Content analysis of one continuous week of a national newspaper was undertaken, and the results show that coverage of science and technology was modest and predominantly news driven. For news stories set locally, there was a pronounced emphasis on the use of institutional actors in the text as well as quotations. Articles on health/medicine and earth science elicited the most coverage in the press. Some suggestions for using newspaper science to introduce inquiry in the science classroom are discussed.","publish_time":"2014-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Subramaniam, R.","journal":"Inquiry into the Singapore Science Classroom","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ccc544c902051047e0852af45155bef108b8d1f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121142.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121142/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs0MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["newspaper science","coverage of science","earth science","science classroom","public understanding of science","role of science journalism","informal science learning","public education","national newspaper","news stories","continuous week","Singapore","use of institutional actors","text","aspect","health","medicine","technology","institutions","inquiry","pronounced emphasis","key platforms","contribution","newspapers","societies","Content analysis","Articles","chapter","results","literature"],"language":"en"},

The Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware was founded in 1963 by, and is still inhabited by sociologists, but has embraced an interdisciplinary approach over time, including core and affiliated faculty from English, history, political science, civil engineering, and environmental policy). My thoughts in this essay are not confined to the DRC\u2019s corpus of work, but \u2018disaster studies\u2019 more broadly defined below. This said, the roots of disaster studies in sociology are deep, the classic Ur-source being an unpublished PhD study of the 1917 explosion in Halifax, Nova Scotia. This disaster continues to be a source of continuing research that provide lessons for our time. My own essay will mention some of these contributions, and they are truly something to celebrate; however, the central theme I will emphasize is what has been missed and could be added to the research agenda over the next decade or so. I employ an optical metaphor that has as much to do with philosophy of science (\u2018vision\u2019 and Mao\u2019s famous question, \u2018Where do ideas come from?\u2019) as it does with optics, optometry and the detailed application of methods at micro and macro scale. The lens is a remarkable human invention. Glass shaped and polished in one way opened up the microscopic world. Treated in another, the lens gave us the telescope. I will argue that politics \u2013 the creation, use and maintenance of power to influence other people and to control space and resources \u2013 has been a largely missing raw material, like glass, from which disaster studies could shape lenses for its own tools of inquiry. Consideration of power has not been totally missing. Yet lenses fashioned from an understanding of power have not been used sufficiently in a number of critical areas of research.","publish_time":"2018-11-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wisner, Ben","journal":"Disaster Research and the Second Environmental Crisis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9f905ef190ea4a525735bc0a44d780f27b261e8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121247.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121247/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs0NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Mao"],"organizations":["Disaster Research Center","DRC"],"locations":["Glass"],"keyphrases":["Disaster Research Center","disaster studies\u2019","roots of disaster studies","research agenda","understanding of power","source of continuing research","time","sociology","Glass","lenses","maintenance of power","Consideration of power","essay","contributions","number of critical areas of research","political science","philosophy of science","classic Ur-source","history","explosion","core","civil engineering","English","detailed application of methods","affiliated faculty","unpublished PhD study","vision","Halifax","optometry","Mao\u2019s famous question","way","people","lessons","macro scale","environmental policy","interdisciplinary approach","University of Delaware","DRC\u2019s corpus of work","Nova Scotia","optics","remarkable human invention","creation","microscopic world","space","resources","ideas","raw material","tools of inquiry","decade","years","central theme","optical metaphor","politics","sociologists","thoughts","telescope","writers"],"language":"en"},

Most natural deaths are unlikely to come to the attention of the forensic pathologist, particularly in cases where death occurs in hospital. During the neonatal period (up to 28 days of age), deaths most commonly occur as a result of prematurity and related conditions, chromosomal abnormalities, or congenital malformations. Beyond the neonatal period, trauma-related deaths and sudden infant death syndrome are more common. In terms of natural acquired diseases of childhood, certain conditions are prevalent based on age and may be encountered at autopsy. Common acquired diseases that cause death in infants and children up to 5 years of age include pneumonia and other respiratory diseases, other infectious diseases, and malignancies. In older children, mortality due to natural disease declines substantially with trauma being the major cause of death, and malignancies the major cause of acquired disease. Sudden and/or unexpected deaths in which a natural disease state was previously unknown are most likely to come under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner or coroner and may be related to an underlying natural disease. Depending on the underlying disease process, the approach can differ, and therefore familiarity with common causes of death during childhood is important in order to focus the autopsy so that special techniques can be used along with obtaining proper ancillary testing to arrive at an accurate diagnosis and cause of death.","publish_time":"2014-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burton, Elizabeth C.; Singer, Nicole A.","journal":"Forensic Pathology of Infancy and Childhood","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5bc62a289ef384131f592ec3a8852545304513a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123209.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123209/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs1MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["natural deaths","major cause of death","underlying natural disease","natural disease declines","natural disease state","trauma-related deaths","common causes of death","Common acquired diseases","terms of natural acquired diseases of childhood","investigation of childhood deaths","unexpected deaths","underlying disease process","related conditions","sudden infant death syndrome","respiratory diseases","infectious diseases","years of age","days of age","malignancies","neonatal period","autopsy","certain conditions","older children","chromosomal abnormalities","mortality","infants","result of prematurity","accurate diagnosis","jurisdiction","cases","approach","pneumonia","familiarity","order","congenital malformations","forensic pathologist","medical examiner","coroner","attention","proper ancillary testing","special techniques","Autopsies","hospital"],"language":"en"},

These structural cellular changes contribute to mucus hypersecretion and destruction of the alveolar walls and a decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)). At the cellular level, macrophages, T lymphocytes, and neutrophils, driven by cytokines including interleukin-8 (IL-8), gather on the airways. The main cause of COPD inflammation is cigarette smoke. Smoke causes an increase in the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) and neutrophilic elastase from epithelial cells and neutrophils, which are responsible for mucin production and destruction of the lung. Initially, cigarette smoke influences the expression of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), the intracellularly located nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), and receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) on lung epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and leukocytes in the lung. These actions bring about the production of cytokines and activation of inflammatory cells, leading to production of MMPs and neutrophilic elastase. The inflammatory changes persist for several months and years after smoking cessation and are sometimes irreversible. Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released from dying cells after cigarette smoking increase the number of apoptotic cells, suppress efferocytosis, induce hypoxia and oxidative stress, and prolong the inflammatory changes, even after smoking cessation. Viral and bacterial infections of the respiratory tract then fortify these inflammatory responses. Exacerbations of COPD then worsen the deterioration of COPD.","publish_time":"2016-07-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kato, Akane; Hanaoka, Masayuki","journal":"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/726c590e961ae5c85027c666146c590e4913e2bb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123312.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123312/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs1Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung epithelial cells","activation of inflammatory cells","endothelial cells","inflammatory changes","cigarette smoking","cigarette smoke","number of apoptotic cells","production of MMPs","production of cytokines","deterioration of COPD","Exacerbations of COPD","smoking cessation","inflammatory responses","structural cellular changes","neutrophils","expression of pattern recognition receptors","main cause of COPD inflammation","neutrophilic elastase","destruction","mucin production","increase","structural features of airways","cellular level","airway wall inflammation","muscle hypertrophy","fibrosis","patients","RAGE","mucus hypersecretion","NOD","efferocytosis","advanced glycation end products","PRRs","respiratory tract","secretion of matrix metalloproteinase","alveolar walls","retinoic acid-inducible gene","macrophages","T lymphocytes","NLRs","Toll","months","nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain","oxidative stress","goblet cell metaplasia","decline","bacterial infections","RIG","DAMPs","hypoxia","years","leukocytes","expiratory volume","Damage","molecular patterns","interleukin","TLRs","RLRs","FEV","actions"],"language":"en"},

Ask your workforce or students, \u201CAre we ready to handle such an event if it were to occur here?\u201D; \u201CWhat resources would we need to have accessible?\u201D; \u201CHave we partnered with the correct agencies in the community?\u201D; \u201CDo we have an established, trusted presence in the community?\u201D; \u201CWho else do we need on our team?\u201D; \u201CDo we need training in a specialty area, e.g., emergency preparedness?\u201D; \u201CWhat skills have we mastered and what skills do we need to obtain?\u201D The discussion-based questions are endless but one runs the risk of not being prepared, either individually, or in their agency, should they not discuss how public health events are occurring around us daily. I encourage you to adapt these selected cases to use in your organization and/or classroom. Discussing these issues and reviewing the lessons learned will only help us to be better prepared public health practitioners and educators of public health students.","publish_time":"2014-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Caron, Rosemary M.","journal":"Preparing the Public Health Workforce","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/edead548fccabfaf28fe69d6495b8693a6279697.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123391.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123391/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs2Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["public health organization","public health events","educators of public health students","skills necessary","reader","issues","better prepared public health practitioners","community","selected cases","general overview","lessons","succinct overview","supervisory group meeting","discussion-based questions","director","specialty area","staff","educator perspective","emergency preparedness","international levels","entry-level position","trusted presence","additional resource materials","master","internship","training","time","correct agencies","concise format","references","resources","minutes","risk","workforce","classroom","news","team","agency"],"language":"en"},

In this chapter, we present a near real-time sentiment analysis service of public health-related tweets. Traditionally, it is impossible for humans to effectively measure the degree of public health concerns due to limited resources and significant time delays. To solve this problem, we have developed a computational intelligence approach for Epidemic Sentiment Monitoring System (ESMOS) to automatically analyze the disease sentiments and gauge the Measure of Concern (MOC) expressed by Twitter users. More specifically, we present a knowledge-based approach that employs a disease ontology to detect the outbreak of diseases and to analyze the linguistic expressions that convey subjective expressions and sentiment polarity of emotions, feelings, opinions, personal attitudes, etc. with a sentiment classifier. The two-step sentiment classification method utilizes the subjective vocabulary corpus (MPQA), sentiment strength corpus (AFINN), as well as emoticons and profanity words that are often used in social media postings. It first automatically classifies the tweets into personal and non-personal classes, eliminating many tweets such as non-personal \u201Cretweets\u201D of news articles from further consideration. In the second stage, the personal tweets are classified into Negative and non-Negative sentiments. In addition, we present a model to quantify the public\u2019s Measure of Concern (MOC) about a disease, based on sentiment classification results. The trends of the public MOC are visualized on a timeline. Correlation analyses between MOC timeline and disease-related sentiment category timelines show that the peaks of the MOC are weakly correlated with the peaks of the News timeline without any appreciable time delay or lead. Our sentiment analysis method and the MOC trend analyses can be generalized to other topical domains, such as mental health monitoring and crisis management. We present the ESMOS prototype for public health-related disease monitoring, for public concern trending and for mapping analyses.","publish_time":"2016-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ji, Xiang; Chun, Soon Ae; Geller, James","journal":"Sentiment Analysis and Ontology Engineering","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58b2e6e847b41cffc01a8e1329703c9d5fc163ce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123466.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123466/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs2NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Epidemic Sentiment Monitoring System","MOC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["public MOC","sentiment classifier","public health-related disease monitoring","personal tweets","MOC timeline","sentiment analysis method","disease-related sentiment category timelines","sentiment strength corpus","sentiment classification results","disease sentiments","Epidemic Sentiment Monitoring System","sentiment polarity of emotions","disease ontology","two-step sentiment classification method","near real-time sentiment analysis service of public health-related tweets","public concern trending","MOC trend analyses","degree of public health concerns","mental health monitoring","unnecessary public concerns","personal attitudes","non-personal classes","News timeline","public\u2019s Measure of Concern","non-Negative sentiments","subjective expressions","mapping analyses","Correlation analyses","peaks","subjective vocabulary corpus","knowledge-based approach","linguistic expressions","news articles","ESMOS prototype","outbreak of diseases","computational intelligence approach","appreciable time delay","significant time delays","spread of contagious diseases","limited resources","feelings","MPQA","opinions","retweets","AFINN","topical domains","crisis management","tracking","tremendous value","emoticons","lead","model","profanity words","Twitter users","social media postings","humans","chapter","consideration","stage","trends","addition","problem"],"language":"en"},

Different types of SARS-CoV vaccines, including nonreplicative and vectored vaccines, have been developed. Administration of these vaccines to animal model systems has shown promise for the generation of efficacious and safe vaccines. Nevertheless, the identification of side effects, preferentially in the elderly animal models, indicates the need to develop novel vaccines that should be tested in improved animal model systems. Live attenuated viruses have generally proven to be the most effective vaccines against viral infections. A limited number of SARS-CoV attenuating modifications have been described, including mutations, and partial or complete gene deletions affecting the replicase, like the nonstructural proteins (nsp1 or nsp2), or the structural genes, and drastic changes in the sequences that regulate the expression of viral subgenomic mRNAs. A promising vaccine candidate developed in our laboratory was based on deletion of the envelope E gene alone, or in combination with the removal of six additional genes nonessential for virus replication. Viruses lacking E protein were attenuated, grew in the lung, and provided homologous and heterologous protection. Improvements of this vaccine candidate have been directed toward increasing virus titers using the power of viruses with mutator phenotypes, while maintaining the attenuated phenotype. The safety of the live SARS-CoV vaccines is being increased by the insertion of complementary modifications in genes nsp1, nsp2, and 3a, by gene scrambling to prevent the rescue of a virulent phenotype by recombination or remodeling of vaccine genomes based on codon deoptimization using synthetic biology. The newly generated vaccine candidates are very promising, but need to be evaluated in animal model systems that include young and aged animals.","publish_time":"2010-07-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Enjuanes, Luis; Nieto-Torres, Jose L.; Jimenez-Guarde\u00F1o, Jose M.; DeDiego, Marta L.","journal":"Replicating Vaccines","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ac431a9a48289831c825c2b30f48bdf7f548995.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123558.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123558/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs3Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["live SARS-CoV vaccines","vectored vaccines","safe vaccines","effective vaccines","novel vaccines","improved animal model systems","promising vaccine candidate","Live attenuated viruses","genes nsp1","attenuated phenotype","remodeling of vaccine genomes","structural genes","nsp2","Different types of SARS","limited number of SARS","power of viruses","elderly animal models","generated vaccine candidates","envelope E gene","need","acute respiratory disease","additional genes nonessential","complete gene deletions","severe acute respiratory syndrome","virus replication","virulent phenotype","viral infections","E protein","insertion of complementary modifications","increasing virus titers","expression of viral subgenomic mRNAs","atypical pneumonia","diarrhea","recombination","codon deoptimization","replicase","promise","coronavirus","nonreplicative","etiological agent","generation of efficacious","mutator phenotypes","high mortality","sequences","drastic changes","removal","nonstructural proteins","rescue","mutations","laboratory","synthetic biology","aged animals","effects","safety","Administration","heterologous protection","lung","Improvements","identification"],"language":"en"},

In this chapter, we present a summary of different mathematical and computational approaches aimed at describing, modeling, and forecasting the diffusion of viruses. We start from the basic concepts and models in an unstructured population and gradually increase the realism by adding the effects of realistic contact structures within a population as well as the effects of human mobility coupling different subpopulations. Building on these concepts we present two realistic data-driven epidemiological models able to forecast the spreading of infectious diseases at different geographical granularities.

The prevalence of POTS has been estimated as 500,000\u20133,000,000 patients in the USA. Because it affects mainly women between 13 and 50 years of age, the impact on productivity at work and lifestyle can be devastating. Considerable clinical overlap exists between POTS and vasovagal syncope (VVS) with patients experiencing similar orthostatic symptoms related to insufficient adaptation to blood volume shifts during upright posture. Nevertheless, differences emerge during head up tilt table testing. In patients with POTS, during upright tilt, sympathetic tone increases, there is an early and sustained tachycardia, and patients complain of presyncope without frank syncope. In contrast, patients with VVS experience delayed symptoms and abrupt drops in BP and HR and are more likely to lose consciousness.

Different gene therapy strategies are being pursued, including long-term gene correction of monogenetic diseases, eradication of tumor cells in cancer patients, or genetic vaccination for infectious diseases. Bispecific antibodies and gene therapy are connected in two ways. First, bispecific antibodies are tools of interest for the development of targeted gene transfer vectors. Different gene therapy strategies require different vectors, frequently replication-ablated viruses. Similar to the role of antibody engineering in antibody therapy, the engineering of gene transfer vectors has become key to the implementation of genetic therapies. Cytoablative cancer gene therapy and efficient genetic vaccination, for example, depend on vectors that are targeted to cancer cells and antigen-presenting cells, respectively, in order to avoid side effects and vector sequestration. To this end, bispecific antibodies have been engineered as adapters that link the vector to a specific molecule on the targeted cell and at the same time block the interaction with the native virus receptor. Different formats of bispecific antibodies and related molecules have been developed and succeeded in re-directing vectors to target cells in vitro and in vivo. These adapters also improved gene therapies in animal models. Second, gene transfer is a promising tool for delivery of bispecific antibodies to patients. Therefore, vectors can be injected directly into patients for antibody gene transfer, or cells isolated from patients can be genetically modified in vitro and then re-injected for in vivo antibody production. Genetic antibody delivery, compared with standard antibody injection, can be advantageous with respect to achieving persistent antibody titers or effective antibody biodistribution in patients. Initial studies have shown antibody production and therapeutic activity in animal models, setting the stage for more widespread investigations. Moreover, gene therapy can enable novel therapeutic applications for bispecific antibodies by facilitating the delivery of membrane associated or intracellular antibody formats.","publish_time":"2011-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nettelbeck, Dirk M.","journal":"Bispecific Antibodies","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dfc739ec907d914c19fe56cedfae687164fdb402.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123931.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123931/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs5NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antibody gene transfer","antibody therapy","gene therapies","engineering of gene transfer vectors","Different gene therapy strategies","antibody production","Cytoablative cancer gene therapy","development of targeted gene transfer vectors","Genetic antibody delivery","different vectors","delivery of bispecific antibodies","cancer patients","Different formats of bispecific antibodies","role of antibody engineering","intracellular antibody formats","persistent antibody titers","effective antibody biodistribution","standard antibody injection","cancer cells","transfer of therapeutic genes","long-term gene correction of monogenetic diseases","therapeutic activity","therapeutic purposes","efficient genetic vaccination","eradication of tumor cells","implementation of genetic therapies","novel therapeutic applications","delivery of membrane","animal models","targeted cell","adapters","infectious diseases","vector sequestration","promising tool","respect","related molecules","interaction","time","stage","specific molecule","replication-ablated viruses","example","native virus receptor","Initial studies","effects","order","tools","antigen","widespread investigations","end","ways"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, the impact of respiratory disease in cows varies with the stage of lactation when the disease is detected. In general, intense management practices facilitate the detection of respiratory disorders in dairy cattle herds relative to beef cattle herds. Thus, we propose that study of respiratory disease incidence in a large dairy cattle data set as paradigm to advance the knowledge on the factors influencing the incidence of this disease across cattle types. Respiratory disease information on 6,283 Holstein cows across four U.S. states and nine herds were evaluated. Two descriptors of respiratory disease were evaluated: days in milk to respiratory disease detection and the binary detection of respiratory disease. Survival analysis was used to study the days in milk-to-disease. The binary variable respiratory disease detection was analyzed using a binary logistic model. Lactation number, season, region, farm, body condition score, and milk yield level (3 levels) were included in the model as fixed explanatory effects whereas sire was considered a random effect. Incidence of respiratory disease was lower in summer relative to winter, and there was a nonsignificant trend on lactation number. Body condition score had a significant effect, with higher body condition score associated with lower incidence of respiratory disease. Farm, body condition score, and milk yield level had significant effect on the time when respiratory disease was identified. The heritability estimate for incidence of respiratory disease was 0.4, suggesting that despite the high number of potential causative agents, selection for less susceptible cattle can be an effective strategy to reduce the impact of this disease. The heritability estimate of the days in milk-to-disease was 0.13, showing that non-genetic components may play an important role on the stage of the lactation when the disease is detected. These findings contribute to an animal health project (USDA-NIFA-ILLU-538909) and a multistate project database (USDA-NIFA-AFRI-003542) for direct measures of health and fertility in cattle.","publish_time":"2017-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goncalves, T.

Here, we discuss the structural and functional aspects of the filovirus matrix protein VP40 and compare them to other known matrix protein structures from vesicular stomatitis virus, influenza virus and retroviral matrix proteins.","publish_time":"2004-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Timmins, Joanna; Ruigrok, Rob W.H.; Weissenhorn, Winfried","journal":"FEMS Microbiol Lett","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/362495d0293ba856688418574140d5334f1034e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110346.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110346/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs1NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["retroviral matrix proteins","matrix proteins of different virus families","known matrix protein structures","filovirus matrix protein VP40","influenza virus","vesicular stomatitis virus","viral particle","cellular vacuolar protein sorting machinery","functional aspects","cellular membranes","functional analogy","viral components","structural homology","individual particle shapes","membrane complex","driving force of assembly","integrity","link","variety of late domain motifs","enveloped viruses","sequence","main function","diversity"],"language":"en"},

The introduction of nanomaterials, such as magnetic nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, graphene, quantum dots, etc. is bringing advantages in terms of improving the selectivity and sensitivity of these systems. These nanomaterials also offer advantages in biosensors owing to their nanometric size, shape, composition, physical properties, ability to manipulate their surface chemistry and the property that they have in terms of adsorbing biological molecules and the change of their physical properties. In recent years, several \u00ADbacterial pathogens, toxins, viruses, parasites and explosives have been considered as potential threats for bioterrorism, among which can find Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Bacillus anthracis, Clostridium botulinum, Botulinum Neurotoxin, Vaccinia, Plasmodium falciparum, Trinitrotoluene, etc. Bioterrorism is extremely complex to tackle but the science and technology are fundamental \u00ADelements to reduce its threat. For this reason, monitoring systems for quick identification of biomolecules are the core of much of the basic research activities in combating bioterrorism. In this chapter we discuss the research efforts by using nanobiotechnologies with the aim of developing accurate, easy, cheap, portable and ultrasensitive assays for agents that pose a biologic threat.

Moreover, in recent years, new infectious agents and diseases are being identified, and some diseases that were previously considered under control have reemerged. Furthermore, antimicrobial resistance has grown rapidly in a variety of hospital as well as community acquired infections. Thus, humanity still faces big challenges in the prevention and control of infectious diseases. Vaccination, generally considered to be the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases, works by presenting a foreign antigen to the immune system to evoke an immune response. The administered antigen can either be a live, but weakened, form of a pathogen (bacteria or virus), a killed or inactivated form of the pathogen, or a purified material such as a protein. However, no vaccine is completely safe; therefore, vaccine safety research and monitoring are necessary to minimize vaccine related harms. From the formulation point of view, the goal continues to be to improve the quality and global availability of vaccine delivery systems. This chapter provides an introduction to vaccine formulation, describes the delivery routes that are utilized, and discusses the factors that affect the safety and stability of a vaccine formulation.","publish_time":"2011-07-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u015Eenel, Sevda","journal":"Fundamentals and Applications of Controlled Release Drug Delivery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c12bb1742ad9b4e9397e661110e30675ef48b8dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119968.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119968/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs4NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccine formulation","control of infectious diseases","vaccine safety research","vaccine related harms","global availability of vaccine delivery systems","pathogen","new infectious agents","formulation point of view","immune system","immune response","delivery routes","inactivated form","foreign antigen","administered antigen","monitoring","prevention","recent years","major causes of illness","disability","big challenges","virus","bacteria","quality","stability","variety of hospital","community","purified material","goal","chapter","introduction","effective method","infections","protein","death","humanity","factors","antimicrobial resistance","Vaccination"],"language":"en"},

Frameshifting occurs in response to specific signals in the mRNA; a slippery sequence, where the ribosome changes frame, and a stimulatory RNA secondary structure, usually a pseudoknot, located immediately downstream. During the frameshift the ribosome slips backwards by a single nucleotide (in the 5\u2032-wards/\u20141 direction) and continues translation in the new, overlapping reading frame, generating a fusion protein composed of the products of both the original and the \u20141 frame coding regions. In eukaryotes, frameshifting is largely a phenomenon of virus gene expression and associated predominantly with the expression of viral replicases. Research on frameshifting impacts upon diverse topics, including the ribosomal elongation cycle, RNA structure and function, tRNA modification, virus replication, antiviral intervention, evolution and bioinformatics. This chapter focuses on the structure and function of frameshift-stimulatory RNA pseudoknots and mechanistic aspects of ribosomal frameshifting. A variety of models of the frameshifting process are discussed in the light of recent advances in our understanding of ribosome structure and the elongation cycle.","publish_time":"2009-07-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brierley, Ian; Gilbert, Robert J.C.; Pennell, Simon","journal":"Recoding: Expansion of Decoding Rules Enriches Gene Expression","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a094d28ffd685164050dbad0e1426abc73a4e18.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119991.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119991/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs4NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA structure","frameshifting process","frameshifting impacts","mechanistic aspects of ribosomal frameshifting","understanding of ribosome structure","ribosomal elongation cycle","stimulatory RNA secondary structure","ribosome changes frame","stimulatory RNA pseudoknots","function of frameshift","reading frame","elongation phase of protein biosynthesis","frame coding regions","virus replication","phenomenon of virus gene expression","fusion protein","expression of viral replicases","tRNA modification","antiviral intervention","diverse topics","place","translational recoding strategy","mRNA","evolution","slippery sequence","light of recent advances","specific signals","response","Research","bioinformatics","products","variety of models","direction","single nucleotide","eukaryotes","chapter","wards"],"language":"en"},

Gladiatoren werden aangemoedigd om in de arena het bloed van de verslagenen te drinken om een deel van hun moed en kracht te verkrijgen. Anderzijds heerste in die tijd ook de gedachte dat een slechte gezondheid, geestelijke ziekten en depressies een gevolg waren van verdorven lichaamssappen of vergiftigd bloed en dat aderlaten om die reden een geneeskracht had voor vele kwalen. Ovidius vertelde in zijn Metamorphosen (43 v.Chr.) het verhaal van de tovenares Medea, die het verdriet van haar geliefde Jason over zijn steeds zwakker wordende oude vader nauwelijks kon verdragen. In een poging de vader weer kracht te geven en te verjongen, sneed ze de keel van de oude man door, liet al het bloed eruit lopen en verving het door een eigen toversap. En ziedaar, het wonder geschiedde: zijn witte haren en baard werden zwart, zijn rimpels verdwenen en hij verrees krachtig van lijf en leden. Ook toen bloedtransfusies tot de mogelijkheden gingen behoren, werden ze gek genoeg niet gebruikt om een voor de hand liggende reden als bloedverlies, maar voor de bestrijding van allerlei geestelijke of emotionele kwalen.","publish_time":"2013-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Wolf, J.Th.M.; Roeloffzen, W.W.H.","journal":"Hematologie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/febc14afdccf7d429b4a0647899979cd54a1f4ef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120193.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120193/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs5NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ovidius","Medea","Jason"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["de bestrijding","de gedachte","de arena","de keel","de mogelijkheden","de veronderstelling","de oude man","poging de vader","de hand liggende reden","vergiftigd bloed","bloed van de verslagenen","bloed sterker","geestelijke vermogens","fysieke kracht","moed en kracht","geestelijke ziekten en depressies","zwakker wordende oude vader","emotionele kwalen","vele kwalen","slechte gezondheid","gevolg","bloedverlies","verdorven lichaamssappen","geliefde Jason","verdriet","mensen","witte haren en baard","verhaal van de tovenares Medea","geneeskracht","tijd","Metamorphosen","lijf en leden","middelpunt van de geest","rimpels","wonder","bloedtransfusies","Gladiatoren","wezen van het leven","eigen toversap","Ovidius"],"language":"nl"},

However, these plants are not suitable for administration without cooking. To overcome this obstacle, a fusion gene encoding the synthetic enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit genetically fused with a synthetic neutralizing epitope of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (sLTB-sCOE) was introduced into lettuce cells (Lactuca sativa) by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation methods. The integration and expression of the sLTB-sCOE fusion gene was confirmed in transgenic lettuce by genomic DNA PCR amplification and Northern blot analysis, respectively. Synthesis and assembly of the LTB-COE fusion protein into oligomeric structures with pentamer size were observed in transgenic plant extracts by Western blot analysis with anti-LTB or anti-COE antibodies. The binding of plantproduced LTB-COE to intestinal epithelial cell membrane glycolipid receptors was confirmed by G(M1)-ganglioside enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (G(M1)-ELISA). Based on the ELISA results, LTB-COE fusion protein made up about 0.026\u223C0.048% of the total soluble protein in the transgenic lettuce leaf tissues. The synthesis and assembly of LTB-COE monomers into biologically active oligomers in transgenic lettuce leaf tissues demonstrates the feasibility of using uncooked edible plant-based vaccines for mucosal immunization.","publish_time":"2010-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huy, Nguyen-Xuan; Kim, Young-Sook; Jun, Sang-Chel; Jin, Zhewu; Park, Seung-Moon; Yang, Moon-Sik; Kim, Tae-Geum","journal":"Biotechnol Bioprocess Eng","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64b1b53f314aadef44863cd2920cff50c39ced6e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091058/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LTB-COE fusion protein","anti-LTB","transgenic plants","assembly of LTB","transgenic lettuce leaf tissues","transgenic plant extracts","COE monomers","binding of plantproduced LTB-COE","anti-COE antibodies","lettuce cells","sLTB-sCOE fusion gene","M1","uncooked edible plant-based vaccines","Synthesis","Western blot analysis","Northern blot analysis","total soluble protein","ELISA results","synthetic neutralizing epitope of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","synthetic enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit","genomic DNA PCR amplification","intestinal epithelial cell membrane glycolipid receptors","active oligomers","pentamer size","feasibility","ganglioside enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","oligomeric structures","Lactuca sativa","potatoes","Agrobacterium-mediated transformation methods","mucosal immunization","corn","tobacco","expression","administration","cooking","rice","integration","obstacle"],"language":"en"},

Studies have suggested that chronic pain pathogenesis involves neuroimmune interactions and blood\u2013spinal cord barrier (BSCB) disruption. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We modeled neuropathic pain in rats by inducing chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve and analyzed the effects on C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10)/CXCR3 activation, BSCB permeability, and immune cell migration from the circulation into the spinal cord. We detected CXCR3 expression in spinal neurons and observed that CCI induced CXCL10/CXCR3 activation, BSCB disruption, and mechanical hyperalgesia. CCI-induced BSCB disruption enabled circulating T cells to migrate into the spinal parenchyma. Intrathecal administration of an anti-CXCL10 antibody not only attenuated CCI-induced hyperalgesia, but also reduced BSCB permeability, suggesting that CXCL10 acts as a key regulator of BSCB integrity. Moreover, T cell migration may play a critical role in the neuroimmune interactions involved in the pathogenesis of CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Our results highlight CXCL10 as a new potential drug target for the treatment of nerve injury\u2013induced neuropathic pain.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Hao-Ling; Huang, Yan; Zhou, Ya-Lan; Teng, Run-Hua; Zhou, Shu-Zhuan; Lin, Jia-Piao; Yang, Yan; Zhu, Sheng-Mei; Xu, Hua; Yao, Yong-Xing","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/120138f6ef07fac0c75d777ffb9946480f613065.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7098954.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098954/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjsyNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CCI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CCI induced CXCL10","Neuropathic pain","CCI-induced BSCB disruption","BSCB permeability","chronic pain pathogenesis","pathogenesis of CCI","attenuated CCI-induced hyperalgesia","CXCL10 acts","debilitating forms of chronic pain","CXCR3 activation","spinal neurons","spinal parenchyma","anti-CXCL10 antibody","spinal cord barrier","key regulator of BSCB integrity","neuroimmune interactions","chronic constriction injury","T cell migration","CXCR3 expression","treatment of nerve injury","immune cell migration","C-X","sciatic nerve","mechanical hyperalgesia","C motif chemokine","circulating T cells","blood","new potential drug target","critical role","effects","circulation","rats","Intrathecal administration","results","Studies","underlying mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we describe the epidemiology of influenza-like illness in non-elderly adults within the U.S. Military Health System (MHS) by pathogen and hospitalization status. METHODS: The Acute Respiratory Infection Consortium (ARIC) is a prospective cohort of patients with influenza-like illness within the MHS. Participants between 18 and 65 years of age were identified in outpatient settings between 2012 and 2017, and were excluded if pregnant, if reporting chronic cardiac, respiratory, renal, or neurologic disease, or if on long-term aspirin therapy. Demographics, nasopharyngeal swabs and symptom data were collected; swabs were tested for viral pathogens using a target-enriched multiplex PCR panel (TEM-PCR(TM), Diatherix LLC). Data were analyzed to compare clinical features and risks for hospitalization. RESULTS: 397 participants met inclusion criteria. 34 participants required hospitalization; 363 were outpatients. Median length of hospitalization was 2 days. A virus was identified in 58.4% of outpatients (OP) and 55.9% of inpatients (IP); coronaviruses (63/363), enteroviruses (50/363), and influenza A (73/363) predominated in OP, whereas influenza A predominated among IP (35.3%, 12/34). There were no significant differences between OP and IP in terms of age, gender, ethnicity, or tobacco use. IP were more likely to be obese (BMI \u226530, 43.3% vs. 20.5%, P = 0.004) and less likely to have received influenza vaccination (45.5% vs. 16.9%, P \u003E 0.001). IP with influenza did not report more severe symptoms (chills, cough, sore throat, diarrhea, myalgia, or headache) on enrollment but were more likely to have fever (temperature \u226538.0\u2070 C) than OP (92.9 vs. 57.1%, P = 0.014). CONCLUSION: Influenza A is the most frequently identified cause of hospitalization among healthy, non-elderly adults with viral respiratory infection. Although age and tobacco use may be risks for viral acquisition, they do not appear to increase the risk of hospitalization in infected patients. Non-obese BMI and influenza vaccination appear protective against hospitalization, even in a relatively healthy cohort. DISCLOSURES: L. Malone, Diatherix Laboratories: Employee, Salary; E.

Data in the literature specific to MM patients is limited. We reviewed four years of multiplex respiratory viral panel (RVP) data in MM patients at our institution to evaluate incidence and seasonality of RVIs. methods. The results from all positive RVPs, obtained via nasopharyngeal swab and as identified by polymerase chain reaction during the years 2013 to 2016, were analyzed. A positive result less than 6 weeks apart was considered a duplicate and removed. All specimens were analyzed in the molecular diagnostics laboratory using the eSensor\u00AE Respiratory Viral Panel (GenMark Dx, Carlsbad, CA). This assay is a qualitative nucleic acid multiplex in vitro diagnostic test that provides for the simultaneous detection and identification of 14 respiratory viral nucleic acids. Results. RVIs were reported in every month in all four years. The peak months were January and February, driven by the peak activity of Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Rhinovirus was isolated the most frequently. The least isolated was Adenovirus. A seasonality was observed with Influenza, RSV, human parainfluenza and human metapneumovirus; however, infections with each virus occurred outside of peak months including an outbreak of Influenza in July and August 2013. The total number of viral infections varied each year as did the total number for each virus. The year 2015 had the lowest number of RVIs reported at 427, followed by the year 2016 with the most RVIs reported at 515. However, 2016 was not the peak incidence for each virus; it was the peak incidence for RSV and Rhinovirus. In fact, Influenza had its lowest number of cases in 2016. Conclusion. At our institution, we have shown that RVIs are more common than previously described in MM patients. RVIs occur in every month throughout the year. Although a seasonality is seen with these viral infections, infections do occur outside of the months considered to be peak months for each virus. Infection control policies, therefore, must be enforced year round. More studies, however, are needed to assess the proportion of community vs. healthcare acquired.

However, specific treatment for HPeV3 infection is currently unavailable. The application of antisense technology, such as peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), to viral infection has opened a new era of therapeutics. The aim of this study is to develop PNAs inhibiting HPeV3 gene expression in an in vitro model. METHODS: We designed four PNAs that target domains I, J (base and head of domain J structure), and K of an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) region within the 5\u2019 untranslated region of HPeV3. The IRES region is needed for the cap-independent translation. The PNAs were conjugated to cell-penetrating peptide (RXR)(4)XB (R = L-arginine, X = 6-aminohexanoic acid, B = \u03B2-alanine). LLC-MK2 cells were treated with 0.1\u201310\u00B5M of each PNA or water-containing growth medium for 4h. The cells were then infected with HPeV3 at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 for 1h. The infected cells were incubated for 7 days at 37\u00BAC in 5% CO(2). Extracellular levels of HPeV3 RNA were measured by real-time PCR on days 0 and 7. RESULTS: Without any treatment, an extracellular level of HPeV3 RNA increased to 8.2 \u00D7 10(6) copies/\u00B5L on day 7. When the cells were treated with 10\u00B5M of PNA targeting the domain I of IRES, an extracellular level of HPeV3 RNA was suppressed to 4.7 \u00D7 10(4) copies/\u00B5L (\u221299%) on day 7. Using the same PNA with lower concentrations, 1 \u00B5M and 0.1 \u00B5M of the PNA suppressed 24% and 0% of extracellular levels of HPeV3 RNA, respectively, which demonstrated the effect is dose-dependent. In contrast, 10\u00B5M of PNAs targeting domain J (base), J (head), and K suppressed 94%, 92%, and 20% of extracellular levels of HPeV3 RNA, respectively, compared with control. CONCLUSION: The PNA-(RXR)(4)XB targeting the domain I of IRES suppressed extracellular levels of HPeV3 RNA in an in vitro model in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, PNA treatment may be a therapeutic candidate for HPeV3-infected patients. This novel therapy could target other HPeV genotypes given that the target sequence used in this study is identical to those of other clinically significant HPeVs.

We evaluated outcomes associated with the use of OR compared with AR in HCT recipients. METHODS: Retrospective review of all HCT recipients with RSV infection treated with OR or AR during three RSV seasons (September 2014 \u2013 February 2017). An established immunodeficiency Scoring Index (ISI) was applied to identify patients at high risk for progression and death based on host risk factors. Mortality, progression to lower respiratory infection (LRI), and need for ICU admission was compared among recipients of AR and OR. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients were treated with OR (n = 42, 39%) or AR (n = 65, 61%). Recipients of AR and OR were equally likely to be high-risk by ISI scoring (11% vs. 10%, P = 1.00). Fifty-three patients (50%) presented with upper respiratory infection (URI) of whom 13 (25%) progressed to LRI. There was no difference in the rate of progression to LRI between patients who received AR and OR (28% vs. 19%, P = 0.53). No difference was found in 30-day mortality rates based on treatment strategy (8% AR vs. 5% OR, P = 0.70). Interestingly, 90-day mortality was found to be significantly lower among patients who received OR vs. AR (20% vs. 5%, P = 0.04). No differences in rates of ICU admission and requirement for mechanical ventilation were found between the two groups. For the 99 inpatients at time of diagnosis, median (interquartile range) length of stay was 7 (5 \u2013 19) days, and was similar for patients on either treatment modality. Eight patients were treated for RSV on an outpatient basis and all received OR. CONCLUSION: HCT patients with RSV had similar outcomes when treated with AR and OR. OR may be a safe and effective alternative to AR for prevention and treatment of RSV in HCT patients with significantly reduced cost. DISCLOSURES: R.

In most programmes the screening and evaluation start using inhibition of virus multiplication in cell cultures, but in some instances the screening starts in animal models of different viral diseases. In these cases, the mechanism of action has to be analyzed after the in vivo effect has been found. It is not possible to specify precisely the time and resources required in a newly started project to find a compound active against a virus infection but 5-10 years is a reasonable estimation. For some viruses such as herpesviruses, where a number of active inhibitors are already known, the task is simpler than it is to find inhibitors of a virus such as influenza against which only a few active inhibitors have been reported. Evaluation of clinical efficacy in humans is a large and difficult part of the development of an antiviral drug. The number of uncontrolled clinical studies claiming efficacy of different drugs against viral diseases is depressingly large. It is essential to perform double-blind, placebo-controlled and statistically well evaluated studies to be able to judge the clinical efficacy of an antiviral drug. As the knowledge of the detailed natural history and molecular biology of viral diseases and viruses themselves increases, one will obviously have better opportunities to find new drugs. Methods such as X-ray diffraction measurement and NMR determinations will probably lead to a detailed understanding of the structures and interactions taking place at the active site of viral enzymes and their cellular counterparts.","publish_time":"2008-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Perspect Med Virol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133937/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NMR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of active inhibitors","antiviral drug","efficacy of different drugs","Evaluation of clinical efficacy","active site of viral enzymes","compound active","molecular biology of viral diseases","animal models of different viral diseases","number of uncontrolled clinical studies","screening","virus infection","new drugs","development","inhibition of virus multiplication","evaluation start","detailed understanding","evaluated studies","detailed natural history","interactions","X-ray diffraction measurement","instances","cell cultures","humans","NMR determinations","structures","years","started project","influenza","cellular counterparts","placebo","resources","Methods","knowledge","better opportunities","programmes","herpesviruses","cases","mechanism of action","time","reasonable estimation","task","long process","effect"],"language":"en"},

Such an understanding of digital entrepreneurship is perceived as a key pillar for economic growth, job creation and innovation. However, a number of issues regarding digital entrepreneurship and digital transformation are prevalent, inhibiting digital entrepreneurs to optimise the advantages that digital entrepreneurship contributes towards business value. Therefore, the aim of this research paper is to investigate digital entrepreneurship and digital transformation, their characteristics and inter-relationships. Data extracted and analysed through a structured analysis process, recognises and discusses the characteristics of digital entrepreneurship and digital transformation. The characteristics are reported by employing the Dynamic Capabilities Theory as the structure. By understanding the characteristics of digital entrepreneurship and digital transformation, individuals and organisations may either create new business ventures or transform existing businesses through the development of novel digital technologies or the innovative application of such technologies.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Antonizzi, Joshua; Smuts, Hanlie","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a12b1713e32ecdb8663370669817d6bdfadbe804.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134220.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134220/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsxNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["digital transformation","characteristics of digital entrepreneurship","digital age","understanding of digital entrepreneurship","development of novel digital technologies","business value","new business ventures","existing businesses","economic growth","key pillar","organisations","individuals","job creation","innovative application","advantages","innovation","research paper","number of issues","Dynamic Capabilities Theory","inter-relationships","structured analysis process","aim","Data"],"language":"en"},

While there are many studies involving fake news and tools on how to detect it, there is a limited amount of work that focuses on the use of information literacy to assist people to critically access online information and news. Critical thinking, as a form of information literacy, provides a means to critically engage with online content, for example by looking for evidence to support claims and by evaluating the plausibility of arguments. The purpose of this study is to investigate the current state of knowledge on the use of critical thinking to identify fake news. A systematic literature review (SLR) has been performed to identify previous studies on evaluating the credibility of news, and in particular to see what has been done in terms of the use of critical thinking to evaluate online news. During the SLR\u2019s sifting process, 22 relevant studies were identified. Although some of these studies referred to information literacy, only three explicitly dealt with critical thinking as a means to identify fake news. The studies on critical thinking noted critical thinking as an essential skill for identifying fake news. The recommendation of these studies was that information literacy be included in academic institutions, specifically to encourage critical thinking.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Machete, Paul; Turpin, Marita","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6b9d642db4590b03c88ed672715c3dda87bc986.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134234.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134234/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsxNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fake news","use of critical thinking","credibility of news","credibility of online news","online information","use of information literacy","relevant studies","previous studies","form of information literacy","online content","means","essential skill","people","current state of knowledge","academic institutions","systematic literature review","study","example","SLR\u2019s","process","terms","tools","claims","evidence","work","ability","recommendation","plausibility of arguments","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Banking institutions are continuously seeking innovative digital solutions to stay ahead of competitors and be the first preference to consumers. Scholars have also shown some interest in investigating mobile commerce and banking implementation and adoption. However, research studies focusing on the elderly and mobile banking are scant. This paper seeks to understand the current state of knowledge regarding the enablers and barriers of mobile banking and commerce among the elderly by providing a systematic review of the existing literature on the phenomenon. The literature review showed that there is minimal research to date that has been conducted on this topic of interest. Consequently, issues of investigating enablers and barriers of mobile banking among the elderly have been fairly neglected. The main barriers noted in the literature include: security concerns, trust and privacy, a lack of personalization and limited technical knowledge of the elderly. Significant enablers that may be considered are: perceived ease of use of mobile banking applications, perceived value, convenience and consumer attitudes. Future directions for research and practice on mobile banking for the elderly are suggested.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Msweli, Nkosikhona Theoren; Mawela, Tendani","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/90756ebfd5ccfd773e55c29037ee314a9865dbc0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134387.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134387/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsyNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["barriers of mobile banking","mobile banking applications","rollout of mobile banking","Banking institutions","banking implementation","elderly","mobile commerce","traditional banking space","literature review","existing literature","minimal research","main barriers","research studies","Significant enablers","perceived value","systematic review","perceived ease of use","limited technical knowledge","current state of knowledge","convenience","practice","lack of personalization","privacy","trust","innovative digital solutions","consumer attitudes","security concerns","adoption","Future directions","competitors","preference","paper","phenomenon","date","issues","consumers","countries","Scholars","topic"],"language":"en"},

The shortage of influenza vaccine for the 2004\u20132005 season brought with it the potential for an even higher rate of morbidity and mortality due to influenza. The Infection Control and Healthcare Epidemiology Consortium of a 12-hospital healthcare system located in St. Louis, Missouri, determined that a comprehensive multi-tiered influenza management plan was needed. PROJECT: A team of four infection control practitioners (ICPs) was established from three of the system\u0027s hospitals, including a large, metropolitan teaching hospital, a comprehensive pediatric hospital, and a small community hospital, along with three system-level consultants, under the advisement of their medical directors. The team developed a resource packet containing a comprehensive multi-tiered influenza management plan. The packet included a core policy, to be customized by each entity, a checklist of recommended materials to have on hand, and algorithms for influenza testing, patient placement, and healthcare worker immunization. The packet also included an admission screening tool, examples of local health department\u0027 line list reports, and educational posters to be used throughout the healthcare facilities to heighten influenza infection prevention awareness. Many of the tools have specific recommendations for different stages of the influenza season; for example, extensive use of rapid diagnostic tests is appropriate early on, but unnecessary during peak flu season when diagnosis can reliably be made based on symptoms. The packet was developed as a guide to assist ICPs in preparing for an influenza season. RESULTS: A resource packet with a comprehensive multi-tiered influenza management plan was developed for all of the system\u0027s hospitals. The packet contains information addressing the action to be taken prior to and at the early onset of the influenza season, when there is an increased level of influenza activity, and during a pandemic event. LESSONS LEARNED: Annual influenza outbreaks are a serious threat to U.S. patients. To reduce that threat, it is necessary to carefully plan and prepare for each influenza season. A resource packet with a comprehensive multi-tiered influenza management plan is a useful tool in making the necessary plans and preparations.","publish_time":"2005-06-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sykora, C.; Jones, M.; Gemeinhart, N.; Woeltje, K.","journal":"Am J Infect Control","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134771/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjszMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Influenza"],"locations":["U.S.","St. Louis"],"keyphrases":["influenza season","influenza testing","Influenza infections","comprehensive multi-tiered influenza management plan","Annual influenza outbreaks","shortage of influenza vaccine","influenza infection prevention awareness","resource packet","increased level of influenza activity","comprehensive pediatric hospital","hospital healthcare system","peak flu season","healthcare facilities","metropolitan teaching hospital","small community hospital","Healthcare Epidemiology Consortium","healthcare worker immunization","infection control practitioners","team","ICPs","system\u0027s hospitals","system-level consultants","useful tool","early onset","serious threat","necessary plans","admission screening tool","examples of local health department","line list reports","patient placement","extensive use of rapid diagnostic tests","different stages","hand","algorithms","educational posters","specific recommendations","tools","advisement","higher rate of morbidity","diagnosis","mortality","Louis","Missouri","checklist of recommended materials","average","entity","potential","LESSONS","pandemic event","hospitalizations","deaths","medical directors","preparations","patients","information","action","core policy","PROJECT","ISSUE","guide","RESULTS","population","symptoms"],"language":"en"},

Immunoglobulin preparations designed for farm animals are commercially available, and some colostrum-based products are marketed also for humans as dietary supplements. The concentration of specific antibodies against a certain pathogenic microorganism can be raised in colostrum and milk by immunizing cows with this pathogen or its antigen. Advances in bioseparation and chromatographic techniques have made it possible to fractionate and enrich these antibodies and formulate so-called hyperimmune colostral or milk preparations. Their efficacy in prevention and treatment of various microbial infections has been evaluated in numerous studies. Immune milk preparations have proven effective in prophylaxis against infections caused by a variety of gastrointestinal pathogens. Their therapeutic efficacy, however, seems more limited. A few commercial immune milk products are already on market and more applications can be expected in the coming years. This article reviews the recent progress made in isolation techniques of bovine immunoglobulins and the application of colostral and immune milk preparations in fighting various microbial infectious diseases in humans.","publish_time":"2006-08-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mehra, Raj; Marnila, Pertti; Korhonen, Hannu","journal":"Int Dairy J","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7135675.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135675/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs0ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Immune milk preparations","commercial immune milk products","Immunoglobulin preparations","treatment of various microbial infections","application of colostral","humans","biological function of bovine colostral immunoglobulins","adequate passive immune protection","various microbial infectious diseases","isolation techniques of bovine immunoglobulins","so-called hyperimmune colostral","colostrum-based products","chromatographic techniques","therapeutic efficacy","concentration of specific antibodies","newborn calf","certain pathogenic microorganism","prevention","prophylaxis","recent progress","immunizing cows","farm animals","market","Advances","bioseparation","variety of gastrointestinal pathogens","numerous studies","applications","article","antigen","dietary supplements","coming years"],"language":"en"},

Although the recommendation systems can find customer groups that have similar interests as target customers, brand new products often lack ratings and comments. Similarly, products that are less often purchased, such as furniture and home appliances, have fewer records of ratings; therefore, the chances of being recommended are often lower. This research attempts to analyze customers\u0027 purchasing behaviors based on product features from transaction records and product feature databases. Customers\u0027 preferences toward particular features of products are analyzed and then rules of customer interest profiles are thus drawn in order to recommend customers products that have potential attraction with customers. The advantage of this research is its ability of recommending to customers brand new products or rarely purchased products as long as they fit customer interest profiles; a deduction which traditional market basket analysis and collaborative filtering methods are unable to do. This research uses a two-stage clustering technique to find customers that have similar interests as target customers and recommend products to fit customers\u0027 potential requirements. Customers\u0027 interest profiles can explain recommendation results and the interests on particular features of products can be referenced for product development, while a one-to-one marketing strategy can improve profitability for companies.","publish_time":"2003-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weng, Sung-Shun; Liu, Mei-Ju","journal":"Expert Syst Appl","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127642.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7127642/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjsxMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["customers products","seasonal products","customers brand new products","particular features of products","target customers","product features","profiles","similar interests","Customers\u0027 preferences","recommendation systems","collaborative filtering analysis","traditional market basket analysis","customers\u0027 potential requirements","product development","recommendation results","customer groups","research attempts","collaborative filtering methods","product feature databases","fewer records of ratings","transaction records","potential attraction","behaviors","deduction","one-to-one marketing strategy","home appliances","profitability","time","stage clustering technique","challenges","furniture","companies","comments","order","fact","chances","advantage"],"language":"en"},

Mucins are produced in partby the conjunctial goblet cells, and are complemented by non-globet secretions. This review focuses on secreted ocular mucins. They are present in the tear film, probably both in gel and soluble form, and play a role in lubrication and ocular defense. It is apparent that mucins are highly adapted to their functions. State of the art techniques for mucin purification and analysis are presented. Density gradient centrifugation, gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography and agarose gel electrophoresis are discussed, together with methods of oliogosaccharide analysis. Reagents for the detection of mucin are considered in conjunction with these methods, which we have employed in the analysis of human and canine ocular mucins. The general structure of mucins is reviewed. The biosyntheas and glycosylation of ocular mucins are not yet fully understood, and are discussed in relation to currently established concepts. The impaact of disease on the nature and secretion of mucins is considered, as well as the physiological and pathological significance of mucus degradation.","publish_time":"1998-01-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Corfield, Anthony P.; Carrington, Stephen D.; Hicks, Sally J.; Berry, Monica; Ellingham, Roger","journal":"Prog Retin Eye Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128873/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjsyOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["secreted ocular mucins","canine ocular mucins","glycosylation of ocular mucins","secretion of mucins","general structure of mucins","ocular surface","ocular defense","gel filtration","analysis of human","methods of oliogosaccharide analysis","agarose gel electrophoresis","mucin purification","detection of mucin","ion-exchange chromatography","role","art techniques","Density gradient centrifugation","pathological significance of mucus degradation","partby","conjunctial goblet cells","membrane-bound forms","State","soluble form","conjunction","lubrication","nature","tear film","biosyntheas","review","non-globet secretions","relation","established concepts","disease","Reagents","functions"],"language":"en"},

It may occur as either a familial disorder or a sporadic condition in association with a variety of triggers: infections, malignancies, autoimmune diseases, and acquired immune deficiencies. However, the most consistent association is with viral infections, especially Epstein\u2013Barr virus. The main clinical features are fever, liver dysfunction, coagulation abnormalities and pancytopenia.

L\u2019efficacit\u00E9 \u00E9tait \u00E9valu\u00E9e par le % de patients sans nouvelle consultation pour EABC \u00E0 3 mois. Le mod\u00E8le de Cox a \u00E9t\u00E9 utilis\u00E9 pour la recherche de facteurs pronostiques. R\u00C9SULTATS: 951 mg et 89 pneumologues ont inclus 4 994 patients. L\u2019\u00E2ge moyen \u00E9tait de 64,4 ans, avec 61,4 % d\u2019hommes, 38,7 % d\u2019anciens fumeurs, 35,7 % de fumeurs actuels. 2 ou 3 crit\u00E8res d\u2019Anthonisen dont une expectoration muco-purulente \u00E9taient retrouv\u00E9s chez 71,8 % des patients, 2 ou 3 crit\u00E8res hors expectoration mucopurulente chez 12,8 % et \u003C 2 crit\u00E8res chez 15,4 %. Prescriptions : antibioth\u00E9rapie (AB) \u00E0 91,9 % des patients, cortico\u00EFdes syst\u00E9miques (41,5 %), mucolytiques (41,0 %) et bronchodilatateurs beta2-adr\u00E9nergiques (30,7 %). L\u2019absence d\u2019une nouvelle consultation pour EABC \u00E0 3 mois concerne 63,8 % des patients.

Une corticoth\u00E9rapie syst\u00E9mique augmente le risque chez les patients ayant au moins 2 crit\u00E8res d\u2019Anthonisen dont l\u2019expectoration muco-purulente (1,16 [1,03 ; 1,30]) et chez les patients ayant deux crit\u00E8res d\u2019Anthonisen hors expectoration muco-purulente ou moins de 2 crit\u00E8res (1,29 [1,06 ; 1,57]). CONCLUSION: Chez les fumeurs actuels ayant au moins deux crit\u00E8res d\u2019Anthonisen dont l\u2019expectoration muco-purulente, l\u2019AB r\u00E9duit de 65 % le risque de nouvelle consultation. La corticoth\u00E9rapie par voie g\u00E9n\u00E9rale augmente ce risque de 16 % \u00E0 29 % selon le groupe de patients.","publish_time":"2009-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peyramond, D.; Demeaux, J.-L.; Housset, B.; Mayaud, C.; Pouchain, D.; Molimard, M.; Moore, N.","journal":"Med Mal Infect","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130852/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjs3MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cox"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["crit\u00E8res","groupe de patients","risque de nouvelle consultation","Anthonisen","expectoration mucopurulente","fumeurs actuels","EABC","risque de survenue","anciens fumeurs","AB r\u00E9duit","mois","corticoth\u00E9rapie syst\u00E9mique","pneumologues lib\u00E9raux","efficacit\u00E9 de la strat\u00E9gie th\u00E9rapeutique","charge","Cohorte prospective observationnelle","\u00E9chantillon al\u00E9atoire","m\u00E9decins g\u00E9n\u00E9ralistes","MAT\u00C9RIELS","M\u00C9THODES","prise","RR","recherche de facteurs pronostiques","ans","pratique courante","hommes","voie g\u00E9n\u00E9rale","absence","bronchodilatateurs beta2","mod\u00E8le de Cox","cortico\u00EFdes syst\u00E9miques","\u00E2ge moyen","mucolytiques","INTRODUCTION","OBJECTIFS","Prescriptions","antibioth\u00E9rapie","CONCLUSION","R\u00C9SULTATS"],"language":"fr"},

We previously showed that Fibrinogen-like-protein 2 (FGL2), a novel CD4(\u002B)CD25(\u002B) Treg effector molecule, was over-expressed in the liver of mice experimentally infected with E. multilocularis. However, little is known about its contribution to the control of this chronic helminth infection. METHODS/FINDINGS: Key parameters for infection outcome in E. multilocularis-infected fgl2(-/-) (AE-fgl2(-/-)) and wild type (AE-WT) mice at 1 and 4 month(s) post-infection were (i) parasite load (i. e. wet weight of parasitic metacestode tissue), and (ii) parasite cell proliferation as assessed by determining E. multilocularis 14-3-3 gene expression levels. Serum FGL2 levels were measured by ELISA. Spleen cells cultured with ConA for 48h or with E. multilocularis Vesicle Fluid (VF) for 96h were analyzed ex-vivo and in-vitro. In addition, spleen cells from non-infected WT mice were cultured with rFGL2/anti-FGL2 or rIL-17A/anti-IL-17A for further functional studies. For Treg-immune-suppression-assays, purified CD4(\u002B)CD25(\u002B) Treg suspensions were incubated with CD4(\u002B) effector T cells in the presence of ConA and irradiated spleen cells as APCs. Flow cytometry and qRT-PCR were used to assess Treg, Th17-, Th1-, Th2-type immune responses and maturation of dendritic cells. We showed that AE-fgl2(-/-) mice exhibited (as compared to AE-WT-animals) (a) a significantly lower parasite load with reduced proliferation activity, (b) an increased T cell proliferative response to ConA, (c) reduced Treg numbers and function, and (d) a persistent capacity of Th1 polarization and DC maturation. CONCLUSIONS: FGL2 appears as one of the key players in immune regulatory processes favoring metacestode survival by promoting Treg cell activity and IL-17A production that contributes to FGL2-regulation. Prospectively, targeting FGL2 could be an option to develop an immunotherapy against AE and other chronic parasitic diseases.","publish_time":"2015-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Junhua; Vuitton, Dominique A.; M\u00FCller, Norbert; Hemphill, Andrew; Spiliotis, Markus; Blagosklonov, Oleg; Grandgirard, Denis; Leib, Stephen L.; Shalev, Itay; Levy, Gary; Lu, Xiaomei; Lin, Renyong; Wen, Hao; Gottstein, Bruno","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7bab005205a7ee772e476d7dbcf5eee3aed12826.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4425495.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4425495/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzUxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AE-fgl2","multilocularis-infected fgl2","anti-FGL2","Treg-immune","FGL2-regulation","AE-WT","Serum FGL2 levels","Treg cell activity","Treg numbers","Treg suspensions","effector T cells","Echinococcus multilocularis metacestode","irradiated spleen cells","Treg effector molecule","non-infected WT mice","maturation of dendritic cells","parasite cell proliferation","liver of mice","immune regulatory processes","multilocularis Vesicle Fluid","metacestode survival","presence of ConA","Th2-type immune responses","infection outcome","reduced proliferation activity","post-infection","lower parasite load","chronic helminth infection","CD25","novel CD4","anti-IL","periparasitic host immune-mediated processes","chronic parasitic diseases","increased T cell proliferative response","wet weight of parasitic metacestode tissue","Key parameters","DC maturation","key players","wild type","gene expression levels","persistent capacity of Th1 polarization","rFGL2","FINDINGS","tumor","rIL","alveolar echinococcosis","control","VF","month","immunotherapy","production","addition","APCs","suppression-assays","growth potential","qRT-PCR","Flow cytometry","nature","METHODS","Th17","ELISA","option","BACKGROUND","contribution","protein","animals","functional studies","vitro","Fibrinogen","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Antiviral drugs exhibit limited efficacy unless administered early and may induce viral resistance. Thus, targeting the host response directly has been proposed as a novel therapeutic strategy with the added potential benefit of not eliciting viral resistance. Severe influenza virus infections are complicated by respiratory failure due to the development of lung microvascular leak and acute lung injury. We hypothesized that enhancing lung endothelial barrier integrity could improve the outcome. Here we demonstrate that the Tie2-agonist tetrameric peptide Vasculotide improves survival in murine models of severe influenza, even if administered as late as 72 hours after infection; the benefit was observed using three strains of the virus and two strains of mice. The effect required Tie2, was independent of viral replication and did not impair lung neutrophil recruitment. Administration of the drug decreased lung edema, arterial hypoxemia and lung endothelial apoptosis; importantly, Vasculotide is inexpensive to produce, is chemically stable and is unrelated to any Tie2 ligands.

Statins are expected to attenuate inflammation in the lungs of patients with ARDS due to their anti-inflammatory effects. Clinical investigations of the role of statin therapy have revealed contradictory results. This study aimed to investigate whether pretreatment and continuous therapy with statins in patients with sepsis-associated ARDS are associated with 28-day survival according to disease severity (mild, moderate, or severe). METHODS: Patients with sepsis-associated ARDS from the surgical intensive care were enrolled in this prospective observational investigation. ARDS was classified into three groups (mild, moderate, and severe); 28-day mortality was recorded as the primary outcome variable and organ failure was recorded as secondary outcome variable. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores and the requirements for organ support were evaluated throughout the observational period to assess organ failure. RESULTS: 404 patients with sepsis-associated ARDS were enrolled in this investigation. The distribution of the ARDS subgroups was 13 %, 59 %, and 28 % for mild, moderate, and severe disease, respectively. Statin therapy improved 28-day survival exclusively in the patients with severe ARDS compared with patients without statin therapy (88.5 % and 62.5 %, respectively; P = 0.0193). To exclude the effects of several confounders, we performed multivariate Cox regression analysis, which showed that statin therapy remained a significant covariate for mortality (hazard ratio, 5.46; 95 % CI, 1.38\u201321.70; P = 0.0156). Moreover, after carrying a propensity score-matching in the severe ARDS cohort, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis confirmed the improved 28-day survival among patients with statin therapy (P = 0.0205). Patients with severe ARDS who received statin therapy had significantly more vasopressor-free days compared with those without statin therapy (13 \u00B1 7 and 9 \u00B1 7, respectively; P = 0.0034), and they also required less extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy and had more ECMO-free days (18 \u00B1 9 and 15 \u00B1 9, respectively; P = 0.0873). CONCLUSIONS: This investigation suggests a beneficial effect of continuous statin therapy in patients with severe sepsis-associated ARDS and a history of prior statin therapy.

Despite the use of a neuron-specific promoter to generate the Tg mice, they expressed significant levels of H-apoD in both plasma and liver and they slowly develop hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. We show here that hepatic PPAR\u03B3 expression in Tg mice is increased by 2-fold compared to wild type (WT) mice. Consequently, PPAR\u03B3 target genes Plin2 and Cide A/C are overexpressed, leading to increased lipid droplets formation. Expression of the fatty acid transporter CD36, another PPARgamma target, is also increased in Tg mice associated with elevated fatty acid uptake as measured in primary hepatocytes. Elevated expression of AMPK in the liver of Tg leads to phosphorylation of acetyl CoA carboxylase, indicating a decreased activity of the enzyme. Fatty acid synthase expression is also induced but the hepatic lipogenesis measured in vivo is not significantly different between WT and Tg mice. In addition, expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1, the rate-limiting enzyme of beta-oxidation, is slightly upregulated. Finally, we show that overexpressing H-apoD in HepG2 cells in presence of arachidonic acid (AA), the main apoD ligand, increases the transcriptional activity of PPAR\u03B3. Supporting the role of apoD in AA transport, we observed enrichment in hepatic AA and a decrease in plasmatic AA concentration. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the hepatic steatosis observed in apoD Tg mice is a consequence of increased PPAR\u03B3 transcriptional activity by AA leading to increased fatty acid uptake by the liver.","publish_time":"2015-06-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Labrie, Marilyne; Lalonde, Simon; Najyb, Ouafa; Thiery, Maxime; Daneault, Caroline; Des Rosiers, Chrisitne; Rassart, Eric; Mounier, Catherine","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a3acbb2d3cf75b9cb9221b0d8acc32559ec4cf8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4470830.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4470830/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzU1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Transgenic"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["apoD Tg mice","hepatic AA","liver of Tg","hepatic PPAR\u03B3 expression","increased fatty acid uptake","Transgenic mice","Fatty acid synthase expression","overexpressing H-apoD","role of apoD","hepatic steatosis","elevated fatty acid uptake","AA transport","transcriptional activity of PPAR\u03B3","consequence of increased PPAR\u03B3 transcriptional activity","hepatic lipogenesis","fatty acid transporter CD36","main apoD ligand","Elevated expression of AMPK","presence of arachidonic acid","plasmatic AA concentration","decreased activity","PPAR\u03B3 target genes Plin2","expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase","WT","increased lipid droplets formation","significant levels of H","PPARgamma target","enzyme of beta-oxidation","HepG2 cells","human apolipoprotein D","phosphorylation of acetyl CoA carboxylase","rate","Cide","enrichment","neuron-specific promoter","addition","fold","wild type","brain","primary hepatocytes","use","insulin resistance","neurodegeneration","results"],"language":"en"},

Without monitoring, effective control and prevention is difficult. We looked at a software system (a) used in shelters across the United States to determine if it can be used to track URI frequency and risk factors in a population. Reports from the software system (a) were compared to data collected manually. This showed that data currently collected were not useful for tracking URI frequency and risk factors. However, potential exists to increase the practicality and usefulness of this shelter software system to monitor URI and other diseases. ABSTRACT: Objective\u2014Feline upper respiratory infection (URI) is a common, multi-factorial infectious disease syndrome endemic to many animal shelters. Although a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in shelter cats, URI is seldom formally monitored in shelter cat populations. Without monitoring, effective control and prevention of this often endemic disease is difficult. We looked at an integrated case management software system (a) for animal care organizations, widely used in shelters across the United States. Shelter staff routinely enter information regarding individual animals and disease status, but do not commonly use the software system to track frequency of disease. The purpose of this study was to determine if the software system (a) can be used to track URI frequency and selected risk factors in a population, and to evaluate the quality and completeness of the data as currently collected in a shelter. Design (type of study)\u2014Descriptive Survey. Animals (or Sample)\u2014317 cats in an animal shelter. Procedures\u2014Reports from the software system (a) containing data regarding daily inventory, daily intake, animal identification, location, age, vaccination status, URI diagnosis and URI duration were evaluated. The reports were compared to data collected manually by an observer (Ann Therese Kommedal) to assess discrepancies, completeness, timeliness, availability and accuracy. Data were collected 6 days a week over a 4 week period. Results\u2014Comparisons between the software system (a) reports and manually collected reports showed that 93% of inventory reports were complete and of these 99% were accurate. Fifty-two percent of the vaccination reports were complete, of which 97% were accurate. The accuracy of the software system\u2019s age reports was 76%. Two-hundred and twenty-three cats were assigned a positive or negative URI diagnosis by the observer. The predictive value of the URI status in the software system (a) was below 60% both for positive and negative URI diagnosis. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance\u2014data currently collected and entered into the software systems in the study shelter, was not useful for tracking URI frequency and risk factors, due to issues with both data quality and capture. However, the potential exists to increase the practicality and usefulness of this shelter software system to monitor URI and other diseases. Relevant data points, i.e., health status at intake and outcome, vaccination date and status, as well as age, should be made mandatory to facilitate more useful data collection and reporting.","publish_time":"2015-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kommedal, Ann Therese; Wagner, Denae; Hurley, Kate","journal":"Animals (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d51485f32ff85186571e9ec9de6d517f9180abe9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4494401.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4494401/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzU3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["URI"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["shelter software system","URI status","URI duration","tracking URI frequency","software systems","negative URI diagnosis","software system\u2019s age reports","data quality","study shelter","shelter cats","vaccination reports","disease status","frequency of disease","integrated case management software system","inventory reports","useful data collection","animal shelters","Shelter staff","vaccination status","Relevant data points","common disease","endemic disease","shelter cat populations","health status","animal identification","selected risk factors","animal care organizations","Feline upper respiratory infection","daily intake","daily inventory","vaccination date","prevention","practicality","effective control","usefulness","completeness","type of study","accuracy","observer","monitoring","United States","diseases","potential","multi-factorial infectious disease syndrome endemic","individual animals","week period","location","discrepancies","outcome","mortality","information","Objective","SIMPLE SUMMARY","issues","Ann Therese Kommedal","timeliness","availability","significant cause of morbidity","ABSTRACT","Descriptive Survey","Conclusions","Clinical Relevance","capture","reporting","days","percent","predictive value","Results","Comparisons","Procedures","Design","Sample","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Its role in acute lung injury (ALI) remains unclear. Here, we assessed the function of Nogo-B during tissue injury in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI mouse model. We found that pulmonary Nogo-B was significantly repressed after LPS instillation in C57BL/6 mice. Over-expression of pulmonary Nogo-B using an adenovirus vector carrying the Nogo-B-RFP-3flag gene (Ad-Nogo-B) significantly prolonged the survival of mice challenged with a lethal dose of LPS. The Ad-Nogo-B-treated mice also had less severe lung injury, less alveolar protein exudation, and a higher number of macrophages but less neutrophil infiltration compared with Ad-RFP-treated mice. Interestingly, microarray analysis showed that the Ad-Nogo-B-treated mice had different gene expression profiles compared with the controls and the prominent expression of genes related to wound healing and the humoral immune response after LPS induction. Of the 49 differently expressed genes, we found that the expression of PTX3 was significantly up-regulated following Nogo-B over-expression as observed in lung tissues and RAW264.7 cells. In conclusion, Nogo-B plays a protective role against LPS-induced ALI, and this effect might be exerted through the modulation of alveolar macrophage recruitment and PTX3 production.","publish_time":"2015-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Wujian; Zhu, Ying; Ning, Yunye; Dong, Yuchao; Huang, Haidong; Zhang, Wei; Sun, Qinying; Li, Qiang","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/519e935c000621a4db50be66bac2cd8bf1856d8a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4502524.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4502524/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzU4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ad-Nogo","B-treated mice","Over-expression of pulmonary Nogo-B","following Nogo-B over-expression","function of Nogo","expression of PTX3","LPS-induced ALI","Ad-RFP","LPS induction","LPS instillation","survival of mice","acute lung injury","prominent expression of genes","tissue injury","severe lung injury","lethal dose of LPS","different gene expression profiles","critical role","lung tissues","protective role","induced ALI mouse model","alveolar protein exudation","flag gene","protein family","tissue repair","acute inflammation","PTX3 production","modulation of alveolar macrophage recruitment","wound healing","humoral immune response","controls","lipopolysaccharide","neutrophil infiltration","higher number of macrophages","adenovirus vector","member","reticulon","RAW264","cells","effect","C57BL","microarray analysis","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

EGCG has been extensively investigated as a multi-targeting anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory compound. In this study, we demonstrated a novel mechanism by which EGCG reverses the neutrophil elastase-induced migration of A549 cells. We found that neutrophil elastase directly triggered human adenocarcinoma A549 cell migration and that EGCG suppressed the elevation of tumor cell migration induced by neutrophil elastase. We observed that EGCG directly binds to neutrophil elastase and inhibits its enzymatic activity based on the CDOCKER algorithm, MD stimulation by GROMACS, SPR assay and elastase enzymatic activity assay. As the natural inhibitor of neutrophil elastase, \u03B11-antitrypsin is synthesized in tumor cells. We further demonstrated that the expression of \u03B11-antitrypsin was up-regulated after EGCG treatment in neutrophil elastase-treated A549 cells. We preliminarily discovered that the EGCG-mediated induction of \u03B11-antitrypsin expression might be correlated with the regulatory effect of EGCG on the PI3K/Akt pathway. Overall, our results suggest that EGCG ameliorates the neutrophil elastase-induced migration of A549 cells. The mechanism underlying this effect may include two processes: EGCG directly binds to neutrophil elastase and inhibits its enzymatic activity; EGCG enhances the expression of \u03B11-antitrypsin by regulating the PI3K/AKT pathway.","publish_time":"2015-07-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiaokaiti, Yilixiati; Wu, Haoming; Chen, Ya; Yang, Haopeng; Duan, Jianhui; Li, Xin; Pan, Yan; Tie, Lu; Zhang, Liangren; Li, Xuejun","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1722fc1da22b2ccf5565ccf81a1677c2994aeee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4503950.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4503950/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzU4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EGCG","SPR","PI3K/Akt","PI3K/AKT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EGCG treatment","neutrophil elastase-induced migration of A549 cells","neutrophil elastase-treated A549 cells","natural inhibitor of neutrophil elastase","elastase enzymatic activity assay","regulatory effect of EGCG","EGCG-mediated induction of \u03B11","\u03B11-antitrypsin","expression of \u03B11","antitrypsin expression","tumor cells","elevation of tumor cell migration","human adenocarcinoma A549 cell migration","PI3K","Akt pathway","SPR assay","multi-targeting anti-tumor","novel mechanism","GROMACS","MD stimulation","CDOCKER algorithm","complex process","anti-inflammatory compound","unregulated inflammatory environment","Lung carcinogenesis","processes","study","results"],"language":"en"},

We assessed vaccine effectiveness (VE) against A(H3N2) hospitalization among elderly individuals during the peak weeks of the 2014/15 epidemic in Quebec, Canada. METHODS: Nasal specimens and clinical/epidemiological data were collected within 7 days of illness onset from elderly patients admitted with respiratory symptoms to one of four participating hospitals between November 30, 2014 and January 13, 2015. Cases tested RT-PCR positive for influenza A(H3N2) and controls tested negative for any influenza. VE was assessed by test-negative case-control design. RESULTS: There were 314 participants including 186 cases (62% vaccinated) and 128 controls (59% vaccinated) included in primary VE analysis. Median age was 81.5 years, two-thirds were admitted from the community and 91% had underlying comorbidity. Crude VE against A(H3N2) hospitalization was -17% (95%CI: -86% to 26%), decreasing to -23% (95%CI: -99 to 23%) with adjustment for age and comorbidity, and to -39% (95%CI: -142 to 20%) with additional adjustment for specimen collection interval, calendar time, type of residence and hospital. In sensitivity analyses, VE estimates were improved toward the null with restriction to participants admitted from the community (-2%; 95%CI: -105 to 49%) or with specimen collection \u22644 days since illness onset (- 8%; 95%CI: -104 to 43%) but further from the null with restriction to participants with comorbidity (-51%; 95%CI: -169 to 15%).

Particle size determines the distance across which pathogens can be transported, as well as the site of deposition and the survivability of the pathogen. Despite the importance of this information, the size distribution of particles bearing viruses emitted by infectious animals remains unknown. In this study we characterized the concentration and size distribution of inhalable particles that transport influenza A virus (IAV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) generated by acutely infected pigs and assessed virus viability for each particle size range. Aerosols from experimentally infected pigs were sampled for 24 days using an Andersen cascade impactor able to separate particles by size (ranging from 0.4 to 10 micrometer (\u03BCm) in diameter). Air samples collected for the first 9, 20 and the last 3 days of the study were analyzed for IAV, PRRSV and PEDV, respectively, using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantified as geometric mean copies/m(3) within each size range. IAV was detected in all particle size ranges in quantities ranging from 5.5x10(2) (in particles ranging from 1.1 to 2.1\u03BCm) to 4.3x10(5) RNA copies/m(3) in the largest particles (9.0\u201310.0\u03BCm).

The bicolored white-toothed shrew (Crocidura leucodon) has recently been identified as reservoir of the neurotropic Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Six out of eleven wild living bicoloured white-toothed shrews were trapped and revealed to be naturally infected with BoDV-1. All shrews were monitored in captivity in a long-term study over a time period up to 600 days that differed between the individual shrews. Interestingly, all six animals showed an asymptomatic course of infection despite virus shedding via various routes indicating a highly adapted host-pathogen interaction. Infectious virus and viral RNA were demonstrated in saliva, urine, skin swabs, lacrimal fluid and faeces, both during the first 8 weeks of the investigation period and for long time shedding after more than 250 days in captivity. CONCLUSIONS: The various ways of shedding ensure successful virus maintenance in the reservoir population but also transmission to accidental hosts such as horses and sheep. Naturally BoDV-1-infected living shrews serve as excellent tool to unravel host and pathogen factors responsible for persistent viral co-existence in reservoir species while maintaining their physiological integrity despite high viral load in many organ systems.","publish_time":"2015-08-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nobach, Daniel; Bourg, Manon; Herzog, Sibylle; Lange-Herbst, Hildburg; Encarna\u00E7\u00E3o, Jorge A.; Eickmann, Markus; Herden, Christiane","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a387a670706c2009e6c5e7a39c112a9e645f963.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4552160.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4552160/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzYxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Infectious virus","BoDV","successful virus maintenance","mechanisms of virus maintenance","infected living shrews","viral RNA","individual shrews","reservoir species","reservoir population","neurotropic Borna disease virus","time period","wild living bicoloured white-toothed shrews","various ways of shedding","transmission","long time shedding","days","captivity","high viral load","persistent viral co-existence","adapted host-pathogen interaction","various routes","bicolored white-toothed shrew","investigation period","RNA viruses","pathogen factors responsible","excellent tool","skin swabs","urine","physiological integrity","accidental hosts","lacrimal fluid","rodents","saliva","asymptomatic course of infection","Crocidura leucodon","faeces","animal reservoirs","horses","organ systems","long-term study","insectivores","animals","sheep","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","weeks","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS"],"language":"en"},

Here we describe rVSV vectors containing a full complement of VSV genes and expressing the Ebola virus (EBOV) GP from an additional transcription unit.

This concern has prompted the use of mathematical models to evaluate strategies to control disease spread, making these models invaluable tools to identify optimal intervention strategies. A particularly important quantity in infectious disease epidemiology is the basic reproduction number, R(0.) Estimation of this quantity is crucial for effective control responses in the early phase of an epidemic. In our previous study, an approach for estimating the basic reproduction number in real time was developed. This approach uses case notification data and the structure of potential transmission contacts to accurately estimate R(0) from the limited amount of information available at the early stage of an outbreak. Based on this approach, we extend the existing methodology; the most recent method features intra- and inter-age groups contact heterogeneity. Given the number of newly reported cases at the early stage of the outbreak, with parsimony assumptions on removal distribution and infectivity profile of the diseases, experiments to estimate real time R(0) under different levels of intra- and inter-group contact heterogeneity using two age groups are presented. We show that the new method converges more quickly to the actual value of R(0) than the previous one, in particular when there is high-level intra-group and inter-group contact heterogeneity. With the age specific contact patterns, number of newly reported cases, removal distribution, and information about the natural history of the 2009 pandemic influenza in Hong Kong, we also use the extended model to estimate R(0) and age-specific R(0).","publish_time":"2015-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kwok, Kin On; Davoudi, Bahman; Riley, Steven; Pourbohloul, Babak","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/624840869f8c5f365a639a67cae53f56c740749f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4570805.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4570805/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzY0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["age-specific R","real time R","inter-group contact heterogeneity","inter-age groups","approach","age specific contact patterns","basic reproduction number","actual value of R","early stage","high-level intra-group","diseases","removal distribution","reported cases","early phase","concern","outbreak","different levels of intra-","use of mathematical models","disease spread","recent method","important quantity","information available","pandemic influenza","pandemic H1N1","new method","previous study","infectious disease epidemiology","models invaluable tools","public health researchers","optimal intervention strategies","effective control responses","health care systems","policy makers","infectivity profile","parsimony assumptions","experiments","increased burden","structure of potential transmission contacts","SARS","case notification data","natural history","existing methodology","Hong Kong","re-emerging infections","extended model","Estimation","epidemic"],"language":"en"},

During infection with RNA viruses, 5\u2032-di- or -triphosphates accompanying specific single or double-stranded RNA motifs trigger signaling of intracellular RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and initiate the antiviral response. Although these molecular signatures are present during the replication of many viruses, it is unknown whether they are sufficient for strong activation of RLRs during infection. Immunostimulatory defective viral genomes (iDVGs) from Sendai virus (SeV) are among the most potent natural viral triggers of antiviral immunity. Here we describe an RNA motif (DVG(70-114)) that is essential for the potent immunostimulatory activity of 5\u2032-triphosphate-containing SeV iDVGs. DVG(70-114) enhances viral sensing by the host cell independently of the long stretches of complementary RNA flanking the iDVGs, and it retains its stimulatory potential when transferred to otherwise inert viral RNA. In vitro analysis showed that DVG(70-114) augments the binding of RIG-I to viral RNA and promotes enhanced RIG-I polymerization, thereby facilitating the onset of the antiviral response. Together, our results define a new natural viral PAMP enhancer motif that promotes viral recognition by RLRs and confers potent immunostimulatory activity to viral RNA.","publish_time":"2015-10-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Jie; Mercado-L\u00F3pez, Xiomara; Grier, Jennifer T.; Kim, Won-keun; Chun, Lauren F.; Irvine, Edward B.; Del Toro Duany, Yoandris; Kell, Alison; Hur, Sun; Gale, Michael; Raj, Arjun; L\u00F3pez, Carolina B.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5d78b139da9ef9b2070d532b2bd773c367656ca8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4611036.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4611036/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzY3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","PAMP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inert viral RNA","viral sensing","viral recognition","RNA viruses","sensing of viral pathogen","Immunostimulatory defective viral genomes","antiviral response","potent natural viral triggers of antiviral immunity","new natural viral PAMP enhancer motif","potent immunostimulatory activity","long stretches of complementary RNA","SeV iDVGs","double-stranded RNA motifs trigger","intracellular RIG","enhanced RIG","binding of RIG","infection","strong activation of RLRs","molecular patterns","molecular signatures","PAMPs","host cell","Sendai virus","specialized cellular proteins","replication","results","triphosphates","polymerization","stimulatory potential","receptors","onset","Stimulation","analysis"],"language":"en"},

SGs have been linked to several pathologies including inflammatory diseases, cancer, viral infection, and neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In ALS and FTD, the majority of cases have no known etiology and exposure to external stress is frequently proposed as a contributor to either disease initiation or the rate of disease progression. Of note, both ALS and FTD are characterized by pathological inclusions, where some well-known SG markers localize with the ALS related proteins TDP-43 and FUS.

By fitting the model to reported cumulative cases and deaths in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia until March 22, 2015, we estimate the basic reproduction number in these countries as 1.2552, 1.6093 and 1.7994, respectively. Model analysis shows that there exists a threshold of the effectiveness of isolation, below which increasing the fraction of latent individuals diagnosed prior to symptoms onset or shortening the duration between symptoms onset and isolation may lead to more Ebola infection. This challenges an existing view. Media coverage plays a substantial role in reducing the final epidemic size. The response to reported cumulative infected cases and deaths may have a different effect on the epidemic spread in different countries. Among all the interventions, we find that shortening the duration between death and burial and improving the effectiveness of isolation are two effective interventions for controlling the outbreak of Ebola virus infection.","publish_time":"2015-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shen, Mingwang; Xiao, Yanni; Rong, Libin","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/85b5447948b449ab1c2e90e5a165e62c5df853bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4626779.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4626779/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzY5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Ebola","West Africa","Liberia"],"keyphrases":["effectiveness of interventions","effectiveness of isolation","Ebola infection","effective interventions","stringent interventions","deaths","cumulative cases","symptoms onset","epidemic spread","different countries","epidemiological model","duration","re-emergence of Ebola","Model analysis","outbreak of Ebola virus infection","cumulative infected cases","different effect","final epidemic size","various controlling measures","disease transmission dynamics","Guinea","substantial role","effects","West Africa","Sierra Leone","fraction of latent individuals","Media coverage","Liberia","basic reproduction number","response","threshold","paper","existing view"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies, using short sessions (\u003C12 h), failed to find any effects on respiratory system compliance. In the present analysis, the effects of prolonged PP sessions (24 h) were retrospectively studied with regard to safety data, oxygenation and respiratory system compliance. METHODS: Retrospective review of 17 consecutive patients who required both VV-ECMO and prone positioning. PP under VV-ECMO was considered when the patient presented at least one unsuccessful ECMO weaning attempt after day 7 or refractory hypoxemia combined or not with persistent high plateau pressure. PP sessions had a duration of 24 h with fixed ECMO and respiratory settings. PP was not performed in patients under vasopressor treatment and in cases of recent open chest cardiac surgery. RESULTS: Despite optimized protective mechanical ventilation and other adjuvant treatment (i.e. PP, inhaled nitric oxide, recruitment maneuvers), 44 patients received VV-ECMO during the study period for refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome. Global survival rate was 66 %. Among the latter, 17 patients underwent PP during VV-ECMO for a total of 27 sessions. After 24 h in prone position, PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio significantly increased from 111 (84\u2013128) to 173 (120\u2013203) mmHg (p \u003C 0.0001) while respiratory system compliance increased from 18 (12\u201336) to 32 (15\u201336) ml/cmH(2)O (p \u003C 0.0001). Twenty-four hours after the return to supine position, tidal volume was increased from 3.0 (2.2\u20134.0) to 3.7 (2.8\u20135.0) ml/kg (p \u003C 0.005). PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio increased by over 20 % in 14/14 sessions for late sessions (\u22657 days) and in 7/13 sessions for early sessions (\u003C7 days) (p = 0.01). Quantitative CT scan revealed a high percentage of non-aerated or poorly-aerated lung parenchyma [52 % (41\u201362)] in all patients. No correlation was found between CT scan data and respiratory parameter changes. Hemodynamics did not vary and side effects were rare (one membrane thrombosis and one drop in ECMO blood flow). CONCLUSION: When used in combination with VV-ECMO, 24 h of prone positioning improves both oxygenation and respiratory system compliance.

However, the epidemiological impact remains to be determined. Mosquito-borne flaviviruses are primarily transmitted through Aedes and Culex mosquitoes; these viruses establish a life-long or persistent infection without apparent pathological effects. This establishment requires a balance between virus replication and the antiviral host response. Viral interference is a phenomenon whereby one virus inhibits the replication of other viruses, and this condition is frequently associated with persistent infections. Viral interference and persistent infection are determined by several factors, such as defective interfering particles, competition for cellular factors required for translation/replication, and the host antiviral response. The interaction between two flaviviruses typically results in viral interference, indicating that these viruses share common features during the replicative cycle in the vector. The potential mechanisms involved in these processes are reviewed here.","publish_time":"2015-10-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Salas-Benito, Juan Santiago; De Nova-Ocampo, M\u00F3nica","journal":"J Immunol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8806dfedc1367125f90ab8479b99ae5a50438c1a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4637105.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4637105/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzcxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Viral interference","virus replication","flaviviruses cocirculating","antiviral host response","host antiviral response","persistent infections","cellular factors","competition","defective interfering particles","translation","replicative cycle","important pathogens","common features","detection","humans","apparent pathological effects","Aedes","balance","life","phenomenon","Culex mosquitoes","geographic area","establishment","condition","potential mechanisms","processes","vector","epidemiological impact","interaction"],"language":"en"},

The most common cause of non-malarial febrile illness (NMFI) in African children is respiratory tract inflection. Whilst the bacterial causes of NMFI are well known, the increasing use of sensitive techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests is revealing large numbers of viruses that are potential respiratory pathogens. However, many of these organisms are commonly present in the respiratory tract of healthy children so causality and risk factors for pneumonia remain poorly understood. Inflection with a combination of viral and bacterial pathogens is increasingly recognised as important in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. Similarly, blood stream inflections with organisms typically grown by aerobic culture are well known but a growing number of organisms that can be identified only by PCR, viral culture, or serology are now recognised to be common pathogens in African children. The high mortality of hospitalised children on the first or second day of admission suggests that, unless results are rapidly available, diagnostic tests to identify specific causes of illness will still be of limited use in guiding the potentially life saving decisions relating to initial treatment of children admitted to district hospitals in Africa with severe febrile illness and a negative test for malaria. Malaria control and the introduction of vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b and pneumococcal disease are contributing to improved child survival in Africa. However, increased parasitological testing for malaria is associated with increased use of antbiotics to which resistance is already high.","publish_time":"2015-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muro, Florid; Reyburn, Rita; Reyburn, Hugh","journal":"Pneumonia (Nathan)","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4650196.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4650196/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzczMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa"],"keyphrases":["African children","severe febrile illness","management of febrile illness","respiratory tract of healthy children","initial treatment of children","specific causes of illness","Malaria control","high mortality of hospitalised children","common pathogens","negative test","bacterial pathogens","potential respiratory pathogens","respiratory tract inflection","bacterial causes of NMFI","negative parasitological test","common cause of non-malarial febrile illness","PCR","limited use","increased use of antbiotics","viral culture","growing number of organisms","diagnostic tests","increasing use of sensitive techniques","presumptive treatment","combination of viral","aerobic culture","parasitological testing","pathogenesis of pneumonia","pneumococcal disease","Haemophilus influenzae type b","causality","district hospitals","introduction of vaccines","polymerase chain reaction","large numbers of viruses","life","risk factors","improved child survival","results","decisions","resistance","awareness","serology","strategies","blood stream inflections","replacement","importance","day of admission"],"language":"en"},

The impact of polymicrobial ICUAP is not extensively known. We therefore investigated the characteristics and outcomes of polymicrobial aetiology of ICUAP. METHOD: Patients with ICUAP confirmed microbiologically were prospectively compared according to identification of 1 (monomicrobial) or more (polymicrobial) potentially-pathogenic microorganisms. Microbes usually considered as non-pathogenic were not considered for the etiologic diagnosis. We assessed clinical characteristics, microbiology, inflammatory biomarkers and outcome variables. RESULTS: Among 441 consecutive patients with ICUAP, 256 (58 %) had microbiologic confirmation, and 41 (16 %) of them polymicrobial pneumonia. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and several Enterobacteriaceae were more frequent in polymicrobial pneumonia. Multi-drug and extensive-drug resistance was similarly frequent in both groups. Compared with monomicrobial, patients with polymicrobial pneumonia had less frequently chronic heart disease (6, 15 % vs. 71, 33 %, p = 0.019), and more frequently pleural effusion (18, 50 %, vs. 54, 25 %, p = 0.008), without any other significant difference. Appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment was similarly frequent in the monomicrobial (185, 86 %) and the polymicrobial group (39, 95 %), as were the initial response to the empiric treatment, length of stay and mortality. Systemic inflammatory response was similar comparing monomicrobial with polymicrobial ICUAP. CONCLUSION: The aetiology of ICUAP confirmed microbiologically was polymicrobial in 16 % cases. Pleural effusion and absence of chronic heart disease are associated with polymicrobial pneumonia. When empiric treatment is frequently appropriate, polymicrobial aetiology does not influence the outcome of ICUAP.","publish_time":"2015-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ferrer, Miquel; Difrancesco, Leonardo Filippo; Liapikou, Adamantia; Rinaudo, Mariano; Carbonara, Marco; Li Bassi, Gianluigi; Gabarrus, Albert; Torres, Antoni","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11cb50e517c065f729bc4add4e5f9263efa7e993.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4699341.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4699341/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozc3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICUAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["polymicrobial pneumonia","impact of polymicrobial ICUAP","outcomes of polymicrobial aetiology of ICUAP","polymicrobial group","outcome of ICUAP","empiric treatment","antibiotic treatment","Appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment","similar comparing monomicrobial","pleural effusion","consecutive patients","absence of chronic heart disease","Systemic inflammatory response","Microbial aetiology of intensive care unit","inflammatory biomarkers","initial response","Multi-drug","clinical characteristics","outcome variables","extensive-drug resistance","microbiology","Haemophilus influenzae","Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus","Enterobacteriaceae","BACKGROUND","length","RESULTS","mortality","pathogenic microorganisms","METHOD","CONCLUSION","etiologic diagnosis","microbiologic confirmation","significant difference","Microbes","groups","identification","cases"],"language":"en"},

Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is one possible method for respirator disinfection. However, UV radiation degrades polymers, which presents the possibility that UVGI exposure could degrade the ability of a disposable respirator to protect the worker. To study this, we exposed both sides of material coupons and respirator straps from four models of N95 FFRs to UVGI doses from 120\u2013950 J/cm(2). We then tested the particle penetration, flow resistance, and bursting strengths of the individual respirator coupon layers, and the breaking strength of the respirator straps. We found that UVGI exposure led to a small increase in particle penetration (up to 1.25%) and had little effect on the flow resistance. UVGI exposure had a more pronounced effect on the strengths of the respirator materials. At the higher UVGI doses, the strength of the layers of respirator material was substantially reduced (in some cases, by \u003E90%). The changes in the strengths of the respirator materials varied considerably among the different models of respirators. UVGI had less of an effect on the respirator straps; a dose of 2360 J/cm(2) reduced the breaking strength of the straps by 20\u201351%. Our results suggest that UVGI could be used to effectively disinfect disposable respirators for reuse, but the maximum number of disinfection cycles will be limited by the respirator model and the UVGI dose required to inactivate the pathogen.","publish_time":"2015-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lindsley, William G.; Martin, Stephen B.; Thewlis, Robert E.; Sarkisian, Khachatur; Nwoko, Julian O.; Mead, Kenneth R.; Noti, John D.","journal":"J Occup Environ Hyg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9ed1d98277a560bca71ed6d7a34c4d7e7058cd89.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4699414.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4699414/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozc3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UVGI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respirator straps","respirator disinfection","respirator materials","UVGI exposure","respirator model","layers of respirator material","higher UVGI doses","individual respirator coupon layers","disposable respirators","breaking strength","models of N95 FFRs","bursting strengths","disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators","flow resistance","different models of respirators","pronounced effect","little effect","particle penetration","ability","reuse","sides of material coupons","maximum number of disinfection cycles","small increase","possible method","infectious respiratory disease","Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation","polymers","pandemic","influenza","possibility","UV radiation","pathogen","worker","changes","results","cases"],"language":"en"},

The clinical presentation of SIVD resembles that of other more contagious and economically devastating vesicular diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), swine vesicular disease (SVD), and vesicular stomatitis (VS), that typically require immediate rule out diagnostics to lift restrictions on animal quarantine, movement, and trade. This study presents the development of a sensitive, SYBR Green RT-qPCR assay suitable for detection of SV-A in diagnostic swine specimens. After testing 50 pigs with clinical signs consistent with vesicular disease, 44 (88%) were found to be positive for SV-A by RT-qPCR as compared to none from a negative cohort of 35 animals without vesicular disease, indicating that the assay is able to successfully detect the virus in an endemic population.

In 2015, there has been an increase in the occurrence of SV-A in the US, and over 200 specimens submitted to our laboratory for vesicular investigation have tested positive for the virus using this method. SV-A RNA was detectable in all common types of vesicular specimens including swabs and tissue from hoof lesions, oral and snout epithelium, oral swabs, scabs, and internal organ tissues such as liver and lymph node. Genome sequencing analysis from recent virus isolates was performed to confirm target amplicon specificity and was aligned to previous isolates.","publish_time":"2016-01-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bracht, Alexa J.; O\u2019Hearn, Emily S.; Fabian, Andrew W.; Barrette, Roger W.; Sayed, Abu","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65731cfe4b5e1d05aa7c85d3b088346832c35315.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4710529.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4710529/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozc4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIVD","SYBR Green","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["swine vesicular disease","vesicular lesions","vesicular signs","vesicular disease syndrome","vesicular investigation","vesicular stomatitis","swine idiopathic vesicular disease","devastating vesicular diseases","common types of vesicular specimens","mouth disease","detection of SV","occurrence of SV","diagnostic swine specimens","recent virus isolates","oral swabs","Seneca Valley virus","clinical presentation of SIVD","clinical signs consistent","SYBR Green RT-qPCR assay suitable","hoof lesions","previous isolates","subset of pigs","scabs","snout epithelium","restrictions","internal organ tissues","diagnostics","animal quarantine","sera","Genome sequencing analysis","foot","FMD","SVD","low level","movement","development","target amplicon specificity","defined causative agent","animals","laboratory","immediate rule","lymph node","negative cohort","trade","SVV","VS","study","endemic population","increase","method","Senecavirus"],"language":"en"},

Over the years shrimp farming alone has experienced billion dollar losses through WSD. The disease is caused by the White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV), a large dsDNA virus and the only member of the Nimaviridae family. Susceptibility to WSSV in a wide range of crustacean hosts makes it a major risk factor in the translocation of live animals and in commodity products. Currently there are no effective treatments for this disease. Understanding the molecular basis of disease processes has contributed significantly to the treatment of many human and animal pathogens, and with a similar aim considerable efforts have been directed towards understanding host\u2013pathogen molecular interactions for WSD. Work on the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis in aquatic crustaceans has been restricted by a lack of sequenced and annotated genomes for host species. Nevertheless, some of the key host\u2013pathogen interactions have been established: between viral envelope proteins and host cell receptors at initiation of infection, involvement of various immune system pathways in response to WSSV, and the roles of various host and virus miRNAs in mitigation or progression of disease. Despite these advances, many fundamental knowledge gaps remain; for example, the roles of the majority of WSSV proteins are still unknown. In this review we assess current knowledge of how WSSV infects and replicates in its host, and critique strategies for WSD treatment.","publish_time":"2016-01-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Verbruggen, Bas; Bickley, Lisa K.; van Aerle, Ronny; Bateman, Kelly S.; Stentiford, Grant D.; Santos, Eduarda M.; Tyler, Charles R.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/52662ce54ce7eec49dce4d7c0592075227729f3e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4728583.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4728583/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozc5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WSD","WSSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host species","key host","roles of various host","WSD treatment","White Spot Disease","progression of disease","host cell receptors","majority of WSSV proteins","molecular basis of disease processes","pathogen molecular interactions","virus miRNAs","White Spot Syndrome Virus","pathogen interactions","large dsDNA virus","molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis","current knowledge","major risk factor","viral envelope proteins","crustacean aquaculture sector","fundamental knowledge gaps","wide range of crustacean hosts","involvement of various immune system pathways","initiation of infection","societal impact","response","mitigation","translocation of live animals","member","example","annotated genomes","animal pathogens","lack of sequenced","aquatic crustaceans","critique strategies","similar aim considerable efforts","replicates","commodity products","dollar losses","years shrimp farming","advances","human","Work","Susceptibility","Nimaviridae family","review","emergence","effective treatments"],"language":"en"},

Because of the high level of antigenic specificity of HPV capsid antigens, the currently available vaccines are not suitable to provide cross-protection from all other high-risk HPV strains. Due to increasing reports of cervical cancer cases from other HPV high-risk strains other than HPV16 and 18, it is crucial to design vaccine that generate reasonable CD8\u002B T-cell responses for possibly all the high-risk strains. With this aim, we have developed a computational workflow to identify conserved cross-clade CD8\u002B T-cell HPV vaccine candidates by considering E1, E2, E6 and E7 proteins from all the high-risk HPV strains.

Since mitigation reduces both peak prevalence and the number of people who fall ill, the answer might appear to be yes. But mitigation also prolongs epidemics and therefore the time susceptible people engage in activities to avoid infection. These avoidance activities come at a cost\u2014in lost production or consumption, for example. Whether private mitigation yields net social benefits depends on the social weight given to the costs of illness and illness avoidance, now and into the future. We show that, for a large class of infectious diseases, private risk mitigation is socially beneficial. However, in cases where society discounts the future at either very low or very high rates relative to private individuals, or where it places a low weight on the private cost of illness, the social cost of illness under proportionate mixing (doing nothing) may be lower than the social cost of illness under preferential mixing (avoiding infectious individuals). That is, under some circumstances, society would prefer shorter, more intense epidemics without avoidance costs over longer, less intense epidemics with avoidance costs. A sobering (although not surprising) implication of this is that poorer societies should be expected to promote less private disease-risk mitigation than richer societies.","publish_time":"2015-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morin, Benjamin R.; Perrings, Charles; Kinzig, Ann; Levin, Simon","journal":"Theor Ecol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89c09d58a8eec276949e350e191d1a604ada4d9e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4742367.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4742367/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzgwOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["private mitigation","private cost of illness","illness avoidance","social cost of illness","private risk mitigation","private individuals","costs of illness","private disease-risk mitigation","private measures","avoidance costs","social weight","avoidance activities","society","intense epidemics","infectious individuals","net social benefits","infectious disease risks","low weight","future","preferential mixing","large class of infectious diseases","proportionate mixing","number of people","richer societies","poorer societies","time susceptible people","high rates relative","implication","lost production","consumption","peak prevalence","example","sobering","circumstances","infection","cases","answer"],"language":"en"},

Here, one such alternative, namely pig antibodies purified from slaughterhouse blood was investigated in order to elucidate its potential usability to control post-weaning diarrhoea (PWD), which is one of the top indications for antibiotics usage in the pig production. A very cost-efficient and rapid one-step expanded bed adsorption (EBA) chromatography procedure was used to purify pig immunoglobulin G from slaughterhouse pig plasma (more than 100 litres), resulting in \u003E85% pure pig IgG (ppIgG). The ppIgG thus comprised natural pig immunoglobulins and was subsequently shown to contain activity towards four pig-relevant bacterial strains (three different types of Escherichia coli and one type of Salmonella enterica) but not towards a fish pathogen (Yersinia ruckeri), and was demonstrated to inhibit the binding of the four pig relevant bacteria to a pig intestinal cell line (IPEC-J2). Finally it was demonstrated in an in vivo weaning piglet model for intestinal colonization with an E. coli F4\u002B challenge strain that ppIgG given in the feed significantly reduced shedding of the challenge strain, reduced the proportion of the bacterial family Enterobacteriaceae, increased the proportion of families Enterococcoceae and Streptococcaceae and generally increased ileal microbiota diversity. Conclusively, our data support the idea that natural IgG directly purified from pig plasma and given as a feed supplement can be used in modern swine production as an efficient and cost-effective means for reducing both occurrence of PWD and antibiotics usage and with a potential for the prevention and treatment of other intestinal infectious diseases even if the causative agent might not be known.","publish_time":"2016-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hedegaard, Chris J.; Strube, Mikael L.; Hansen, Marie B.; Lindved, Bodil K.; Lihme, Allan; Boye, Mette; Heegaard, Peter M.

However, the role of bypass axis of RAS (Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)/Ang-(1\u20137)/Mas) in hepatic steatosis is still unclear. Here we showed that deletion of ACE2 aggravates liver steatosis, which is correlated with the increased expression of hepatic lipogenic genes and the decreased expression of fatty acid oxidation-related genes in the liver of ACE2 knockout (ACE2(\u2212/y)) mice. Meanwhile, oxidative stress and inflammation were also aggravated in ACE2(\u2212/y) mice. On the contrary, overexpression of ACE2 improved fatty liver in db/db mice, and the mRNA levels of fatty acid oxidation-related genes were up-regulated.

As this epidemic is finally coming to a close, refocusing on long-term prevention strategies becomes paramount. Given the very real threat of future filovirus outbreaks, and the inherent uncertainty of the next outbreak virus and geographic location, it is prudent to consider the extent and implications of known natural diversity in advancing vaccines and therapeutic approaches. To facilitate such consideration, we have updated and enhanced the content of the filovirus portion of Los Alamos Hemorrhagic Fever Viruses Database. We have integrated and performed baseline analysis of all family Filoviridae sequences deposited into GenBank, with associated immune response data, and metadata, and we have added new computational tools with web-interfaces to assist users with analysis.

Moreover, some immunity related genes were also altered following BmNPV infection. Specifically, after removing genetic background and individual immune stress response genes, 22 genes were found to be potentially involved in repressing BmNPV infection. These genes were related to transport, virus replication, intracellular innate immune, and apoptosis.

In addition to the primary role of the capsid protein (CP) in encapsidating the RNA progeny, experimental evidence on positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses suggests that the CP also regulates RNA synthesis. Here, we demonstrate that replication of Satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV) is controlled by the cooperative interaction between STMV CP and the helper virus (HV) Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) replicase. We identified that the STMV CP-HV replicase interaction requires a positively charged residue at the third position (3R) in the N-terminal 13 amino acid (aa) motif. Far-Northwestern blotting showed that STMV CP promotes binding between HV-replicase and STMV RNA. An STMV CP variant having an arginine to alanine substitution at position 3 in the N-terminal 13aa motif abolished replicase-CP binding. The N-terminal 13aa motif of the CP bearing alanine substitutions for positively charged residues located at positions 5, 7, 10 and 11 are defective in packaging full-length STMV, but can package a truncated STMV RNA lacking the 3\u2032 terminal 150 nt region.

The optimized method was established with specifically designed primers for target amplification by real-time detection in approximately 30 min under isothermal conditions.

Although the scientific discourse is working hard to keep pace with these rapid changes, there is nevertheless a considerable deficit in research on the problems and risks as well as the potential and opportunities associated with intensifying processes of internationalization. This paper focuses on the internationalization process of small and medium\u2010sized tourism enterprises (SMTEs) in the Middle East, specifically in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, which continues to be a tourist destination for Westerners in spite of major political and other crises. Internationalization of SMTEs is a complex process, and studies that take a more holistic view of this phenomenon are needed. This paper will therefore attempt to investigate the internationalization process in Jordan from a problem\u2010centred perspective and to critically examine and discuss it on the basis of comments made by leading actors in the Jordanian tourism business.

We aimed to identify the causes and risks of death among TB patients. METHODS: Medical records of mortality cases of culture-proven TB diagnosed during 2003\u20132007 were reviewed. All TB deaths were classified into 2 groups (TB-related and non-TB-related), based on the underlying cause of death. RESULTS: During the study period, 2016 cases (male: 71.1%) of culture-proven TB were identified. The mean age was 59.3 (range: 0.3\u201396) years. The overall mortality rate was 12.3% (249 cases) and the mean age at death was 74 years; 17.3% (43 cases) of all TB deaths were TB-related. Most of the TB-related deaths occurred early (median survival: 20 days), and the patient died of septic shock. Malignancy, liver cirrhosis, renal failure, and miliary and pneumonic radiographic patterns were all independent predictors for all TB deaths. Cavitary, miliary and pneumonic radiographic patterns were all significant predictive factors for TB-related death. Extrapulmonary involvement and liver cirrhosis were also factors contributing to TB-related death. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of TB deaths were ascribed to non-TB-related causes. Managing TB as well as underlying comorbidities in a multidisciplinary approach is essential to improve the outcome of patients in an aging population. However, the clinical manifestations of patients with TB-related death vary; many progressed to fulminant septic shock requiring timely recognition with prompt treatment to prevent early death.","publish_time":"2014-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Chou-Han; Lin, Chou-Jui; Kuo, Yao-Wen; Wang, Jann-Yuan; Hsu, Chia-Lin; Chen, Jong-Min; Cheng, Wern-Cherng; Lee, Li-Na","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb553f0b443bbf57dd5ae7ba30d97652e2ebdaa5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3890594.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3890594/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzEz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TB patients","TB-related deaths","majority of TB deaths","non-TB-related causes","culture-proven TB","early death","risks of death","underlying cause of death","pneumonic radiographic patterns","miliary","liver cirrhosis","Medical records of mortality cases of culture","outcome of patients","mean age","years","fulminant septic shock","clinical manifestations of patients","underlying comorbidities","significant predictive factors","overall mortality rate","timely recognition","renal failure","prompt treatment","independent predictors","multidisciplinary approach","groups","study period","Malignancy","male","METHODS","antibiotic era","Cavitary","median survival","Extrapulmonary involvement","days","aging population","range","tuberculosis","CONCLUSIONS","substantial number of mortalities","RESULTS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

It has been suggested that resting of PBMC after thawing, that is, culturing them overnight in test medium, produces higher antigen-induced spot counts in ELISPOT assays. To evaluate the importance of overnight resting, we systematically tested cryopreserved PBMC from 25 healthy donors. CEF peptides (comprising CMV, EBV and flu antigens) were used to stimulate CD8 cells and mumps antigen to stimulate CD4 cells. The data show that resting significantly increased antigen-elicited T cell responses only for CEF high responder PBMC. The maximal gain observed was doubling of spot counts. For CEF low responders, and for mumps responders of either low- or high reactivity levels, resting had no statistically significant effect on the observed spot counts. Therefore, resting is not a generally applicable approach to improve ELISPOT assay performance, but can be recommended only for clinical subject cohorts and antigens for which it has a proven benefit. Because resting invariably leads to losing about half of the PBMC available for testing, and because doubling the PBMC numbers plated into the assay reliably doubles the antigen-induced spot counts, we suggest the latter approach as a simple and reliable alternative to resting for enhancing the performance of ELISPOT assays. Our data imply that resting is not required if PBMC were cryopreserved and thawed under conditions that minimize apoptosis of the cells. Therefore, this study should draw attention to the need to optimize freezing and thawing conditions for successful T cell work.","publish_time":"2012-07-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuerten, Stefanie; Batoulis, Helena; Recks, Mascha S.; Karacsony, Edith; Zhang, Wenji; Subbramanian, Ramu A.; Lehmann, Paul V.","journal":"Cells","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/83a6a45a591e9222cf68f14d60dce7d3c810c1f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3901103.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3901103/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzI20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PBMC","CEF","ELISPOT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cryopreserved PBMC","PBMC available","PBMC numbers","importance of overnight resting","observed spot counts","CEF high responder PBMC","mumps antigen","higher antigen-induced spot counts","T cell monitoring","CEF low responders","ELISPOT assay performance","performance of ELISPOT assays","increased antigen-elicited T cell responses","successful T cell work","mumps responders","thawing conditions","CEF peptides","CD8 cells","CD4 cells","data","applicable approach","flu antigens","high reactivity levels","freezing","need","CMV","EBV","significant effect","testing","reliable alternative","test medium","attention","clinical subject cohorts","half","healthy donors","maximal gain","study","apoptosis","proven benefit"],"language":"en"},

Explanatory hypotheses included direct and indirect vaccine effects. In a randomized placebo-controlled ferret study, we tested whether prior receipt of 2008\u201309 TIV may have directly influenced A(H1N1)pdm09 illness. Thirty-two ferrets (16/group) received 0.5 mL intra-muscular injections of the Canadian-manufactured, commercially-available, non-adjuvanted, split 2008\u201309 Fluviral or PBS placebo on days 0 and 28. On day 49 all animals were challenged (Ch0) with A(H1N1)pdm09. Four ferrets per group were randomly selected for sacrifice at day 5 post-challenge (Ch\u002B5) and the rest followed until Ch\u002B14. Sera were tested for antibody to vaccine antigens and A(H1N1)pdm09 by hemagglutination inhibition (HI), microneutralization (MN), nucleoprotein-based ELISA and HA1-based microarray assays. Clinical characteristics and nasal virus titers were recorded pre-challenge then post-challenge until sacrifice when lung virus titers, cytokines and inflammatory scores were determined. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups of influenza-na\u00EFve animals. Antibody rise to vaccine antigens was evident by ELISA and HA1-based microarray but not by HI or MN assays; virus challenge raised antibody to A(H1N1)pdm09 by all assays in both groups. Beginning at Ch\u002B2, vaccinated animals experienced greater loss of appetite and weight than placebo animals, reaching the greatest between-group difference in weight loss relative to baseline at Ch\u002B5 (7.4% vs. 5.2%; p = 0.01). At Ch\u002B5 vaccinated animals had higher lung virus titers (log-mean 4.96 vs. 4.23pfu/mL, respectively; p = 0.01), lung inflammatory scores (5.8 vs. 2.1, respectively; p = 0.051) and cytokine levels (p\u003E0.05). At Ch\u002B14, both groups had recovered. Findings in influenza-na\u00EFve, systematically-infected ferrets may not replicate the human experience. While they cannot be considered conclusive to explain human observations, these ferret findings are consistent with direct, adverse effect of prior 2008\u201309 TIV receipt on A(H1N1)pdm09 illness.

The disease is caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV), an Arterivirus which is a highly mutating RNA virus. Widely used modified live PRRSV vaccines have failed to prevent PRRS outbreaks and reinfections; moreover, safety of the live virus vaccines is questionable. Though poorly immunogenic, inactivated PRRSV vaccine is safe. The PRRSV infects primarily the lung macrophages. Therefore, we attempted to strengthen the immunogenicity of inactivated/killed PRRSV vaccine antigens (KAg), especially in the pig respiratory system, through: 1) entrapping the KAg in biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (NP-KAg); 2) coupling the NP-KAg with a potent mucosal adjuvant, whole cell lysate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb WCL); and 3) delivering the vaccine formulation twice intranasally to growing pigs. We have previously shown that a single dose of NP-KAg partially cleared the challenged heterologous PRRSV. Recently, we reported that NP-KAg coupled with unentrapped M. tb WCL significantly cleared the viremia of challenged heterologous PRRSV. Since PRRSV is primarily a lung disease, our goal in this study was to investigate lung viral load and various immune correlates of protection at the lung mucosal surfaces and its parenchyma in vaccinated heterologous PRRSV-challenged pigs. Our results indicated that out of five different vaccine-adjuvant formulations, the combination of NP-KAg and unentrapped M. tb WCL significantly cleared detectable replicating infective PRRSV with a tenfold reduction in viral RNA load in the lungs, associated with substantially reduced gross and microscopic lung pathology. Immunologically, strong humoral (enhanced virus neutralization titers by high avidity antibodies) and cell-mediated immune responses (augmented population of interferon-\u03B3 secreting CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) lymphocytes and reduced secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines) in the lungs were observed. In conclusion, combination of NP-KAg and soluble M. tb WCL elicits broadly cross-protective anti-PRRSV immunity in the pig respiratory system.","publish_time":"2014-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Binjawadagi, Basavaraj; Dwivedi, Varun; Manickam, Cordelia; Ouyang, Kang; Torrelles, Jordi B; Renukaradhya, Gourapura J","journal":"Int J Nanomedicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f34670b6327305bb3d66de79d1aa96a5d8de2b2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3969340.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3969340/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozg20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV","WCL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NP-KAg","inactivated PRRSV vaccine","challenged heterologous PRRSV","PRRSV vaccine antigens","vaccinated heterologous PRRSV","tb WCL","combination of NP","modified live PRRSV vaccines","lung disease","detectable replicating infective PRRSV","PRRS virus","lung viral load","cross-protective anti-PRRSV immunity","lung macrophages","devastating respiratory disease of pigs","lung mucosal surfaces","live virus vaccines","single dose of NP","pig respiratory system","respiratory syndrome","vaccine formulation","mutating RNA virus","microscopic lung pathology","viral RNA load","different vaccine-adjuvant formulations","PRRS outbreaks","lungs","enhanced virus neutralization titers","potent mucosal adjuvant","immune responses","immunogenicity of inactivated","various immune correlates of protection","cell lysate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis","reduced secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines","tenfold reduction","augmented population of interferon","lactic-co-glycolic acid","high avidity antibodies","nanoparticles","parenchyma","biodegradable poly","\u03B3 secreting CD4","lymphocytes","safety","study","CD8","Arterivirus","viremia","reinfections","goal","conclusion","results"],"language":"en"},

In Nigeria, the existence of these subtypes in pigs has not been well studied. This study aimed at determining the prevalence and correlates of Influenza-A viruses circulating in piggery workers and pigs in Oke-aro and Goshen communities in Lagos, Nigeria. METHODS: Nasal swabs were taken from 197 consenting piggery workers and 281 randomly selected pigs to determine the prevalence of Influenza-A (H1, H3, H5) using Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction test (gene M). An interviewer administered questionnaire was used to collect information on demography, Influenza-A related symptoms experienced, personal hygiene and management practices from the piggery workers. Descriptive statistics was used and chi square test performed at 5% significant level. RESULTS: All piggery workers and pigs\u2019 nasal swabs tested negative for Influenza-A viruses, hence, association could not be tested. Mean age of piggery workers was 41 \u00B1 13.6 years and 60% were females. Forty two percent were farm attendants, 38.0% were pig farmers and the rest butchers. Nineteen percent had history of headache; 14.0% had catarrh and cough; 4.0% had sore-throat; 5.0% had diarrhea; while 48.0% had muscle pain at the time of data collection. The mean body temperature for the pig workers was 36.5 \u00B1 0.5 \u00B0C. A significant difference (p\u003C0.05) existed among piggery workers who had muscle pains. CONCLUSION: Piggery workers and pigs in study area were free of Influenza-A (H1, H3, H5) viruses.

Therefore, NRs have become a frequent target for drug development. During the process of developing drugs against these diseases by targeting NRs, we are often facing a problem: Given a NR and chemical compound, can we identify whether they are really in interaction with each other in a cell? To address this problem, a predictor called \u201CiNR-Drug\u201D was developed. In the predictor, the drug compound concerned was formulated by a 256-D (dimensional) vector derived from its molecular fingerprint, and the NR by a 500-D vector formed by incorporating its sequential evolution information and physicochemical features into the general form of pseudo amino acid composition, and the prediction engine was operated by the SVM (support vector machine) algorithm. Compared with the existing prediction methods in this area, iNR-Drug not only can yield a higher success rate, but is also featured by a user-friendly web-server established at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iNR-Drug/, which is particularly useful for most experimental scientists to obtain their desired data in a timely manner. It is anticipated that the iNR-Drug server may become a useful high throughput tool for both basic research and drug development, and that the current approach may be easily extended to study the interactions of drug with other targets as well.","publish_time":"2014-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fan, Yue-Nong; Xiao, Xuan; Min, Jian-Liang; Chou, Kuo-Chen","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee55aea26f816403476a7cb71816b8ecb1110329.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3975431.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3975431/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozk30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["drug development","drug compound","iNR-Drug server","interactions of drug","NRs","D vector","predictor","problem","support vector machine","prediction engine","chemical compound","various major diseases","existing prediction methods","user-friendly web-server","useful high throughput tool","general form of pseudo amino acid composition","physicochemical features","basic research","diabetes","cancer","SVM","sequential evolution information","desired data","area","inflammatory disease","experimental scientists","algorithm","frequent target","molecular fingerprint","process of developing drugs","timely manner","osteoporosis","current approach","higher success rate","Nuclear receptors","targets","cell"],"language":"en"},

In total, 209 blood samples were collected from great frigatebirds (Fregata minor), masked boobies (Sula dactylatra) and red-footed boobies (Sula sula). Forty-one hippoboscid flies were also collected from birds. Seventeen frigatebirds and one fly collected on Europa tested positive for the presence of Haemoproteus parasites by polymerase chain reaction. Phylogenetic analyses based on partial sequences of the Cytochrome b gene showed that parasites were closely related to Haemoproteus iwa reported from frigatebirds in the Pacific Ocean and in the Caribbean.

RESULTS: Forty-seven and 42 cirrhotic patients presented with septic shock in 1997-2004 and 2005-2010, respectively. The recent period differed from the previous one by implementation of adjuvant treatments of septic shock including albumin infusion as fluid volume therapy, low-dose glucocorticoids, and intensive insulin therapy. ICU and hospital survival markedly improved over time (40% in 2005-2010 vs. 17% in 1997-2004, P = 0.02 and 29% in 2005-2010 vs. 6% in 1997-2004, P = 0.009, respectively). Furthermore, this survival gain in the latter period was sustained for 6 months (survival rate 24% in 2005-2010 vs. 6% in 1997-2004, P = 0.06). After adjustment with age, the liver disease stage (Child-Pugh score), and the critical illness severity score (SOFA score), ICU admission between 2005 and 2010 remained an independent favorable prognostic factor (odds ratio (OR) 0.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02-0.4, P = 0.004). The stage of the underlying liver disease was also independently associated with hospital mortality (Child-Pugh score: OR 1.42 per point, 95% CI 1.06-1.9, P = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: In the light of advances in management of both cirrhosis and septic shock, survival of such patients substantially increased over recent years. The stage of the underlying liver disease and the related therapeutic options should be included in the decision-making process for ICU admission.","publish_time":"2013-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sauneuf, Bertrand; Champigneulle, Benoit; Soummer, Alexis; Mongardon, Nicolas; Charpentier, Julien; Cariou, Alain; Chiche, Jean-Daniel; Mallet, Vincent; Mira, Jean-Paul; P\u00E8ne, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4de66808e17dc7e6b9b5830eb1c6391af86aa4c3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4057386.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4057386/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzE4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hospital survival","survival gain","overall outcome of septic shock","liver disease stage","Cirrhotic patients","ICU admission","survival rate","Child-Pugh score","underlying liver disease","implementation of adjuvant treatments of septic shock","SOFA score","high-risk subgroup of patients","cirrhosis","recent period","critical illness severity score","intensive insulin therapy","hospital mortality","recent years","fluid volume therapy","medical intensive care unit","albumin infusion","low-dose glucocorticoids","odds ratio","independent favorable prognostic factor","related therapeutic options","management","METHODS","light of advances","decision-making process","INTRODUCTION","months","adjustment","point","confidence interval","consecutive periods","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","time"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: In 2007, the Kenyan Ministry of Health with technical support from the CDC-Kenya established a national sentinel surveillance system for influenza. At 11 hospitals, for every hospitalized patient with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI), and for the first three outpatients with influenza-like illness (ILI) per day, we collected both nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. Beginning in 2008, we conducted in-hospital follow-up for SARI patients to determine outcome. Specimens were tested by real time RT-PCR for influenza A and B. Influenza A-positive specimens were subtyped for H1, H3, H5, and (beginning in May 2009) A(H1N1)pdm09. RESULTS: From July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2013, we collected specimens from 24,762 SARI and 14,013 ILI patients. For SARI and ILI case-patients, the median ages were 12 months and 16 months, respectively, and 44% and 47% were female. In all, 2,378 (9.6%) SARI cases and 2,041 (14.6%) ILI cases were positive for influenza viruses. Most influenza-associated SARI cases (58.6%) were in children \u003C2 years old. Of all influenza-positive specimens, 78% were influenza A, 21% were influenza B, and 1% were influenza A/B coinfections. Influenza circulated in every month. In four of the six years influenza activity peaked during July\u2013November. Of 9,419 SARI patients, 2.7% died; the median length of hospitalization was 4 days. CONCLUSIONS: During six years of surveillance in Kenya, influenza was associated with nearly 10 percent of hospitalized SARI cases and one-sixth of outpatient ILI cases. Most influenza-associated SARI and ILI cases were in children \u003C2 years old; interventions to reduce the burden of influenza, such as vaccine, could consider young children as a priority group.","publish_time":"2014-06-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Katz, Mark A.; Muthoka, Philip; Emukule, Gideon O.; Kalani, Rosalia; Njuguna, Henry; Waiboci, Lilian W.; Ahmed, Jamal A.; Bigogo, Godfrey; Feikin, Daniel R.; Njenga, Moses K.; Breiman, Robert F.; Mott, Joshua A.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/458baa469db78afded4d1acdbc4b7d440a5f0a74.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4067481.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4067481/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzE5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARI"],"locations":["Africa"],"keyphrases":["burden of influenza","influenza B","influenza viruses","influenza-associated SARI cases","influenza-positive specimens","years influenza activity","SARI patients","ILI patients","percent of hospitalized SARI cases","outpatient ILI cases","ILI case-patients","years of surveillance","years old","national surveillance","young children","countries","months","national sentinel surveillance system","CDC-Kenya","hospitalized patient","median ages","B coinfections","significant disease burden","median length of hospitalization","severe acute respiratory illness","technical support","real time RT-PCR","Kenyan Ministry of Health","interventions","tropics","vaccine","hospital follow-up","days","priority group","H3","Recent studies","outcome","oropharyngeal swabs","BACKGROUND","H5","hospitals","CONCLUSIONS","outpatients","H1N1","pdm09","METHODS","Africa","RESULTS","female"],"language":"en"},

Within the RAS, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin (Ang) I into the vasoconstrictor Ang II. An \u201Calternate\u201D arm of the RAS now exists in which ACE2 counterbalances the effects of the classic RAS through degradation of Ang II, and generation of the vasodilator Ang 1-7. ACE2 is highly expressed in the heart, blood vessels, and kidney. The catalytically active ectodomain of ACE2 undergoes shedding, resulting in ACE2 in the circulation. The ACE2 gene maps to a quantitative trait locus on the X chromosome in three strains of genetically hypertensive rats, suggesting that ACE2 may be a candidate gene for hypertension. It is hypothesized that disruption of tissue ACE/ACE2 balance results in changes in blood pressure, with increased ACE2 expression protecting against increased blood pressure, and ACE2 deficiency contributing to hypertension. Experimental hypertension studies have measured ACE2 in either the heart or kidney and/or plasma, and have reported that deletion or inhibition of ACE2 leads to hypertension, whilst enhancing ACE2 protects against the development of hypertension, hence increasing ACE2 may be a therapeutic option for the management of high blood pressure in man. There have been relatively few studies of ACE2, either at the gene or the circulating level in patients with hypertension. Plasma ACE2 activity is low in healthy subjects, but elevated in patients with cardiovascular risk factors or cardiovascular disease. Genetic studies have investigated ACE2 gene polymorphisms with either hypertension or blood pressure, and have produced largely inconsistent findings. This review discusses the evidence regarding ACE2 in experimental hypertension models and the association between circulating ACE2 activity and ACE2 polymorphisms with blood pressure and arterial hypertension in man.","publish_time":"2014-06-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patel, Sheila K.; Velkoska, Elena; Freeman, Melanie; Wai, Bryan; Lancefield, Terase F.; Burrell, Louise M.","journal":"Front Physiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b7f529b58714037f09a19f78d9a06d68f1f15dd9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4067757.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4067757/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzE5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ang II","Ang"],"organizations":["RAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["studies of ACE2","ACE2 polymorphisms","ACE2 deficiency","inhibition of ACE2","ACE2 gene polymorphisms","ACE2 gene maps","circulating ACE2 activity","Plasma ACE2 activity","increased ACE2 expression","ACE2 balance results","active ectodomain of ACE2","arterial hypertension","development of hypertension","Experimental hypertension studies","increased blood pressure","experimental hypertension models","blood vessels","management of high blood pressure","heart","candidate gene","classic RAS","degradation of Ang","vasodilator Ang","vasoconstrictor Ang","patients","kidney","Genetic studies","cardiovascular risk factors","major risk factor","renin-angiotensin system","circulating level","cardiovascular disease","major role","disruption of tissue ACE","coronary events","changes","quantitative trait locus","association","stroke","X chromosome","renal failure","healthy subjects","evidence","therapeutic option","strains","generation","effects","enzyme","shedding","hypertensive rats","deletion","pathogenesis","arm","review","inconsistent findings","circulation"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The multi-method training needs assessment included reviews of the competency domains needed to implement the International Health Regulations (2005) as well as China\u2019s policies and emergency regulations. The review, iterative interviews and workshops with experts in government, academia, the military, and with HERO staff were reviewed critically by an expert technical advisory panel. FINDINGS: Over 1600 participants contributed to curriculum development. Of the 18 competency domains identified as essential for HERO staff, nine were developed into priority in-service training modules to be conducted over 2.5 weeks. Experts from academia and experienced practitioners prepared and delivered each module through lectures followed by interactive problem-solving exercises and desktop simulations to help trainees apply, experiment with, and consolidate newly acquired knowledge and skills. CONCLUSION: This study adds to the emerging literature on China\u2019s enduring efforts to strengthen its emergency response capabilities since the outbreak of SARS in 2003. The multi-method approach to curriculum development in partnership with senior policy-makers, researchers, and experienced practitioners can be applied in other settings to ensure training is responsive and customized to local needs, resources and priorities. Ongoing curriculum development should reflect international standards and be coupled with the development of appropriate performance support systems at the workplace for motivating staff to apply their newly acquired knowledge and skills effectively and creatively.","publish_time":"2014-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yadong; Li, Xiangrui; Yuan, Yiwen; Patel, Mahomed S.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e216d0c059fbbc7cace4a9d12a48482ad781366.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4074095.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4074095/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzIwMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Ongoing curriculum development","HERO staff","in-service curriculum","motivating staff","emergency regulations","emergency response capabilities","multi-method training needs assessment","multi-method approach","competency domains","experts","experienced practitioners","International Health Regulations","academia","settings","knowledge","skills","established health emergency response offices","priority in-service training modules","development of appropriate performance support systems","local needs","international standards","China\u2019s policies","innovative approach","China\u2019s enduring efforts","partnership","reviews","interactive problem-solving exercises","workplace","workshops","senior policy-makers","HEROs","desktop simulations","emerging literature","government","researchers","iterative interviews","trainees","lectures","military","METHODS","outbreak of SARS","expert technical advisory panel","study","resources","priorities","participants","experiment","OBJECTIVE","CONCLUSION","FINDINGS","weeks"],"language":"en"},

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is a standard method for quantification of gene expression studies. However, the reliability of qRT-PCR data critically depends on proper selection of reference genes. In the study, using two different analysis programs, geNorm and NormFinder, we systematically evaluated the gene expression stability of six candidate reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, B2M, RPL4, TBP, and PPIA) in samples of whole blood and PBMC with or without poly I:C stimulation. Generally, the six candidate genes performed a similar trend of expression stability in the samples of whole blood and PBMC, but more stably expressed in whole blood than in PBMC. geNorm ranked B2M and PPIA as the best combination for gene expression normalization, while according to NormFinder, TBP was ranked as the most stable reference gene, followed by B2M and PPIA. Comprehensively considering the results from the two programs, we recommended using the geometric mean of the three genes, TBP, PPIA and B2M, to normalize the gene expression of whole blood and PBMC with poly I:C stimulation. Our study is the first detailed survey of the gene expression stability in whole blood and PBMC with or without poly I:C stimulation and should be helpful for investigating the molecular mechanism involved in porcine whole blood and PBMC in response to poly I:C stimulation.","publish_time":"2014-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jiying; Wang, Yanping; Wang, Huaizhong; Hao, Xiaojing; Wu, Ying; Guo, Jianfeng","journal":"Asian-Australas J Anim Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bbfbefd19c9c471dbacabd1f57124d1ad36f24f5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4093518.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4093518/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzIxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPIA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PBMC","gene expression stability","gene expression normalization","C stimulation","gene expression of immune cells","quantification of gene expression studies","B2M","PPIA","stable reference gene","similar trend of expression stability","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","candidate genes","candidate reference genes","TBP","qRT-PCR","proper selection of reference genes","PCR data","samples","NormFinder","geNorm","study","immune response of organism","Quantitative real-time PCR","reliability of qRT","different analysis programs","ACTB","polyinosinic","GAPDH","standard method","best combination","RPL4","polycytidylic acid","detailed survey","RNA viruses","molecular mechanism","geometric mean","results"],"language":"en"},

RV-C has been associated with more severe illness. We aimed to characterize and compare the clinical presentations and disease severity of different RV type circulating in South Africa. METHOD: We performed two analyses of RV-positive specimens identified through surveillance in South Africa across all age groups. First, RV-positive specimens identified through severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) surveillance in four provinces was randomly selected from 2009 to 2010 for molecular characterization. Second, RV-positive specimens identified through SARI, influenza-like illness (ILI) and control surveillance at hospitals and outpatient clinics in during 2012\u20132013 were used to determine the association of RV type with severe disease. Selected specimens were sequenced, and phylogenetic analysis was performed. RESULTS: Among the 599 sequenced specimens from 2009 to 2010 and 2012 to 2013, RV-A (285, 48%) and RV-C (247, 41%) were more commonly identified than RV-B (67, 11%), with no seasonality and a high genetic diversity.

Components of the innate immune response may be crucial in the first days of the infection. The collectins surfactant protein (SP)-A1, -A2, and -D and mannose-binding lectin (MBL) neutralize IAV infectivity, although only SP-A2 can establish an efficient neutralization of poorly glycosylated pandemic IAV strains. METHODS: We studied the role of polymorphic variants at the genes of MBL (MBL2), SP-A1 (SFTPA1), SP-A2 (SFTPA2), and SP-D (SFTPD) in 93 patients with H1N1 pandemic 2009 (H1N1pdm) infection. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that two frequent SFTPA2 missense alleles (rs1965708-C and rs1059046-A) and the SFTPA2 haplotype 1A(0) were associated with a need for mechanical ventilation, acute respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The SFTPA2 haplotype 1A(1) was a protective variant. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression also showed that diplotypes not containing the 1A(1) haplotype were associated with a significantly shorter time to ICU admission in hospitalized patients. In addition, rs1965708-C (P = 0.0007), rs1059046-A (P = 0.0007), and haplotype 1A(0) (P = 0.0004) were associated, in a dose-dependent fashion, with lower PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, whereas haplotype 1A(1) was associated with a higher PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest an effect of genetic variants of SFTPA2 on the severity of H1N1pdm infection and could pave the way for a potential treatment with haplotype-specific (1A(1)) SP-A2 for future IAV pandemics.","publish_time":"2014-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Herrera-Ramos, Estefan\u00EDa; L\u00F3pez-Rodr\u00EDguez, Marta; Ru\u00EDz-Hern\u00E1ndez, Jos\u00E9 Juan; Horcajada, Juan Pablo; Border\u00EDas, Luis; Lerma, Elisabeth; Blanquer, Jos\u00E9; P\u00E9rez-Gonz\u00E1lez, Mar\u00EDa Carmen; Garc\u00EDa-Laorden, Mar\u00EDa Isabel; Florido, Yanira; Mas-Bosch, Virginia; Montero, Milagro; Ferrer, Jos\u00E9 Mar\u00EDa; Sorl\u00ED, Luisa; Vilaplana, Carlos; Rajas, Olga; Briones, Marisa; Aspa, Javier; L\u00F3pez-Granados, Eduardo; Sol\u00E9-Viol\u00E1n, Jordi; de Castro, Felipe Rodr\u00EDguez; Rodr\u00EDguez-Gallego, Carlos","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/70e67c792aa9148b0a13d53c7b296da253367edb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4229788.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4229788/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzMyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cox"],"organizations":["MBL","IAV","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SFTPA2 haplotype","SP-A2","SP-D","SP-A1","haplotype-specific","IAV infectivity","severity of H1N1pdm infection","effect of genetic variants of SFTPA2","frequent SFTPA2 missense alleles","glycosylated pandemic IAV strains","future IAV pandemics","rs1965708-C","FiO","rs1059046","ratio","acute respiratory failure","acute respiratory distress syndrome","genes of MBL","hospitalized patients","H1N1 pandemic","Multivariate analysis","lower PaO","higher PaO","innate immune response","Kaplan-Meier analysis","role of polymorphic variants","host immune responses influences susceptibility","outcome of Influenza","Inherited variability","efficient neutralization","mannose-binding lectin","Cox regression","ICU admission","shorter time","mechanical ventilation","virus","way","data","INTRODUCTION","need","potential treatment","SFTPD","MBL2","SFTPA1","dose-dependent fashion","collectins surfactant protein","Components","factors","addition","CONCLUSIONS","diplotypes","RESULTS","days","protective variant","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Vpu forms cation-specific ion channels in host cells, and has been proposed as a potential drug target. An understanding of the mechanism of ion transport through Vpu is desirable, but remains limited because of the unavailability of an experimental structure of the channel. Using a structure of the pentameric form of Vpu \u2013 modeled and validated based on available experimental data \u2013 umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations (cumulative simulation time of more than 0.4 \u00B5s) were employed to elucidate the energetics and the molecular mechanism of ion transport in Vpu. Free energy profiles corresponding to the permeation of Na(\u002B) and K(\u002B) were found to be similar to each other indicating lack of ion selection, consistent with previous experimental studies. The Ser23 residue is shown to enhance ion transport via two mechanisms: creating a weak binding site, and increasing the effective hydrophilic length of the channel, both of which have previously been hypothesized in experiments. A two-dimensional free energy landscape has been computed to model multiple ion permeation, based on which a mechanism for ion conduction is proposed. It is shown that only one ion can pass through the channel at a time. This, along with a stretch of hydrophobic residues in the transmembrane domain of Vpu, explains the slow kinetics of ion conduction. The results are consistent with previous conductance studies that showed Vpu to be a weakly conducting ion channel.","publish_time":"2014-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Padhi, Siladitya; Burri, Raghunadha Reddy; Jameel, Shahid; Priyakumar, U.

The identification and characterization of cellular proteins that interact with the 3\u2032UTR of HAstV-8 virus will help to uncover cellular requirements for viral functions. To this end, mobility shift assays and UV cross-linking were performed with uninfected and HAstV-8-infected cell extracts and HAstV-8 3\u2032UTR probes. Two RNA-protein complexes (CI and CII) were recruited into the 3\u2032UTR. Complex CII formation was compromised with cold homologous RNA, and seven proteins of 35, 40, 45, 50, 52, 57/60 and 75 kDa were cross-linked to the 3\u2032UTR. Supermobility shift assays indicated that PTB/hnRNP1 is part of this complex, and 3\u2032UTR-crosslinked PTB/hnRNP1 was immunoprecipitated from HAstV-8 infected cell-membrane extracts. Also, immunofluorescence analyses revealed that PTB/hnRNP1 is distributed in the nucleus and cytoplasm of uninfected cells, but it is mainly localized perinuclearly in the cytoplasm of HAstV-8 infected cells. Furthermore, the minimal 3\u2032UTR sequences recognized by recombinant PTB are those conforming helix I, and an intact PTB/hnRNP1-binding site. Finally, small interfering RNA-mediated PTB/hnRNP1 silencing reduced synthesis viral genome and virus yield in CaCo2 cells, suggesting that PTB/hnRNP1 is required for HAstV replication. In conclusion, PTB/hnRNP1 binds to the 3\u2032UTR HAstV-8 and is required or participates in viral replication.","publish_time":"2014-11-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Espinosa-Hern\u00E1ndez, Wendy; Velez-Uriza, Dora; Vald\u00E9s, Jes\u00FAs; V\u00E9lez-Del Valle, Cristina; Salas-Benito, Juan; Mart\u00EDnez-Contreras, Rebeca; Garc\u00EDa-Esp\u00EDtia, Matilde; Salas-Benito, Mariana; Vega-Almeida, Tania; De Nova-Ocampo, M\u00F3nica","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/085c71736d6b79717bb03aec375310d9e536f851.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4236132.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4236132/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzMzMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CII","PTB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["UTR of HAstV","UTR HAstV","UTR-crosslinked PTB","intact PTB","recombinant PTB","conserved PTB","cytoplasm of HAstV","HAstV replication","UTR sequences","UTR probes","hnRNP1 binding site","hnRNP1-binding site","small interfering RNA-mediated PTB","viral replication","infected cell extracts","cytoplasm of uninfected cells","CaCo2 cells","viral functions","infected cell-membrane extracts","cold homologous RNA","Supermobility shift assays","RNA-protein complexes","Complex CII formation","characterization of cellular proteins","virus yield","reduced synthesis viral genome","cellular requirements","conforming helix","UV cross-linking","end","nucleus","identification","hairpin structures","human astroviruses","immunofluorescence analyses","linker","untranslated region","conclusion","kDa"],"language":"en"},

Recombinant RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) from the human norovirus and the murine norovirus (MNV) were found to preferentially recognize RNA segments that contain the promoter and a short template sequence for subgenomic RNA synthesis. Both the promoter and template sequence contribute to stable RdRp binding, accurate initiation of the subgenomic RNAs and efficient RNA synthesis. Using a method that combines RNA crosslinking and mass spectrometry, residues near the template channel of the MNV RdRp were found to contact the hairpin RNA motif.

In the prevaccination era, HBV infections were endemic due to frequent mother to child transmission in large regions of the world. However, there are still estimated 240 million chronic HBV carriers today and ca. 620,000 patients die per year due to HBV-related liver diseases. Recommended treatment of chronic hepatitis B with interferon-\u03B1 and/or nucleos(t)ide analogues does not lead to satisfactory results. Induction of HBV-specific T cells by therapeutic vaccination or immunomodulation may be an innovative strategy to overcome virus persistence. Vaccination with commercially available HBV vaccines in patients with or without therapeutic reduction of viral load did not result in effective immune control of HBV infection, suggesting that combination of antiviral treatment with new formulations of therapeutic vaccines is needed. The woodchuck (Marmota monax) and its HBV-like woodchuck hepatitis virus are a useful preclinical animal model for developing new therapeutic approaches in chronic hepadnaviral infections. Several innovative approaches combining antiviral treatments using nucleos(t)ide analogues, with prime-boost vaccination using DNA vaccines, new hepadnaviral antigens or recombinant adenoviral vectors were tested in the woodchuck model.

A cosinor function combined with a Poisson regression was used to calculate the three seasonal parameters of diarrhoea in different provinces. Regression tree analysis was used to identify the predictors of diarrhoea seasonality. Diarrhoea cases in China showed a bimodal distribution. Diarrhoea in children \u003C5 years was more likely to peak in fall-winter seasons, while diarrhoea in persons \u003E = 5 years peaked in summer. Latitude was significantly associated with spatial pattern of diarrhoea seasonality, with peak and trough times occurring earlier at high latitudes (northern areas), and later at low latitudes (southern areas). The annual amplitudes of diarrhoea in persons \u003E = 5 years increased with latitude (r = 0.62, P\u003C0.001). Latitude 27.8\u00B0 N and 38.65\u00B0 N were the latitudinal thresholds for diarrhoea seasonality in China. Regional-specific diarrhoea control and prevention strategies may be optimal for China.

Though new methods of the two kinds have been proposed in these years, they cannot maintain a high degree of satisfaction in various circumstances. In this paper, we proposed a new conformational B-cell epitope prediction method based on antigen preprocessing and mimotopes analysis. The method classifies the antigen surface residues into \u201Cepitopes\u201D and \u201Cnonepitopes\u201D by six epitope propensity scales, removing the \u201Cnonepitopes\u201D and using the preprocessed antigen for epitope prediction based on mimotope sequences.

Here, we aimed to identify an effective, safe, and affordable antiviral agent for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) of RSV infection in children at high risk. We found that maleic anhydride (ML)-modified human serum albumin (HSA), designated ML-HSA, exhibited potent antiviral activity against RSV and that the percentages of the modified lysines and arginies in ML- are correlated with such anti-RSV activity. ML-HSA inhibited RSV entry and replication by interacting with viral G protein and blocking RSV attachment to the target cells, while ML-HAS neither bound to F protein, nor inhibited F protein-mediated membrane fusion.

Bacterial-induced host proteins such as procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and Interleukin-6, are routinely used to support diagnosis of infection. However, their performance is negatively affected by inter-patient variability, including time from symptom onset, clinical syndrome, and pathogens. Our aim was to identify novel viral-induced host proteins that can complement bacterial-induced proteins to increase diagnostic accuracy. Initially, we conducted a bioinformatic screen to identify putative circulating host immune response proteins. The resulting 600 candidates were then quantitatively screened for diagnostic potential using blood samples from 1002 prospectively recruited patients with suspected acute infectious disease and controls with no apparent infection. For each patient, three independent physicians assigned a diagnosis based on comprehensive clinical and laboratory investigation including PCR for 21 pathogens yielding 319 bacterial, 334 viral, 112 control and 98 indeterminate diagnoses; 139 patients were excluded based on predetermined criteria. The best performing host-protein was TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86 to 0.91), which was consistently up-regulated in viral infected patients. We further developed a multi-protein signature using logistic-regression on half of the patients and validated it on the remaining half. The signature with the highest precision included both viral- and bacterial-induced proteins: TRAIL, Interferon gamma-induced protein-10, and CRP (AUC of 0.94; 95% CI, 0.92 to 0.96). The signature was superior to any of the individual proteins (P\u003C0.001), as well as routinely used clinical parameters and their combinations (P\u003C0.001). It remained robust across different physiological systems, times from symptom onset, and pathogens (AUCs 0.87-1.0). The accurate differential diagnosis provided by this novel combination of viral- and bacterial-induced proteins has the potential to improve management of patients with acute infections and reduce antibiotic misuse.","publish_time":"2015-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oved, Kfir; Cohen, Asi; Boico, Olga; Navon, Roy; Friedman, Tom; Etshtein, Liat; Kriger, Or; Bamberger, Ellen; Fonar, Yura; Yacobov, Renata; Wolchinsky, Ron; Denkberg, Galit; Dotan, Yaniv; Hochberg, Amit; Reiter, Yoram; Grupper, Moti; Srugo, Isaac; Feigin, Paul; Gorfine, Malka; Chistyakov, Irina; Dagan, Ron; Klein, Adi; Potasman, Israel; Eden, Eran","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a0fe7316ddd2f7cfcaa5e7500f781357477f3d1.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d692faf09c38fc62f237f0ff9f2b3a2751ff76f7.json; document_parses/pdf_json/dd5f8cf7e557b09094248fd8fbc59fbf7f01649e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/50c5334ead9ce88189c0840243fb64fa9599bfdb.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0f9aaacbdad195c0133c25eb6dc02585ba7e1e2b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9148852f390403699eb166e03dc4147520b7ed5e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4364938.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4364938/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQ0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bacterial-induced proteins","Bacterial-induced host proteins","novel viral-induced host proteins","individual proteins","viral infections","viral infected patients","management of patients","Interferon gamma-induced protein","novel combination of viral","pathogens","multi-protein signature","putative circulating host immune response proteins","best performing host-protein","diagnosis of infection","symptom onset","TRAIL","C-reactive protein","clinical syndrome","inappropriate patient management","acute infections","clinical parameters","diagnostic potential","antibiotic misuse","CRP","inter-patient variability","accurate differential diagnosis","diagnostic accuracy","apparent infection","remaining half","suspected acute infectious disease","times","controls","TNF-related apoptosis","PCR","procalcitonin","different physiological systems","laboratory investigation","logistic-regression","ligand","bioinformatic screen","area","blood samples","independent physicians","indeterminate diagnoses","highest precision","curve","combinations","AUCs","confidence interval","candidates","performance","predetermined criteria","Interleukin","aim"],"language":"en"},

Progressive simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of nonhuman primates (NHPs) closely reproduces these comorbidities and offers a simplified system in which most of the traditional human risk factors for comorbidities (i.e., smoking, hyperlipidemia) are absent. Additionally, experimental conditions can be properly controlled during a shorter course of disease for SIV infection.

The placenta releases an immunosuppressive endogenous retroviral protein syncytin-1. We hypothesised that exposure of peripheral monocytes (PBMCs) to syncytin-1 would impair responses to H1N1pdm09 influenza. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Recombinant syncytin-1 was produced. PBMCs from non-pregnant women (n=10) were exposed to H1N1pdm09 in the presence and absence of syncytin-1 and compared to responses of PBMCs from pregnant women (n=12). PBMCs were characterised using flow cytometry, release of interferon (IFN)-\u03B1, IFN-\u03BB, IFN-\u03B3, IL-10, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-1\u03B2 were measured by cytometric bead array or ELISA. Exposure of PBMCs to H1N1pdm09 resulted in the release of IFN-\u03B1, (14,787 pg/mL, 95% CI 7311-22,264 pg/mL) IFN-\u03BB (1486 pg/mL, 95% CI 756-2216 pg/mL) and IFN-\u03B3 (852 pg/mL, 95% CI 193-1511 pg/mL) after 48 hours.

Even today, we are still mostly ignorant about why most poxvirus infections of vertebrate hosts show strict species specificity, or how zoonotic poxvirus infections occur when poxviruses occasionally leap into novel host species. Poxvirus tropism at the cellular level seems to be regulated by intracellular events downstream of virus binding and entry, rather than at the level of specific host receptors as is the case for many other viruses. This review summarizes our current understanding of poxvirus tropism and host range, and discusses the prospects of exploiting host-restricted poxvirus vectors for vaccines, gene therapy or tissue-targeted oncolytic viral therapies for the treatment of human cancers.","publish_time":"2005-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"McFadden, Grant","journal":"Nature Reviews Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/07148c1b730510d2b7306f922bb5a6f96bc54232.json; document_parses/pdf_json/cebf6e7862919c77fd59480af879cc05c411a1c0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4382915.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4382915?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQ2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["zoonotic poxvirus infections","host range","novel host species","poxvirus infections of vertebrate hosts","current understanding of poxvirus tropism","prospects of exploiting host-restricted poxvirus vectors","level of specific host receptors","variola virus","virus binding","cellular level","human population","strict species specificity","related pathogenic poxviruses","treatment of human cancers","gene therapy","tissue-targeted oncolytic viral therapies","vaccines","monkeypox","century","spread disease","considerable fear","intracellular events","case","entry","smallpox eradication","quarter","review","success"],"language":"en"},

An early and accurate diagnosis of dengue can support clinical management, surveillance and disease control and is central to achieving the World Health Organisation target of a 50% reduction in dengue case mortality by 2020. METHODS: 5729 children with fever of \u003C72hrs duration were enrolled into this multicenter prospective study in southern Vietnam between 2010-2012. A composite of gold standard diagnostic tests identified 1692 dengue cases. Using statistical methods, a novel Early Dengue Classifier (EDC) was developed that used patient age, white blood cell count and platelet count to discriminate dengue cases from non-dengue cases. RESULTS: The EDC had a sensitivity of 74.8% (95%CI: 73.0-76.8%) and specificity of 76.3% (95%CI: 75.2-77.6%) for the diagnosis of dengue. As an adjunctive test alongside NS1 rapid testing, sensitivity of the composite test was 91.6% (95%CI: 90.4-92.9%). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the early diagnosis of dengue can be enhanced beyond the current standard of care using a simple evidence-based algorithm. The results should support patient management and clinical trials of specific therapies.","publish_time":"2015-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tuan, Nguyen Minh; Nhan, Ho Thi; Chau, Nguyen Van Vinh; Hung, Nguyen Thanh; Tuan, Ha Manh; Tram, Ta Van; Ha, Nguyen Le Da; Loi, Phan; Quang, Han Khoi; Kien, Duong Thi Hue; Hubbard, Sonya; Chau, Tran Nguyen Bich; Wills, Bridget; Wolbers, Marcel; Simmons, Cameron P.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/becb2b5961d536efc8f0a0b535aeaf7e78d3d273.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4383489.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4383489/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQ2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organisation","EDC"],"locations":["Vietnam"],"keyphrases":["early diagnosis of dengue","non-dengue cases","accurate diagnosis of dengue","dengue case mortality","novel Early Dengue Classifier","clinical management","patient management","composite test","sensitivity","EDC","RESULTS","patient age","disease control","adjunctive test","statistical methods","composite of gold standard diagnostic tests","current standard of care","clinical trials of specific therapies","white blood cell count","commonest arboviral disease of humans","NS1 rapid testing","platelet","surveillance","multicenter prospective study","reduction","simple evidence-based algorithm","World Health Organisation target","hrs duration","southern Vietnam","fever","children","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","specificity"],"language":"en"},

These molecules were developed during evolution through natural selection in that they fit many important molecular targets, often receptors, of cells, which are seen in molecules that mimic endogenous neurotransmitters. The chapter discusses that microorganisms and herbivores rely on plants as a food source. Since both have survived, there must be mechanisms of adaptations toward the defensive chemistry of plants. Many herbivores have evolved strategies to avoid the extremely toxic plants and prefer the less toxic ones. Many herbivores have potent mechanisms to detoxify xenobiotics, which allow the exploitation of at least the less toxic plants. In insects, many specialists evolved that are adapted to the defense chemicals of their host plant, in that they accumulate these compounds and exploit them for their own defense. Alkaloids function as defense molecules against insect predators in the examples studied, and this is further support for the hypothesis that the same compound also serves for chemical defense in the host plant. It needs more experimental data to understand fully the intricate interconnections between plants, their alkaloids, and herbivores, microorganisms, and other plants.","publish_time":"2008-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wink, Michael","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148816/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs5OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["toxic plants","herbivores","competing plants","defense molecules","defense compounds","defensive chemistry of plants","microorganisms","chemical defense","defense chemicals","functionless molecules","Alkaloids function","host plant","toxic ones","chapter","mechanisms of adaptations","potent mechanisms","insect predators","survival","intricate interconnections","receptors","xenobiotics","products","important molecular targets","cells","examples","evidence","exploitation","strategies","experimental data","food source","hypothesis","endogenous neurotransmitters","insects","specialists","support","evolution"],"language":"en"},

Several factors have been reported to promote such emergences, including viral traffic from animals, ongoing viral genetic evolution, host factors, environmental and social changes. As an example, HIV-1 pandemic perfectly illustrates the evolutionary success of a simian retrovirus introduced into the human population as well as its dramatic impact both on the demographic and economic status of many countries. Influenza viruses remain a classic persisting model of emerging pathogens, which is supported by the coalescence of many contributing characteristics, particularly an animal reservoir consisting of birds and mammals and a segmented RNA genome prone to point mutations and reassortments. Two recent examples, the avian flu due to A/H5N1 virus and the pandemic flu due to A/H1N1 2009, show the difficulties both for predicting the outcome of flu emergences and defining the right strategy for their control.

Virus-based methods of gene therapy are likely to be most useful in applications that require a burst of high-level expression in many of the patient\u0027s cells, such as in cancer therapy. Liposomal methods of gene therapy are flexible in that all the components of the system are controlled by designers. As these systems have become more sophisticated, they have begun to take on several characteristics of the viruses that they are intended to replace.

Lysosomes contain hydrolytic enzymes that degrade proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids derived from intracellular (through autophagy) and extracellular (through heterophagy) sources. Lysosomal degradation regulates several physiological cell functions. These include turnover of cellular organelles and extracellular constituents; amino acid and glucose homeostasis; processing of proteins; lipid metabolism; cell growth, differentiation, and involution; host defenses against microorganisms and other pathogens; and removal of necrotic and foreign material from the circulation and from tissues. Lysosomal degradation also plays an important role in the pathophysiology of acute and chronic cell injury, inflammation and repair, and tumor growth and metastasis. The participation of the lysosomes in the specific types of cell injury we have discussed is due to altered regulation of one or more of the following processes: turnover of cellular organelles by autophagic degradation; levels and activities of lysosomal hydrolases; levels of intracellular and extracellular lysosomal hydrolase inhibitors; transport of degradation products from the lysosomal matrix to the cytosol; permeability of the lysosomal membrane to hydrolases; lysosomal vacuolar acidification; transport of degradable substrates and of pathogens to the lysosomes; transport and processing of secretory proteins and lysosomal hydrolases during biogenesis; traffic and fusion of lysosomal vacuoles and vesicles; secretion of lysosomal hydrolases; and accumulation of metals, particularly iron, acidotropic agents, and undegraded and/or undegradable materials in lysosomes.","publish_time":"2007-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marzella, Louis; Lee, Hsiang-Kuang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/26894a35e35c6364d845f1bcb37eef5c6b606927.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149001/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Lysosomal degradation","lysosomal membrane","lysosomal matrix","secretion of lysosomal hydrolases","activities of lysosomal hydrolases","Lysosomes","fusion of lysosomal vacuoles","lysosomal vacuolar acidification","extracellular lysosomal hydrolase inhibitors","cell growth","transport of degradation products","processing of proteins","levels of intracellular","autophagic degradation","chronic cell injury","extracellular constituents","processing of secretory proteins","turnover of cellular organelles","pathogens","specific types of cell injury","physiological cell functions","transport of degradable substrates","acidic intracellular vacuoles of heterogeneous shape","tumor growth","amino acid","differentiation","glucose homeostasis","repair","inflammation","biogenesis","pathophysiology of acute","lipid metabolism","lipids","involution","permeability","vesicles","traffic","accumulation of metals","iron","removal of necrotic","microorganisms","host defenses","size","important role","cytosol","foreign material","nucleic acids","circulation","acidotropic agents","carbohydrates","following processes","autophagy","hydrolytic enzymes"],"language":"en"},

The structures of carborane fluorinated polyesters (CFPETs) and polyurethanes (CFPUs) were characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. The thermal stability, mechanical properties, Shore A hardness, solvent resistance and acid-alkali resistance of the carborane fluorinated polyurethane films were also studied. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) tests manifested that the introduction of carborane groups into the main chain of fluorinated polyurethane endowed the obtained fluorinated polyurethane with excellent thermal stability. The thermal decomposition temperature of carborane fluorinated polyurethane (CFPU) increased by 190 \u00B0C compared with that of the carborane-free fluorinated polyurethane (FPU). Even at 800 \u00B0C, CFPU showed the char yield of 66.5%, which was higher than that of FPU (34.3%). The carborane-containing fluorinated polyurethanes also showed excellent chemical resistance and prominent mechanical property even after the cured films being immersed into Jet aircraft oil or 37% HCl for 168 h or at high temperature (700 \u00B0C). It is found that the structural characteristics of carborane group and the compacted structure of CFPU effectively improve the thermal stability, mechanical property, solvent resistance and acid-alkali resistance of the carborane-free fluorinated polyurethane. These excellent properties make CFPU as the useful raw materials to prepare the high temperature resistant coatings or adhesives for automotive engines, engine or fuel tank of aircraft and other equipment working in high-temperature or high concentrations of acid-alkali environments.","publish_time":"2017-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Ning; Zeng, Fang-Lei; Wang, Yu; Qu, De-Zhi; Zhang, Chun; Li, Juan; Huo, Jin-Zhao; Bai, Yong-Ping","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5741ca81f942200cfed3a0281f1311c221c16d58.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149015/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGA","CFPU","FPU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["carborane-free fluorinated polyurethane","fluorinated polyurethanes","thermal decomposition temperature of carborane fluorinated polyurethane","structures of carborane fluorinated polyesters","obtained fluorinated polyurethane","main chain of fluorinated polyurethane","introduction of carborane groups","high-temperature","polyurethane films","acid-alkali resistance","solvent resistance","excellent thermal stability","structural characteristics of carborane group","excellent chemical resistance","room temperature","high temperature resistant coatings","high concentrations of acid","mechanical properties","excellent properties","prominent mechanical property","CFPETs","alkali environments","compacted structure of CFPU","HDI trimer","cured films","main chains","fuel tank of aircraft","Jet aircraft oil","reaction of hexamethylene diisocyanate trimer","automotive engines","spectroscopy","adhesives","nuclear magnetic resonance","Fourier","FTIR","useful raw materials","hydroxyl","GPC","NMR","infrared","tests","HCl","equipment","hardness","gel permeation chromatography","TGA","measurements","CFPUs","Thermogravimetric analysis","char yield","study"],"language":"en"},

As these allergens presented considerable effects against biofilm-related infections, CV-B2-5, and several cell lines, they might be employed as alternative/complementary treatments after further preclinical and clinical studies.","publish_time":"2019-12-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Taghizadeh, Seyedeh Faezeh; Rezaee, Ramin; Mehmandoust, Masoumeh; Badibostan, Hasan; Karimi, Gholamreza","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/726ca4edadd468bd39dbd592cbd87a0306b01f7b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149036/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Pis"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S globulin","S albumin","human glioblastoma","human prostate cell lines","\u00B5g","Human ovarian carcinoma","human colon carcinoma","CV-B2","CV-B4","human breast adenocarcinoma","biological activity of Pis","allergens of pistachio","minimum bactericidal concentration","minimum inhibitory concentration","cytotoxicity assay","lowest IC","A2780","biofilm-related infections","HTC","cytotoxic activities","Coxsackie viruses","considerable effects","B3","complementary treatments","highest antimicrobial effect","MBC","B5","MCF","PC3","clinical studies","Gram-negative bacteria","findings","loteus","fungi","values","Results"],"language":"en"},

As our world becomes increasingly connected, emerging diseases pose a greater threat, requiring coordination at local, regional, and global levels. One Health is a multisectoral, transdisciplinary, and collaborative approach promoted to more effectively address these complex health threats. Despite strong advocacy for One Health, challenges for practical implementation remain. Here we discuss the value of the One Health approach for addressing global health challenges. We also share strategies applied to achieve successful outcomes through the USAID Emerging Pandemic Threats Program PREDICT project, which serve as useful case studies for implementing One Health approaches. Lastly, we explore methods for promoting more formal One Health implementation to capitalize on the added value of shared knowledge and leveraged resources.","publish_time":"2020-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kelly, Terra R.; Machalaba, Catherine; Karesh, William B.; Crook, Paulina Zielinska; Gilardi, Kirsten; Nziza, Julius; Uhart, Marcela M.; Robles, Erika Alandia; Saylors, Karen; Joly, Damien O.; Monagin, Corina; Mangombo, Prime Mulembakani; Kingebeni, Placide Mbala; Kazwala, Rudovick; Wolking, David; Smith, Woutrina; Mazet, Jonna A.

Instead of fitting comfortably in the latter\u2019s capacious tent, animal studies has chafed at environmentalists\u2019 commitment to holistic communitarianism best represented by Aldo Leopold\u2019s \u201Cland ethic.\u201D The land ethic approaches the biotic community as a pyramidal ecological system that turns on the relations between producers and consumers and between predators and prey rather than as an egalitarian moral community. Animal rights activists have thus repeatedly clashed with conservationists in an internecine fight poignantly dramatized in T.C. Boyle\u2019s novel When the Killing\u2019s Done (2011). In this paper, I argue that environmental justice cannot be secured solely from the third-person perspective of the deontological argument underlying animal rights or the utilitarian argument often used to justify the land ethic. Instead, we might draw on the pragmatist traditions East and West and view justice as a larger loyalty achieved as much by the moral imagination of the particular from the first- and second-person perspectives as by rational deliberation on the universal.

METHODS: Patients aged 6 to 11 years were included in a randomised controlled study with two parallel groups. Both groups received standard treatment including Weber\u2019s douche and symptomatic medicine on therapeutic grounds. Isotonic sea salt solution was applied four times daily for 10 days. The intervention group received Sinupret\u00AE syrup three times daily as add-on therapy. Using a five-point scale (0\u20134 points) the physicians evaluated the following symptomatic parameters within four successive visits (Day 0, 5, 7, and 10): nasal congestion, nasal discharge, post-nasal drip, headache, and facial pain. Using a 11 -point scale (0\u201310 points), each patient gave a daily self-assessment of the following parameters from Day 1 to Day 10: rhinorrhoea, headache, and facial pain. RESULTS: In total, 184 patients (mean age 8.1 years) were included. In accordance with physicians\u2019 assessment compared to saline irrigation alone, significant improvements were detected in three out of five symptomatic parameters under combined treatment including Sinupret\u00AE syrup as assessed by the physicians. The between-group differences in the severity of facial pain and headache were insignificant. The Sinupret\u00AE group also showed a trend to an antibiotic-sparing effect (2.17% in the Sinupret\u00AE group vs. 5.26% in the control group). Further, the frequency of the transition of viral rhinosinusitis to the post-viral phase tended to decrease (1.08% in the Sinupret\u00AE group vs. 5.26% in the control group). No adverse reactions to the herbal medicine occurred during the study period. CONCLUSION: The complex herbal medicine Sinupret\u00AE syrup alleviates effectively the symptoms of acute viral rhinosinusitis in children.

The concept and ideas of ANT offer a meaningful approach to addressing the hybridity and heterogeneity of complex assemblages of risk. Furthermore, the theory provides a theoretical vocabulary to analyse settings of risk and disasters. Especially for ex post analysis of disasters, ANT is able to identify errors in process chains and management practice. In this regard, it deals with questions of stability/instability in management and organisations within the broader context of risk governance. The article discusses the following questions from an ANT perspective: What is \u2018risk\u2019 and how can it be managed? What are the general implications and benefits of an ANT approach to disaster risk management? In what ways does an ANT approach challenge some of the conventional wisdoms in the field of disaster risk management?

Since the turn of the century, China has been a source of numerous infectious disease outbreaks. It is also the origin of the MCR-1 gene, which confers resistance to colistin, a \u201Clast-line\u201D antibiotic deployed against multidrug-resistant infections. With the largest population in the world, coupled with its status as a major supplier of agricultural produce, evaluating Chinese responses to AMR is critical to understanding the efficacy of the global response. Drawing on knowledge of both Chinese politics and health security, this article analyzes how Chinese actors have responded to the threat in the public and animal health sectors as well as the domestic and international implications of these responses. Based on interviews with key Chinese and international officials, scientists, and public health specialists, as well as farmers and consumers, we argue that the securitization of AMR in China is currently more concerned with domestic policy and resource competition than with addressing the existential health threat. Without a greater alignment of AMR strategies within China, macrosecuritizing efforts to address the threat globally cannot succeed.","publish_time":"2019-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thomas, Nicholas; Lo, Catherine Yuk-ping","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27cd455508e3ebf996aa5f067020924398f18607.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149462.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149462/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjszMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AMR"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["existential health threat","China","Chinese responses","existential threat","key Chinese","Chinese politics","securitization of AMR","health security","Chinese actors","public health specialists","international officials","animal health sectors","international organizations","international implications","macrosecuritizing response","global response","greater alignment of AMR strategies","domestic policy","macrosecuritizing efforts","global spread of antimicrobial resistance","scientists","resource competition","major supplier of agricultural produce","article","source of numerous infectious disease outbreaks","antibiotic","status","gene","interviews","states","efficacy","multidrug-resistant infections","world","line","colistin","century","farmers","knowledge","largest population","origin","MCR","consumers","turn","humanity"],"language":"en"},

It is an inherently multidisciplinary challenge with each approach giving wildly varying and often irreconcilable definitions. The given definitions of life are numerous with over 300 definitions published in books and journals. The unique characteristics of the mimivirus, discovered in 2003, and later giant viruses, rekindled the discussion in defining life, indicating other complications in a definition.","publish_time":"2018-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Love, Luca Gregory","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e71f1a5b5e51a5b7917c00209cacbd66c4d4d2f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149470.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149470/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjszMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Aristotle"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["definition of life","given definitions of life","irreconcilable definitions","synthetic biology","divided biologists","exobiology","attempts","unintended implications","Emerging fields","study of living organisms\u2019","approach","strong counterexamples","Proffitt","philosophers","discussion","Aristotle","practical purposes","unique characteristics","mimivirus","multidisciplinary challenge","giant viruses","question","challenges","books","journals","consensus","Bedau","complications"],"language":"en"},

He played a key role in developing vaccines for Asian flu in 1957 and Hong Kong flu in 1968. Over six decades, most of which were spent at Merck \u0026 Company, his leadership and innovations blazed new trails in virology, epidemiology, immunology, cancer research, and vaccine development that were unmatched. His work resulted in current vaccines used for the prevention of measles, mumps, hepatitis A and B, chickenpox, meningitis, and pneumonia, which have saved millions of lives across the globe. The need for close cooperation between public and private agencies, including donors, to promote research in vaccinology is reemphasized by recent global health crises such as the Ebola and Zika viruses, as well as the annual influenza virus threats. Eradication of many diseases is feasible, but requires political support for resources, vaccine development and harmonization of vaccination policies, to be achievable. Hilleman worked with many collaborators in academic centers, in industrial management, with which he led his research and development team to produce world-changing achievements.","publish_time":"2018-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tulchinsky, Theodore H.","journal":"Case Studies in Public Health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150172.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7150172/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs0ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Maurice Ralph Hilleman","Hilleman"],"organizations":["Merck \u0026 Company"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["vaccine development","development team","cancer research","Asian flu","developing vaccines","current vaccines","Hong Kong flu","Maurice Ralph Hilleman","virology","epidemiology","immunology","new trails","political support","leadership","Ebola","hepatitis","close cooperation","innovations","private agencies","recent global health crises","vaccinology","donors","harmonization of vaccination policies","resources","academic centers","prevention of measles","key role","chickenpox","mumps","collaborators","world","industrial management","annual influenza virus threats","greatest microbiologists","vaccinologists","time","pneumonia","meningitis","Company","Zika viruses","diseases","need","millions of lives"],"language":"en"},

Many virus diseases, both of humans and animals, have been successfully controlled by vaccines. These successes have naturally led to improvements in the spectrum and duration of protection offered by vaccines until, at present it is difficult to see how antiviral drugs could compete with vaccines in the control of many virus diseases. One may cite smallpox, yellow fever, polio, and recently measles among human diseases, Newcastle disease, Marek\u0027s disease, and infectious bronchitis among poultry diseases\u2014an area of veterinary disease control where vaccines have been particularly important. Research into the treatment of virus diseases by drugs is at present directed toward three general areas: (1) attempts to stimulate the defense mechanism of the host animal, (2) large screening programs to find drugs which directly block some virus-specific process, and (3) alleviation of the symptoms of the disease. The treatment of the symptoms, rather than the cause of a disease, has been the mainstay of medical practice from time immemorial, and this is still the case with most virus disease. The short incubation period of many virus diseases will inevitably restrict the therapeutic use of antiviral drugs and in cases where symptoms have already appeared.","publish_time":"2008-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bucknall, R.A.","journal":"Adv Pharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75bdc9bf614eeefbad41fd687001b7773c7a4b9b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172480/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs1MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Marek"],"organizations":["Newcastle"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of virus diseases","vaccines","human diseases","poultry diseases","Marek\u0027s disease","Newcastle disease","symptoms","virus-specific process","area of veterinary disease control","therapeutic use of antiviral drugs","present","measles","infectious bronchitis","polio","host animal","mainstay of medical practice","time immemorial","large screening programs","continuing search","short incubation period","cases","yellow fever","duration of protection","improvements","spectrum","defense mechanism","smallpox","chapter","alleviation","humans","Research","general areas","animals","cause","successes"],"language":"en"},

Since athletes are expected to return to training as soon as possible, the knowledge of these diseases, their clinical presentation, possible complications, transmission mechanisms, and prevention should be among the main concerns of sports medicine. Infectious diseases can be prolonged or aggravated by continuing physical activity and athletes also risk having other acute or chronic organ manifestations such as bronchitis or pneumonia, myocarditis, pericarditis, and other secondary complications, for this reason exercise should not be allowed during convalescence and recovery. In the case of elite athletes, the return-to-play decision is particularly important and consensus between scientific evidence and clinical experience is necessary. Although infectious diseases are highly prevalent in athletes, there is a scarcity of literature focused on evidence and guidelines for sports physicians regarding RTP decision.

Severe infections are more common among premature infants, those with cardiac and pulmonary anomalies, and the immunosupressed. Effective prophylactic monoclonal antibody treatment is available for high-risk infants, but there is no effective vaccine. Mouse challenge models have been used for the study of the human RSV pathogen, but the most severe forms of RSV disease are not replicated by this approach. Pneumonia virus of mice (PVM; family Paramyxoviridae, genus Pneumovirus) is a mouse pathogen of the same family as human respiratory syncytial virus. PVM replicates efficiently in mouse-lung epithelial cells in vivo in response to a minimal virus inoculum, and replication is accompanied by local production of proinflammatory cytokines (MIP-1\u03B1, MIP-2, MCP-1, and IFN-\u03B3) and granulocyte recruitment to the lung. PVM infection and the ensuing inflammatory response can lead to pulmonary edema and respiratory compromise. Our laboratories have pioneered the use of the PVM model for the study of human clinical disease, which has provided important insights into the role of the inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of severe respiratory virus infection. As part of this work, we have presented several immunomodulatory strategies that clearly reduce morbidity and mortality when administered to PVM infected, symptomatic mice, and thus hold promise as realistic therapeutic strategies for severe RSV infection in human subjects.","publish_time":"2010-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rosenberg, Helene F.; Domachowske, Joseph B.","journal":"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad585ad5aae6620b76e193bafddce2b36ec623c0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7176177.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176177/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs3NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","PVM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PVM infection","human respiratory syncytial virus","severe RSV infection","human RSV pathogen","pathogenesis of severe respiratory virus infection","important respiratory pathogen","Severe infections","PVM model","PVM infected","PVM replicates","mouse pathogen","respiratory compromise","severe forms of RSV disease","Pneumonia virus of mice","human subjects","minimal virus inoculum","study of human clinical disease","ensuing inflammatory response","high-risk infants","premature infants","MIP","mouse-lung epithelial cells","Mouse challenge models","family Paramyxoviridae","pulmonary edema","pulmonary anomalies","infections prevalent","important insights","immunomodulatory strategies","symptomatic mice","effective vaccine","realistic therapeutic strategies","Effective prophylactic monoclonal antibody treatment","genus Pneumovirus","toddlers","local production of proinflammatory cytokines","replication","granulocyte recruitment","morbidity","mortality","role","IFN-\u03B3","MCP","age group","work","laboratories","approach"],"language":"en"},

The child with septic shock may have simultaneous derangements in the function of virtually every system of the body including: cardiovascular, respiratory, immune, renal, coagulation, hepatic, metabolic and neurologic. The degree to which physiologic alterations are manifest in a given patient is variable and influenced by multiple host and non-host factors including: the developmental stage, the presence of co-morbidities, pathogen-related factors, and genetic influences on both the host inflammatory response as well as the response to pharmacologic agents, all combining to have a profound influence on outcome. The clinician must possess a systematic and multifaceted approach to these critically ill patients. The goal of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive description of the epidemiology, biology and pathophysiology (at both the cellular and organ level) of sepsis, as well as outlining the current principles of managing septic shock.

In the present study, the inhibitory effect of EGCg on bovine coronavirus (BCV) propagation in Madin\u2010Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells was investigated. EGCg at concentrations of less than 10 \u00B5g/mL did not show any cytotoxicity to MDBK cells. BCV propagation was significantly inhibited by pretreatment of the virus with EGCg (0.5\u201310 \u00B5g/mL) before virus inoculation in dose\u2010dependent, incubation time\u2010dependent and temperature\u2010dependent manners. The antiviral effect of pretreating MDBK cells with EGCg on BCV propagation was much weaker than that of pretreating BCV with EGCg. The hemagglutination activity of BCV was also reduced by EGCg in a dose\u2010dependent manner. These results demonstrate that EGCg possesses a distinct anti\u2010BCV activity and strongly suggest that EGCg interferes with the adsorption of BCV to MDBK cells by the interaction of EGCg with BCV particles. EGCg may therefore be a useful candidate for controlling BCV infection more effectively.","publish_time":"2005-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"MATSUMOTO, Mitsuyo; MUKAI, Takao; FURUKAWA, Satoru; OHORI, Hitoshi","journal":"Anim Sci J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37dc8003e75c33ca7baa9f5ef979591f580566b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7187767.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7187767/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs5ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDBK","BCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["interaction of EGCg","BCV propagation","pretreating BCV","adsorption of BCV","BCV infection","BCV particles","inhibitory effect of EGCg","hemagglutination activity of BCV","distinct anti\u2010BCV activity","antiviral effect of pretreating MDBK cells","dependent manners","dose","\u00B5g","anti\u2010oxidative activities","bovine coronavirus","biological activities","virus inoculation","Darby bovine kidney","Madin","incubation time","main active component of tea polyphenol","temperature","useful candidate","pretreatment","present study","Epigallocatechin gallate","results","concentrations","cytotoxicity"],"language":"en"},

Data on the inactivation of enveloped viruses by S/D treatment collected from seven Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association member companies demonstrate the robustness, reliability, and efficacy of this virus inactivation method. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The results from 308 studies reflecting production conditions as well as technical variables significantly beyond the product release specification were evaluated for virus inactivation, comprising different combinations of solvent and detergent (tri(n\u2010butyl) phosphate [TNBP]/Tween 80, TNBP/Triton X\u2010100, TNBP/Na\u2010cholate) and different products (Factor [F]VIII, F IX, and intravenous and intramuscular immunoglobulins). RESULTS: Neither product class, process temperature, protein concentration, nor pH value has a significant impact on virus inactivation. A variable that did appear to be critical was the concentration of solvent and detergent. CONCLUSION: The data presented here demonstrate the robustness of virus inactivation by S/D treatment for a broad spectrum of enveloped test viruses and process variables. Our data substantiate the fact that no transmission of viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, or of other enveloped viruses was reported for licensed plasma derivatives since the introduction of S/D treatment.","publish_time":"2009-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dichtelm\u00FCller, Herbert O.; Biesert, Lothar; Fabbrizzi, Fabrizio; Gajardo, Rodrigo; Gr\u00F6ner, Albrecht; von Hoegen, Ilka; Jorquera, Juan I.; Kempf, Christoph; Kreil, Thomas R.; Pifat, Dominique; Osheroff, Wendy; Poelsler, Gerhard","journal":"Transfusion","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7590f2f9c49cd344821b62e2c1472dd23537c35e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7187780.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7187780/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs5ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association","TNBP/Triton"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["robustness of virus inactivation","virus inactivation method","inactivation of enveloped viruses","D treatment","established virus inactivation technology","hepatitis B virus","hepatitis C virus","human immunodeficiency virus","TNBP","detergent","Data","human plasma","transmission of viruses","introduction of S","concentration of solvent","broad spectrum of enveloped test viruses","protein concentration","process variables","different combinations of solvent","different products","results","licensed plasma derivatives","Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association member companies","process temperature","product class","technical variables","product release specification","manufacture of medicinal products","pH value","phosphate","production conditions","Tween","butyl","cholate","reliability","Factor","significant impact","efficacy","Triton X","METHODS","studies","STUDY DESIGN","BACKGROUND","intramuscular immunoglobulins","years","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Two main larval types (Groups 1 and 2) are recognised, as are distinct morphotypes within each group. Although both groups are assignable to the Nemognathinae, they are characterised by traits not paralleled by subfamily representatives from other regions of the world. Group 1, which includes Palaestra, is the more distinctive, whereas Group 2 shares most characteristics with members of the cosmopolitan tribe Nemognathini.

They may be regional, organized around a common issue or function, or global. International financial institutions (IFIs) are international banks composed of sovereign member states that use public money from the Member States to provide technical and financial support for developing countries. The United Nations is the organization most involved in the mitigation of, preparedness for, response to, and recovery from disasters around the world. It is considered the best equipped to do so because of its strong relationships with most countries, especially the developing countries where assistance is most needed. When disasters strike, the UN is one of the first organizations to mobilize, and it remains in the affected countries during the recovery period for many years after. The Consolidated Appeal Process is one way the UN garners international support for relief and reconstruction.

Such an approach is essential because human, animal, and ecosystem health are inextricably linked; therefore, with this One Health approach, we are called to work together to promote, improve, and defend the health and well-being of all by enhancing cooperation and collaboration between physicians, veterinarians social scientists, economists, psychologists, legal professionals, philosophers, and other scientific health and environmental professionals. As such, the One Health movement and approach is a growing vision in global health and is gaining increasing recognition by national and international institutions, organizations, stakeholders, NGOs, and health policymakers. Likewise, the role of world-class universities is pivotal in discovering One Health scientific knowledge and translating them to policy and evidence-based practices. Universities have responsibilities to train future professionals capable of solving global health issues through interdisciplinary scientific knowledge, integrative approaches to teaching, research collaboration, community linkages, and leadership.

Methods: Ethical analysis is carried out by examining arguments that can be made in favor or against such a mandatory measure and by seeking a reasonably balanced position between them. Arguments under consideration are based on the duties of health professionals and public health authorities, the consequences of their actions and on other ethical principles. The importance of relevant empirical data is stressed without any attempt to review or analyze them systematically. Results: Mandatory vaccination of some health care professionals during a serious pandemic of influenza can be justified, but only under certain limited conditions. Conclusions: In the throes of an influenza pandemic, health care professionals (and to a variable degree, other health care workers) have an ethical obligation to accept influenza vaccination if it is reasonably safe and effective. The ethical responsibility of public health authorities is to limit the impact of a pandemic on the population by all reasonable means, which clearly includes the appropriate use of vaccine. Consequently, the vaccination of health care staff can be made mandatory under certain conditions. However, a critical objection to this conclusion, which upholds that a voluntary vaccination program (an ethically much less problematic intervention) is just as effective, needs to be addressed.","publish_time":"2006-11-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kotalik, Jaro","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5121f0ce31fd533f6e1026c7c19c980efeee204.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162258.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162258/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs3NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health care professionals","health care workers","vaccination of health care staff","duties of health professionals","influenza vaccination","ethical responsibility of public health authorities","influenza pandemic","mandatory vaccination program","serious pandemic of influenza","voluntary vaccination program","mandatory measure","ethical obligation","Ethical analysis","ethical principles","certain conditions","arguments","certain limited conditions","reasonably balanced position","variable degree","population","actions","consequences","impact","throes","importance of relevant empirical data","reasonable means","favor","Results","problematic intervention","appropriate use of vaccine","critical objection","attempt","consideration","Methods","Conclusions","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

In particular, the author considers how the borders between nations, species, and individuals are thrown into relief and called into question by influenza outbreaks and their management. Methodology/approach \u2013 This work relies on literature review, media research, and critical and interpretative sociological methods. Findings \u2013 While panic surrounding new and potentially highly virulent influenza strains is reasonable, such panic is not sustainable and belies the fact that every year presents the danger of a pandemic. This chapter argues that, if public health systems only respond to immediate panic and fail to consider how quickly airborne diseases can cross all sorts of borders, they do not attend to the real need for far-seeing, long-term, internationally collaborative disease prevention and disaster preparedness. Contribution to the field \u2013 The author offers a critical and wellness- and prevention-oriented perspective on what priorities should be emphasized in the rapidly growing fields of disaster studies and disaster preparedness, which, by their nature, tend to be crisis oriented and focused on the micro-term, with planning done on a case-by-case basis. Such a narrow focus can render preventative health systems inflexible and unable to rise to the challenge of a disease that can spread easily through casual contact.","publish_time":"2010-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mukherjea, Ananya","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162265.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162265/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs3Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disaster preparedness","preventative health systems inflexible","robust preventative public health systems","avian influenza","influenza outbreaks","author","H1N1 pandemic","chapter","immediate panic","virulent influenza strains","collaborative disease prevention","history of pandemic influenzas","prevention-oriented perspective","continuing need","real need","growing fields of disaster studies","sorts of borders","case basis","media research","work","literature review","social politics of H5N1","wellness","narrow focus","interpretative sociological methods","question","context","nations","fact","individuals","approach","planning","species","year","danger","response","relief","management","priorities","micro-term","airborne diseases","crisis","Methodology","Findings","Contribution","nature","Purpose","challenge","casual contact"],"language":"en"},

In particular, the author considers how the borders between nations, species, and individuals are thrown into relief and called into question by influenza outbreaks and their management. Methodology/approach \u2013 This work relies on literature review, media research, and critical and interpretative sociological methods. Findings \u2013 While panic surrounding new and potentially highly virulent influenza strains is reasonable, such panic is not sustainable and belies the fact that every year presents the danger of a pandemic. This chapter argues that, if public health systems only respond to immediate panic and fail to consider how quickly airborne diseases can cross all sorts of borders, they do not attend to the real need for far-seeing, long-term, internationally collaborative disease prevention and disaster preparedness. Contribution to the field \u2013 The author offers a critical and wellness- and prevention-oriented perspective on what priorities should be emphasized in the rapidly growing fields of disaster studies and disaster preparedness, which, by their nature, tend to be crisis oriented and focused on the micro-term, with planning done on a case-by-case basis. Such a narrow focus can render preventative health systems inflexible and unable to rise to the challenge of a disease that can spread easily through casual contact.","publish_time":"2010-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mukherjea, Ananya","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5a1ade00071a102f8ae6a6dd575e4b551096651.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162422.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162422/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs4MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disaster preparedness","preventative health systems inflexible","robust preventative public health systems","avian influenza","influenza outbreaks","author","H1N1 pandemic","chapter","immediate panic","virulent influenza strains","collaborative disease prevention","history of pandemic influenzas","prevention-oriented perspective","continuing need","real need","growing fields of disaster studies","sorts of borders","case basis","media research","work","literature review","social politics of H5N1","wellness","narrow focus","interpretative sociological methods","question","context","nations","fact","individuals","approach","planning","species","year","danger","response","relief","management","priorities","micro-term","airborne diseases","crisis","Methodology","Findings","Contribution","nature","Purpose","challenge","casual contact"],"language":"en"},

Four sites were on infertile and four on fertile soil. Each of the 355 species was classified according to seed mass (measured as fresh mass of embryo plus endosperm), morphological adaptations for dispersal by different vectors, and growth form. The infertile\u2014soil sites had more species and more cover adapted for dispersal by ants, and the fertile\u2014soil sites had more species and more cover with fleshy fruits adapted for dispersal by vertebrates. We tested the hypothesis that this difference could be interpreted as a secondary correlate of seed size or of growth form. Species with smaller seed mass of growing to \u003C2 m tall were significantly more likely to be adapted for dispersal by ants relative to vertebrates. An indirect association via growth form was capable of accounting for up to 84% of the relationship between soil type and dispersal mode, and indirect association via seed mass for up to 23% of the relationship; the two together could account for a maximum of 85%. The indirect association association via seed mass relatively weaker because seed masses proved not to be very different between these soil types. There remained a significant residual tendency for species in any given seed size class and growth form to be more likely to be dispersed by vertebrates relative to ants on fertile soils than on infertile soils.","publish_time":"1990-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Westoby, Mark; Rice, Barbara; Howell, Jocelyn","journal":"Ecology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b505823cb32882b6279fd19168a605d1713ac32e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163505/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs4Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Sydney","Australia"],"keyphrases":["soil sites","smaller seed mass","seed masses","growth form","indirect association association","dispersal mode","soil types","given seed size class","secondary correlate of seed size","vascular plant species","ants relative","vertebrates relative","infertile soils","fresh mass of embryo","cover","relationship","different vectors","morphological adaptations","endosperm","fleshy fruits","significant residual tendency","capable of accounting","difference","Sydney","Australia","hypothesis","maximum"],"language":"en"},

The ease of exploitation is commonly dictated by favourable geological setting, ore grade, tonnage, existing processing technology, costs and attendant environmental concerns including local people. These aspects need to be assessed properly before commencing exploitation. Apart from strengthening downstream sector, upstream sector also need to be developed for identifying and quantifying additional natural resources to sustain \u201CRare Earth Industry Chain\u201D. This endeavour may also involve innovative groups at the interface of information technology and the minerals, metals and materials engineering domains (cf. Pradip et al. 2019). Assessment of effective recovery of REE and associated metals from industrial wastes and mine dumps, comprising \u2018Technospheric mining\u2019, should continue to receive focussed attention. The indigenous manufacturing of intermediate products need to be augmented with matching progressive growth of technological advancements. Industrially speaking, promotion of the \u201CRare Earth Industry\u201D should be an integral part of the present programme of \u201CMake in India\u201D (Singh 2019). In this regard, a beginning can be made by the AMD-IREL-BARC-NFC-DMRL-ARCI combine. To achieve this goal, several of the industrial partners like Aluminium extraction, Thermal Power Plants, Fertiliser Plants, different Mining Agencies and Steel Plants can also be involved as partners. Also, India can promote its ties with countries, as has been established now with Japan for improving its domain knowledge and new technologies for both upstream and downstream processes of the \u201CIndian Rare Earth Industry\u201D.

Tracing virus origin and predicting the most likely host species for future spillover events are major objectives in One Health disciplines. We assessed patterns of virus sharing among a large diversity of mammals, including humans and domestic species. LOCATION: Global. TIME PERIOD: Current. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: Mammals and associated viruses. METHODS: We used network centrality analysis and trait\u2010based Bayesian hierarchical models to explore patterns of virus sharing among mammals. We analysed a global database that compiled the associations between 1,785 virus species and 725 mammalian host species as sourced from automatic screening of meta\u2010data accompanying published nucleotide sequences between 1950 and 2019. RESULTS: We show that based on current evidence, domesticated mammals hold the most central positions in networks of known mammal\u2013virus associations. Among entire host\u2013virus networks, Carnivora and Chiroptera hold central positions for mainly sharing RNA viruses, whereas ungulates hold central positions for sharing both RNA and DNA viruses with other host species. We revealed strong evidence that DNA viruses were phylogenetically more host specific than RNA viruses. RNA viruses exhibited low functional host specificity despite an overall tendency to infect phylogenetically related species, signifying high potential to shift across hosts with different ecological niches. The frequencies of sharing viruses among hosts and the proportion of zoonotic viruses in hosts were larger for RNA than for DNA viruses. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Acknowledging the role of domestic species in addition to host and virus traits in patterns of virus sharing is necessary to improve our understanding of virus spread and spillover in times of global change. Understanding multi\u2010host virus\u2010sharing pathways adds focus to curtail disease spread.","publish_time":"2019-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wells, Konstans; Morand, Serge; Wardeh, Maya; Baylis, Matthew","journal":"Glob Ecol Biogeogr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1e4cb699455fc9e217e7450d2427ad777560e53.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165700.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165700/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs5Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus species","RNA viruses","patterns of virus sharing","multi\u2010host virus","virus networks","virus associations","DNA viruses","understanding of virus","frequencies of sharing viruses","virus traits","likely host species","mammalian host species","associated viruses","entire host","related species","Tracing virus origin","proportion of zoonotic viruses","role of domestic species","central positions","hosts","domesticated mammals","low functional host specificity","large diversity of mammals","pathogen spillover","humans","current evidence","global database","future spillover events","times of global change","major objectives","MAJOR TAXA","Health disciplines","strong evidence","disease spread","networks of known mammal","substantial health threat","based Bayesian hierarchical models","Carnivora","automatic screening of meta\u2010data","overall tendency","network centrality analysis","pathways","addition","Emerging infectious diseases","published nucleotide sequences","focus","Chiroptera","high potential","ungulates","different ecological niches","AIM","METHODS","MAIN CONCLUSIONS","TIME PERIOD","LOCATION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The radiomics, which explores huge amounts of features from medical image for disease diagnosis, may help the screen of the COVID-19. In this study, we aim to develop a radiomic signature to screen COVID-19 from CT images. We retrospectively collect 75 pneumonia patients from Beijing Youan Hospital, including 46 patients with COVID-19 and 29 other types of pneumonias. These patients are divided into training set (n = 50) and test set (n = 25) at random. We segment the lung lesions from the CT images, and extract 77 radiomic features from the lesions. Then unsupervised consensus clustering and multiple cross-validation are utilized to select the key features that are associated with the COVID-19. In the experiments, while twenty-three radiomic features are found to be highly associated with COVID-19, four key features are screened and used as the inputs of support vector machine to build the radiomic signature. We use area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration curve to assess the performance of our model. It yields AUCs of 0.862 and 0.826 in the training set and the test set respectively. We also perform the stratified analysis and find that its predictive ability is not affected by gender, age, chronic disease and degree of severity. In conclusion, we investigate the value of radiomics in screening COVID-19, and the experimental results suggest the radiomic signature could be a potential tool for diagnosis of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fang, Mengjie; He, Bingxi; Li, Li; Dong, Di; Yang, Xin; Li, Cong; Meng, Lingwei; Zhong, Lianzhen; Li, Hailin; Li, Hongjun; Tian, Jie","journal":"Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/81586d26da397e7f054e891f0190ab6246b83c1b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166002/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs5Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["radiomic features","diagnosis of COVID","screening COVID","radiomic signature","key features","test set","training set","disease diagnosis","huge amounts of features","chronic disease","pneumonia patients","Coronavirus disease","CT images","characteristic curve","calibration curve","value of radiomics","lung lesions","medical image","Beijing Youan Hospital","multiple cross-validation","gender","unsupervised consensus clustering","potential tool","inputs of support vector machine","receiver","predictive ability","degree of severity","experimental results","performance","area","stratified analysis","experiments","types of pneumonias","model","conclusion","world","study","AUCs"],"language":"en"},

Potential threats and pollution hotspots bring forth the various health and environmental impact attributed to the water system accessibility, distribution, and quality. Strategies addressing water resources problems are taken into consideration side-by-side the numerous national laws, policies, standards, and guidelines in addressing water quality control and management. Therefore, the legal framework for various agencies to carry out these policies on quality control, usage, and water management are pivotal to recommendations on revision of certain provisions that rely on embedding local community involvement to lessen the environmental impact that is causal to poor population health. The World Bank has been instrumental in prompting local activity with initiatives first established in relation to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals that are being carried forward today in the Sustainable Development Initiatives.

Otitis is one of the most common infections seen in young children. Each case represents an opportunity to practice precise diagnostic skills and to practice judicious antibiotic use. Sinusitis, while also relatively common, may present with nonspecific signs and symptoms. An accurate diagnosis requires a complete history and careful physical examination to help distinguish between viral rhinosinusitis, a condition that is usually self-limiting, and bacterial rhinosinusitis, a condition that requires treatment with antibiotics. Mastoiditis is a less common condition that can occur as a complication of otitis media.

A worldwide overview of all parasites known for 48 out 86 extant euphausiid species includes 17 distinct types of epibionts, pathogens, parasites, and parasitoids. So far, only seven of them have been reported interacting with E. superba [epibionts: exuviotrophic ciliates (Foettingeriidae) and microplanktophagous ciliates (Suctoridae, Ephelota), pathogens: chitinoclastic bacteria and fungi; and trophically transmitted endoparasites: Apicomplexans (Gregarinidae, Cephaloidophora), nematode infecting krill\u2019s eggs (under laboratory conditions), and histophagous parasites: Apostomatida ciliates of the family Pseudocollinidae]. The epibionts have interspecific associations that strongly depend on the krill\u2019s moult cycle, discarding them at each moulting event. Their colonization and intensity show a remarkable synchronization with the krill moulting process at individual, school, and population levels. The social and sometimes highly dense swarms and schools of E. superba, its keystone trophic function (both as voracious predator and as prey to multiple predators) should make it a critical vector for trophically transmitted parasites in the food web. However, E. superba interacts with a relatively low diversity of epibionts, pathogens, and parasites, in comparison with parasite diversity known for relatively well-studied temperate (Meganyctiphanes norvegica, Euphausia pacifica) and subtropical (Nyctiphanes simplex) euphausiid species. The apparently low parasite diversity of E. superba is likely associated with its Antarctic zoogeographic pattern; where, parasites have not invaded the Antarctic krill with the same evolutionary success as have occurred with other euphausiid species from tropical, subtropical, temperate, and even Arctic ecosystems.","publish_time":"2016-08-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"G\u00F3mez-Guti\u00E9rrez, Jaime; Morales-\u00C1vila, Jos\u00E9 Ra\u00FAl","journal":"Biology and Ecology of Antarctic Krill","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73bf37c60dacab7930948eec05b0e945eb9eec93.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153171.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153171/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Euphausia"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["histophagous parasites","trophically transmitted parasites","Antarctic krill Euphausia superba","studied species","pathogens","low diversity of epibionts","extant euphausiid species","low parasite diversity of","microplanktophagous ciliates","Apostomatida ciliates","exuviotrophic ciliates","distinct types of epibionts","trophically transmitted endoparasites","Antarctic zoogeographic pattern","Euphausia pacifica","moulting event","krill\u2019s moult cycle","nematode infecting krill\u2019s eggs","Cephaloidophora","Gregarinidae","laboratory conditions","Meganyctiphanes norvegica","voracious predator","Order Euphausiacea","Ephelota","fungi","Foettingeriidae","chitinoclastic bacteria","Nyctiphanes simplex","ecological aspects","remarkable synchronization","individual","process","Apicomplexans","keystone trophic function","Suctoridae","critical vector","prey","multiple predators","dense swarms","schools of","reports","food web","comparison","family Pseudocollinidae","evolutionary success","colonization","intensity","population levels","diseases","Arctic ecosystems","interspecific associations","worldwide overview","parasitoids"],"language":"en"},

Two thirds of pneumonias observed after both autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantations are of infectious origin, and coinfections are frequent. One third is due to noninfectious process, such as alveolar hemorrhage, alveolar proteinosis, or alloimmune pulmonary complications such as bronchiolitis obliterans or idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis. Most of these noninfectious complications may require treatment with corticosteroids which may be deleterious in infection. On the other hand, these complications either mimic or may be complicated with infections. Therefore, a precise diagnosis of pneumonia is of crucial importance to decide of the optimal treatment. CT scan is the best procedure for imaging of the lung. Although several indirect biomarkers, such as serum or plasma galactomannan or (1-3) \u03B2(beta)-G-glucan, can help in the etiological diagnosis, only direct invasive investigations provide the best chance to identify the cause(s) of pneumonia. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) under fiberoptic bronchoscopy is the procedure of choice to identify the cause of pulmonary infection. It is safe and reproducible, and its diagnostic yield is around 50 % if the BAL fluid is processed at the laboratory according to a prespecified protocol established between the transplanter, the infectious diseases\u2019 specialist, the pneumologist, and the laboratory, allowing the identification of the most likely hypotheses. Transbronchial biopsy does not provide significant additional information to BAL in most cases and more often complicates with bleeding and pneumothorax. In case of a noncontributory BAL, the decision to proceed to a second BAL, a transthoracic biopsy, or a surgical biopsy should be cautiously weighted in a multidisciplinary approach in regard to the benefits and risks of invasive procedures versus empirical treatment.","publish_time":"2016-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cordonnier, Catherine","journal":"Transplant Infections","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39b460667b7559c83fca1144f711afd584de0f4c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153442.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153442/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjsxMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BAL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["noncontributory BAL","BAL fluid","noninfectious complications","cause of pulmonary infection","best procedure","alloimmune pulmonary complications","transthoracic biopsy","empirical treatment","Transbronchial biopsy","surgical biopsy","precise diagnosis of pneumonia","optimal treatment","laboratory","main cause of morbidity","infectious origin","allogeneic stem cell transplantations","alveolar hemorrhage","alveolar proteinosis","hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","best chance","procedure of choice","etiological diagnosis","noninfectious process","direct invasive investigations","risks of invasive procedures","infectious diseases\u2019 specialist","bronchiolitis obliterans","mortality","benefits","fiberoptic bronchoscopy","significant additional information","transplanter","crucial importance","corticosteroids","idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis","serum","regard","pneumologist","imaging","cases","CT scan","Bronchoalveolar lavage","beta","G-glucan","multidisciplinary approach","identification","prespecified protocol","coinfections","lung","decision","diagnostic yield","indirect biomarkers","plasma galactomannan","thirds of pneumonias","likely hypotheses","bleeding","pneumothorax","hand"],"language":"en"},

HeV was recognized in Australia 1994 in horses exhibiting respiratory disease along with a human case fatality, and then NiV was identified during a large outbreak of human cases of encephalitis with high mortality in Malaysia and Singapore in 1998\u20131999 along with respiratory disease in pigs which served as amplifying hosts. The recently identified third henipavirus isolate, Cedar virus (CedPV), is not pathogenic in animals susceptible to HeV and NiV disease. Molecular detection of additional henipavirus species has been reported but no additional isolates of virus have been reported. Central pathological features of both HeV and NiV infection in humans and several susceptible animal species is a severe systemic and often fatal neurologic and/or respiratory disease. In people, both viruses can also manifest relapsed encephalitis following recovery from an acute infection, particularly NiV. The recognized natural reservoir hosts of HeV, NiV, and CedPV are pteropid bats, which do not show clinical illness when infected. With spillovers of HeV continuing to occur in Australia and NiV in Bangladesh and India, these henipaviruses continue to be important transboundary biological threats. NiV in particular possesses several features that highlight a pandemic potential, such as its ability to infect humans directly from natural reservoirs or indirectly from other susceptible animals along with a capacity of limited human-to-human transmission. Several henipavirus animal challenge models have been developed which has aided in understanding HeV and NiV pathogenesis as well as how they invade the central nervous system, and successful active and passive immunization strategies against HeV and NiV have been reported which target the viral envelope glycoproteins.","publish_time":"2016-09-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Broder, Christopher C.; Wong, Kum Thong","journal":"Neurotropic Viral Infections","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e6b2b4203e491c9f8525837e583ab7c78357792.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153454.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153454/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjsxMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia","Malaysia","Bangladesh","India"],"keyphrases":["NiV disease","NiV infection","NiV pathogenesis","understanding HeV","spillovers of HeV","respiratory disease","humans","recognized natural reservoir hosts of HeV","animals susceptible","susceptible animals","human transmission","Nipah virus","Cedar virus","Hendra virus","serious disease outbreaks","susceptible animal species","additional isolates of virus","capacity of limited human","human case fatality","CedPV","henipaviruses","Australia","henipavirus isolate","large outbreak of human cases of encephalitis","Molecular detection of additional henipavirus species","henipavirus animal challenge models","Central pathological features","acute infection","natural reservoirs","pathogenic zoonoses","amplifying hosts","manifest relapsed encephalitis","central nervous system","passive immunization strategies","high mortality","recovery","livestock","Malaysia","ability","pigs","Bangladesh","India","important transboundary biological threats","pteropid bats","Singapore","pandemic potential","horses","viral envelope glycoproteins","people","clinical illness"],"language":"en"},

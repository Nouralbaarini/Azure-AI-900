We describe the clinical course in eight HSCT recipients suffering from hMPV infection. METHODS: We prospectively included all patients with hMPV-associated LRTI after allogeneic HSCT during a period of 1 year. hMPV was diagnosed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). RESULTS: Eight patients with hMPV-associated LRTI were identified from 93 BAL samples. Three of the eight patients had co-infections with other pathogens. The median age of the patients was 45 years [interquartile range (IQR) 36.8\u201353.5], the median time posttransplant was 473 days (IQR 251\u20131,165), 5/8 patients had chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD), and 6/8 patients received immunosuppression. Chest computed tomography (CT) scanning showed a ground-glass pattern in 7/8 patients. Seven of eight patients required hospitalization due to severe symptoms and hypoxemia. All were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which was combined with oral ribavirin in six patients. The mortality rate was 12.5 % (1/8).

The major routes of entry of pharmaceuticals into the environment are industries, hospitals, or direct disposal of unwanted or expired drugs made by the patient. The most important and distinct features of pharmaceuticals are that they are deliberately designed to have an explicit mode of action and designed to exert an effect on humans and other living systems. This distinctive feature makes pharmaceuticals and their metabolites different from other chemicals, and this necessitates the evaluation of the direct effects of pharmaceuticals in various environmental compartments as well as to living systems. In this background, the alarming situation of ecotoxicity of diverse pharmaceuticals have forced government and nongovernment regulatory authorities to recommend the application of in silico methods to provide quick information about the risk assessment and fate properties of pharmaceuticals as well as their ecological and indirect human health effects. This chapter aims to offer information regarding occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment, their persistence, environmental fate, and toxicity as well as application of in silico methods to provide information about the basic risk management and fate prediction of pharmaceuticals in the environment. Brief ideas about toxicity endpoints, available ecotoxicity databases, and expert systems employed for rapid toxicity predictions of ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals are also discussed.","publish_time":"2016-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roy, Kunal; Kar, Supratik","journal":"In Silico Methods for Predicting Drug Toxicity","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39aad597f477cbf702e31c5791fbe5f55e64d7bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120582.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120582/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzY2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diverse pharmaceuticals","occurrence of pharmaceuticals","direct effects of pharmaceuticals","fate prediction of pharmaceuticals","fate properties of pharmaceuticals","distinct features of pharmaceuticals","environmental fate","living systems","rapid toxicity predictions of ecotoxicity","toxicity endpoints","quick information","expert systems","application","silico methods","environmental toxicants","available ecotoxicity databases","alarming situation of ecotoxicity","various environmental compartments","risk assessment","metabolites different","active metabolites","basic risk management","direct disposal of unwanted","indirect human health effects","expired drugs","hospitals","nongovernment regulatory authorities","industries","persistence","Brief ideas","evaluation","distinctive feature","major routes of entry","chemicals","background","humans","explicit mode of action","patient","chapter"],"language":"en"},

In particular we show the importance of publicly available biological and clinical repositories to support systems medicine studies. Second, we discuss how the integration and analysis of multiple types of omics data through integrative bioinformatics may facilitate the determination of more predictive and robust disease signatures, lead to a better understanding of (patho)physiological molecular mechanisms, and facilitate personalized medicine. Third, we focus on network analysis and discuss how gene networks can be constructed from omics data and how these networks can be decomposed into smaller modules. We discuss how the resulting modules can be used to generate experimentally testable hypotheses, provide insight into disease mechanisms, and lead to predictive models. Throughout, we provide several examples demonstrating how bioinformatics contributes to systems medicine and discuss future challenges in bioinformatics that need to be addressed to enable the advancement of systems medicine.","publish_time":"2015-08-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Kampen, Antoine H.

However, clinical failures occur as a result of the ability of HIV-1 to rapidly mutate. One approach to overcome drug resistance is to target HIV-1 proteins that are highly conserved among phylogenetically distant viral strains and currently not targeted by available therapies. In this respect, the nucleocapsid (NC) protein, a zinc finger protein, is particularly attractive, as it is highly conserved and plays a central role in virus replication, mainly by interacting with nucleic acids. The compelling rationale for considering NC as a viable drug target is illustrated by the fact that point mutants of this protein lead to noninfectious viruses and by the inability to select viruses resistant to a first generation of anti-NC drugs. In our review, we discuss the most relevant properties and functions of NC, as well as recent developments of small molecules targeting NC. Zinc ejectors show strong antiviral activity, but are endowed with a low therapeutic index due to their lack of specificity, which has resulted in toxicity. Currently, they are mainly being investigated for use as topical microbicides. Greater specificity may be achieved by using non-covalent NC inhibitors (NCIs) targeting the hydrophobic platform at the top of the zinc fingers or key nucleic acid partners of NC. Within the last few years, innovative methodologies have been developed to identify NCIs. Though the antiviral activity of the identified NCIs needs still to be improved, these compounds strongly support the druggability of NC and pave the way for future structure-based design and optimization of efficient NCIs.","publish_time":"2015-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mori, Mattia; Kovalenko, Lesia; Lyonnais, S\u00E9bastien; Antaki, Danny; Torbett, Bruce E.; Botta, Maurizio; Mirambeau, Gilles; M\u00E9ly, Yves","journal":"The Future of HIV-1 Therapeutics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65af4ac291df6e57ed1ffc35e6a7040bf7eb457f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122173.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122173/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzcxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["functions of NC","druggability of NC","generation of anti-NC drugs","non-covalent NC inhibitors","key nucleic acid partners of NC","identified NCIs","zinc finger protein","available anti-HIV","zinc fingers","protein lead","Zinc ejectors","optimization of efficient NCIs","ability of HIV","strong antiviral activity","viable drug target","noninfectious viruses","viruses resistant","lack of specificity","nucleic acids","Greater specificity","available therapies","overcome drug resistance","future structure-based design","way","therapeutics","fact","point mutants","recent developments of small molecules","central role","result","inability","virus replication","relevant properties","low therapeutic index","distant viral strains","infected patients","approach","hydrophobic platform","nucleocapsid","innovative methodologies","compelling rationale","topical microbicides","years","clinical failures","compounds","respect","proteins","review","toxicity"],"language":"en"},

Despite weak or lacking CD13 surface expression all lymphoid cell lines tested contain APNmRNA as quantified by competitive RT-PCR as well as low enzymatic activity in their particulate fractions. By isoelectric focusing two enzyme species with isoelectric points of 5.4 or between 3.5 to 4.8, respectively, were detected. To investigate whether these activities result from APN-gene we established transfectants lacking cellular APN expression of the CD13-positive histiocytic cell line U937 and the CD13-negative T cell line H9.

This increase in salmonella resistance was observed when the interval between MHV and salmonella infections was 6 days, but not at 3, 10, or 14 day intervals. The mouse lty locus, which controls the number of intracellular salmonella, had a significant effect on the ability of MHV to induce resistance to salmonella. MHV caused an increase in resistance to salmonella in lty(s) (salmonella susceptible) mice at all doses of salmonella tested (100 to 10000 cfu). In the lty(r) (salmonella resistant) mice tested the beneficial effect of MHV on salmonella resistance was small and when observed, was only present at salmonella doses of 10000 cfu or greater. Neither the Lps(d) nor Xid mutations affected the ability of MHV to increase resistance to salmonella infection. In contrast to euthymic mice, MHV infection greatly decreased the resistance of athymic (nude) mice to salmonella infection. Since the Nu locus does not affect the resistance of mice to salmonella (at 4 days post salmonella infection), these results indicate that MHV infection and the nude phenotype interact to increase susceptibility to salmonella. These findings re-emphasize the importance of keeping laboratory mice used in research free of MHV and other immunomodulatory pathogens.","publish_time":"2004-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fallon, Michael T.; Schoeb, Trenton R.; Benjamin, William H.; Lindsey, J.Russell; Briles, David E.","journal":"Microb Pathog","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7127339/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozg3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["salmonella resistance","salmonella infections","doses of salmonella","salmonella doses","salmonella resistant","salmonella susceptible","resistance of mice","MHV infection","days post salmonella infection","fewer salmonella colony","number of intracellular salmonella","ability of MHV","Prior infection of mice","early resistance of euthymic mice","virulent Salmonella typhimurium strain SR","laboratory mice","resistance of athymic","beneficial effect of MHV","increase","research free of MHV","cfu","mouse lty locus","present","significant effect","nude phenotype","Nu locus","field strain of mouse hepatitis virus","units","spleens","livers","Xid mutations","results","contrast","immunomodulatory pathogens","Lps","importance","susceptibility","findings","day intervals"],"language":"en"},

In contrast, infection of SJL/J mice results in acute encephalitis, virus persistence, and immune-mediated demyelination. These experiments examined the role of T-cell subsets in the in vivo immune response to Theiler\u0027s virus in resistant C57BL/10SNJ mice. Depletion of T-cell subsets with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed at CD3 (pan-T-cell marker), CD4(\u002B) (class II-restricted) or CD8(\u002B) (class I-restricted) T cells resulted in increased frequency of paralysis and death as a result of acute encephalitis. Neuropathologic studies 10 days after infection demonstrated prominent necrosis, primarily in the pyramidal layer of hippocampus and in the thalamus of mice depleted of T-cell subsets. In immunosuppressed and infected C57BL/10SNJ mice, analysis of spinal cord sections 35 days after infection demonstrated small demyelinated lesions relatively devoid of inflammatory cells even though virus antigen could be detected by immunocytochemistry. Both CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) T cells are important in the resistance to infection with Theiler\u0027s virus in C57BL/10SNJ mice. However, subsequent spinal cord demyelination, to the extent observed in susceptible mice, depends on the presence of virus antigen persistence and a competent cellular immune response.","publish_time":"2004-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rodriguez, Moses; Lindsley, Mark D.; Pierce, Mabel L.","journal":"Microb Pathog","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7127457/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozg3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SJL/J"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SNJ mice","virus persistence","T cells","T-cell subsets","Theiler\u0027s virus results","thalamus of mice","susceptible mice","pan-T","role of T","Depletion of T","subsequent virus clearance","J mice results","Intracerebral infection of C57BL","presence of virus antigen persistence","infection of SJL","subsequent spinal cord demyelination","resistant C57BL","absence of spinal cord demyelination","infected C57BL","cell marker","result of acute encephalitis","immune-mediated demyelination","days","analysis of spinal cord sections","class","CD8","CD4","competent cellular immune response","devoid of inflammatory cells","small demyelinated lesions","death","mAbs","resistance","monoclonal antibodies","increased frequency of paralysis","prominent necrosis","CD3","extent","pyramidal layer of hippocampus","Neuropathologic studies","contrast","experiments","immunocytochemistry"],"language":"en"},

To date, less than 200 animals remain in the wild. Low numbers and genetic uniformity may contribute to render this species particularly susceptible to infectious diseases. Different pathogens have been identified in Iberian lynxes; including several feline bacterial and viral agents. Within a 6-month period starting in December 2006, 12 lynxes living in the northern part of the Do\u00F1ana area were found to be infected with feline leukemia virus (FeLV). Eleven of these animals were antigenemic, and four of them died in the wild in less than 6 months since the first infected animal had been discovered. The remaining viremic lynxes were captured and allocated to a quarantine center to stop the spread of the infection. An additional three animals died shortly in the quarantine center due to acute anemic disease. Sequencing of the envelope surface unit gene revealed a common origin for the FeLV found in all lynxes. The sequences were closely related to FeLV-A/61E, originally isolated from cats in the USA. Our data demonstrate that, similarly to FeLV, the introduction of a new or particularly pathogenic infection brought into the small population of Iberian lynxes by other wild carnivores or feral cats and dogs roaming in the same habitats have severe consequences. It could result in epidemics that have the potential to eradicate the entire lynx population.","publish_time":"2010-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meli, Marina L.; Cattori, Valentino; Mart\u00EDnez, Fernando; L\u00F3pez, Guillermo; Vargas, Astrid; Palomares, Francisco; L\u00F3pez-Bao, Jos\u00E9 V.; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina; Lutz, Hans","journal":"Vet Immunol Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab58ef9490d13c80ad2cc093bf584d17a1e3288c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127500.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7127500/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozg4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FeLV","animals","small population of Iberian lynxes","remaining viremic lynxes","wild carnivores","quarantine center","entire lynx population","Lynx pardinus","feral cats","pathogenic infection","infected animal","endangered felid species","feline leukemia virus","envelope surface unit gene","common origin","dogs","Sequencing","acute anemic disease","potential","genetic uniformity","habitats","Low numbers","infectious diseases","world","viral agents","introduction","months","spread","Different pathogens","severe consequences","Do\u00F1ana area","month period","epidemics","USA","date","antigenemic","data"],"language":"en"},

Eight species of Eimeria, and Isospora suis, were recovered. In their descending order of predominance in the pigs raised on concrete, the species of coccidia were E. debliecki (26.7%), E. scabra (22.4%), E. neodebliecki (19.8%), E. porci (15.5%), E. suis (11.6%), E. polita (8.6%), E. perminuta (7%), E. spinosa (5.6%) and E. suis (3.9%). The first five species listed above predominated in the village pigs as well. E. polita, E. spinosa and I. suis were not found in the wild boar. I. suis oocysts prevailed in 8.3% of the 36 sows on concrete, and in 11.1% (327) of those which were positive for coccidia. Isosporoid oocysts were absent in the village sows. Of the 125 \u003C24-day-old piglets, 29.6% were diarrhoeic, and of these, 43.2% were positive for coccidia. Four of the 16 (25%) coccidia-positive, diarrhoeic piglets, and four of the 37 (10.8%) coccidia-positive non-diarrhoeic piglets shed I. suis oocysts, an observation which seems to weaken the present contention that I. suis is the primary causative agent of neonatal porcine occidiosis. The highest mean number of oocysts per gram faeces (23 550) was recorded from the diarrhoeic farm piglets on conrete, and the lowest of 6,100 from the gestating farm sows. Mean opg data revealed very little significant quantitative variation between the corresponding age groups of the free-ranging village pigs and the commercially-farmed ones. One of the most interesting findings in the study was that the sows were more frequently infected than all other age groups.","publish_time":"2002-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Varghese, Thomas","journal":"Vet Parasitol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7127732/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozg5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Isospora","E. debliecki","E. scabra","E. neodebliecki","E. porci"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["suis oocysts","village pigs","Isospora suis","village sows","species of coccidia","coccidia-positive non-diarrhoeic piglets","diarrhoeic farm piglets","domestic pigs","Isosporoid oocysts","concrete","day-old piglets","prevalence of coccidian oocysts","gestating farm sows","highest mean number of oocysts","species of Eimeria","wild boar","polita","spinosa","corresponding age groups","Mean opg data","little significant quantitative variation","primary causative agent of neonatal porcine occidiosis","gram faeces","conrete","descending order of predominance","study","Faecal samples","present contention","observation","farmed ones","interesting findings","scabra","neodebliecki","perminuta"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, they have been useful to establish a viral etiology in neurological syndromes of dubious origin and to recognise unusual or poorly characterised CNS diseases. Quantitative methods have provided a valuable additional tool for clinical management of these diseases, whereas post-amplification techniques have enabled precise genome characterisation.

Aetiological studies have focused on the presence of a limited number of pathogens. The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of a wide range of bacteria and viruses, including Fusobacterium necrophorum, in patients with pharyngotonsillitis and in asymptomatic controls. A prospective case control study was performed in primary healthcare in Kronoberg County, Sweden. Patients (n = 220) aged 15 to 45 years with a suspected acute pharyngotonsillitis, and controls (n = 128), were included. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs were analysed for \u03B2-hemolytic streptococci, F. necrophorum, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and 13 respiratory viruses. Serum samples were analysed for antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus. The patient history and symptoms, including Centor score, were analysed in relation to pathogens. In 155/220 (70.5%) of the patients, as compared to 26/128 (20.3%) of the controls (p \u003C0.001), at least one microorganism was found. Group A streptococci, F. necrophorum, and influenza B virus were the three most common findings, and all significantly more common in patients than in controls (p \u003C0.001, p 0.001, and p 0.002, respectively). Patients with F. necrophorum only (n = 14) displayed a lower Centor score than patients with Group A streptococcus only (n = 46), but a higher score than patients with influenza B, other viruses, or no potential pathogen (Kruskal-Wallis p \u003C0.001). A pathogen was detected in 70% of the patients, displaying a wide range of pathogens contributing to the aetiology of pharyngotonsillitis. This study supports F. necrophorum as one of the pathogens to be considered in the aetiology of pharyngotonsillitis.","publish_time":"2014-11-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hedin, K.; Bieber, L.; Lindh, M.; Sundqvist, M.","journal":"Clin Microbiol Infect","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128797.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128797/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzI10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Group"],"locations":["Sweden"],"keyphrases":["patients","Fusobacterium necrophorum","aetiology of pharyngotonsillitis","wide range of pathogens","asymptomatic controls","Kruskal-Wallis p","primary healthcare","presence","lower Centor score","influenza B virus","higher score","respiratory viruses","suspected acute pharyngotonsillitis","common findings","present study","Group","limited number of pathogens","wide range of bacteria","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","Chlamydophila pneumoniae","throat swabs","Sore throat","prospective case control study","potential pathogen","\u03B2-hemolytic streptococci","Epstein-Barr virus","antibodies","Kronoberg County","Sweden","symptoms","streptococcus","patient history","years","relation","Serum samples","Aetiological studies","aim","microorganism"],"language":"en"},

Numerous RDTs have been developed but not necessarily for the ED environment. Their successful implementation in the ED relies on their performance and impact on patient management. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this narrative review is to provide an overview of currently available RDTs for infectious diseases in the ED. SOURCES: PubMed was searched through August 2019 for available studies on RDTs for infectious diseases. Inclusion criteria included: commercial tests approved by the FDA or CE-IVD with data on clinical samples, ability to run on fully-automated systems and result delivery within 2 hours. CONTENT: A non-exhaustive list of representative commercially available FDA or CE approved assays was categorized by clinical syndrome: pharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection, lower respiratory tract infection, gastrointestinal infection, meningitis and encephalitis, fever in the returning traveler and sexually-transmitted infection including HIV. The performance of tests was described based on clinical validation studies. Further, their impact on clinical outcomes and anti-infective use was discussed with a focus on ED-based studies. IMPLICATIONS: Clinicians should be familiar with the distinctive features of each RDT and individual performance characteristics for each target. Their integration into ED workflow should be pre-planned considering local constraints of given settings. Additional clinical studies are needed to further evaluate their clinical and cost effectiveness.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bouzid, Donia; Zanella, Marie-C\u00E9line; Kerneis, Solen; Visseaux, Beno\u00EEt; May, Larissa; Schrenzel, Jacques; Cattoir, Vincent","journal":"Clin Microbiol Infect","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129254.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129254/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzEwMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["Rapid","FDA","CE","HIV","RDT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical validation studies","Additional clinical studies","ED-based studies","available RDTs","clinical syndrome","clinical samples","clinical outcomes","available studies","infection prevention","gastrointestinal infection","transmitted infection","infectious diseases","performance of tests","ED workflow","ED environment","lower respiratory tract infection","upper respiratory tract infection","available FDA","Numerous RDTs","commercial tests","impact","hours","CE approved assays","Rapid diagnostic tests","individual performance characteristics","patient care","CE-IVD","patient management","encephalitis","non-exhaustive list of representative","data","meningitis","pharyngitis","antimicrobial stewardship","emergency department","local constraints of given settings","distinctive features","returning traveler","fever","anti-infective use","focus","overview","promising tools","automated systems","result delivery","ability","BACKGROUND","narrative review","aim","Clinicians","CONTENT","time","Inclusion criteria","target","integration","SOURCES","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

Escherichia coli, the preferred host for recombinant protein expression, presents many challenges which must be surmounted in order to over-express heterologous proteins. These challenges include the proteolytic degradation of target proteins, protein misfolding, poor solubility, and the necessity for good purification methodologies. Gene fusion technologies have been able to improve heterologous expression by overcoming many of these challenges. The ability of gene fusions to improve expression, solubility, purification, and decrease proteolytic degradation will be discussed in this review. The main disadvantage, cleaving the protein fusion, will also be addressed. Focus will be given to the newly described SUMO fusion system and the improvements that this technology has advanced over traditional gene fusion systems.","publish_time":"2005-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Butt, Tauseef R.; Edavettal, Suzanne C.; Hall, John P.; Mattern, Michael R.","journal":"Protein Expr Purif","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129290.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129290/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzEwMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein fusion","heterologous expression","challenges","recombinant protein expression","Gene fusion technologies","protein misfolding","traditional gene fusion systems","folded proteins","proteolytic degradation of target proteins","over-express heterologous proteins","field of protein production","heterologous hosts","described SUMO fusion system","ability of gene fusions","good purification methodologies","poor solubility","large quantities of soluble","functional genomics","preferred host","improvements","necessity","technology","advancements","order","demands of structural","Escherichia coli","main disadvantage","review","Focus"],"language":"en"},

The occurrence of subclinical herd infections, the prolonged circulation of virus within herds and probable aerogenic virus spread all mitigated against the success of control measures. The origin of the disease is unknown but the causative agent has been shown to be an arterivirus with shared features to lactate dehydrogenase virus of mice. There is evidence of extreme genetic and antigenic variability between American and European isolates. PRRS virus has a predilection for alveolar macrophages and does notgrow in most cell lines. In infected pigs, viraemia can persist for many weeks in the face of circulating antibodies and little is known about the mechanisms by which immunity to infection develops. A wide spectrum of disease has been reported from the field, accompanied in some cases by heavy economic losses. Reproductive and perinatal losses were most prominent when the disease first appeared. In the endemic phase, PRRS may be more significant as a contributory factor to a post-weaning respiratory syndrome of young pigs of 3\u20138 weeks. On-farm techniques have been developed to reduce the recycling of PRRS virus from older infected nursery pigs to the younger newly weaned pig. Vaccines are now marketed for the control of PRRS, but are not licensed for use in Britain. Improvements in knowledge of virion composition and antigenic stability and in the nature of the immune response of the pig should result in genetically engineered subunit vaccines becoming available. Diagnosis of PRRS is still difficult as many animals do not show clinicalsigns and may only be detected by serology and often only when other respiratory diseases are being investigated. Now that the infection is widespread, serological testing must be properly targeted and interpreted to give meaningful results about virus circulation. An increasing arsenal of diagnostic methods are becoming available to detect virus in both fresh and fixed specimens. The pathogenic mechanisms of PRRS remain poorly defined and more work is needed to reveal the nature of the interaction between PRRS virus and other factors in disease.","publish_time":"2007-11-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Done, S.H.; Paton, D.J.; White, M.E.C.","journal":"Br Vet J","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130409/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzI5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRS"],"locations":["Britain"],"keyphrases":["recycling of PRRS virus","control of PRRS","virus circulation","Diagnosis of PRRS","prolonged circulation of virus","pathogenic mechanisms of PRRS","probable aerogenic virus","dehydrogenase virus of mice","infected pigs","wide spectrum of disease","nature","respiratory diseases","weeks","spread","Britain","post-weaning respiratory syndrome of young pigs","older infected nursery pigs","porcine reproductiveand respiratory syndrome","success of control measures","antigenic variability","antigenic stability","weaned pig","perinatal losses","endemic phase","heavy economic losses","engineered subunit vaccines","herds","contributory factor","notgrow","knowledge of virion composition","alveolar macrophages","predilection","occurrence of subclinical herd infections","evidence of extreme genetic","shared features","cases","serological testing","European isolates","increasing arsenal of diagnostic methods","meaningful results","interaction","factors","Improvements","arterivirus","face of circulating antibodies","immune response","causative agent","animals","fixed specimens","work","viraemia","cell lines","early attempts","countries","immunity","field","origin","farm techniques","clinicalsigns","use","serology"],"language":"en"},

A research priority of the World Health Organization is to develop oral rehydration solutions containing amino acids or other additives that will stimulate intestinal absorption more efficiently than the current glucose-based oral rehydration solutions. Glutamine is the principal metabolic fuel of the small bowel and a putative stimulator of mucosal repair. This report describes the transport response to mucosal l-glutamine following intestinal injury caused by porcine rotavirus. Peak symptoms and mucosal damage were observed 2\u20137 days after oral rotavirus inoculation. In vitro transport studies of the maximally injured region, the midjejunum (80% reduction in lactase), surprisingly, showed transport responses to l-glutamine (30 mmol/L) Sand l-alanine (30 mmol/L) that were similar qualitatively and quantitatively to those observed in control tissue. Subsequent application of mucosal d-glucose (30 mmol/L) caused additional stimulation of electrogenic Na(\u002B) transport, but the response to glucose was blunted (P \u003C 0.05) in the infected tissues. Glutamine and alanine enhanced Na(\u002B) absorption to a similar degree (2\u20132.5 \u03BCEq \u00B7 cm(\u22122) \u00B7 h(\u22121)), but glutamine stimulated equal amounts of electrogenic and electroneutral NaC1 absorption, whereas alanine had no significant effect on net Cl(\u2212) flux.

A major part of the cysteine proteases are evolutionary related to the structurally well\u2013defined cysteine protease papain and are called papain\u2013like cysteine proteases. The biological roles and the cystatin superfamily inhibitors of papain\u2013like cystein proteases are also discussed. The aminoacid sequence and schematic structure of human cystatin C is also presented. The evolutionary relationships among all known inhibitory active human cystatins and kininogen cystatin domains are diagrammatically represented. The distribution of cystatins in body fluids and additional functions attributed to cystatin C are described. The serum or plasma cystatin C is used as a marker for glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The urine cystatin C is used as a marker for proximal tubular damage. The two types of brain hemorrhage associated with Cystatin C amyloid deposits are also demonstrated.

According to current taxonomy, the family includes four genera: Enterouirus (polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and other enteroviruses), Rhinovirus, Curdiouirus [encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), mengovirus, Theiler\u0027s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)], and Aphthouirus [foot-and-mouth disease viruses (FMDV)]. There are also some, as yet, unclassified picornaviruses [e.g., hepatitis A virus (HAW] that should certainly be assessed as a separate genus. Studies on the molecular biology of picornaviruses might be divided into two periods: those before and after the first sequencing of the poliovirus genome. The 5\u0027-untranslated region (5-UTR) of the viral genome was one of the unexpected problems. This segment proved to be immensely long: about 750 nucleotides or \u223C10% of the genome length. There were also other unusual features (e.g., multiple AUG triplets preceding the single open reading frame (ORF) that encodes the viral polyprotein). This chapter shows that the picornaviral 5-UTRs are not only involved in such essential events as the synthesis of viral proteins and RNAs that could be expected to some extent, although some of the underlying mechanisms appeared to be quite a surprise, but also may determine diverse biological phenotypes from the plaque size or thermosensitivity of reproduction to attenuation of neurovirulence. Furthermore, a close inspection of the 5-UTR structure unravels certain hidden facets of the evolution of the picornaviral genome. Finally, the conclusions drawn from the experiments with the picornaviral5-UTRs provide important clues for understanding the functional capabilities of the eukaryotic ribosomes.","publish_time":"2008-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Agol, Vadim I.","journal":"Adv Virus Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130636/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzMyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["picornaviral genome","poliovirus genome","genome length","encephalomyocarditis virus","unclassified picornaviruses","viral polyprotein","single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity","synthesis of viral proteins","molecular biology of picornaviruses","Theiler\u0027s murine encephalomyelitis virus","UTR structure","picornaviral5-UTRs","mouth disease viruses","single open reading frame","small naked icosahedral viruses","mengovirus","plaque size","triplets","EMCV","ORF","thermosensitivity of reproduction","certain hidden facets","genera","functional capabilities","Enterouirus","coxsackieviruses","important clues","Curdiouirus","TMEV","evolution","diverse biological phenotypes","family","echoviruses","enteroviruses","polioviruses","foot","Rhinovirus","hepatitis","attenuation of neurovirulence","essential events","eukaryotic ribosomes","Aphthouirus","experiments","FMDV","Studies","RNAs","current taxonomy","unusual features","close inspection","unexpected problems","underlying mechanisms","surprise","untranslated region","HAW","sequencing","separate genus","extent","conclusions","chapter","periods","segment","nucleotides"],"language":"en"},

The molecular mechanisms underlying both events are clearly different; early membrane permeability is induced by isolated virus particles, whereas late membrane leakiness is produced by newly synthesized virus protein(s) that possess activities resembling ionophores or membrane-active toxins. Detailed knowledge of the mechanisms, by which animal viruses permeabilize cells, adds to our understanding of the steps involved in virus replication. Studies on early membrane permeabilization give clues about the processes underlying entry of animal viruses into cells; understanding gained on the modification by viral proteins of membrane permeability during virus replication indicates that membrane leakiness is required for efficient virus release from infected cells or virus budding, in the case of enveloped viruses. In addition, the activity of these membrane-active virus proteins may be related to virus interference with host cell metabolism and with the cytopathic effect that develops after virus infection.","publish_time":"2008-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carrasco, Luis","journal":"Adv Virus Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131156/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzQwOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus replication","virus infection","virus interference","virus genome","membrane-active virus proteins","isolated virus particles","efficient virus release","synthesized virus protein","virus gains access","early membrane permeability","early membrane permeabilization","late membrane leakiness","membrane-active toxins","viral proteins of membrane permeability","entry of animal viruses","infected cells","case of enveloped viruses","understanding","molecular mechanisms","clues","processes","host cell metabolism","cytopathic effect","ionophores","activities","events","modification","well-defined moments","Studies","activity","cytoplasm","steps","Detailed knowledge","addition","expression"],"language":"en"},

Twenty-six subjects (12 males, 14 females, mean age 23 years 10 months, age range 18\u201339 years) were tested once a week for a period of a month. Fifteen subjects were suffering from a common cold on the first week and the other 11 subjects were matched healthy controls. Subjects attended for an initial 3-h testing period that consisted of a set of practice trials and two test sessions involving mood rating and performance of a battery of tests measuring psychomotor functions, attention, and memory. Sessions 3, 4, and 5 took place 1, 2, and 3 weeks later, respectively. In addition to measuring mood and mental performance, symptom severity was rated on a subjective checklist. The results showed that subjects with a cold reported an increase in negative mood and that this was only significant in the first week. Impairments of psychomotor function (simple reaction time and tracking) were also observed at this time. Performance of sustained and selective attention tasks was also impaired in subjects with colds but this effect was only significant in the second week. Other functions such as working and semantic memory were unimpaired in subjects with colds at any point in the experiment. Overall, the present results confirm many of the earlier results obtained in studies of experimentally induced upper respiratory tract illnesses. Indeed, these results are both of great practical importance and theoretical interest and further studies must now elucidate the mechanisms underlying these effects.","publish_time":"1999-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hall, Sara; Smith, Andrew","journal":"Physiol Behav","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131210/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzQxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["subjects","mood rating","mental performance","Performance of sustained","negative mood","earlier results","present results","upper respiratory tract illnesses","years","psychomotor functions","studies","colds","mean age","age range","test sessions","semantic memory","Impairments of psychomotor function","selective attention tasks","simple reaction time","h testing period","symptom severity","battery of tests","months","aftereffects","females","set of practice trials","great practical importance","tracking","increase","point","addition","subjective checklist","place","study","experiment","mechanisms","healthy controls","weeks"],"language":"en"},

In further in vivo voltammetric studies, the effects of SC cocaine on synaptic concentrations of DA and 5-HT were studied in the chloral hydrate-anesthetized paradigm in two neuroanatomic substrates, NAcc and mesoaccumbens somatodendrites, the ventral tegmental area (VTA-A(10)), in a dose-response fashion (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) in six separate studies.

Viral transduction of structural and regulatory genes provides a means for information to leave the body of an organism other than through the germ cells. Natural selection acts upon the cell\u2013virus nucleic acid coupling and the rate and direction of the evolution of any species depends upon the number of associated viruses and the extent to and speed with which they allow information to be cycled through the total gene pool of that population. There are three mechanisms by which gene material can be transferred from cell to cell: (1) transformation, (2) transduction, and (3) sexual conjugation. Transformation is the most random and inefficient process; it requires the laws of diffusion and the existing chemistry of the cell membrane, modified in contemporary cells by the development of transport systems, which facilitate membrane penetration. Transduction requires the development of genes for capsomere proteins to encapsidate nucleic acid and a sophistication of the process of membrane evagination to package nucleic acid into free particles, These are relatively modest genetic adaptations. However, true sexual union as it occurs in modern eukaryotes, requires such a high degree of cytological organization that it is inconceivable that it could have operated efficiently during the first billion or so years of cell evolution.","publish_time":"2008-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reanney, D.C.","journal":"Int Rev Cytol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133209/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzU1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell membrane","years of cell evolution","encapsidate nucleic acid","virus nucleic acid coupling","development of genes","process of membrane evagination","membrane penetration","information","transformation","Viral transduction of structural","regulatory genes","contemporary cells","inefficient process","role of viruses","germ cells","gene material","sexual conjugation","development of transport systems","number of associated viruses","total gene pool","true sexual union","rate","capsomere proteins","sophistication","means","direction","free particles","existing chemistry","high degree of cytological organization","modern eukaryotes","laws of diffusion","extent","species","modest genetic adaptations","organism","population","body","speed","acts","chapter","nature","mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

Cocaine-induced DA and 5-HT release were highly and positively correlated during the first hour of study (p \u003C 0.01). As expected, increased DA release in vlNAcc after cocaine administration was significantly and positively correlated with classically DA-dependent behaviors (first- and second-hour effects) (p \u003C 0.01) and with the 5-HT-ergic behavior, central ambulations (p \u003C 0.01). Also, cocaine-induced 5-HT release was significantly and positively correlated with 5-HT behavior (p \u003C 0.01). However, not as expected, classically DA-dependent behaviors were more positively correlated with cocaine-induced 5-HT release in vlNAcc throughout the two-hour period of study. Thus, the present findings show that 5-HT is a comediator with DA in the cocaine response in vlNAcc. Importantly, 5-HT may signal the known DA response to cocaine.","publish_time":"2002-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Broderick, Patricia A.; Kornak, Eugene P.; Eng, Frankie; Wechsler, Robert","journal":"Pharmacol Biochem Behav","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133218/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzU2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HT release","Cocaine-induced DA","HT behavior","increased DA release","increased vlNAcc DA release","HT-ergic behavior","cocaine response","cocaine administration","parameters of cocaine","known DA response","central ambulations","DA-dependent behaviors of locomotor activity","Psychostimulant behaviors","IP","rearing","stereotypy","hour of study","hour effects","two-hour period of study","virus-free","Sprague-Dawley rats","behaving male","ventrolateral nucleus","electrochemistry","form","line","serotonin","comediator","Miniature stearate probes","coincident data points","voltammetry","dopamine","temporal resolution of seconds","behavioral components","infrared photobeam detection","present findings","results"],"language":"en"},

Acute gastroenteritis is among the most common illnesses of humans and is caused by a variety of agents, including bacteria, viruses, parasites, toxins, and chemicals. The clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic or mild infection to severe dehydrating illness with a fatal outcome; the latter occurs primarily in young children and in the elderly. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the prevention and treatment of gastroenteritis. For the prevention of epidemic viral gastroenteritis, efforts need to be focused on caliciviruses. No specific antiviral therapy is recommended for childhood viral gastroenteritis, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing it from the selected forms of bacterial and parasitic gastroenteritis that require treatment. Other than pertinent epidemiologic information, certain clinical features of illness may provide etiologic clues, but they are not highly discriminating. Standard therapy of viral enteric infections relies on maintenance of adequate hydration and electrolyte balance. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is the main treatment.","publish_time":"2004-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parashar, Umesh D.; Glass, Roger I.","journal":"Perspect Med Virol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134077/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzcxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of gastroenteritis","childhood viral gastroenteritis","parasitic gastroenteritis","immunology of gastroenteritis","Acute gastroenteritis","prevention of epidemic viral gastroenteritis","causative viral agents","Standard therapy of viral enteric infections","main treatment","chapter","specific antiviral therapy","Oral rehydration therapy","certain clinical features of illness","clinical spectrum","variety of agents","severe dehydrating illness","mild infection","maintenance of adequate hydration","pertinent epidemiologic information","efforts","pathophysiology","selected forms of bacterial","parasites","toxins","electrolyte balance","fatal outcome","importance","etiologic clues","common illnesses of humans","discussion","young children","elderly","chemicals","caliciviruses"],"language":"en"},

The immunomodulating activity was measured by increases in phagocytic activity and in nitric oxide production by peritoneal macrophages from mice treated with both free and LIP-IFN-\u03B3 (4000 U/mouse, intraperitoneal injection). Resident peritoneal macrophages harvested from mice treated with free unencapsulated IFN-\u03B3 or muramyl dipeptide showed significant increases in macrophage yield, and enhanced ability to phagocytize zymosan particles. In mice treated with liposome-encapsulated IFN-\u03B3 (LIP-IFN-\u03B3), both macrophage yield and phagocytic activity further increased by 2-fold over unencapsulated IFN-\u03B3. In addition, the activation of peritoneal macrophages with LIP-IFN-\u03B3 showed enhanced production of NO when the cells were cultured ex vivo. Using a murine respiratory influenza infection model, intranasally administered LIP-IFN-\u03B3 conferred protection to 70% in mice challenged intranasally with 10 LD(50) doses of influenza A/PR/8 virus compared with a 20% survival rate using free IFN-\u03B3. Together these results suggest that liposome-encapsulation increases the immunomodulating and antiviral activities of IFN-\u03B3.

The impaired balance of the low-frequency/high-frequency ratio obtained from spectral components of RR intervals can be a diagnostic test for sepsis. In addition, it is known that a reduction of heart rate variability (HRV) is useful in identifying septic patients at risk of the development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). We have reported a non-contact method using a microwave radar to monitor the heart and respiratory rates of a healthy person placed inside an isolator or of experimental animals exposed to toxic materials. APPARATUS DESIGN AND TESTING. With the purpose of preventing secondary exposure of medical personnel to toxic materials under biochemical hazard conditions, we designed a novel apparatus for non-contact measurement of HRV using a 1215 MHz microwave radar, a high-pass filter, and a personal computer. The microwave radar monitors only the small reflected waves from the subject\u0027s chest wall, which are modulated by the cardiac and respiratory motion. The high-pass filter enhances the cardiac signal and attenuates the respiratory signal. In a human trial, RR intervals derived from the non-contact apparatus significantly correlated with those derived from ECG (r=0.98, P\u003C0.0001). The non-contact apparatus showed a similar power spectrum of RR intervals to that of ECG. CONCLUSIONS. Our non-contact HRV measurement apparatus appears promising for future pre-hospital monitoring of septic patients or for predicting MODS patients, inside isolators or in the field for mass casualties under biochemical hazard circumstances.","publish_time":"2005-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matsui, T.; Arai, I.; Gotoh, S.; Hattori, H.; Takase, B.; Kikuchi, M.; Ishihara, M.","journal":"Biomed Pharmacother","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134716/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzgzNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RR","HRV","ECG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-contact apparatus","non-contact HRV measurement apparatus","non-contact measurement of HRV","non-contact method","novel apparatus","APPARATUS DESIGN","MODS patients","respiratory signal","microwave radar monitors","spectral components of RR intervals","toxic materials","high-frequency ratio","respiratory rates","filter","cardiac signal","respiratory motion","ECG","similar power spectrum of RR intervals","biochemical hazard conditions","biochemical hazard circumstances","future pre-hospital monitoring of septic patients","low-frequency","reduction of heart rate variability","small reflected waves","secondary exposure of medical personnel","risk","development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome","mass casualties","field","subject\u0027s chest wall","healthy person","experimental animals","isolators","diagnostic test","purpose","impaired balance","human trial","sepsis","personal computer","TESTING","BACKGROUND","addition","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Here we report an expert system, which utilizes this knowledge base, for predicting localization sites of proteins only from the information on the amino acid sequence and the source origin. We collected data for 401 eukaryotic proteins with known localization sites (subcellular and extracellular) and divided them into training data and testing data. Fourteen localization sites were distinguished for animal cells and 17 for plant cells. When sorting signals were not well characterized experimentally, various sequence features were computationally derived from the training data. It was found that 66% of the training data and 59% of the testing data were correctly predicted by our expert system.

It is now possible to identify many viral respiratory pathogens directly from clinical specimens in \u003C1 hr. Rapid antigen detection promises to be of the most value in the identification of respiratory viruses 1) for which antiviral therapy is available, 2) which can be prevented by employing isolation precautions, chemoprophylaxis, and/or immunization. 3) whose presence usually is associated with acute respiratory disease, not just asymptomatic colonization, and 4) which ordinarily are not associated with concomitant bacterial infection, and thus, whose early detection may allow withholding or withdrawing antibiotics. Based on these considerations, the relative usefulness of rapid viral antigen detection of commonly encountered respiratory pathogens will be discussed. In addition, the role of rapid viral detection in diagnosis of respiratory infections in high risk versus otherwise healthy individuals will be explored.","publish_time":"2008-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cates, K.

BALB/c mice were infected with MHV3, subsequently labelled in vivo with (35)S-methionine, and then the liver preparations from both infected and non-infected animals were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Comparisons of the patterns by computer image analysis revealed 17 gene products which increased, and 8 gene products which decreased, upon virus infection in their two-dimensional gel spot intensity. We conclude that during MHV3 infection of a susceptible strain of mice, a major modification in protein synthesis occurs. The pattern alterations were not related to the virus gene products but were mostly endogenous mouse proteins. Whether these proteins are a result of a defence attempt by the animal, or are dictated by the virus in order to prevent a protective response from happening, remains to be shown.","publish_time":"2007-09-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lucchiari, M.A.; Pereira, C.A.; Kuhn, L.; Lefkovits, I.","journal":"Res Virol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135047/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzkyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus infection","virus gene products","MHV3 infection","c mice","mouse hepatitis virus","virus titres","experimental infection","days\u0027 infection","susceptible strain of mice","Susceptible BALB","non-infected animals","two-dimensional gel electrophoresis","endogenous mouse proteins","two-dimensional gel spot intensity","liver preparations","acute hepatitis","computer image analysis","major modification","patterns","g of tissue","defence attempt","protein synthesis","Comparisons","result","order","protective response","PFU","S-methionine","pattern alterations","peak"],"language":"en"},

Recent researches revealed that it, as one number of the Caliciviridae, has some specialties in its genome, its reproduction and so on. RESULTS: In this report, we firstly analyzed its genome and two open reading frameworks (ORFs) from this aspect of codon usage bias. Our researches indicated that mutation pressure rather than natural is the most important determinant in RHDV with high codon bias, and the codon usage bias is nearly contrary between ORF1 and ORF2, which is maybe one of factors regulating the expression of VP60 (encoding by ORF1) and VP10 (encoding by ORF2). Furthermore, negative selective constraints on the RHDV whole genome implied that VP10 played an important role in RHDV lifecycle. CONCLUSIONS: We conjectured that VP10 might be beneficial for the replication, release or both of virus by inducing infected cell apoptosis initiate by RHDV. According to the results of the principal component analysis for ORF2 of RSCU, we firstly separated 30 RHDV into two genotypes, and the ENC values indicated ORF1 and ORF2 were independent among the evolution of RHDV.","publish_time":"2011-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tian, Xiao-ting; Li, Bao-yu; Zhang, Liang; Jiao, Wen-qiang; Liu, Ji-xing","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eff26d8739498efca2d32fe2e66cdbebf0569c50.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3377956.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3377956/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzUyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RHDV","ENC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RHDV lifecycle","evolution of RHDV","genome","ORF1","VP10","ORF2 of RSCU","high codon bias","aspect of codon usage bias","Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus","fatal disease","pathogeny of Rabbit haemorrhagic disease","RESULTS","important determinant","important role","Recent researches","ORFs","principal component analysis","ENC values","open reading frameworks","replication","infected cell apoptosis","BACKGROUND","negative selective constraints","domestic rabbits","mutation pressure","release","specialties","expression of VP60","genotypes","Caliciviridae","factors","reproduction","report","number","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

No T cell epitopes have been previously identified in the H5N1 AIV virus nucleoprotein (NP) in chickens. For the first time, this study used homology modelling techniques to construct three-dimensional structures of the peptide-binding domains of chicken MHC class \u0399 molecules for four commonly encountered unique haplotypes, i.e., B4, B12, B15, and B19. H5N1 AIV NP was computationally parsed into octapeptides or nonapeptides according to the peptide-binding motifs of MHC class I molecules of the B4, B12, B15 and B19 haplotypes. Seventy-five peptide sequences were modelled and their MHC class I molecule-binding abilities were analysed by molecular docking. Twenty-five peptides (Ten for B4, six for B12, two for B15, and seven for B19) were predicted to be potential T cell epitopes in chicken. Nine of these peptides and one unrelated peptide were manually synthesized and their T cell responses were tested in vitro. Spleen lymphocytes were collected from SPF chickens that had been immunised with a NP-expression plasmid, pCAGGS-NP, and they were stimulated using the synthesized peptides. The secretion of chicken IFN-\u03B3 and the proliferation of CD8(\u002B) T cells were tested using an ELISA kit and flow cytometry, respectively. The significant secretion of chicken IFN-\u03B3 and proliferation of CD8(\u002B) T lymphocytes increased by 13.7% and 11.9% were monitored in cells stimulated with peptides NP(89\u201397) and NP(198\u2013206), respectively. The results indicate that peptides NP(89\u201397) (PKKTGGPIY) and NP(198\u2013206) (KRGINDRNF) are NP T cell epitopes in chicken of certain haplotypes. The method used in this investigation is applicable to predicting T cell epitopes for other antigens in chicken, while this study also extends our understanding of the mechanisms of the immune response to AIV in chicken.","publish_time":"2012-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hou, Yanxia; Guo, Yingying; Wu, Chunyan; Shen, Nan; Jiang, Yongping; Wang, Jingfei","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/68011fab7fc7a4d29797a161cb32d21ffd2a2ea7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3379973.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3379973/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzUyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC","AIV NP","NP","AIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NP T cell epitopes","peptides NP","T cell responses","potential T cell epitopes","T cells","T lymphocytes","H5N1 AIV NP","pCAGGS-NP","chicken of certain haplotypes","NP-expression plasmid","synthesized peptides","peptide-binding domains of chicken MHC class \u0399 molecules","B4","B12","B19 haplotypes","B15","peptide-binding motifs of MHC class","significant secretion of chicken IFN-\u03B3","peptide sequences","unrelated peptide","H5N1 AIV virus nucleoprotein","immune responses","proliferation of CD8","unique haplotypes","study","molecule-binding abilities","SPF chickens","Spleen lymphocytes","accurate monitoring of avian influenza virus","three-dimensional structures","homology modelling techniques","antigens","ELISA kit","rational design of vaccines","mechanisms","investigation","octapeptides","KRGINDRNF","flow cytometry","time","molecular docking","understanding","nonapeptides","method","results","PKKTGGPIY"],"language":"en"},

But while so far all bat-borne paramyxoviruses have been identified in fruit bats across Africa, Australia, South America, and Asia, we describe the detection and characterization of the first paramyxoviruses in free-ranging European bats. Moreover, we examined the possible impact of paramyxovirus infection on individual animals by comparing histo-pathological findings and virological results. Organs from deceased insectivorous bats of various species were sampled in Germany and tested for paramyxovirus RNA in parallel to a histo-pathological examination. Nucleic acids of three novel paramyxoviruses were detected, two viruses in phylogenetic relationship to the recently proposed genus Jeilongvirus and one closely related to the genus Rubulavirus. Two infected animals revealed subclinical pathological changes within their kidneys, suggestive of a similar pathogenesis as the one described in fruit bats experimentally infected with Hendra virus. Our findings indicate the presence of bat-born paramyxoviruses in geographic areas free of fruit bat species and therefore emphasize a possible virus\u2013host co-evolution in European bats. Since these novel viruses are related to the very distinct genera Rubulavirus and Jeilongvirus, a similarly broad genetic diversity among paramyxoviruses in other Microchiroptera compared to Megachiroptera can be assumed. Given that the infected bats were either found in close proximity to heavily populated human habitation or areas of intensive agricultural use, a potential risk of the emergence of zoonotic paramyxoviruses in Europe needs to be considered.","publish_time":"2012-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kurth, Andreas; Kohl, Claudia; Brinkmann, Annika; Ebinger, Arnt; Harper, Jennifer A.; Wang, Lin-Fa; M\u00FChldorfer, Kristin; Wibbelt, Gudrun","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/302f6a1a81d1ee96bb1dea1b7b2716c846ea332a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3380927.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3380927/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzUyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hendra"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa","Australia","South America","Asia","Europe","Germany"],"keyphrases":["fruit bats","infected bats","novel paramyxoviruses","European bats","zoonotic potential of paramyxoviruses","emergence of zoonotic paramyxoviruses","infected animals","novel viruses","deceased insectivorous bats of various species","histo-pathological findings","geographic areas free of fruit bat species","histo-pathological examination","possible virus","Hendra virus","presence of bat","Nipah viruses","genus Rubulavirus","subclinical pathological changes","broad host range","proposed genus Jeilongvirus","individual animals","possible impact of paramyxovirus infection","potential risk","pathogenic Hendra","paramyxovirus RNA","host co-evolution","broad genetic diversity","distinct genera Rubulavirus","areas of intensive agricultural use","populated human habitation","kidneys","Australia","close proximity","Africa","South America","phylogenetic relationship","Asia","Germany","Microchiroptera","Organs","Europe needs","virological results","similar pathogenesis","detection","Nucleic acids","characterization","Megachiroptera"],"language":"en"},

Here we describe the evolution of the respiratory compromise, ventilatory management and laboratory variables of patients with diffuse viral pneumonitis caused by pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) admitted to the ICU. METHOD: This was a multicenter, prospective inception cohort study including adult patients with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) admitted to 20 ICUs in Argentina between June and September of 2009 during the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. In a standard case-report form, we collected epidemiological characteristics, results of real-time reverse-transcriptase--polymerase-chain-reaction viral diagnostic tests, oxygenation variables, acid-base status, respiratory mechanics, ventilation management and laboratory tests. Variables were recorded on ICU admission and at days 3, 7 and 10. RESULTS: During the study period 178 patients with diffuse viral pneumonitis requiring MV were admitted. They were 44 \u00B1 15 years of age, with Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores of 18 \u00B1 7, and most frequent comorbidities were obesity (26%), previous respiratory disease (24%) and immunosuppression (16%). Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) was applied in 49 (28%) patients on admission, but 94% were later intubated. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was present throughout the entire ICU stay in the whole group (mean PaO(2)/FIO(2 )170 \u00B1 25). Tidal-volumes used were 7.8 to 8.1 ml/kg (ideal body weight), plateau pressures always remained \u003C 30 cmH(2)O, without differences between survivors and non-survivors; and mean positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels used were between 8 to 12 cm H(2)O. Rescue therapies, like recruitment maneuvers (8 to 35%), prone positioning (12 to 24%) and tracheal gas insufflation (3%) were frequently applied. At all time points, pH, platelet count, lactate dehydrogenase assay (LDH) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) differed significantly between survivors and non-survivors. Lack of recovery of platelet count and persistence of leukocytosis were characteristic of non-survivors. Mortality was high (46%); and length of MV was 10 (6 to 17) days. CONCLUSIONS: These patients had severe, hypoxemic respiratory failure compatible with ARDS that persisted over time, frequently requiring rescue therapies to support oxygenation. NIV use is not warranted, given its high failure rate. Death and evolution to prolonged mechanical ventilation were common outcomes. Persistence of thrombocytopenia, acidosis and leukocytosis, and high LDH levels found in non-survivors during the course of the disease might be novel prognostic findings.","publish_time":"2011-08-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"R\u00EDos, Fernando G; Estenssoro, Elisa; Villarejo, Fernando; Valentini, Ricardo; Aguilar, Liliana; Pezzola, Daniel; Valdez, Pascual; Blasco, Miguel; Orlandi, Cristina; Alvarez, Javier; Saldarini, Fernando; G\u00F3mez, Alejandro; G\u00F3mez, Pablo E; Deheza, Martin; Zazu, Alan; Quinteros, M\u00F3nica; Chena, Ariel; Osatnik, Javier; Violi, Damian; Gonzalez, Maria Eugenia; Chiappero, Guillermo","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fccc0f98b960c946fadce5a045b150a83e7bc5bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3387643.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3387643/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzUzMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","MV","Sequential Organ Failure Assessment","ARDS"],"locations":["Argentina"],"keyphrases":["acute respiratory failure","characteristic of non-survivors","respiratory mechanics","respiratory compromise","laboratory variables of patients","previous respiratory disease","adult patients","hypoxemic respiratory failure compatible","ventilation management","mechanical ventilation","influenza","H1N1","Acute respiratory distress syndrome","high failure rate","oxygenation variables","Non-invasive ventilation","ICU admission","diffuse viral pneumonitis","high LDH levels","platelet count","Acute Physiology","laboratory tests","ARDS","persistence of leukocytosis","Rescue therapies","evolution","pandemic","entire ICU","length of MV","days","reaction viral diagnostic tests","Sequential Organ Failure Assessment","study period","ventilatory management","Persistence of thrombocytopenia","time points","severe condition","mean PaO","NIV use","prospective inception cohort study","results of real-time reverse-transcriptase","acid-base status","lactate dehydrogenase assay","polymerase-chain","epidemiological characteristics","Chronic Health Evaluation","positive end-expiratory pressure","plateau pressures","PEEP","SOFA","acidosis","ideal body weight","standard case-report form","APACHE","group","course","differences","years of age","Lack of recovery","common outcomes","novel prognostic findings","obesity","cmH","recruitment maneuvers","infection","Death","tracheal gas insufflation","frequent comorbidities","scores","FIO","hospitalization","cases","ICUs","CONCLUSIONS","Tidal-volumes","prone positioning","INTRODUCTION","Argentina","METHOD","Mortality","immunosuppression"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we resolved the crystal structures of IPO in its apo form and in complex with carbohydrates such as methyl \u03B1-D-mannopyranoside (Me-Man), methyl \u03B1-D-glucopyranoside (Me-Glc), and methyl \u03B1-D-galactopyranoside (Me-Gal) in different space groups. The packing diagrams indicated that IPO might represent a compact tetrameric association in the JRL family. The protomer of IPO showed a canonical \u03B2-prism fold with 12 strands of \u03B2-sheets but with 2 additional short \u03B2-strands at the N terminus. A truncated IPO (\u0394N10IPO) by removing the 2 short \u03B2-strands of the N terminus was used to reveal its role in a tetrameric association. Gel filtration chromatography confirmed IPO as a tetrameric form in solution. Isothermal titration calorimetry determined the binding constants (K(A)) of IPO and \u0394N10IPO against various carbohydrates. IPO could bind to Me-Man, Me-Glc, and Me-Gal with similar binding constants. In contrast, \u0394N10IPO showed high binding ability to Me-Man and Me-Glc but could not bind to Me-Gal.

FINDINGS: We developed a real-time PCR array capable of simultaneously detecting eight human viral pathogens: human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and -2), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human T-cell leukemia virus-1 and -2 (HTLV-1 and -2), vaccinia virus (VACV) and West Nile virus (WNV). One hundred twenty (120) primers were designed using a combination of bioinformatics approaches, and, after experimental testing, 24 primer sets targeting eight viral pathogens were selected to set up the array with SYBR Green chemistry. The specificity and sensitivity of the virus-specific primer sets selected for the array were evaluated using analytical panels with known amounts of viruses spiked into human plasma. The array detected: 10 genome equivalents (geq)/ml of HIV-2 and HCV, 50 geq of HIV-1 (subtype B), HBV (genotype A) and WNV. It detected 100\u20131,000 geq/ml of plasma of HIV-1 subtypes (A \u2013 G), group N and CRF (AE and AG) isolates. Further evaluation with a panel consisting of 28 HIV-1 and HIV-2 clinical isolates revealed no cross-reactivity of HIV-1 or HIV-2 specific primers with another type of HIV. All 28 viral isolates were identified with specific primer sets targeting the most conserved genome areas. The PCR array correctly identified viral infections in a panel of 17 previously quantified clinical plasma samples positive for HIV-1, HCV or HBV at as low as several geq per PCR reaction.

Type I interferon (IFN) and cytokine production are crucial in the innate immune system. We previously reported that DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) induced low levels of interferon regulatory factor 3 and NF-\u03BAB activation, thus leading to reduced production of IFN-\u03B2 in the early phase of infection. Here, we determined whether DENV infection not only hampers type I IFN activation but also cytokine production triggered by Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used quantitative RT-PCR and found that only low levels of IFN-\u03B2 and inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 10 (IL-10), IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor \u03B1 (TNF\u03B1) mRNA were detected in DENV-2\u2013infected bone-marrow\u2013derived dendritic cells. Furthermore, DENV-2 infection repressed cytokine production triggered by TLR signaling. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this suppression event, we measured NF-\u03BAB activation by p65 nuclear translocation and luciferase reporter assay and found that NF-\u03BAB activation triggered by TLR ligands was blocked by DENV-2 infection. As well, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity was suppressed by DENV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: To downregulate the host innate immunity, DENV-2 by itself is a weak inducer of type I IFN and cytokines, furthermore DENV-2 can also block the TLR-triggered ERK\u2013NF-\u03BAB activation and cytokine production.","publish_time":"2012-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Tsung-Hsien; Chen, Siang-Ru; Yu, Chia-Yi; Lin, You-Sheng; Chen, Yao-Shen; Kubota, Toru; Matsuoka, Mayumi; Lin, Yi-Ling","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d92b7e913f313face4f704f326d15fca9a91183d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3425550.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3425550/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzU2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV","TLR","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DENV infection","DENV serotype","IFN activation","cytokine production","NF-\u03BAB activation","reduced production of IFN","TLR-triggered ERK","low levels of IFN","early phase of infection","TLR ligands","IL","low levels of interferon regulatory factor","weak inducer of type","inflammatory cytokines","innate immune system","host innate immunity","tumor necrosis factor \u03B1","p65 nuclear translocation","luciferase reporter assay","TNF\u03B1","viral disease","infected bone-marrow","common mosquito","mRNA","derived dendritic cells","human health","extracellular signal-regulated kinase","suppression event","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","quantitative RT-PCR","interleukin","activity","Dengue virus","Toll","hampers","molecular mechanisms","world","SIGNIFICANCE","BACKGROUND","receptor","METHODOLOGY","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Studies examining associations of TNF and lymphotoxin-\u03B1 (LTA) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with severe sepsis have produced conflicting results. The objective of this study was to investigate whether genetic variation in TNF, LTA, TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B was associated with susceptibility to or death from severe sepsis in Chinese Han population. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Ten SNPs in TNF, LTA, TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B were genotyped in samples of patients with severe sepsis (n = 432), sepsis (n = 384) and healthy controls (n = 624). Our results showed that rs1800629, a SNP in the promoter region of TNF, was significantly associated with risk for severe sepsis. The minor allele frequency of rs1800629 was significantly higher in severe sepsis patients than that in both healthy controls (P(adj) = 0.00046, odds ratio (OR)(adj) = 1.92) and sepsis patients (P(adj) = 0.002, OR(adj) = 1.56). Further, we investigated the correlation between rs1800629 genotypes and TNF-\u03B1 concentrations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy volunteers exposed to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) ex vivo, and the association between rs1800629 and TNF-\u03B1 serum levels in severe sepsis patients. After exposure to LPS, the TNF-\u03B1 concentration in culture supernatants of PBMCs was significantly higher in the subjects with AA\u002BAG genotypes than that with GG genotype (P = 0.007). Moreover, in patients with severe sepsis, individuals with AA\u002BAG genotypes had significantly higher TNF-\u03B1 serum concentrations than those with GG genotype (P(adj) = 0.02). However, there were no significant associations between SNPs in the four candidate genes and 30 day mortality for patients with severe sepsis.

The developed CAD system in this study is based on 1) fast localization of candidate imaging patterns using local scale information of the images, and 2) M\u00F6bius invariant feature extraction method based on learned local shape and texture properties of TIB patterns. For fast localization of candidate imaging patterns, we use ball-scale filtering and, based on the observation of the pattern of interest, a suitable scale selection is used to retain only small size patterns. Once candidate abnormality patterns are identified, we extract proposed shape features from regions where at least one candidate pattern occupies. The comparative evaluation of the proposed method with commonly used CAD methods is presented with a dataset of 60 chest CTs (laboratory confirmed 39 viral bronchiolitis human parainfluenza CTs and 21 normal chest CTs). The quantitative results are presented as the area under the receiver operator characteristics curves and a computer score (volume affected by TIB) provided as an output of the CAD system. In addition, a visual grading scheme is applied to the patient data by three well-trained radiologists.

Here we analyzed the spatial, age and temporal evolution of the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic in Chile, a southern hemisphere country covering a long and narrow strip comprising latitudes 17\u00B0S to 56\u00B0S. METHODS: We analyzed the dissemination patterns of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic across 15 regions of Chile based on daily hospitalizations for severe acute respiratory disease and laboratory confirmed A/H1N1 influenza infection from 01-May to 31-December, 2009. We explored the association between timing of pandemic onset and peak pandemic activity and several geographical and demographic indicators, school vacations, climatic factors, and international passengers. We also estimated the reproduction number (R) based on the growth rate of the exponential pandemic phase by date of symptoms onset, estimated using maximum likelihood methods. RESULTS: While earlier pandemic onset was associated with larger population size, there was no association with connectivity, demographic, school or climatic factors. In contrast, there was a latitudinal gradient in peak pandemic timing, representing a 16-39-day lag in disease activity from the southern regions relative to the northernmost region (P \u003C 0.001). Geographical differences in latitude of Chilean regions, maximum temperature and specific humidity explained 68.5% of the variability in peak timing (P = 0.01). In addition, there was a decreasing gradient in reproduction number from south to north Chile (P \u003C 0.0001). The regional mean R estimates were 1.6-2.0, 1.3-1.5, and 1.2-1.3 for southern, central and northern regions, respectively, which were not affected by the winter vacation period. CONCLUSIONS: There was a lag in the period of most intense 2009 pandemic influenza activity following a South to North traveling pattern across regions of Chile, significantly associated with geographical differences in minimum temperature and specific humidity. The latitudinal gradient in timing of pandemic activity was accompanied by a gradient in reproduction number (P \u003C 0.0001). Intensified surveillance strategies in colder and drier southern regions could lead to earlier detection of pandemic influenza viruses and improved control outcomes.","publish_time":"2012-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chowell, Gerardo; Towers, Sherry; Viboud, C\u00E9cile; Fuentes, Rodrigo; Sotomayor, Viviana; Simonsen, Lone; Miller, Mark A; Lima, Mauricio; Villarroel, Claudia; Chiu, Monica; Villarroel, Jose E; Olea, Andrea","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e3da58a0d46d88ee542720cc9e1f594a3d69a79.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4dfa5a3533ef3b79abb871f4b4132f8b654a52eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3518181.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3518181/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzY2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Chile","South","North"],"keyphrases":["H1N1 pandemic","pandemic influenza activity","timing of pandemic activity","H1N1 influenza pandemic","peak pandemic activity","timing of pandemic onset","peak pandemic timing","earlier pandemic onset","regions of Chile","exponential pandemic phase","earlier detection of pandemic influenza viruses","spatio-temporal dynamics of pandemic influenza","drier southern regions","southern regions relative","northern regions","peak timing","disease activity","north Chile","climatic factors","latitudinal gradient","H1N1 influenza infection","reproduction number","latitude of Chilean regions","Geographical differences","decreasing gradient","role of demographic factors","school vacations","demographic indicators","climatic conditions","school cycles","southern hemisphere country","maximum temperature","specific humidity","connectivity patterns","association","date of symptoms onset","maximum likelihood methods","minimum temperature","temporal evolution","dissemination patterns","day lag","North traveling pattern","winter vacation period","severe acute respiratory disease","regional mean R estimates","laboratory","daily hospitalizations","narrow strip","improved control outcomes","Intensified surveillance strategies","growth rate","northernmost region","larger population size","latitudes","variability","international passengers","age","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","addition","contrast","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The generation of secreted antigens has been studied in several viruses and suggested as a mechanism of host immune evasion through absorption of antibodies and interference with antibody-mediated clearance. However such a role has not been conclusively determined for the Ebola virus sGP. In this study, we immunized mice with DNA constructs expressing GP(1,2) and/or sGP, and demonstrate that sGP can efficiently compete for anti-GP(12) antibodies, but only from mice that have been immunized by sGP. We term this phenomenon \u201Cantigenic subversion\u201D, and propose a model whereby sGP redirects the host antibody response to focus on epitopes which it shares with membrane-bound GP(1,2), thereby allowing it to absorb anti-GP(1,2) antibodies. Unexpectedly, we found that sGP can also subvert a previously immunized host\u0027s anti-GP(1,2) response resulting in strong cross-reactivity with sGP. This finding is particularly relevant to EBOV vaccinology since it underscores the importance of eliciting robust immunity that is sufficient to rapidly clear an infection before antigenic subversion can occur. Antigenic subversion represents a novel virus escape strategy that likely helps EBOV evade host immunity, and may represent an important obstacle to EBOV vaccine design.","publish_time":"2012-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mohan, Gopi S.; Li, Wenfang; Ye, Ling; Compans, Richard W.; Yang, Chinglai","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a24f22d8d49dc503c52d43dbc51459fc06fbb14.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3521666.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3521666/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzY2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBOV","Antigenic"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ebola virus sGP","immunized host\u0027s anti-GP","antigenic subversion","membrane-bound GP","EBOV vaccinology","host immunity","host antibody response","absorption of antibodies","EBOV vaccine design","novel virus","mice","mechanism of host immune evasion","surface glycoprotein","truncated glycoprotein isoform","antibody-mediated clearance","generation of secreted antigens","importance of eliciting robust immunity","interference","production of large quantities","strategy","important obstacle","strong cross-reactivity","epitopes","model","DNA constructs","finding","infection","addition","viruses","study","phenomenon","extracellular space","role"],"language":"en"},

The cellular factors exploited by filoviruses for their spread constitute potential targets for intervention, but are incompletely defined. The viral glycoprotein (GP) mediates filovirus entry into host cells. Recent studies revealed important insights into the host cell molecules engaged by GP for cellular entry. The binding of GP to cellular lectins was found to concentrate virions onto susceptible cells and might contribute to the early and sustained infection of macrophages and dendritic cells, important viral targets. Tyrosine kinase receptors were shown to promote macropinocytic uptake of filoviruses into a subset of susceptible cells without binding to GP, while interactions between GP and human T cell Ig mucin 1 (TIM-1) might contribute to filovirus infection of mucosal epithelial cells. Moreover, GP engagement of the cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1 was demonstrated to be essential for GP-mediated fusion of the viral envelope with a host cell membrane. Finally, mutagenic and structural analyses defined GP domains which interact with these host cell factors.

The first influenza pandemic of this century was declared in April of 2009, with the emergence of a novel H1N1 IAV strain (H1N1pdm) in Mexico and USA. Understanding the extent and causes of biases in codon usage is essential to the understanding of viral evolution. A comprehensive study to investigate the effect of selection pressure imposed by the human host on the codon usage of an emerging, pandemic IAV strain and the trends in viral codon usage involved over the pandemic time period is much needed. RESULTS: We performed a comprehensive codon usage analysis of 310 IAV strains from the pandemic of 2009. Highly biased codon usage for Ala, Arg, Pro, Thr and Ser were found. Codon usage is strongly influenced by underlying biases in base composition. When correspondence analysis (COA) on relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) is applied, the distribution of IAV ORFs in the plane defined by the first two major dimensional factors showed that different strains are located at different places, suggesting that IAV codon usage also reflects an evolutionary process. CONCLUSIONS: A general association between codon usage bias, base composition and poor adaptation of the virus to the respective host tRNA pool, suggests that mutational pressure is the main force shaping H1N1 pdm IAV codon usage. A dynamic process is observed in the variation of codon usage of the strains enrolled in these studies. These results suggest a balance of mutational bias and natural selection, which allow the virus to explore and re-adapt its codon usage to different environments. Recoding of IAV taking into account codon bias, base composition and adaptation to host tRNA may provide important clues to develop new and appropriate vaccines.","publish_time":"2012-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Go\u00F1i, Natalia; Iriarte, Andr\u00E9s; Comas, Victoria; So\u00F1ora, Mart\u00EDn; Moreno, Pilar; Moratorio, Gonzalo; Musto, H\u00E9ctor; Cristina, Juan","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9bd892682a0ebb3ab1361af5b375bbc11aa6d8b1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3543350.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3543350/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzcwMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ser"],"organizations":["IAV"],"locations":["Mexico"],"keyphrases":["codon usage bias","viral codon usage","variation of codon usage","biased codon usage","comprehensive codon usage analysis","H1N1 pdm IAV codon usage","relative synonymous codon usage","account codon bias","IAV strains","pandemic IAV strain","Recoding of IAV","distribution of IAV ORFs","novel H1N1 IAV strain","base composition","different strains","virus","influenza pandemic","different places","mutational pressure","balance of mutational bias","different environments","pandemic time period","human host","RESULTS","respective host tRNA pool","understanding of viral evolution","poor adaptation","underlying biases","correspondence analysis","comprehensive study","evolutionary process","dynamic process","effect of selection pressure","main force","Arg","H1N1pdm","COA","single-stranded RNA genome","trends","general association","segments","important clues","RSCU","negative polarity","major dimensional factors","Thr","plane","Mexico","member","emergence","appropriate vaccines","family Orthomyxoviridae","Ser","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","century","extent","studies"],"language":"en"},

HIV-1 patients benefit from a coinfection with GB Virus C (GBV-C), since HIV-positive individuals with long-term GBV-C viraemia show better survival rates than HIV-1 patients without persisting GBV-C. A direct influence of GBV-C on HIV-1 replication has been shown in coinfection experiments. GBV-C is a human non-pathogenic member of the flaviviridae family that can replicate in T and B cells. Therefore, GBV-C shares partly the same ecological niche with HIV-1. In earlier work we have demonstrated that recombinant glycoprotein E2 of GBV-C and peptides derived from the E2 N-terminus interfere with HIV entry. In this study we investigated the underlying mechanism. Performing a virus-cell fusion assay and temperature-arrested HIV-infection kinetics, we provide evidence that the HIV-inhibitory E2 peptides interfere with late HIV-1 entry steps after the engagement of gp120 with CD4 receptor and coreceptor. Binding and competition experiments revealed that the N-terminal E2 peptides bind to the disulfide loop region of HIV-1 transmembrane protein gp41. In conjunction with computational analyses, we identified sequence similarities between the N-termini of GBV-C E2 and the HIV-1 glycoprotein gp120. This similarity appears to enable the GBV-C E2 N-terminus to interact with the HIV-1 gp41 disulfide loop, a crucial domain involved in the gp120-gp41 interface. Furthermore, the results of the present study provide initial proof of concept that peptides targeted to the gp41 disulfide loop are able to inhibit HIV fusion and should inspire the development of this new class of HIV-1 entry inhibitors.","publish_time":"2013-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eissmann, Kristin; Mueller, Sebastian; Sticht, Heinrich; Jung, Susan; Zou, Peng; Jiang, Shibo; Gross, Andrea; Eichler, Jutta; Fleckenstein, Bernhard; Reil, Heide","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/54cbbaf44335fdc1995cb19e5a08779929fd0966.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3551756.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3551756/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzcwOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HIV entry","HIV fusion","late HIV","GBV-C shares","HIV-inhibitory E2 peptides","GBV-C E2 N-terminus","HIV-positive individuals","new class of HIV","disulfide loop region of HIV","long-term GBV-C viraemia","recombinant glycoprotein E2 of GBV","GB Virus C","N-terminal E2 peptides","direct influence of GBV","temperature-arrested HIV-infection kinetics","gp41 disulfide loop","gp120-gp41 interface","N-termini","glycoprotein gp120","engagement of gp120","entry steps","transmembrane protein gp41","entry inhibitors","patients","coinfection experiments","virus-cell fusion assay","present study","competition experiments","elucidation","better survival rates","initial proof of concept","human non-pathogenic member","crucial domain","flaviviridae family","sequence similarities","evidence","development","antiviral drug discovery","imitation of viral interference mechanisms","computational analyses","CD4 receptor","ecological niche","replication","strategy","results","coreceptor","earlier work","B cells","conjunction","underlying mechanism","Binding","similarity"],"language":"en"},

It was originally thought that viral peptides are liberated during constitutive protein turnover, but this conflicts with the observation that viral epitopes are detected within minutes of their synthesis even when their source proteins exhibit half-lives of days. The DRiPs hypothesis proposes that epitopes derive from Defective Ribosomal Products (DRiPs), rather than degradation of mature protein products. One potential source of DRiPs is premature translation termination. If this is a major source of DRiPs, this should be reflected in positional bias towards the N-terminus. By contrast, if downstream initiation is a major source of DRiPs, there should be positional bias towards the C-terminus. Here, we systematically assessed positional bias of epitopes in viral antigens, exploiting the large set of data available in the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource. We show a statistically significant degree of positional skewing among epitopes; epitopes from both ends of antigens tend to be under-represented. Centric-skewing correlates with a bias towards class I binding peptides being over-represented in the middle, in parallel with a higher degree of evolutionary conservation.","publish_time":"2013-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Yohan; Yewdell, Jonathan W.; Sette, Alessandro; Peters, Bjoern","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1ca045bd7724943ce8c268353153bd522358625d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3554532.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3554532/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzcxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC","Defective Ribosomal Products"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["positional bias of epitopes","viral epitopes","major source of DRiPs","potential source of DRiPs","DRiPs hypothesis","T-cell epitopes","viral antigens","viral peptides","significant degree of positional skewing","source proteins exhibit half-lives of days","MHC class","ends of antigens","immune system","degradation of mature protein products","N-terminus","C-terminus","Immune Epitope Database","constitutive protein turnover","Defective Ribosomal Products","Centric-skewing correlates","higher degree of evolutionary conservation","conflicts","large set of data available","intracellular infections","premature translation termination","downstream initiation","middle","Analysis Resource","synthesis","infected cells","minutes","observation","contrast"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We performed a prospective study of patients admitted to three adult ICUs of our hospital from December 2010 to February 2011. All tracheal aspirate (TA) samples sent to the microbiology department were systematically screened for influenza. We defined influenza as unsuspected if testing was not requested and the patient was not receiving empirical antiviral therapy after sample collection. RESULTS: We received TA samples from 105 patients. Influenza was detected in 31 patients and was classified as unsuspected in 15 (48.4%) patients, and as hospital acquired in 13 (42%) patients. Suspected and unsuspected cases were compared, and significant differences were found for age (53 versus 69 median years), severe respiratory failure (68.8% versus 20%), surgery (6.3% versus 60%), median days of ICU stay before diagnosis (1 versus 4), nosocomial infection (18.8% versus 66.7%), cough (93.8% versus 53.3%), localized infiltrate on chest radiograph (6.3% versus 40%), median days to antiviral treatment (2 versus 9), pneumonia (93.8% versus 53.3%), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (75% versus 26.7%). Multivariate analysis showed admission to the surgical ICU (odds ratio (OR), 37.1; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.1 to 666.6; P = 0.01) and localized infiltrate on chest radiograph (OR, 27.8; 95% CI, 1.3 to 584.1; P = 0.03) to be independent risk factors for unsuspected influenza. Overall mortality at 30 days was 29%. ICU admission for severe respiratory failure was an independent risk factor for poor outcome. CONCLUSION: During the influenza season, almost one third of critical patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection had influenza, and in 48.4%, the influenza was unsuspected.

The focus is on folded \u03B2-hairpin mimetics, which are designed to mimic \u03B2-hairpin motifs in biologically important peptides and proteins. An ever-growing number of protein crystal structures reveal how \u03B2-hairpin motifs often play key roles in protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013nucleic acid interactions. This review illustrates how using protein structures as a starting point for small-molecule mimetic design can provide novel ligands as protein\u2013protein interaction inhibitors, as protease inhibitors, and as ligands for chemokine receptors and folded RNA targets, as well as novel antibiotics to combat the growing health threat posed by the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The \u03B2-hairpin antibiotics are shown to target a \u03B2-barrel outer membrane protein (LptD) in Pseudomonas sp., which is essential for the biogenesis of the outer cell membrane. Another exciting prospect is that protein epitope mimetics will be of increasing importance in synthetic vaccine design, in the emerging field of structural vaccinology. Crystal structures of protective antibodies bound to their pathogen-derived epitopes provide an ideal starting point for the design of synthetic epitope mimetics. The mimetics can be delivered to the immune system in a highly immunogenic format on the surface of synthetic virus-like particles.

Inflammatory responses to cancer can also contribute directly to oncogenesis. Since the immune system is hardwired to protect the host, there is a possibility that cancers, regardless of their histological origins, endow themselves with a common and shared inflammatory cancer-associated molecular pattern (iCAMP) to promote oncoinflammation. However, the definition of iCAMP has not been conceptually and experimentally investigated. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Genome-wide cDNA expression data was analyzed for 221 normal and 324 cancer specimens from 7 cancer types: breast, prostate, lung, colon, gastric, oral and pancreatic. A total of 96 inflammatory genes with consistent dysregulation were identified, including 44 up-regulated and 52 down-regulated genes. Protein expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry for some of these genes. The iCAMP contains proteins whose roles in cancer have been implicated and others which are yet to be appreciated. The clinical significance of many iCAMP genes was confirmed in multiple independent cohorts of colon and ovarian cancer patients. In both cases, better prognosis correlated strongly with high CXCL13 and low level of GREM1, LOX, TNFAIP6, CD36, and EDNRA. An \u201CInflammatory Gene Integrated Score\u201D was further developed from the combination of 18 iCAMP genes in ovarian cancer, which predicted overall survival. Noticeably, as a selective nuclear import protein whose immuno-regulatory function just begins to emerge, karyopherin alpha 2 (KPNA2) is uniformly up-regulated across cancer types. For the first time, the cancer-specific up-regulation of KPNA2 and its clinical significance were verified by tissue microarray analysis in colon and head-neck cancers. CONCLUSION: This work defines an inflammatory signature shared by seven epithelial cancer types and KPNA2 as a consistently up-regulated protein in cancer. Identification of iCAMP may not only serve as a novel biomarker for prognostication and individualized treatment of cancer, but also have significant biological implications.","publish_time":"2013-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rachidi, Saleh M.; Qin, Tingting; Sun, Shaoli; Zheng, W.

However, the lack of a safe and efficient oral delivery system restricts its clinical application. Here, we constructed alginic acid-coated chitosan nanoparticles (A.C.NPs) as an oral delivery carrier for a legumain DNA vaccine. First, we tested its characteristic in acidic environments in vitro. DNA agarose electrophoresis data show that A.C.NPs protected DNA better from degradation in acidic solution (pH 1.5) than did chitosan nanoparticles (C.NPs). Furthermore, size distribution analysis showed that A.C.NPs tended to aggregate and form micrometer scale complexes in pH\u003C2.7, while dispersing into nanoparticles with an increase in pH. Mice were intragastrically administrated A.C.NPs carrying EGFP plasmids and EGFP expression was detected in the intestinal Peyer\u2019s patches. Full-length legumain plasmids were loaded into different delivery carriers, including C.NPs, attenuated Salmonella typhimurium and A.C.NPs. A.C.NPs loaded with empty plasmids served as a control. Oral vaccination was performed in the murine orthotopic 4T1 breast cancer model. Our data indicate that tumor volume was significantly smaller in groups using A.C.NPs or attenuated Salmonella typhimurium as carriers.

We sought to determine if co-infection with pandemic 2009\u20132010 influenza A H1N1 (pH1N1) and another respiratory virus was associated with worse clinical outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed of all hospitalized patients with a positive respiratory viral panel (RVP) for two or more viruses within 72 hours of admission at our institution from October 2009 to December 2009. We compared patients infected with one respiratory virus to those with respiratory viral co-infection. RESULTS: We identified 617 inpatients with a positive RVP sample with a single virus and 49 inpatients with a positive RVP sample for two viruses (i.e. co-infection). Co-infected patients were significantly younger, more often had fever/chills, tachypnea, and they more often demonstrated interstitial opacities suggestive of viral pneumonia on the presenting chest radiograph (OR 7.5, 95% CI 3.4\u201316.5). The likelihood of death, length of stay, and requirement for intensive care unit level of care were similar in both groups, but patients with any respiratory virus co-infection were more likely to experience complications, particularly treatment for a secondary bacterial pneumonia (OR 6.8, 95% CI 3.3\u201314.2). Patients co-infected with pH1N1 and another respiratory virus were more likely to present with chest radiograph changes suggestive of a viral pneumonia, compared to mono-infection with pH1N1 (OR 16.9, 95% CI 4.5\u201362.7). By logistic regression using mono-infection with non-PH1N1 viruses as the reference group, co-infection with pH1N1 was the strongest independent predictor of treatment for a secondary bacterial pneumonia (OR 17.8, 95% CI 6.7\u201347.1). CONCLUSION: Patients with viral co-infection, particularly with pH1N1, were more likely to have chest radiograph features compatible with a viral pneumonia and complications during their hospital course, particularly treatment for secondary bacterial pneumonia.

However, how these genes evolved and to what extent they diverged in humans remain to be investigated specifically. Based on syntenic mapping of chordate genomes, we reveal that diverging homologs with a prototypic CEACAM architecture\u2013including an extracellular domain with immunoglobulin variable and constant domain-like regions, and an intracellular domain containing ITAM motif\u2013are present from cartilaginous fish to humans, but are absent in sea lamprey, cephalochordate or urochordate. Interestingly, the CEACAM/PSG gene inventory underwent radical divergence in various vertebrate lineages: from zero in avian species to dozens in therian mammals. In addition, analyses of genetic variations in human populations showed the presence of various types of copy number variations (CNVs) at the CEACAM/PSG locus. These copy number polymorphisms have 3\u201380% frequency in select populations, and encompass single to more than six PSG genes. Furthermore, we found that CEACAM/PSG genes contain a significantly higher density of nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) compared to the chromosome average, and many CEACAM/PSG SNPs exhibit high population differentiation. Taken together, our study suggested that CEACAM/PSG genes have had a more dynamic evolutionary history in vertebrates than previously thought. Given that CEACAM/PSGs play important roles in maternal\u2013fetal interaction and pathogen recognition, these data have laid the groundwork for future analysis of adaptive CEACAM/PSG genotype-phenotypic relationships in normal and complicated pregnancies as well as other etiologies.","publish_time":"2013-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Chia Lin; Semyonov, Jenia; Cheng, Po Jen; Huang, Shang Yu; Park, Jae Il; Tsai, Huai-Jen; Lin, Cheng-Yung; Gr\u00FCtzner, Frank; Soong, Yung Kuei; Cai, James J.; Hsu, Sheau Yu Teddy","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/145bb000d606bc2ea82e7e11f79363796bc9b7b1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3628338.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3628338/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozc3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CEACAM/PSG","PSG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PSG genes","PSG SNPs","PSG locus","prototypic CEACAM architecture","PSG gene inventory","future analysis of adaptive CEACAM","PSG genotype-phenotypic relationships","extracellular domain","important roles","constant domain","intracellular domain","PSGs","humans","presence of various types of copy number variations","copy number polymorphisms","fetal interaction","pathogen recognition","human populations","therian mammals","maternal interactions","various vertebrate lineages","regulation of pathogen transmission","analyses of genetic variations","higher density of nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism","CEACAMs","radical divergence","carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecules","turnover","CNVs","pregnancy-specific glycoproteins","avian species","ITAM motif","immunoglobulin variable","complicated pregnancies","cartilaginous fish","tumorigenesis","data","insulin","groundwork","regions","sea lamprey","high population differentiation","dozens","dynamic evolutionary history","homologs","chromosome average","syntenic mapping of chordate genomes","urochordate","vertebrates","addition","study","etiologies","frequency","extent"],"language":"en"},

We introduce such an outbreak threshold (T(0)), and find that for large and homogeneous host populations, in which the pathogen has a reproductive ratio R(0), on the order of 1/Log(R(0)) infected individuals are needed to prevent stochastic fade-out during the early stages of an epidemic.

We hypothesized that this approach would result in more robust cellular immune responses than those achieved with the use of any of the vaccines alone in a homologous prime-boost regimen. To this end, we primed BALB/c mice with each of the NSV-based vectors. Primed mice were rested for thirty-five days after which we administered a second immunization with the same or heterologous NSV-Gag viruses. The magnitude and quality of the Gag-specific CD8(\u002B) T cells in response to these vectors post boost were measured. In addition, we performed challenge experiments using vaccinia virus expressing HIV-1 Gag (VV-Gag) thirty-three days after the boost inoculation. Our results showed that the choice of the vaccine used for priming was important for the detected Gag-specific CD8(\u002B) T cell recall responses post boost and that NDV-Gag appeared to result in a more robust recall of CD8(\u002B) T cell responses independent of the prime vaccine used. However, the different prime-boost strategies were not distinct for the parameters studied in the challenge experiments using VV-Gag but did indicate some benefits compared to single immunizations. Taken together, our data show that NSV vectors can individually stimulate HIV-Gag specific CD8(\u002B) T cells that are effectively recalled by other NSV vectors in a heterologous prime-boost approach.

Enteroviruses are genetically highly variable, and recombination between serotypes is known to be a major contribution to their diversity. Recently it was reported that recombination events in HRVs cause the diversity of HRV-C. This study analyzed parts of the viral genes spanning the 5\u2032 non- coding region (NCR) through to the viral protein (VP) encoding sequences of 105 HRV field isolates from 51 outpatient cases of Acute Respiratory Infectious Network (ARINET) and 54 inpatient cases of severe lower respiratory infection (SLRI) surveillance, in order to identify recombination in field samples. When analyzing parts of the 5\u2032NCR and VP4/VP2 encoding sequences, we found intra- and interspecies recombinants in field strains of HRV-A and -C. Nineteen cases of recombination events (18.1%) were found among 105 field strains. For HRV-A, there were five cases (4.8%) of intraspecies recombination events and three cases (2.8%) of interspecies recombination events. For HRV-C, there were four cases (3.8%) of intraspecies recombination events and seven cases (6.7%) of interspecies recombination events. Recombination events were significantly more frequently observed in the ARINET samples (18 cases) than in the SLRI samples (1 case; P\u003C 0.0001).

In particular, a protective mAb directed against conserved regions can play a key role in immunogen design and in human therapy as well. Experimental approaches aiming to characterize protective mAb epitopes or to identify T-cell-activating peptides are often burdened by technical limitations and can require long time to be correctly addressed. Thus, in the last decade many epitope predictive algorithms have been developed. These algorithms are continually evolving, and their use to address the empirical research is widely increasing. Here, we review several strategies based on experimental techniques alone or addressed by in silico analysis that are frequently used to predict immunogens to be included in novel epitope-based vaccine approaches.

Dysregulation in host\u2013commensal interactions has been implicated as the central pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which predisposes to developing colorectal cancer. Recent animal studies have begun to outline some unique physiology and pathology involving each PRR signaling in the intestine. The major roles played by PRRs in the gut appear to be the regulation of the number and the composition of commensal bacteria, epithelial proliferation, and mucosal permeability in response to epithelial injury. In addition, PRR signaling in lamina propria immune cells may be involved in induction of inflammation in response to invasion of pathogens. Because some PRR-deficient mice have shown variable susceptibility to colitis, the outcome of intestinal inflammation may be modified depending on PRR signaling in epithelial cells, immune cells, and the composition of commensal flora. Through recent findings in animal models of IBD, this review will discuss how abnormal PRR signaling may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammation and inflammation-associated tumorigenesis in the intestine.

It is time-consuming and expensive to determine whether a drug and a GPCR are to interact with each other in a cellular network purely by means of experimental techniques. Although some computational methods were developed in this regard based on the knowledge of the 3D (dimensional) structure of protein, unfortunately their usage is quite limited because the 3D structures for most GPCRs are still unknown. To overcome the situation, a sequence-based classifier, called \u201CiGPCR-drug\u201D, was developed to predict the interactions between GPCRs and drugs in cellular networking. In the predictor, the drug compound is formulated by a 2D (dimensional) fingerprint via a 256D vector, GPCR by the PseAAC (pseudo amino acid composition) generated with the grey model theory, and the prediction engine is operated by the fuzzy K-nearest neighbour algorithm. Moreover, a user-friendly web-server for iGPCR-drug was established at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iGPCR-Drug/. For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a step-by-step guide is provided on how to use the web-server to get the desired results without the need to follow the complicated math equations presented in this paper just for its integrity. The overall success rate achieved by iGPCR-drug via the jackknife test was 85.5%, which is remarkably higher than the rate by the existing peer method developed in 2010 although no web server was ever established for it. It is anticipated that iGPCR-Drug may become a useful high throughput tool for both basic research and drug development, and that the approach presented here can also be extended to study other drug \u2013 target interaction networks.","publish_time":"2013-08-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Xuan; Min, Jian-Liang; Wang, Pu; Chou, Kuo-Chen","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db7b6440cfdfd2bbf71c22361d4ea606a16d4643.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3754978.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3754978/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozg5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["iGPCR-drug","drug development","drug compound","GPCRs","web server","D vector","D structures","user-friendly web-server","G-protein","structure of protein","experimental scientists","experimental techniques","cellular networking","overall success rate","sequence-based classifier","frequent targets of therapeutic drugs","PseAAC","basic research","useful high throughput tool","respiratory disorders","pseudo amino acid composition","need","diabetes","grey model theory","prediction engine","paper","complicated math equations","cancer","fingerprint","existing peer method","desired results","regard","nearest neighbour algorithm","step-by-step guide","situation","usage","target interaction networks","receptors","knowledge","interactions","jackknife test","computational methods","diseases","convenience","predictor","approach","integrity"],"language":"en"},

A detailed description and quantification of contacts in hospitals provides key information for HAIs epidemiology and for the design and validation of control measures. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used wearable sensors to detect close-range interactions (\u201Ccontacts\u201D) between individuals in the geriatric unit of a university hospital. Contact events were measured with a spatial resolution of about 1.5 meters and a temporal resolution of 20 seconds. The study included 46 HCWs and 29 patients and lasted for 4 days and 4 nights. 14,037 contacts were recorded overall, 94.1% of which during daytime. The number and duration of contacts varied between mornings, afternoons and nights, and contact matrices describing the mixing patterns between HCW and patients were built for each time period. Contact patterns were qualitatively similar from one day to the next. 38% of the contacts occurred between pairs of HCWs and 6 HCWs accounted for 42% of all the contacts including at least one patient, suggesting a population of individuals who could potentially act as super-spreaders. CONCLUSIONS: Wearable sensors represent a novel tool for the measurement of contact patterns in hospitals. The collected data can provide information on important aspects that impact the spreading patterns of infectious diseases, such as the strong heterogeneity of contact numbers and durations across individuals, the variability in the number of contacts during a day, and the fraction of repeated contacts across days. This variability is however associated with a marked statistical stability of contact and mixing patterns across days. Our results highlight the need for such measurement efforts in order to correctly inform mathematical models of HAIs and use them to inform the design and evaluation of prevention strategies.","publish_time":"2013-09-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vanhems, Philippe; Barrat, Alain; Cattuto, Ciro; Pinton, Jean-Fran\u00E7ois; Khanafer, Nagham; R\u00E9gis, Corinne; Kim, Byeul-a; Comte, Brigitte; Voirin, Nicolas","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cad994637f061356cd5ea11a7570b2f5ad38ed47.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3770639.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3770639/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzkxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCW"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of contacts","quantification of contacts","duration of contacts","measurement of contact patterns","patients","fraction of repeated contacts","mixing patterns","contact matrices","Contact events","pairs of HCWs","days","strong heterogeneity of contact numbers","marked statistical stability of contact","hospitals","spreading patterns of infectious diseases","wearable sensors","design","population of individuals","variability","nights","important aspects","key information","measurement efforts","HAIs epidemiology","university hospital","spatial resolution","temporal resolution","important routes of transmission","mathematical models of HAIs","durations","novel tool","health care workers","order","need","meters","geriatric unit","close-range interactions","collected data","detailed description","validation of control measures","evaluation of prevention strategies","infections","FINDINGS","CONCLUSIONS","mornings","BACKGROUND","seconds","METHODS","results","time period","study","daytime","spreaders"],"language":"en"},

The administration of poly(I:C) plus D-galactosamine (D-GalN) in mice led to acute liver injury associated with the induction of IL-33 expression in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) and vascular endothelial cells (VEC), while the administration of poly(I:C) alone led to hepatocyte specific IL-33 expression in addition to vascular IL-33 expression. The hepatocyte-specific IL-33 expression was down-regulated in NK-depleted poly(I:C) treated mice suggesting a partial regulation of IL-33 by NK cells. The CD1d KO (NKT deficient) mice showed hepatoprotection against poly(I:C)-induced hepatitis in association with increased number of IL-33 expressing hepatocytes in CD1d KO mice than WT controls. These results suggest that hepatocyte-specific IL-33 expression in poly(I:C) induced liver injury was partially dependent of NK cells and with limited role of NKT cells. In parallel, the L2-MHV3 infection in mice induced fulminant hepatitis associated with up-regulated IL-33 expression as well as pro-inflammatory cytokine microenvironment in liver. The LSEC and VEC expressed inducible expression of IL-33 following L2-MHV3 infection but the hepatocyte-specific IL-33 expression was only evident between 24 to 32h of post infection. In conclusion, the alarmin cytokine IL-33 was over-expressed during fulminant hepatitis in mice with LSEC, VEC and hepatocytes as potential sources of IL-33.","publish_time":"2013-09-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arshad, Muhammad Imran; Patrat-Delon, Sol\u00E8ne; Piquet-Pellorce, Claire; L\u2019Helgoualc\u2019h, Annie; Rauch, Michel; Genet, Valentine; Lucas-Clerc, Catherine; Bleau, Christian; Lamontagne, Lucie; Samson, Michel","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4ea57e72c426571255c1c45861db4c6b46b95d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3772926.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3772926/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzkxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["KO"],"organizations":["NK","NKT","LSEC","VEC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vascular IL","regulated IL","inducible expression of IL","induction of IL","hepatocyte specific IL","hepatocyte-specific IL","cellular sources of IL","potential sources of IL","alarmin cytokine IL","increased number of IL","partial regulation of IL","induced hepatitis","administration of poly","murine fulminant hepatitis","CD1d KO mice","NK-depleted poly","liver sinusoidal endothelial cells","LSEC","sera of viral hepatitis patients","vascular endothelial cells","VEC","dependent of NK cells","liver pathologies","acute liver injury","pathogenic mouse hepatitis virus","following L2-MHV3 infection","limited role of NKT cells","hepatocytes","viral mimetic","h of post infection","NKT deficient","D-GalN","D-galactosamine","pro-inflammatory cytokine microenvironment","human","Toll","association","addition","TLR3","receptor","hepatoprotection","WT controls","levels","conclusion","results","ST2 axis"],"language":"en"},

Here we present an approach to strengthen the biosafety of gain-of-function influenza experiments. We exploit species-specific endogenous small RNAs to restrict influenza A virus tropism. In particular, we found that the microRNA miR-192 was expressed in primary human respiratory tract epithelial cells as well as mouse lungs but absent from the ferret respiratory tract. Incorporation of miR-192 target sites into influenza A virus did not prevent influenza replication and transmissibility in ferrets, but did attenuate influenza pathogenicity in mice.

In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of synonymous codon usage bias in 41 available TTSuV2 coding sequences (CDS), and compared the codon usage patterns of TTSuV2 and TTSuV1. TTSuV codon usage patterns were found to be phylogenetically conserved. Values for the effective number of codons (ENC) indicated that the overall extent of codon usage bias in both TTSuV2 and TTSuV1 was not significant, the most frequently occurring codons had an A or C at the third codon position. Correspondence analysis (COA) was performed and TTSuV2 and TTSuV1 sequences were located in different quadrants of the first two major axes. A plot of the ENC revealed that compositional constraint was the major factor determining the codon usage bias for TTSuV2. In addition, hierarchical cluster analysis of 41 TTSuV2 isolates based on relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values suggested that there was no association between geographic distribution and codon bias of TTSuV2 sequences. Finally, the comparison of RSCU for TTSuV2, TTSuV1 and the corresponding host sequence indicated that the codon usage pattern of TTSuV2 was similar to that of TTSuV1. However the similarity was low for each virus and its host.

These gene lesions unexpectedly resulted in the retention of the downstream introns, thereby increasing the length of the dystrophin mRNA by 20.2 and 36 kb, respectively. Splice-switching antisense oligomers targeted to exon 16 excised this in-frame exon and the following intron from the patient dystrophin transcript very efficiently in vitro, thereby restoring the reading frame and allowing synthesis of near-normal levels of a putatively functional dystrophin isoform. In contrast, targeting splice-switching oligomers to exon 45 in patient cells promoted only modest levels of an out-of-frame dystrophin transcript after transfection at high oligomer concentrations, whereas dual targeting of exons 44 and 45 or 45 and 46 resulted in more efficient exon skipping, with concomitant removal of intron 45.

Medical advances have led to an increase in the world\u0027s population of immunosuppressed individuals. The most severely immunocompromised patients are those who have been diagnosed with a hematologic malignancy, solid organ tumor, or who have other conditions that require immunosuppressive therapies and/or solid organ or stem cell transplants. Materials and methods. Medically attended patients with a positive clinical diagnosis of influenza were recruited prospectively and clinically evaluated. Nasal washes and serum were collected. Evaluation of viral shedding, nasal and serum cytokines, clinical illness, and clinical outcomes were performed to compare severely immunocompromised individuals to nonimmunocompromised individuals with influenza infection. Results. Immunocompromised patients with influenza had more severe disease/complications, longer viral shedding, and more antiviral resistance while demonstrating less clinical symptoms and signs on clinical assessment. Conclusions. Immunocompromised patients are at risk for more severe or complicated influenza induced disease, which may be difficult to prevent with existing vaccines and antiviral treatments. Specific issues to consider when managing a severely immunocompromised host include the development of asymptomatic shedding, multi-drug resistance during prolonged antiviral therapy, and the potential high risk of pulmonary involvement.

Previous work has suggested that SJL/J mice immunize with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2), the major mitochondrial autoantigen of PBC, leads to the development of lymphoid cell infiltration in portal tracts and a model system coined autoimmune cholangitis. We hypothesized that this pathology would be augmented if immunization occurred in the presence of IFN-\u03B3 injections. Accordingly, SJL/J mice were immunized with PDC-E2 and, for purpose of control, \u03B1-casein. Subgroups of mice were also treated with exogenous IFN-\u03B3. As expected, mice immunized with PDC-E2, with or without IFN-\u03B3, developed high titer AMAs. In contrast, mice immunized with \u03B1-casein, develop antinuclear antibodies. More importantly, the livers from mice immunized with PDC-E2 and/or those immunized with \u03B1-casein all displayed lymphoid cell infiltration to the portal tracts, irrespective of bile duct size. Indeed, there was no significant difference between the experimental and the control groups by histologic analysis. Thus, autoimmune cholangitis in these mice is antigen non-specific.","publish_time":"2002-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sasaki, Motoko; Allina, Jorge; Odin, Joseph A.; Thung, Swan N.; Coppel, Ross; Nakanuma, Yasuni; Gershwin, M.

These systems are very useful to collect data, but cannot be used to forecast the probable spread of the virus in coming years. Such forecasts, if proven reliable, would permit preventive measures to be put into place at the appropriate level of expected risk and at the appropriate time. It is within this context that the Multi-Agent GeoSimulation approach has been selected to develop a system that simulates the interactions of populations of mosquitoes and birds over space and time in relation to the spread and transmission of WNV. This simulation takes place in a virtual mapping environment representing a large administrative territory (e.g. province, state) and carried out under various climate scenarios in order to simulate the effects of vector control measures such as larviciding at scales of 1/20 000 or smaller. RESULTS: After setting some hypotheses, a conceptual model and system architecture were developed to describe the population dynamics and interactions of mosquitoes (genus Culex) and American crows, which were chosen as the main actors in the simulation. Based on a mathematical compartment model used to simulate the population dynamics, an operational prototype was developed for the Southern part of Quebec (Canada). The system allows users to modify the parameters of the model, to select various climate and larviciding scenarios, to visualize on a digital map the progression (on a weekly or daily basis) of the infection in and around the crows\u0027 roosts and to generate graphs showing the evolution of the populations. The basic units for visualisation are municipalities. CONCLUSION: In all likelihood this system might be used to support short term decision-making related to WNV vector control measures, including the use of larvicides, according to climatic scenarios. Once fully calibrated in several real-life contexts, this promising approach opens the door to the study and management of other zoonotic diseases such as Lyme disease.","publish_time":"2008-07-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bouden, Mondher; Moulin, Bernard; Gosselin, Pierre","journal":"Int J Health Geogr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da2c2eff11689e4e5e34ed7f9a2373a81b68cac5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2492840.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2492840/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzU1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["West Nile","North America"],"keyphrases":["WNV vector control measures","larviciding scenarios","system architecture","various climate scenarios","effects of vector control measures","interactions of mosquitoes","place","transmission of WNV","preventive measures","population dynamics","interactions of populations","appropriate time","conceptual model","climatic scenarios","mathematical compartment model","promising approach","surveillance systems","probable spread","West Nile virus","appropriate level of expected risk","Multi-Agent GeoSimulation approach","epizooty","large administrative territory","virtual mapping environment","birds","genus Culex","short term decision-making","zoonotic diseases","study","relation","space","order","public health authorities","use of larvicides","infection","progression","management","province","graphs","expansion","door","state","operational prototype","hypotheses","scales","daily basis","American crows","coming years","basic units","visualisation","municipalities","crows\u0027 roosts","Lyme disease","digital map","North America","real-life contexts","parameters","Quebec","Canada","main actors","data","evolution","CONCLUSION","likelihood","users","forecasts","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

We found that the basic reproductive number for rabies, R(0), is very low in our study area in rural Africa (\u223C1.2) and throughout its historic global range (\u003C2). This finding provides strong support for the feasibility of controlling endemic canine rabies by vaccination, even near wildlife areas with large wild carnivore populations. However, we show that rapid turnover of domestic dog populations has been a major obstacle to successful control in developing countries, thus regular pulse vaccinations will be required to maintain population-level immunity between campaigns.

Each oligonucleotide was 29 bases long, starting at every 5th base of every sequence, resulting in an overlap of 24 bases in two consecutive oligonucleotides. The applicability of the array for virus identification was examined using PCR amplified products from multiple HAV and CV strains. PCR products labeled with biotin were hybridized to the array, and the biotin was detected using a brief reaction with Cy3-labeled streptavidin, the array subjected to laser scanning, and the hybridization data plotted as fluorescence intensity against each oligonucleotide in the array. The combined signal intensities of all probes representing a particular strain of virus were calculated and plotted against all virus strains identified on a linear representation of the array. The profile of the total signal intensity identified the strain that is most likely represented in the amplified cDNA target. The results obtained with HAV and CV indicated that the hybridization profile thus generated can be used to identify closely related viral strains. This represents a significant improvement over current methods for virus identification using PCR amplification and amplicon sequencing.","publish_time":"2009-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ayodeji, Mobolanle; Kulka, Michael; Jackson, Scott A; Patel, Isha; Mammel, Mark; Cebula, Thomas A; Goswami, Biswendu B","journal":"Open Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1f933dc26c6379a87598a2954792f4943c6c426.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2707758.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2707758/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzY0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CVB","PCR","HAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus strains","oligonucleotide array","virus identification","CV strains","particular strain of virus","PCR products","viral strains","PCR amplified products","PCR amplification","multiple HAV","selected strains of hepatitis","hybridization profile","biotin","bases","total signal intensity","human rotavirus","human coxsackieviruses","hybridization data","fluorescence intensity","combined signal intensities","amplified cDNA target","current methods","probes","CVA","streptavidin","elements","significant improvement","laser scanning","amplicon sequencing","brief reaction","RV","gene segments","Cy3","microarray","linear representation","genogroups","CVB","overlap","Norovirus","NV","applicability","consecutive oligonucleotides","sequence","results","principle of tiling"],"language":"en"},

Rather than being the actual cause of MS, it is more probable that these agents are involved in the development of immunoregulatory pathways. These pathways, if disturbed by hygiene-related factors including an altered sequence of infections, may generate and maintain a deficit within the immunological network that facilitates, to particular early events in the development of MS, preceding the onset of MS disease by years or a decade. A framework that can serve as a guide for further epidemiological, immunologic and molecular biologic investigations is formulated. This approach may shed light on the complex natural history of MS and may lead to rational preventive and therapeutic strategies. It is possible that, in the future, MS could be prevented by vaccination against EBV in early childhood; the framework is of relevance to the design of an appropriate type of vaccine.","publish_time":"2009-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krone, Bernd; Oeffner, Frank; Grange, John M.","journal":"J Neurol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e8b5cb3fc6da16eb2ffe2830a159b3aa9c04577d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2708340.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2708340/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzY0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of MS","aetiology of MS","onset of MS disease","infectious agents","actual cause of MS","complex natural history of MS","EBV","infectious background","early childhood","framework","development of immunoregulatory pathways","epidemiological studies","particular early events","design","unique opportunity","immune reactions","Epstein-Barr virus","hygiene-related factors","light","altered sequence of infections","molecular biologic investigations","relevance","rational preventive","involvement","years","vaccination","immunological network","appropriate type of vaccine","therapeutic strategies","guide","children","decade","Multiple sclerosis","prime candidate","deficit","approach","future"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Studies in which critically ill immunocompetent adults were monitored for CMV infection in the intensive care unit (ICU) were reviewed. RESULTS: CMV infection occurs in 0 to 36% of critically ill patients, mostly between 4 and 12 days after ICU admission. Potential risk factors for CMV infection include sepsis, requirement of mechanical ventilation, and transfusions. Prolonged mechanical ventilation (21 to 39 days vs. 13 to 24 days) and duration of ICU stay (33 to 69 days vs. 22 to 48 days) correlated significantly with a higher risk of CMV infection. Mortality rates in patients with CMV infection were higher in some but not all studies. Whether CMV produces febrile syndrome or end-organ disease directly in these patients is not known. CONCLUSIONS: CMV infection frequently occurs in critically ill immunocompetent patients and may be associated with poor outcomes. Further studies are warranted to identify subsets of patients who are likely to develop CMV infection and to determine the impact of antiviral agents on clinically meaningful outcomes in these patients.","publish_time":"2009-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Osawa, Ryosuke; Singh, Nina","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3bd7912ee3f03ede00bee1e04a4142156cd55e87.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2717427.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2717427/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzY0OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CMV","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ill patients","higher risk of CMV infection","days","ill immunocompetent patients","subsets of patients","Studies","ill immunocompetent adults","meaningful outcomes","poor outcomes","ICU admission","duration of ICU","requirement of mechanical ventilation","Prolonged mechanical ventilation","Potential risk factors","sepsis","end-organ disease","febrile syndrome","intensive care unit","precise role of cytomegalovirus","impact of antiviral agents","Mortality rates","INTRODUCTION","transfusions","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

These problems might be overcome using helium-oxygen gas mixture. However, the effect of mechanical ventilation with heliox in these patients is unclear. The objective of this prospective cross-over study was to determine the effects of mechanical ventilation with heliox 60/40 versus conventional gas on respiratory system resistance, air-trapping and CO2 removal. METHODS: Mechanically ventilated, sedated and paralyzed infants with proven RSV were enrolled within 24 hours after paediatric intensive care unit (PICU)admission. At T = 0, respiratory system mechanics including respiratory system compliance and resistance, and peak expiratory flow rate were measured with the AVEA ventilator. The measurements were repeated at each interval (after 30 minutes of ventilation with heliox, after 30 minutes of ventilation with nitrox and again after 30 minutes of ventilation with heliox). Indices of gas exchange (ventilation and oxygenation index) were calculated at each interval. Air-trapping (defined by relative change in end-expiratory lung volume) was determined by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) at each interval. RESULTS: Thirteen infants were enrolled. In nine, EIT measurements were performed. Mechanical ventilation with heliox significantly decreased respiratory system resistance. This was not accompanied by an improved CO2 elimination, decreased peak expiratory flow rate or decreased end-expiratory lung volume. Importantly, oxygenation remained unaltered throughout the experimental protocol. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory system resistance is significantly decreased by mechanical ventilation with heliox (ISCRTN98152468).","publish_time":"2009-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kneyber, Martin CJ; van Heerde, Marc; Twisk, Jos WR; Pl\u00F6tz, Frans B; Markhors, Dick G","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c551385f15dce997db2f9f39531903c3907dfac7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2717432.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2717432/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzY1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","AVEA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory system resistance","heliox","minutes of ventilation","respiratory system compliance","respiratory system mechanics","respiratory acidosis","effects of mechanical ventilation","effect of mechanical ventilation","Respiratory syncytial virus","Air-trapping","interval","decreased end-expiratory lung volume","lower respiratory tract disease","peak expiratory flow rate","increased airway resistance","conventional gas","EIT measurements","Indices of gas exchange","proven RSV","helium-oxygen gas mixture","oxygenation index","paralyzed infants","CO2 removal","improved CO2 elimination","hours","paediatric intensive care unit","relative change","PICU","electrical impedance tomography","admission","INTRODUCTION","patients","study","experimental protocol","airways","nitrox","ISCRTN98152468","CONCLUSIONS","AVEA ventilator","objective","RESULTS","METHODS","problems"],"language":"en"},

Mutations of the GNE protein cause sialurea or autosomal recessive inclusion body myopathy/Nonaka myopathy. GNE is the only human protein that contains a kinase domain belonging to the ROK (repressor, ORF, kinase) family. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We solved the structure of the GNE kinase domain in the ligand-free state. The protein exists predominantly as a dimer in solution, with small populations of monomer and higher-order oligomer in equilibrium with the dimer. Crystal packing analysis reveals the existence of a crystallographic hexamer, and that the kinase domain dimerizes through the C-lobe subdomain. Mapping of disease-related missense mutations onto the kinase domain structure revealed that the mutation sites could be classified into four different groups based on the location \u2013 dimer interface, interlobar helices, protein surface, or within other secondary structural elements. CONCLUSIONS: The crystal structure of the kinase domain of GNE provides a structural basis for understanding disease-causing mutations and a model of hexameric wild type full length enzyme.

Improved understanding of environmental influence on disease seasonality has taken on new urgency due to global climate change. METHODS: We evaluated 602 cases of IPD reported in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, from 2002 to 2007. Poisson regression models incorporating seasonal smoothers were used to identify associations between weekly weather patterns and case counts. Associations between acute (day-to-day) environmental fluctuations and IPD occurrence were evaluated using a case-crossover approach. Effect modification across age and sex strata was explored, and meta-regression models were created using stratum-specific estimates for effect. RESULTS: IPD incidence was greatest in the wintertime, and spectral decomposition revealed a peak at 51.0 weeks, consistent with annual periodicity. After adjustment for seasonality, yearly increases in reporting, and temperature, weekly incidence was found to be associated with clear-sky UV index (IRR per unit increase in index: 0.70 [95% CI 0.54-0.91]). The effect of UV index was highest among young strata and decreased with age. At shorter time scales, only an association with increases in ambient sulphur oxides was linked to disease risk (OR for highest tertile of exposure 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.93). CONCLUSION: We confirmed the wintertime predominance of IPD in a major urban center. The major predictor of IPD in Philadelphia is extended periods of low UV radiation, which may explain observed wintertime seasonality. The mechanism of action of diminished light exposure on disease occurrence may be due to direct effects on pathogen survival or host immune function via altered 1,25-(OH)(2)-vitamin-D metabolism. These findings may suggest less diminution in future IPD risk with climate change than would be expected if wintertime seasonality was driven by temperature.","publish_time":"2009-12-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"White, Alexander NJ; Ng, Victoria; Spain, C Victor; Johnson, Caroline C; Kinlin, Laura M; Fisman, David N","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a324b07dddba6a95b23d5cf90c4f0756b87afe4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2797517.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2797517/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzczNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IPD"],"locations":["Philadelphia"],"keyphrases":["IPD occurrence","disease seasonality","IPD incidence","wintertime predominance of IPD","cases of IPD","observed wintertime seasonality","future IPD risk","major predictor of IPD","disease occurrence","disease risk","effect of UV index","seasonality of invasive pneumococcal disease","Excess wintertime mortality","clear-sky UV index","associations","weekly incidence","Effect modification","temperature","age","highest tertile of exposure","global climate change","meta-regression models","Poisson regression models","sex strata","environmental fluctuations","young strata","yearly increases","Philadelphia County","case counts","extended periods of low UV radiation","diminished light exposure","weekly weather patterns","major urban center","case-crossover approach","Improved understanding of environmental influence","IRR","pathogen survival","direct effects","new urgency","reporting","common cause of community","ambient sulphur oxides","host immune function","unit increase","weeks","seasonal smoothers","diminution","Streptococcus pneumoniae","mechanism of action","stratum-specific estimates","peak","spectral decomposition","shorter time scales","annual periodicity","BACKGROUND","bacteremia","adjustment","RESULTS","Pennsylvania","vitamin-D metabolism","OH","findings","CONCLUSION","century","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

This suggests the fast evolution of Mafa-B alleles due to adaptation to new environments. In contrast to humans, the B locus in Old World monkeys displays extensive copy number variation. The Mafa-B and previously defined -A gene combinations segregate in families and thus allowed the definition of extended haplotypes. In many cases it was possible to assign a particular Mafa-I allele to one of these Mafa-A/B haplotypes as well. The presence of a large number of stable haplotypes in this cohort of animals, which was pedigreed for up to eight generations, looks promising for developing discriminative MHC typing tools that are less cumbersome. Furthermore, the discovery of 53 unreported Mafa-B sequences expands the lexicon of alleles significantly, and may help in understanding the complex organisation of the macaque B region.","publish_time":"2009-11-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Otting, Nel; Doxiadis, Gaby G.

Thailand was massively infected in 2004 and 2005 and continues today to experience sporadic outbreaks. While research findings suggest that the spread of HPAI H5N1 is influenced primarily by trade patterns, identifying the anthropogenic risk factors involved remains a challenge. In this study, we investigated which anthropogenic factors played a role in the risk of HPAI in Thailand using outbreak data from the \u201Csecond wave\u201D of the epidemic (3 July 2004 to 5 May 2005) in the country. We first performed a spatial analysis of the relative risk of HPAI H5N1 at the subdistrict level based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. We observed a strong spatial heterogeneity of the relative risk. We then tested a set of potential risk factors in a multivariable linear model. The results confirmed the role of free-grazing ducks and rice-cropping intensity but showed a weak association with fighting cock density. The results also revealed a set of anthropogenic factors significantly linked with the risk of HPAI. High risk was associated strongly with densely populated areas, short distances to a highway junction, and short distances to large cities. These findings highlight a new explanatory pattern for the risk of HPAI and indicate that, in addition to agro-environmental factors, anthropogenic factors play an important role in the spread of H5N1. To limit the spread of future outbreaks, efforts to control the movement of poultry products must be sustained.","publish_time":"2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paul, Mathilde; Tavornpanich, Saraya; Abrial, David; Gasqui, Patrick; Charras-Garrido, Myriam; Thanapongtharm, Weerapong; Xiao, Xiangming; Gilbert, Marius; Roger, Francois; Ducrot, Christian","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/67db14be4e5b68f4d42496330429a1d86266a161.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2821766.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2821766/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozc2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPAI"],"locations":["Southeast Asia","Thailand"],"keyphrases":["anthropogenic risk factors","relative risk of HPAI H5N1","spread of HPAI H5N1","High risk","set of potential risk factors","set of anthropogenic factors","spread of H5N1","agro-environmental factors","H5N1 virus","spread of future outbreaks","short distances","important role","role of free","results","Thailand","spatial analysis","research findings","sporadic outbreaks","multivariable linear model","hierarchical Bayesian model","strong spatial heterogeneity","highway junction","subdistrict level","Southeast Asia","weak association","intensity","grazing ducks","efforts","trade patterns","pathogenic avian influenza","new explanatory pattern","outbreak data","fighting cock density","rice","populated areas","addition","large cities","wave","unprecedented epidemics","movement of poultry products","challenge","study","country"],"language":"en"},

However, a pseudoknot is not sufficient to promote \u22121 PRF. hTPK-DU177, a pseudoknot derived from human telomerase RNA, shares structural similarities with several \u22121 PRF pseudoknots and is used to dissect the roles of distinct structural features in the stimulator of \u22121 PRF. Structure-based mutagenesis on hTPK-DU177 reveals that the \u22121 PRF efficiency of this stimulator can be modulated by sequential removal of base\u2013triple interactions surrounding the helical junction. Further analysis of the junction-flanking base triples indicates that specific stem\u2013loop interactions and their relative positions to the helical junction play crucial roles for the \u22121 PRF activity of this pseudoknot. Intriguingly, a bimolecular pseudoknot approach based on hTPK-DU177 reveals that continuing triplex structure spanning the helical junction, lacking one of the loop-closure features embedded in pseudoknot topology, can stimulate \u22121 PRF. Therefore, the triplex structure is an essential determinant for the DU177 pseudoknot to stimulate \u22121 PRF. Furthermore, it suggests that \u22121 PRF, induced by an in-trans RNA via specific base\u2013triple interactions with messenger RNAs, can be a plausible regulatory function for non-coding RNAs.","publish_time":"2009-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chou, Ming-Yuan; Chang, Kung-Yao","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f59470fcae185cd02092b4e6e986a558ab811e92.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2836554.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2836554/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozc3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DU177 pseudoknot","pseudoknot topology","helical junction","hTPK-DU177","downstream RNA stimulator","hairpin-type pseudoknot","bimolecular pseudoknot approach","PRF activity","PRF pseudoknots","PRF efficiency","triple interactions","specific base","loop interactions","trans RNA","common stimulator","triplex structure","RNA slippery sequence","human telomerase RNA","base triples","Structure-based mutagenesis","roles of distinct structural features","sequential removal of base","loop-closure features","messenger RNAs","specific stem","structural similarities","crucial roles","non-coding RNAs","signal","plausible regulatory function","relative positions","programmed ribosomal frameshifting","essential determinant","analysis"],"language":"en"},

To help clinicians triage adults with acute respiratory illness, a scoring system for influenza-like illness (ILI) was implemented at Hospital Civil de Guadalajara, Mexico. METHODS: A medical history, laboratory and radiology results were collected on emergency room (ER) patients with acute respiratory illness to calculate an ILI-score. Patients were evaluated for admission by their ILI-score and clinicians\u0027 assessment of risk for developing complications. Nasal and throat swabs were collected from intermediate and high-risk patients for influenza testing by RT-PCR. The disposition and ILI-score of those oseltamivir-treated versus untreated, clinical characteristics of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) patients versus test-negative patients were compared by Pearson\u0027s \u03A7(2), Fisher\u0027s Exact, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. RESULTS: Of 1840 ER patients, 230 were initially hospitalized (mean ILI-score = 15), and the rest were discharged, including 286 ambulatory patients given oseltamivir (median ILI-score = 11), and 1324 untreated (median ILI-score = 5). Fourteen (1%) untreated patients returned, and 3 were hospitalized on oseltamivir (median ILI-score = 19). Of 371 patients tested by RT-PCR, 104 (28%) had pandemic influenza and 42 (11%) had seasonal influenza A detected. Twenty (91%) of 22 imaged hospitalized pandemic influenza patients had bilateral infiltrates compared to 23 (38%) of 61 imaged hospital test-negative patients (p\u003C0.001). One patient with confirmed pandemic influenza presented 6 days after symptom onset, required mechanical ventilation, and died. CONCLUSIONS: The triaging system that used an ILI-score complimented clinicians\u0027 judgment of who needed oseltamivir and inpatient care and helped hospital staff manage a surge in demand for services.","publish_time":"2010-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rodriguez-Noriega, Eduardo; Gonzalez-Diaz, Esteban; Morfin-Otero, Rayo; Gomez-Abundis, Gerardo F.; Brise\u00F1o-Ramirez, Jaime; Perez-Gomez, Hector Raul; Lopez-Gatell, Hugo; Alpuche-Aranda, Celia M.; Ram\u00EDrez, Ernesto; L\u00F3pez, Irma; Iguala, Miguel; Chapela, Ietza Boj\u00F3rquez; Zavala, Ethel Palacios; Hern\u00E1ndez, Mauricio; Stuart, Tammy L.; Villarino, Margarita Elsa; Widdowson, Marc-Alain; Waterman, Steve; Uyeki, Timothy; Azziz-Baumgartner, Eduardo","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b747413330a7699f64ee1acbc773808fba975fb3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2871038.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2871038/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzgwNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pearson"],"organizations":["Hospital Civil de Guadalajara"],"locations":["Mexico"],"keyphrases":["untreated patients","median ILI-score","ER patients","high-risk patients","ambulatory patients","mean ILI-score","imaged hospitalized pandemic influenza patients","confirmed pandemic influenza","influenza testing","seasonal influenza","oseltamivir","imaged hospital test-negative patients","acute respiratory illness","hospital staff","Hospital Civil","H1N1","RT-PCR","scoring system","radiology results","triaging system","clinicians\u0027 assessment of risk","complimented clinicians\u0027 judgment","days","symptom onset","emergency room","bilateral infiltrates","Fisher\u0027s Exact","medical history","laboratory","clinicians triage adults","inpatient care","Pearson\u0027s \u03A7","Wilcoxon rank-sum tests","clinical characteristics","surge","demand","throat swabs","mechanical ventilation","METHODS","complications","Guadalajara","Mexico","BACKGROUND","virus","admission","services","CONCLUSIONS","disposition","rest"],"language":"en"},

Mitigating the spread of such an influenza pandemic would require not only the timely administration of antiviral drugs to those infected, but also the implementation of suitable intervention policies for stunting the spread of the virus. Towards this end, mathematical modelling and simulation studies are crucial as they allow us to evaluate the predicted effectiveness of the various intervention policies before enforcing them. Diagnosis plays a vital role in the overall pandemic management framework by detecting and distinguishing the pathogenic strain from the less threatening seasonal strains and other influenza-like illnesses. This allows treatment and intervention to be deployed effectively, given limited antiviral supplies and other resources. However, the time required to design a fast and accurate testkit for novel strains may limit the role of diagnosis. Herein, we aim to investigate the cost and effectiveness of different diagnostic methods using a stochastic agent-based city-scale model, and then address the issue of whether conventional testing approaches, when used with appropriate intervention policies, can be as effective as fast testkits in containing a pandemic outbreak. We found that for mitigation purposes, fast and accurate testkits are not necessary as long as sufficient medication is given, and are generally recommended only when used with extensive contact tracing and prophylaxis. Additionally, in the event of insufficient medication and fast testkits, the use of slower, conventional testkits together with proper isolation policies while waiting for the diagnostic results can be an equally effective substitute.","publish_time":"2010-07-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chin, Juxin; Koh, Geoffrey; Lee, Dong-Yup","journal":"J R Soc Interface","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dd4007604c49bf0a0933e4dad118b8c5073c8c7f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2880075.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2880075/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzgxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fast testkits","influenza pandemic","conventional testkits","accurate testkits","appropriate intervention policies","various intervention policies","implementation of suitable intervention policies","pandemic outbreak","global pandemic","novel strains","proper isolation policies","role of diagnosis","spread","overall pandemic management framework","human transmissible influenza virus","effectiveness of different diagnostic methods","diagnostic results","vital role","pathogenic strain","predicted effectiveness","effective substitute","threatening seasonal strains","conventional testing approaches","event of insufficient medication","limited antiviral supplies","timely administration of antiviral drugs","stochastic agent-based city-scale model","use of slower","mathematical modelling","simulation studies","end","issue","cost","mitigation purposes","extensive contact tracing","prophylaxis","resources","illnesses","treatment"],"language":"en"},

Pre-existing CD8(\u002B) T-cell immunity directed towards conserved internal viral regions can greatly ameliorate the disease. However, mutational escape within the T cell epitopes is a substantial issue for virus control and vaccine design. Although mutations can result in a loss of T cell recognition, some variants generate cross-reactive T cell responses. In this study, we used reverse genetics to modify the influenza NP(336\u2013374) peptide at a partially-solvent exposed residue (N-\u003EA, NPN3A mutation) to assess the availability, effectiveness and mechanism underlying influenza-specific cross-reactive T cell responses. The engineered virus induced a diminished CD8(\u002B) T cell response and selected a narrowed T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire within two V\u03B2 regions (V\u03B28.3 and V\u03B29). This can be partially explained by the H-2D(b)NPN3A structure that showed a loss of several contacts between the NPN3A peptide and H-2D(b), including a contact with His155, a position known to play an important role in mediating TCR-pMHC-I interactions. Despite these differences, common cross-reactive TCRs were detected in both the na\u00EFve and immune NPN3A-specific TCR repertoires. However, while the NPN3A epitope primes memory T-cells that give an equivalent recall response to the mutant or wild-type (wt) virus, both are markedly lower than wt-\u003Ewt challenge. Such decreased CD8(\u002B) responses elicited after heterologous challenge resulted in delayed viral clearance from the infected lung. Furthermore, mice first exposed to the wt virus give a poor, low avidity response following secondary infection with the mutant. Thus, the protective efficacy of cross-reactive CD8(\u002B) T cells recognising mutant viral epitopes depend on peptide-MHC-I structural interactions and functional avidity. Our study does not support vaccine strategies that include immunization against commonly selected cross-reactive variants with mutations at partially-solvent exposed residues that have characteristics comparable to NPN3A.","publish_time":"2010-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Valkenburg, Sophie A.; Gras, Stephanie; Guillonneau, Carole; La Gruta, Nicole L.; Thomas, Paul G.; Purcell, Anthony W.; Rossjohn, Jamie; Doherty, Peter C.; Turner, Stephen J.; Kedzierska, Katherine","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa1f783a1af8b14cdbee5ea50cc0a78c56d7442e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2920842.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2920842/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozg0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T cell epitopes","T-cell immunity","T cells","influenza-specific cross-reactive T cell responses","loss of T cell recognition","narrowed T cell receptor","wt virus","NPN3A peptide","NPN3A structure","NPN3A mutation","NPN3A epitope primes memory T-cells","virus control","engineered virus","selected cross-reactive variants","wt challenge","protective efficacy of cross-reactive CD8","mutant viral epitopes","immune NPN3A-specific TCR repertoires","diminished CD8","decreased CD8","Pre-existing CD8","common cross-reactive TCRs","low avidity response","influenza NP","peptide-MHC","solvent exposed residues","mutations","study","conserved internal viral regions","delayed viral clearance","mediating TCR-pMHC","equivalent recall response","new influenza strain","V\u03B2 regions","functional avidity","structural interactions","heterologous challenge","vaccine strategies","vaccine design","minimal antibody immunity","substantial issue","poor","mechanism","secondary infection","rapid global spread","important role","availability","characteristics comparable","immunization","wild-type","position","V\u03B28","infected lung","reverse genetics","effectiveness","contacts","mutational escape","Emergence","differences","His155","V\u03B29","disease","mice"],"language":"en"},

Here we evaluate the microbial biota in healthy mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) by analyses of lymph node meta-transcriptomes. cDNA libraries from five individuals and two pools of samples were prepared from retropharyngeal lymph node RNA enriched for polyadenylated RNA and sequenced using Roche-454 Life Sciences technology. Protein-coding and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences were taxonomically profiled using protein and rRNA specific databases. Representatives of all bacterial phyla were detected in the seven libraries based on protein-coding transcripts indicating that viable microbiota were present in lymph nodes. Residents of skin and rumen, and those ubiquitous in mule deer habitat dominated classifiable bacterial species. Based on detection of both rRNA and protein-coding transcripts, we identified two new proteobacterial species; a Helicobacter closely related to Helicobacter cetorum in the Helicobacter pylori/Helicobacter acinonychis complex and an Acinetobacter related to Acinetobacter schindleri. Among viruses, a novel gamma retrovirus and other members of the Poxviridae and Retroviridae were identified. We additionally evaluated bacterial diversity by amplicon sequencing the hypervariable V6 region of 16S rRNA and demonstrate that overall taxonomic diversity is higher with the meta-transcriptomic approach. These data provide the most complete picture to date of the microbial diversity within a wildlife host. Our research advances the use of meta-transcriptomics to study microbiota in wildlife tissues, which will facilitate detection of novel organisms with pathogenic potential to human and animals.","publish_time":"2010-10-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wittekindt, Nicola E.; Padhi, Abinash; Schuster, Stephan C.; Qi, Ji; Zhao, Fangqing; Tomsho, Lynn P.; Kasson, Lindsay R.; Packard, Michael; Cross, Paul; Poss, Mary","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4d0092e3e79f9d5ad3c48f23778317ad867d61c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2956653.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2956653/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozg2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Roche-454 Life Sciences"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wildlife species","microbial diversity","S rRNA","protein-coding transcripts","bacterial diversity","wildlife tissues","Helicobacter pylori","Helicobacter cetorum","wildlife host","classifiable bacterial species","retropharyngeal lymph node RNA","microbial community","microbial biota","S ribosomal RNA","Helicobacter acinonychis complex","analyses of lymph node meta-transcriptomes","polyadenylated RNA","lymph nodes","rRNA specific databases","bacterial phyla","healthy mule deer","mule deer habitat","use of meta-transcriptomics","overall taxonomic diversity","new proteobacterial species","meta-transcriptomic approach","detection of novel organisms","viable microbiota","study microbiota","Acinetobacter schindleri","cDNA libraries","novel gamma retrovirus","ongoing emergence of human infections","Odocoileus hemionus","pathogenic potential","hypervariable V6 region","better knowledge","members","Roche","amplicon","need","traditional diagnostic approaches","sequences","pools of samples","complete picture","individuals","rumen","date","Life Sciences technology","Poxviridae","viruses","animals","research","Residents of skin","Retroviridae","Representatives"],"language":"en"},

It also regulates tumor immunity. A truncated CD200 (CD200(tr)) resulting from alternative splicing has been identified and characterized as a functional antagonist to full-length CD200. Thus, it is important to explore the mechanism(s) controlling alternative splicing of CD200. In this study, we identified an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) located in exon 2, which is a putative binding site for a splicing regulatory protein SF2/ASF. Deletion or mutation of the ESE site decreased expression of the full-length CD200. Direct binding of SF2/ASF to the ESE site was confirmed by RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Knockdown of expression of SF2/ASF resulted in the same splicing pattern as seen after deletion or mutation of the ESE, whereas overexpression of SF2/ASF increased expression of the full-length CD200. In vivo studies showed that viral infection reversed the alternative splicing pattern of CD200 with increased expression of SF2/ASF and the full-length CD200. Taken together, our data suggest for the first time that SF2/ASF regulates the function of CD200 by controlling CD200 alternative splicing, through direct binding to an ESE located in exon 2 of CD200.","publish_time":"2010-06-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Zhiqi; Ma, Xuezhong; Zhang, Jianhua; Hu, Jim; Gorczynski, Reginald M.","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a6d14471d9c34da1c4f1bf4ef530a35f58ad863.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2965252.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2965252/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozg2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ESE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["full-length CD200","CD200 alternative splicing","alternative splicing of CD200","function of CD200","truncated CD200","alternative splicing pattern of CD200","ASF increased expression","ESE site","increased expression of SF2","splicing regulatory protein SF2","Direct binding of SF2","overexpression of SF2","Knockdown of expression","putative binding site","mutation","Deletion","important role","autoimmune diseases","graft rejection","prevention of inflammatory disorders","RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay","EMSA","spontaneous fetal loss","membrane glycoprotein","viral infection","mechanism","exonic","type","enhancer","time","functional antagonist","studies","tumor immunity","study","data"],"language":"en"},

Thus, we do not understand how viral LRTI either predispose or serve as a marker of children to develop asthma. The Tennessee Children\u0027s Respiratory Initiative has been established as a longitudinal prospective investigation of infants and their biological mothers. The primary goals are to investigate both the acute and the long\u2010term health consequences of varying severity and aetiology of clinically significant viral respiratory tract infections on early childhood outcomes. Methods: Over four respiratory viral seasons, 2004\u20132008, term, non\u2010low birth weight previously healthy infants and their biological mothers were enrolled during an infant\u0027s acute viral respiratory illness. Longitudinal follow up to age 6 years is ongoing. Results: This report describes the study objectives, design and recruitment results of the over 650 families enrolled in this longitudinal investigation. The Tennessee Children\u0027s Respiratory Initiative is additionally unique because it is designed in parallel with a large retrospective birth cohort of over 95 000 mother\u2013infant dyads with similar objectives to investigate the role of respiratory viral infection severity and aetiology in the development of asthma. Conclusions: Future reports from this cohort will help to clarify the complex relationship between infant respiratory viral infection severity, aetiology, atopic predisposition and the subsequent development of early childhood asthma and atopic diseases.","publish_time":"2010-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"HARTERT, Tina V.; CARROLL, Kecia; GEBRETSADIK, Tebeb; WOODWARD, Kimberly; MINTON, Patricia","journal":"Respirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ccbd07ee1865e4f2afffdb6cc8b6039ab605ee7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2992986.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2992986/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozg4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LRTI","The Tennessee Children\u0027s Respiratory Initiative"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory viral seasons","viral LRTI","infant respiratory viral infection severity","role of respiratory viral infection severity","significant viral respiratory tract infections","viral lower respiratory tract infections","infant\u0027s acute viral respiratory illness","development of asthma","Tennessee Children\u0027s Respiratory Initiative","asthma incidence","aetiology","subsequent development of early childhood asthma","longitudinal investigation","biological mothers","longitudinal prospective investigation of infants","age","early childhood outcomes","healthy infants","atopic predisposition","study objectives","similar objectives","infant dyads","atopic diseases","large retrospective birth cohort","recruitment results","majority of children","marker of children","long\u2010term health consequences of varying severity","non\u2010low birth weight","complex relationship","design","attack rate","families","infancy","general population","Conclusions","Future reports","years","Methods","fold higher","Background","primary goals"],"language":"en"},

More than 50% of these cases involved patients \u003C20 years of age. Determining an association between the clinical factors at the time of hospital admission and prognosis may be useful for timely and adequate consultation and treatment. It has been difficult to obtain these clinical factors adjusted with other confounding factors, such as age and sex, as published studies of H5N1 virus infection usually reported only a few cases. So, we performed a pooled analysis of the reported cases. METHODS: Five case reports (36 patients \u003C18 years of age) of H5N1 infection from four countries published between 2004 and 2009 were assessed based on available individual clinical data. Using the pooled data for all patients, we investigated the associations between patients\u2019 prognosis and available laboratory findings, such as white blood cell (WBC) counts, platelet (PLT) counts, and serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) by adjusting for age and/or sex. RESULTS: The linear regression analysis revealed that mortality was negatively associated with WBC and PLT counts adjusted with age and sex. Increased log AST tended to be associated with a poor prognosis (p = 0.054), but there was no significant association between survival and log ALT level. CONCLUSIONS: Both decreased WBC and PLT counts can be considered to be common predictors of poor prognosis in H5N1 influenza patients \u003C18 years of age. Further studies are needed for clarification.","publish_time":"2010-06-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Furuya, Hiroyuki; Kawachi, Shoji; Shigematsu, Mika; Suzuki, Kazuo; Watanabe, Tetsu","journal":"Environ Health Prev Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a5eecacb8091624fdcf52c064fd16049665601e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2999688.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2999688/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozg5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WBC","PLT","AST"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["years of age","PLT counts","H5N1 influenza patients","H5N1 infection","clinical factors","cases of influenza","sex","reported cases","patients\u2019 prognosis","published studies of H5N1 virus infection","common predictors of poor prognosis","decreased WBC","confounding factors","available individual clinical data","pooled analysis","pooled data","countries","available laboratory findings","log ALT level","Increased log AST","alanine aminotransferase","case reports","significant association","linear regression analysis","serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase","white blood cell","time of hospital admission","survival","associations","platelet","World Health organization","adequate consultation","mortality","treatment","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","clarification"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, the mechanism by which the liposome-coupled antigens were cross-presented to CD8(\u002B) T cells by APCs was investigated. Confocal laser scanning microscopic analysis demonstrated that antigens coupled to the surface of unsaturated-fatty-acid-based liposomes received processing at both MHC class I and class II compartments, while most of the antigens coupled to the surface of saturated-fatty-acid-based liposomes received processing at the class II compartment. In addition, flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that antigens coupled to the surface of unsaturated-fatty-acid-liposomes were taken up by APCs even in a 4\u00B0C environment; this was not true of saturated-fatty-acid-liposomes. When two kinds of inhibitors, dimethylamiloride (DMA) and cytochalasin B, which inhibit pinocytosis and phagocytosis by APCs, respectively, were added to the culture of APCs prior to the antigen pulse, DMA but not cytochalasin B significantly reduced uptake of liposome-coupled antigens. Further analysis of intracellular trafficking of liposomal antigens using confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that a portion of liposome-coupled antigens taken up by APCs were delivered to the lysosome compartment. In agreement with the reduction of antigen uptake by APCs, antigen presentation by APCs was significantly inhibited by DMA, and resulted in the reduction of IFN-\u03B3 production by antigen-specific CD8(\u002B) T cells. These results suggest that antigens coupled to the surface of liposomes consisting of unsaturated fatty acids might be pinocytosed by APCs, loaded onto the class I MHC processing pathway, and presented to CD8(\u002B) T cells. Thus, these liposome-coupled antigens are expected to be applicable for the development of vaccines that induce cellular immunity.","publish_time":"2010-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tanaka, Yuriko; Taneichi, Maiko; Kasai, Michiyuki; Kakiuchi, Terutaka; Uchida, Tetsuya","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e8c2bc95762a2aefd919b02ae90131bc67716140.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3003686.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3003686/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzkwMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Confocal","MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["surface of liposomes","fatty-acid","culture of APCs","T cells","surface of unsaturated","antigen-specific CD8","based liposomes","unsaturated fatty acids","antigen pulse","induction of antigen","antigen presentation","surface of saturated","reduction of antigen uptake","analysis of intracellular trafficking of liposomal antigens","DMA","MHC class","portion of liposome","reduced uptake of liposome","specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes","cytochalasin B","MHC processing pathway","microscopic analysis","cytometric analysis","confocal laser scanning microscopy","true of saturated","reduction of IFN","lysosome compartment","\u03B3 production","dimethylamiloride","development of vaccines","pinocytosis","compartments","cellular immunity","kinds of inhibitors","mechanism","phagocytosis","agreement","C environment","present study","addition","results"],"language":"en"},

A dual-luciferase reporter construct where the Renilla luciferase (Rluc) translation is cap-dependent while the firefly luciferase (Fluc) translation depends on HIV-1 IRES was used. The Fluc/Rluc ratio was measured in lysates of Jurkat T cells transfected with the dual-luciferase plasmid bearing either the wild-type or a mutated IRES. Deletions or mutations in three regions decreased the IRES activity but deletion or mutations of a stem-loop preceding the primer binding site increased the IRES activity. The wild-type IRES activity, but not that of an IRES with a mutated stem-loop, was increased when cells were treated with agents that induce oxidative stress. Such stress is known to be caused by HIV-1 infection and we propose that this stem-loop is involved in a switch that stimulates the IRES activity in cells infected with HIV-1, supporting the suggestion that the IRES activity is up-regulated in the course of HIV-1 replication cycle.","publish_time":"2010-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gendron, Karine; Ferbeyre, Gerardo; Heveker, Nikolaus; Brakier-Gingras, L\u00E9a","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/54e77bff1912076bccf12a6b099e48a59f634d5f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/21337e54a7d02b12aea5f5835648d69aef32701e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3035469.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3035469/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzkzNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IRES","Jurkat T"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mutated IRES","wild-type IRES activity","regions of HIV","course of HIV","mutated stem-loop","Renilla luciferase","firefly luciferase","dual-luciferase plasmid","full-length messenger RNA of HIV","dual-luciferase reporter construct","Initiation of translation","mutations","Fluc","Rluc ratio","lysates of Jurkat T cells","oxidative stress","primer binding site","internal ribosome entry site","enzymes","viral structural proteins","replication cycle","agents","mutational analysis","switch","suggestion","Deletions","infection","untranslated region","aim"],"language":"en"},

Much research has been done in recent years in the development of sophisticated data-driven models for realistic computer-based simulations of infectious disease spreading. However, only a few computational tools are presently available for assessing scenarios, predicting epidemic evolutions, and managing health emergencies that can benefit a broad audience of users including policy makers and health institutions. RESULTS: We present \u0022GLEaMviz\u0022, a publicly available software system that simulates the spread of emerging human-to-human infectious diseases across the world. The GLEaMviz tool comprises three components: the client application, the proxy middleware, and the simulation engine. The latter two components constitute the GLEaMviz server. The simulation engine leverages on the Global Epidemic and Mobility (GLEaM) framework, a stochastic computational scheme that integrates worldwide high-resolution demographic and mobility data to simulate disease spread on the global scale. The GLEaMviz design aims at maximizing flexibility in defining the disease compartmental model and configuring the simulation scenario; it allows the user to set a variety of parameters including: compartment-specific features, transition values, and environmental effects. The output is a dynamic map and a corresponding set of charts that quantitatively describe the geo-temporal evolution of the disease. The software is designed as a client-server system. The multi-platform client, which can be installed on the user\u0027s local machine, is used to set up simulations that will be executed on the server, thus avoiding specific requirements for large computational capabilities on the user side. CONCLUSIONS: The user-friendly graphical interface of the GLEaMviz tool, along with its high level of detail and the realism of its embedded modeling approach, opens up the platform to simulate realistic epidemic scenarios. These features make the GLEaMviz computational tool a convenient teaching/training tool as well as a first step toward the development of a computational tool aimed at facilitating the use and exploitation of computational models for the policy making and scenario analysis of infectious disease outbreaks.","publish_time":"2011-02-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Broeck, Wouter Van den; Gioannini, Corrado; Gon\u00E7alves, Bruno; Quaggiotto, Marco; Colizza, Vittoria; Vespignani, Alessandro","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6c9c76be06450c8a68693ca9e28efe129a16c3d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3048541.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3048541/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozk1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GLEaMviz computational tool","GLEaMviz tool","computational tools","GLEaMviz server","exploitation of computational models","GLEaMviz design","training tool","stochastic computational scheme","large computational capabilities","Global Epidemic","simulation scenario","scenario analysis of infectious disease outbreaks","realistic computer-based simulations of infectious disease","realistic epidemic scenarios","disease compartmental model","mobility data","human infectious diseases","epidemic evolutions","health emergencies","health institutions","simulation engine leverages","available software system","components","development of sophisticated data-driven models","compartment-specific features","spread of emerging human","multi-platform client","corresponding set of charts","policy makers","specific requirements","control of public health crises","client application","global scale","client-server system","assessment","transition values","framework","high-resolution demographic","convenient teaching","broad audience of users","realism","proxy middleware","important role","flexibility","user-friendly graphical interface","dynamic map","recent years","variety of parameters","embedded modeling approach","geo-temporal evolution","environmental effects","high level","CONCLUSIONS","world","step","H1N1 influenza pandemic","user\u0027s local machine","output","research","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Periodic deadly outbreaks, documentation of person-to-person transmission, and the potential of this virus as an agent of agroterror reinforce the need for effective means of therapy and prevention. In this report, we describe the vaccine potential of NiV virus-like particles (NiV VLPs) composed of three NiV proteins G, F and M. Co-expression of these proteins under optimized conditions resulted in quantifiable amounts of VLPs with many virus-like/vaccine desirable properties including some not previously described for VLPs of any paramyxovirus: The particles were fusogenic, inducing syncytia formation; PCR array analysis showed NiV VLP-induced activation of innate immune defense pathways; the surface structure of NiV VLPs imaged by cryoelectron microscopy was dense, ordered, and repetitive, and consistent with similarly derived structure of paramyxovirus measles virus. The VLPs were composed of all the three viral proteins as designed, and their intracellular processing also appeared similar to NiV virions. The size, morphology and surface composition of the VLPs were consistent with the parental virus, and importantly, they retained their antigenic potential. Finally, these particles, formulated without adjuvant, were able to induce neutralizing antibody response in Balb/c mice. These findings indicate vaccine potential of these particles and will be the basis for undertaking future protective efficacy studies in animal models of NiV disease.","publish_time":"2011-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walpita, Pramila; Barr, Jennifer; Sherman, Michael; Basler, Christopher F.; Wang, Linfa","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/475c8599530b970bbf476ee0e2798f5940dc1254.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3071823.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3071823/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozk3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["M.

Here we addressed the question which cells are responsible for IFN-\u03B2 expression after infection with the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes by using a genetic approach. By means of newly established reporter mice, maximum of IFN-\u03B2 expression was observed at 24 hours post infection in spleen and, surprisingly, 48 hours post infection in colonized cervical and inguinal lymph nodes. Colonization of lymph nodes was independent of the type I IFN signaling, as well as bacterial dose and strain.

Yeast EST2 mRNA is highly unstable and contains up to five \u22121 RF signals.

However, these are typically confined to wealthy, developed countries; or, to the national reference laboratories of developing-world countries. There are many infectious diseases that are endemic in low-resource settings (LRS) where the lack of simple, instrument-free, NA diagnostic tests is a critical barrier to timely treatment. One of the primary barriers to the practicality and availability of NA assays in LRS has been the complexity and power requirements of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instrumentation (another is sample preparation). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this article, we investigate the hypothesis that an electricity-free heater based on exothermic chemical reactions and engineered phase change materials can successfully incubate isothermal NA amplification assays. We assess the heater\u0027s equivalence to commercially available PCR instruments through the characterization of the temperature profiles produced, and a minimal method comparison. Versions of the prototype for several different isothermal techniques are presented. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate that an electricity-free heater based on exothermic chemical reactions and engineered phase change materials can successfully incubate isothermal NA amplification assays, and that the results of those assays are not significantly different from ones incubated in parallel in commercially available PCR instruments. These results clearly suggest the potential of the non-instrumented nucleic acid amplification (NINA) heater for molecular diagnostics in LRS. When combined with other innovations in development that eliminate power requirements for sample preparation, cold reagent storage, and readout, the NINA heater will comprise part of a kit that should enable electricity-free NA testing for many important analytes.","publish_time":"2011-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"LaBarre, Paul; Hawkins, Kenneth R.; Gerlach, Jay; Wilmoth, Jared; Beddoe, Andrew; Singleton, Jered; Boyle, David; Weigl, Bernhard","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/133933d03341e293921239f0d6a2b3ea4f1f574c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3090398.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3090398/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozk5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NA","LRS","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["isothermal NA amplification assays","availability of NA assays","electricity-free heater","electricity-free NA testing","Molecular assays","NINA heater","LRS","NA diagnostic tests","instrument-free","available PCR instruments","exothermic chemical reactions","engineered phase change materials","sample preparation","different isothermal techniques","molecular diagnostics","results","non-instrumented nucleic acid amplification","important analytes","world countries","medical diagnostics","power requirements of polymerase chain reaction","cold reagent storage","critical barrier","instrumentation","complexity","low-resource settings","readout","potential","characterization","practicality","lack of simple","markers","temperature profiles","national reference laboratories","prototype","development","heater\u0027s equivalence","ones","hypothesis","timely treatment","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","minimal method comparison","article","infectious diseases","primary barriers","innovations","BACKGROUND","kit","METHODOLOGY","Versions","SIGNIFICANCE","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

SP-D is synthesized and secreted by alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells, but is also expressed by epithelial cells lining various exocrine ducts and the mucosa of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. SP-D, a collagenous calcium-dependent lectin (or collectin), binds to surface glycoconjugates expressed by a wide variety of microorganisms, and to oligosaccharides associated with the surface of various complex organic antigens. SP-D also specifically interacts with glycoconjugates and other molecules expressed on the surface of macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. In addition, SP-D binds to specific surfactant-associated lipids and can influence the organization of lipid mixtures containing phosphatidylinositol in vitro. Consistent with these diverse in vitro activities is the observation that SP-D-deficient transgenic mice show abnormal accumulations of surfactant lipids, and respond abnormally to challenge with respiratory viruses and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. The phenotype of macrophages isolated from the lungs of SP-D-deficient mice is altered, and there is circumstantial evidence that abnormal oxidant metabolism and/or increased metalloproteinase expression contributes to the development of emphysema. The expression of SP-D is increased in response to many forms of lung injury, and deficient accumulation of appropriately oligomerized SP-D might contribute to the pathogenesis of a variety of human lung diseases.","publish_time":"2000-08-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crouch, Erika C","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/06ced00a5fc04215949aa72528f2eeaae1d58927.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC59549.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC59549/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SP-D binds","oligomerized SP-D","expression of SP","D-deficient mice","lungs of SP","Surfactant protein-D","surface of macrophages","surface glycoconjugates","deficient transgenic mice","deficient accumulation","abnormal accumulations of surfactant lipids","surface of various complex organic antigens","specific surfactant-associated lipids","variety of human lung diseases","forms of lung injury","wide variety of microorganisms","bronchiolar epithelial cells","increased metalloproteinase expression","innate response","inhaled microorganisms","phenotype of macrophages","abnormal oxidant metabolism","various exocrine ducts","mucosa","collectin","collagenous calcium-dependent lectin","observation","circumstantial evidence","activities","oligosaccharides","pathogenesis","organization of lipid mixtures","respiratory viruses","bacterial lipopolysaccharides","phosphatidylinositol","genitourinary tracts","development of emphysema","inflammatory regulation","neutrophils","molecules","addition","lymphocytes"],"language":"en"},

The best studied nidoviruses, the corona- and arteriviruses, employ a unique transcription mechanism, which involves discontinuous RNA synthesis, a process resembling similarity-assisted copy-choice RNA recombination. During infection, multiple subgenomic (sg) mRNAs are transcribed from a mirror set of sg negative-strand RNA templates. The sg mRNAs all possess a short 5\u2032 common leader sequence, derived from the 5\u2032 end of the genomic RNA. The joining of the non-contiguous \u2018leader\u2019 and \u2018body\u2019 sequences presumably occurs during minus-strand synthesis. To study whether toroviruses use a similar transcription mechanism, we characterized the 5\u2032 termini of the genome and the four sg mRNAs of Berne virus (BEV). We show that BEV mRNAs 3\u20135 lack a leader sequence. Surprisingly, however, RNA 2 does contain a leader, identical to the 5\u2032-terminal 18 residues of the genome.

The virus causing SARS was identified as a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and multiple genomic sequences have been revealed since mid-April, 2003. After a quiet summer and fall in 2003, the newly emerged SARS cases in Asia, particularly the latest cases in China, are reinforcing a wide-spread belief that the SARS epidemic would strike back. With the understanding that SARS-CoV might be with humans for years to come, knowledge of the evolutionary mechanism of the SARS-CoV, including its mutation rate and emergence time, is fundamental to battle this deadly pathogen. To date, the speed at which the deadly virus evolved in nature and the elapsed time before it was transmitted to humans remains poorly understood. RESULTS: Sixteen complete genomic sequences with available clinical histories during the SARS outbreak were analyzed. After careful examination of multiple-sequence alignment, 114 single nucleotide variations were identified. To minimize the effects of sequencing errors and additional mutations during the cell culture, three strategies were applied to estimate the mutation rate by 1) using the closely related sequences as background controls; 2) adjusting the divergence time for cell culture; or 3) using the common variants only. The mutation rate in the SARS-CoV genome was estimated to be 0.80 \u2013 2.38 \u00D7 10(-3 )nucleotide substitution per site per year which is in the same order of magnitude as other RNA viruses. The non-synonymous and synonymous substitution rates were estimated to be 1.16 \u2013 3.30 \u00D7 10(-3 )and 1.67 \u2013 4.67 \u00D7 10(-3 )per site per year, respectively. The most recent common ancestor of the 16 sequences was inferred to be present as early as the spring of 2002. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated mutation rates in the SARS-CoV using multiple strategies were not unusual among coronaviruses and moderate compared to those in other RNA viruses. All estimates of mutation rates led to the inference that the SARS-CoV could have been with humans in the spring of 2002 without causing a severe epidemic.","publish_time":"2004-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Zhongming; Li, Haipeng; Wu, Xiaozhuang; Zhong, Yixi; Zhang, Keqin; Zhang, Ya-Ping; Boerwinkle, Eric; Fu, Yun-Xin","journal":"BMC Evol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cdb29ec7a9029d22f6fbf7ee04543819591acdc2.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e9c78584c08ba79d735e150eff98297eb57f12dd.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4a228865af2c19adf9386a5b04cca3ceb3c8683d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC446188.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC446188/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["SARS epidemic","SARS outbreak","SARS-CoV genome","emerged SARS cases","estimated mutation rates","multiple genomic sequences","estimates of mutation rates","severe epidemic","humans","multiple strategies","related sequences","complete genomic sequences","synonymous substitution rates","severe global epidemic","cell culture","divergence time","nucleotide substitution","emergence time","elapsed time","deadly virus","RNA viruses","site","spring","careful examination of multiple","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","latest cases","background controls","deadly pathogen","common variants","single nucleotide variations","recent common ancestor","sequence alignment","available clinical histories","additional mutations","Asia","effects of sequencing errors","knowledge","coronaviruses","nature","evolutionary mechanism","novel coronavirus","inference","order of magnitude","hundreds of deaths","China","speed","RESULTS","years","belief","CONCLUSIONS","thousands of hospitalizations","understanding","quiet summer","date"],"language":"en"},

Several trends are apparent, including: (i) a 3\u2032 terminal U LNA and 5\u2032 terminal LNAs are less stabilizing than interior and other 3\u2032 terminal LNAs; (ii) most of the stability enhancement is achieved when LNA nucleotides are separated by at least one 2\u2032-O-methyl nucleotide; and (iii) the effects of LNA substitutions are approximately additive when the LNA nucleotides are separated by at least one 2\u2032-O-methyl nucleotide.

Internal mismatches with LNA nucleotides significantly destabilize duplexes with RNA.","publish_time":"2005-09-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kierzek, Elzbieta; Ciesielska, Anna; Pasternak, Karol; Mathews, David H.; Turner, Douglas H.; Kierzek, Ryszard","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95aec306660c1b7519e9f019d92cc3a8206481e4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1201327.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1201327/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzEzNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA/RNA","LNA","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA duplexes","O-methyl RNA oligonucleotide","RNA heteroduplexes","O-methyl nucleotide separates LNA nucleotides","terminal U LNA","effects of LNA substitutions","stabilities of complementary duplexes","terminal LNAs","residues","preliminary nearest-neighbor free energy","interior","influence of locked nucleic acid","thermodynamic properties","Internal mismatches","Optical melting studies","stability enhancement","sequence dependence","trends","equation"],"language":"en"},

Sequence analysis of SARS-coronavirus isolates revealed that specific genotypes predominated at different periods of the epidemic. This information can be used as a footprint for tracing the epidemiology of infections and monitor viral evolution. However, direct sequencing analysis of a large number of clinical samples is cumbersome and time consuming. We present here a simple and rapid assay for the screening of SARS-coronavirus genotypes based on the use of fluorogenic oligonucleotide probes for allelic discrimination. METHODS: Thirty SARS patients were recruited. Allelic discrimination assays were developed based on the use of fluorogenic oligonucleotide probes (TaqMan). Genotyping of the SARS-coronavirus isolates obtained from these patients were carried out by the allelic discrimination assays and confirmed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Genotyping based on the allelic discrimination assays were fully concordant with direct sequencing. All of the 30 SARS-coronavirus genotypes studied were characteristic of genotypes previously documented to be associated with the latter part of the epidemic. Seven of the isolates contained a previously reported major deletion but in patients not epidemiologically related to the previously studied cohort.

To our knowledge, there have been no comprehensive studies investigating viral infection at the cellular level in humans. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We collected the largest series of fatal cases of SARS with autopsy material to date by merging the pathological material from two regions involved in the 2003 worldwide SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, China, and Toronto, Canada. We developed a monoclonal antibody against the SARS-CoV nucleoprotein and used it together with in situ hybridization (ISH) to analyze the autopsy lung tissues of 32 patients with SARS from Hong Kong and Toronto. We compared the results of these assays with the pulmonary pathologies and the clinical course of illness for each patient. SARS-CoV nucleoprotein and RNA were detected by immunohistochemistry and ISH, respectively, primarily in alveolar pneumocytes and, less frequently, in macrophages. Such localization was detected in four of the seven patients who died within two weeks of illness onset, and in none of the 25 patients who died later than two weeks after symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: The pulmonary alveolar epithelium is the chief target of SARS-CoV, with macrophages infected subsequently. Viral replication appears to be limited to the first two weeks after symptom onset, with little evidence of continued widespread replication after this period. If antiviral therapy is considered for future treatment, it should be focused on this two-week period of acute clinical disease.","publish_time":"2006-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nicholls, John M; Butany, Jagdish; Poon, Leo L.

Prion infectivity may enter soil environments via shedding from diseased animals and decomposition of infected carcasses. Burial of TSE-infected cattle, sheep, and deer as a means of disposal has resulted in unintentional introduction of prions into subsurface environments. We examined the potential for soil to serve as a TSE reservoir by studying the interaction of the disease-associated prion protein (PrP(Sc)) with common soil minerals. In this study, we demonstrated substantial PrP(Sc) adsorption to two clay minerals, quartz, and four whole soil samples. We quantified the PrP(Sc)-binding capacities of each mineral. Furthermore, we observed that PrP(Sc) desorbed from montmorillonite clay was cleaved at an N-terminal site and the interaction between PrP(Sc) and Mte was strong, making desorption of the protein difficult. Despite cleavage and avid binding, PrP(Sc) bound to Mte remained infectious. Results from our study suggest that PrP(Sc) released into soil environments may be preserved in a bioavailable form, perpetuating prion disease epizootics and exposing other species to the infectious agent.","publish_time":"2006-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Johnson, Christopher J; Phillips, Kristen E; Schramm, Peter T; McKenzie, Debbie; Aiken, Judd M; Pedersen, Joel A","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51dd595e1404da9a49935f1df61c163b6ad01a58.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1435987.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1435987/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzIwMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PrP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Sc","substantial PrP","soil environments","Prion infectivity","soil samples","common soil minerals","disease-associated prion protein","perpetuating prion disease epizootics","interaction","sheep","subsurface environments","deer","TSE reservoir","clay minerals","Mte","study","natural transmission of prion diseases","infected cattle","binding capacities","avid binding","unidentified environmental reservoir of infectivity","montmorillonite clay","Burial of TSE","protein difficult","infectious agent","decomposition of infected carcasses","diseased animals","transmissible spongiform encephalopathies","TSEs","shedding","adsorption","bioavailable form","unintentional introduction of prions","species","quartz","N-terminal site","means of disposal","desorption","cleavage","elk","Results","potential"],"language":"en"},

SARS-CoV mainly infects tissues of non-lymphatic origin, and the cytokine profile of those cells can determine the course of disease. Here, we investigated the cytokine response of two human non-lymphatic cell lines, Caco-2 and HEK 293, which are fully permissive for SARS-CoV. RESULTS: A comparison with established cytokine-inducing viruses revealed that SARS-CoV only weakly triggered a cytokine response. In particular, SARS-CoV did not activate significant transcription of the interferons IFN-\u03B1, IFN-\u03B2, IFN-\u03BB1, IFN-\u03BB2/3, as well as of the interferon-induced antiviral genes ISG56 and MxA, the chemokine RANTES and the interleukine IL-6. Interestingly, however, SARS-CoV strongly induced the chemokines IP-10 and IL-8 in the colon carcinoma cell line Caco-2, but not in the embryonic kidney cell line 293. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that SARS-CoV suppresses the antiviral cytokine system of non-immune cells to a large extent, thus buying time for dissemination in the host. However, synthesis of IP-10 and IL-8, which are established markers for acute-stage SARS, escapes the virus-induced silencing at least in some cell types. Therefore, the progressive infiltration of immune cells into the infected lungs observed in SARS patients could be due to the production of these chemokines by the infected tissue cells.","publish_time":"2006-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Spiegel, Martin; Weber, Friedemann","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4fa871503ddbbaaead7a34fce89298a36648f662.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1444920.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1444920/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzIwMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","SARS patients","SARS coronavirus","acute-stage SARS","established cytokine","cytokine response","cytokine profile","antiviral cytokine system of non-immune cells","IFN-\u03B2","IFN-\u03BB1","IFN-\u03BB2","cell types","infected tissue cells","human non-lymphatic cell lines","interferons IFN-\u03B1","progressive infiltration of immune cells","colon carcinoma cell line Caco","embryonic kidney cell line","interleukine IL","chemokines IP","tissues of non-lymphatic origin","virus-induced silencing","infected lungs","established markers","synthesis of IP","antiviral genes ISG56","severe acute respiratory syndrome","etiologic agent","chemokine RANTES","large extent","MxA","significant transcription","viruses","time","comparison","dissemination","HEK","production","RESULTS","data","BACKGROUND","host","course of disease","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Mutant clouds in infected organisms represent the first stage in the genetic and antigenic diversification of RNA viruses, such as foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV), an important animal pathogen. Antigenic variants of FMDV have been classically diagnosed by immunological or RT-PCR-based methods. DNA microarrays are becoming increasingly useful for the analysis of gene expression and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Recently, a FMDV microarray was described to detect simultaneously the seven FMDV serotypes. These results encourage the development of new oligonucleotide microarrays to probe the fine genetic and antigenic composition of FMDV for diagnosis, vaccine design, and to gain insight into the molecular epidemiology of this pathogen. RESULTS: A FMDV microarray was designed and optimized to detect SNPs at a major antigenic site of the virus. A screening of point mutants of the genomic region encoding antigenic site A of FMDV C-S8c1 was achieved. The hybridization pattern of a mutant includes specific positive and negative signals as well as crosshybridization signals, which are of different intensity depending on the thermodynamic stability of each probe-target pair. Moreover, an array bioinformatic classification method was developed to evaluate the hybridization signals. This statistical analysis shows that the procedure allows a very accurate classification per variant genome. CONCLUSION: A specific approach based on a microarray platform aimed at distinguishing point mutants within an important determinant of antigenicity and host cell tropism, namely the G-H loop of capsid protein VP1, was developed. The procedure is of general applicability as a test for specificity and discriminatory power of microarray-based diagnostic procedures using multiple oligonucleotide probes.","publish_time":"2006-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mart\u00EDn, Ver\u00F3nica; Perales, Celia; Abia, David; Ort\u00EDz, Angel R; Domingo, Esteban; Briones, Carlos","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dce2c9d835e3ebbee3ff4e6868d5755ddec76b71.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1481559.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1481559/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzIxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FMDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FMDV microarray","antigenic composition of FMDV","Antigenic variants of FMDV","FMDV serotypes","FMDV C-S8c1","major antigenic site","microarray platform","antigenic diversification of RNA viruses","negative signals","discriminatory power of microarray","crosshybridization signals","SNPs","results","based methods","distinguishing point mutants","screening of point mutants","important animal pathogen","viral pathogenesis","specific approach","development of new oligonucleotide microarrays","Mutant clouds","accurate classification","statistical analysis","DNA microarrays","hybridization pattern","important determinant of antigenicity","analysis of gene expression","evolution of viral quasispecies","multiple oligonucleotide probes","mouth disease virus","probe-target pair","array bioinformatic classification method","diagnostic procedures","host cell tropism","specificity","foot","genomic region","single nucleotide polymorphisms","thermodynamic stability","G-H loop of capsid protein VP1","test","stage","diagnosis","different intensity","vaccine design","insight","infected organisms","general applicability","response","RT-PCR","antiviral treatments","molecular epidemiology","variant genome","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

The effects of those disparities can be observed at both individual and population levels. Migration across health and disease disparities influences the epidemiology of certain diseases globally and in nations receiving migrants. While specific disease-based outcomes may vary between migrant group and location, general epidemiological principles may be applied to any situation where numbers of individuals move between differences in disease prevalence. Traditionally, migration health activities have been designed for national application and lack an integrated international perspective. Present and future health challenges related to migration may be more effectively addressed through collaborative global undertakings.

However, many of these have been deposited in GenBank without annotations, severely limiting their value to researchers. While maintaining comprehensive genomic databases for a set of virus families at the Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center and Viral Bioinformatics \u2013 Canada , we found that researchers were unnecessarily spending time annotating viral genomes that were close relatives of already annotated viruses. We have therefore designed and implemented a novel tool, Genome Annotation Transfer Utility (GATU), to transfer annotations from a previously annotated reference genome to a new target genome, thereby greatly reducing this laborious task. RESULTS: GATU transfers annotations from a reference genome to a closely related target genome, while still giving the user final control over which annotations should be included. GATU also detects open reading frames present in the target but not the reference genome and provides the user with a variety of bioinformatics tools to quickly determine if these ORFs should also be included in the annotation. After this process is complete, GATU saves the newly annotated genome as a GenBank, EMBL or XML-format file. The software is coded in Java and runs on a variety of computer platforms. Its user-friendly Graphical User Interface is specifically designed for users trained in the biological sciences. CONCLUSION: GATU greatly simplifies the initial stages of genome annotation by using a closely related genome as a reference. It is not intended to be a gene prediction tool or a \u0022complete\u0022 annotation system, but we have found that it significantly reduces the time required for annotation of genes and mature peptides as well as helping to standardize gene names between related organisms by transferring reference genome annotations to the target genome.

They are to assure comparability and consistency of surveillance data and have crucial impact on the sensitivity and the positive predictive value of a surveillance system. The reliability of case definitions has rarely been investigated systematically. METHODS: We conducted a Round-Robin test by asking all 425 local health departments (LHD) and the 16 state health departments (SHD) in Germany to classify a selection of 68 case examples using case definitions. By multivariate analysis we investigated factors linked to classification agreement with a gold standard, which was defined by an expert panel. RESULTS: A total of 7870 classifications were done by 396 LHD (93%) and all SHD. Reporting sensitivity was 90.0%, positive predictive value 76.6%. Polio case examples had the lowest reporting precision, salmonellosis case examples the highest (OR = 0.008; CI: 0.005\u20130.013). Case definitions with a check-list format of clinical criteria resulted in higher reporting precision than case definitions with a narrative description (OR = 3.08; CI: 2.47\u20133.83). Reporting precision was higher among SHD compared to LHD (OR = 1.52; CI: 1.14\u20132.02). CONCLUSION: Our findings led to a systematic revision of the German case definitions and build the basis for general recommendations for the creation of case definitions. These include, among others, that testable yes/no criteria in a check-list format is likely to improve reliability, and that software used for data transmission should be designed in strict accordance with the case definitions. The findings of this study are largely applicable to case definitions in many other countries or international networks as they share the same structural and editorial characteristics of the case definitions evaluated in this study before their revision.","publish_time":"2006-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krause, G\u00E9rard; Brodhun, Bonita; Altmann, Doris; Claus, Hermann; Benzler, Justus","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6cfcbd2a102a3666d0d168f9bdaba0b2107fc8bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1538585.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1538585/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SHD"],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["reliability of case definitions","creation of case definitions","German case definitions","salmonellosis case examples","Polio case examples","higher reporting precision","Reporting sensitivity","LHD","SHD","lowest reporting precision","consistency of surveillance data","local health departments","state health departments","positive predictive value","study","findings","check-list format of clinical criteria","important elements of public health surveillance systems","data transmission","systematic revision","basis","crucial impact","general recommendations","classification agreement","strict accordance","factors","Germany","countries","editorial characteristics","narrative description","selection","Round-Robin test","gold standard","international networks","classifications","software","comparability","multivariate analysis","RESULTS","total","BACKGROUND","expert panel","METHODS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate use of the Internet in accessing information related to the anthrax scare in the United States in late 2001, and to strategize about the most effective use of this technology as a communication vehicle during times of public health crises. METHODS: A paper-based survey to assess how individuals obtained health information relating to bioterrorism and anthrax during late 2001.We surveyed 500 randomly selected patients from two ambulatory primary care clinics affiliated with the Brigham and Women\u0027s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. RESULTS: The response rate was 42%. While traditional media provided the primary source of information on anthrax and bioterrorism, 21% (95% CI, 15% - 27%) of respondents reported searching the Internet for this information during late 2001. Respondents reported trusting information from physicians the most, and information from health websites slightly more than information from any traditional media source. Over half of those searching the Internet reported changing their behavior as a result of information found online. CONCLUSIONS: Many people already look to the Internet for information during a public health crisis, and information found online can positively influence behavioral responses to such crises. However, the potential of the Internet to convey accurate health information and advice has not yet been realized. In order to enhance the effectiveness of public-health communication, physician practices could use this technology to pro-actively e-mail their patients validated information.

Recently, the prevailing hypothesis that reactive oxygen species (ROS) promote inflammation was challenged when polymorphisms in Ncf1, that decrease oxidative burst, were shown to increase disease severity in mouse and rat arthritis models. Based on these findings we developed a new therapy for arthritis using oxidative burst-inducing substances. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Treatment of rats with phytol (3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecene-1-ol) increased oxidative burst in vivo and thereby corrected the effect of the genetic polymorphism in arthritis-prone Ncf1 (DA) rats. Importantly, phytol treatment also decreased the autoimmune response and ameliorated both the acute and chronic phases of arthritis. When compared to standard therapies for RA, anti-tumour necrosis factor-\u03B1 and methotrexate, phytol showed equally good or better therapeutic properties. Finally, phytol mediated its effect within hours of administration and involved modulation of T cell activation, as injection prevented adoptive transfer of disease with arthritogenic T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of arthritis with ROS-promoting substances such as phytol targets a newly discovered pathway leading to autoimmune inflammatory disease and introduces a novel class of therapeutics for treatment of RA and possibly other chronic inflammatory diseases.","publish_time":"2006-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hultqvist, Malin; Olofsson, Peter; Gelderman, Kyra A; Holmberg, Jens; Holmdahl, Rikard","journal":"PLoS Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7de21b4df4bb390e0fba8c0938ef6eeef9a4630e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1564167.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1564167/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Treatment of arthritis","phytol treatment","rheumatoid arthritis","arthritis-prone Ncf1","chronic phases of arthritis","Treatment of rats","oxidative burst","autoimmune inflammatory diseases","rat arthritis models","chronic inflammatory diseases","disease severity","new therapy","autoimmune response","new therapies","effect","findings","substances","adoptive transfer of disease","standard therapies","arthritogenic T cells","involved modulation of T cell activation","anti-tumour necrosis factor-\u03B1","biological agents","methotrexate","injection","reactive oxygen species","hours of administration","novel class of therapeutics","recent successes","continued search","inflammation","mouse","genetic polymorphism","discovered pathway","prevailing hypothesis","BACKGROUND","polymorphisms","tetramethyl","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","therapeutic properties","hexadecene","treatments","patients"],"language":"en"},

The spike (S) protein is one of the best characterized proteins of SARS-CoV, which plays a key role in SARS-CoV overcoming species barrier and accomplishing interspecies transmission from animals to humans, suggesting that it may be the major target of selective pressure. However, the process of adaptive evolution of S protein and the exact positively selected sites associated with this process remain unknown. RESULTS: By investigating the adaptive evolution of S protein, we identified twelve amino acid sites (75, 239, 244, 311, 479, 609, 613, 743, 765, 778, 1148, and 1163) in the S protein under positive selective pressure. Based on phylogenetic tree and epidemiological investigation, SARS outbreak was divided into three epidemic groups: 02\u201304 interspecies, 03-early-mid, and 03-late epidemic groups in the present study. Positive selection was detected in the first two groups, which represent the course of SARS-CoV interspecies transmission and of viral adaptation to human host, respectively. In contrast, purifying selection was detected in 03-late group. These indicate that S protein experiences variable positive selective pressures before reaching stabilization. A total of 25 sites in 02\u201304 interspecies epidemic group and 16 sites in 03-early-mid epidemic group were identified under positive selection. The identified sites were different between these two groups except for site 239, which suggests that positively selected sites are changeable between groups. Moreover, it was showed that a larger proportion (24%) of positively selected sites was located in receptor-binding domain (RBD) than in heptad repeat (HR)1-HR2 region in 02\u201304 interspecies epidemic group (p = 0.0208), and a greater percentage (25%) of these sites occurred in HR1\u2013HR2 region than in RBD in 03-early-mid epidemic group (p = 0.0721). These suggest that functionally different domains of S protein may not experience same positive selection in each epidemic group. In addition, three specific replacements (F360S, T487S and L665S) were only found between 03-human SARS-CoVs and strains from 02\u201304 interspecies epidemic group, which reveals that selective sweep may also force the evolution of S genes before the jump of SARS-CoVs into human hosts. Since certain residues at these positively selected sites are associated with receptor recognition and/or membrane fusion, they are likely to be the crucial residues for animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoVs, and subsequent adaptation to human hosts. CONCLUSION: The variation of positive selective pressures and positively selected sites are likely to contribute to the adaptive evolution of S protein from animals to humans.","publish_time":"2006-10-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Chi-Yu; Wei, Ji-Fu; He, Shao-Heng","journal":"BMC Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9aa51dd5b5755afa670398027272f2e6b4f3d83b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1609170.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1609170/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["selected sites","interspecies epidemic group","identified sites","human transmission of SARS","human SARS-CoVs","SARS outbreak","early-mid epidemic group","jump of SARS","course of SARS","Positive selection","late epidemic groups","process of adaptive evolution of S protein","CoV interspecies transmission","different domains of S protein","late group","evolution of S genes","S protein experiences variable positive selective pressures","human hosts","amino acid sites","variation of positive selective pressures","best characterized proteins of SARS","selective sweep","human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome","major target of selective pressure","RBD","animals","HR2 region","humans","viral adaptation","subsequent adaptation","receptor recognition","crucial residues","certain residues","receptor-binding domain","coronavirus","species barrier","F360S","epidemiological investigation","specific replacements","strains","phylogenetic tree","key role","T487S","heptad repeat","membrane fusion","stabilization","cause","HR1","present study","addition","L665S","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","spike","larger proportion","greater percentage","BACKGROUND","contrast","total"],"language":"en"},

Acute demyelination models in rodents typically exhibit robust spontaneous remyelination that prevents appropriate evaluation of strategies for improving conditions of insufficient remyelination. In the current study, we used a mouse model of chronic demyelination induced by continuous ingestion of 0.2% cuprizone for 12 weeks. This chronic process depleted the oligodendrocyte progenitor population and impaired oligodendrocyte regeneration. Remyelination remained limited after removal of cuprizone from the diet. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) expression was persistently increased in the corpus callosum of chronically demyelinated mice as compared with nonlesioned mice. We used FGF2(\u2212/\u2212)mice to determine whether removal of endogenous FGF2 promoted remyelination of chronically demyelinated areas. Wild-type and FGF2(\u2212/\u2212)mice exhibited similar demyelination during chronic cuprizone treatment. Importantly, in contrast to wild-type mice, the FGF2(\u2212/\u2212)mice spontaneously remyelinated completely during the recovery period after chronic demyelination. Increased remyelination in FGF2(\u2212/\u2212)mice correlated with enhanced oligodendroglial regeneration. FGF2 genotype did not alter the density of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells or proliferating cells after chronic demyelination. These findings indicate that attenuating FGF2 created a sufficiently permissive lesion environment for endogenous cells to effectively remyelinate viable axons even after chronic demyelination.","publish_time":"2006-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Armstrong, Regina C.; Le, Tuan Q.; Flint, Nicole C.; Vana, Adam C.; Zhou, Yong-Xing","journal":"Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d90d787828b6f96b4a93eb6948d613293bc51bf9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1635791.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/jnen/article-pdf/65/3/245/8276837/65-3-245.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzMwMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["demyelinated mice","attenuating FGF2","FGF2 genotype","chronic process","removal of endogenous FGF2","nonlesioned mice","Increased remyelination","mouse model of chronic demyelination","chronic cuprizone treatment","wild-type mice","similar demyelination","chronic demyelinating episodes","robust spontaneous remyelination","Acute demyelination models","conditions of insufficient remyelination","endogenous cells","removal of cuprizone","density of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells","proliferating cells","oligodendrocyte progenitor population","impaired oligodendrocyte regeneration","demyelinated areas","enhanced oligodendroglial regeneration","remyelinate viable axons","results","appropriate evaluation of strategies","rodents","permissive lesion environment","neurologic disability","continuous ingestion","expression","Fibroblast growth factor","corpus callosum","multiple sclerosis lesions","recovery period","contrast","current study","findings","diet","weeks"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we investigated what effect different levels of travel restrictions might have on the speed and geographical spread of an outbreak of a disease similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS: We used a stochastic simulation model incorporating survey data of travel patterns between municipalities in Sweden collected over 3 years. We tested scenarios of travel restrictions in which travel over distances \u003E50 km and 20 km would be banned, taking into account different levels of compliance. RESULTS: We found that a ban on journeys \u003E50 km would drastically reduce the speed and geographical spread of outbreaks, even when compliance is \u003C 100%. The result was found to be robust for different rates of intermunicipality transmission intensities.

In conclusion, our findings, at least, suggest that E-CR1 is likely involved in immune pathogenesis of SARS disease.","publish_time":"2005-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, F S; Chu, F L; Jin, L; Li, Y G; Zhang, Z; Xu, D; Shi, M; Wu, H; Moulds, J-M","journal":"Clinical and Experimental Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7337e45c853a4ffb961e1b5a4db830db88425e06.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1809271.xml.json","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2005.02681.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzM1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["E-CR1 expression","CR1 gene","CR1 genotype","SARS patients","expression level of E","expression density of E","weeks","NFI","relevant genetic genotypes","immune pathogenesis of SARS disease","major genetic polymorphism","genetic polymorphisms","healthy individuals","LL genotypes","HH","disease onset","restriction fragment length polymorphism","PCR","Chinese population","severe acute respiratory syndrome","change of erythrocyte","flow cytometric analyses","polymerase chain reaction","intron","receptor","net fluorescence intensity values","RFLP","convalescent phase","longitudinal study","initiation","progressive phases","control","results","findings","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

While natural killer (NK) cells can directly contribute to the control of viral replication, whether, and how, they may help orchestrate global antiviral defense is largely unknown. To address this question, we took advantage of the well-defined molecular interactions involved in the recognition of mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) by NK cells. By using congenic or mutant mice and wild-type versus genetically engineered viruses, we examined the consequences on antiviral CD8 T cell responses of specific defects in the ability of the NK cells to control MCMV. This system allowed us to demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, that NK cells accelerate CD8 T cell responses against a viral infection in vivo. Moreover, we identify the underlying mechanism as the ability of NK cells to limit IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 production to levels not immunosuppressive to the host. This is achieved through the early control of cytomegalovirus, which dramatically reduces the activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) for cytokine production, preserves the conventional dendritic cell (cDC) compartment, and accelerates antiviral CD8 T cell responses. Conversely, exogenous IFN-\u03B1 administration in resistant animals ablates cDCs and delays CD8 T cell activation in the face of NK cell control of viral replication. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the ability of NK cells to respond very early to cytomegalovirus infection critically contributes to balance the intensity of other innate immune responses, which dampens early immunopathology and promotes optimal initiation of antiviral CD8 T cell responses. Thus, the extent to which NK cell responses benefit the host goes beyond their direct antiviral effects and extends to the prevention of innate cytokine shock and to the promotion of adaptive immunity.","publish_time":"2007-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robbins, Scott H; Bessou, Gilles; Cornillon, Am\u00E9lie; Zucchini, Nicolas; Rupp, Brigitte; Ruzsics, Zsolt; Sacher, Torsten; Tomasello, Elena; Vivier, Eric; Koszinowski, Ulrich H; Dalod, Marc","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb3c146b1766b4aa33df1637742bf93159967289.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1950948.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1950948/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQzMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NK cell responses","ability of NK cells","optimal initiation of antiviral CD8 T cell responses","antiviral CD8 T cell responses of specific defects","face of NK cell control of viral replication","delays CD8 T cell activation","conventional dendritic cell","innate immune responses","protective immune responses","early control of cytomegalovirus","activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells","viral infection","cytomegalovirus infection","direct antiviral effects","global antiviral defense","cytokine production","host","early immunopathology","MCMV","recognition of mouse cytomegalovirus","exogenous IFN-\u03B1 administration","\u03B2 production","prevention of innate cytokine shock","cDCs","resistant animals","compartment","consequences","important goal","major challenge","pathogens","pDCs","design of innovative therapeutic","wild-type","biomedical research","levels","well-defined molecular interactions","advantage","mutant mice","vaccination strategies","engineered viruses","intensity","time","promotion of adaptive immunity","underlying mechanism","mechanisms","natural killer","extent","data","question","knowledge","system"],"language":"en"},

Because of the lack of a disease model in animals and the complex immune interaction in dengue infection, the study of host response and immunopathogenesis is difficult. The development of genomics technology, microarray and high throughput quantitative PCR have allowed researchers to study gene expression changes on a much broader scale. We therefore used this approach to investigate the host response in dengue virus-infected cell lines and in patients developing dengue fever. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using microarray and high throughput quantitative PCR method to monitor the host response to dengue viral replication in cell line infection models and in dengue patient blood samples, we identified differentially expressed genes along three major pathways; NF-\u03BAB initiated immune responses, type I interferon (IFN) and the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Among the most highly upregulated genes were the chemokines IP-10 and I-TAC, both ligands of the CXCR3 receptor. Increased expression of IP-10 and I-TAC in the peripheral blood of ten patients at the early onset of fever was confirmed by ELISA. A highly upregulated gene in the IFN pathway, viperin, was overexpressed in A549 cells resulting in a significant reduction in viral replication. The upregulation of genes in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway prompted the testing of proteasome inhibitors MG-132 and ALLN, both of which reduced viral replication. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Unbiased gene expression analysis has identified new host genes associated with dengue infection, which we have validated in functional studies. We showed that some parts of the host response can be used as potential biomarkers for the disease while others can be used to control dengue viral replication, thus representing viable targets for drug therapy.","publish_time":"2007-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fink, Joshua; Gu, Feng; Ling, Ling; Tolfvenstam, Thomas; Olfat, Farzad; Chin, Keh Chuang; Aw, Pauline; George, Joshy; Kuznetsov, Vladimir A.; Schreiber, Mark; Vasudevan, Subhash G.; Hibberd, Martin L.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/63008713691bdb1d8eed016dbc54332f11d43739.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2100376.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2100376/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQ1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dengue infection","dengue viral replication","seriousness of dengue","cases of dengue fever","cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever","dengue shock syndrome","dengue patient blood samples","clear understanding of dengue pathogenesis","study of host response","dengue virus-infected cell lines","new host genes","upregulated genes","ubiquitin proteasome pathway","ubiquitin-proteasome pathway","IFN pathway","upregulation of genes","study gene expression changes","microarray","Unbiased gene expression analysis","patients","Increased expression of IP","early onset of fever","disease model","related disease","TAC","high throughput quantitative PCR method","cell line infection models","testing of proteasome inhibitors","immune responses","peripheral blood","chemokines IP","complex immune interaction","researchers","year","animals","NF-\u03BAB","viable targets","SIGNIFICANCE","significant reduction","viperin","development of genomics technology","major pathways","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","A549 cells","interferon","CONCLUSION","immunopathogenesis","broader scale","potential biomarkers","drug therapy","ligands","METHODOLOGY","lack","ALLN","CXCR3 receptor","ELISA","BACKGROUND","approach","parts","functional studies"],"language":"en"},

Anthrax, caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, has been used as both a biological warfare agent and bioterrorist weapon previously. Although antibiotic therapy is effective in the early stages of anthrax infection, it does not have any effect once exposed individuals become symptomatic due to B. anthracis exotoxin accumulation. The bipartite exotoxins are the major contributing factors to the morbidity and mortality observed in acute anthrax infections. METHODS: Using recombinant B. anthracis protective antigen (PA83), covalently coupled to a novel non-toxic muramyl dipeptide (NT-MDP) derivative we hyper-immunized goats three times over the course of 14 weeks. Goats were plasmapheresed and the IgG fraction (not affinity purified) and F(ab\u0027)(2 )derivatives were characterized in vitro and in vivo for protection against lethal toxin mediated intoxication. RESULTS: Anti-PA83 IgG conferred 100% protection at 7.5 \u03BCg in a cell toxin neutralization assay. Mice exposed to 5 LD(50 )of Bacillus anthracis Ames spores by intranares inoculation demonstrated 60% survival 14 d post-infection when administered a single bolus dose (32 mg/kg body weight) of anti-PA83 IgG at 24 h post spore challenge. Anti-PA83 F(ab\u0027)(2 )fragments retained similar neutralization and protection levels both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: The protection afforded by these GMP-grade caprine immunotherapeutics post-exposure in the pilot murine model suggests they could be used effectively to treat post-exposure, symptomatic human anthrax patients following a bioterrorism event. These results also indicate that recombinant PA83 coupled to NT-MDP is a potent inducer of neutralizing antibodies and suggest it would be a promising vaccine candidate for anthrax. The ease of production, ease of covalent attachment, and immunostimulatory activity of the NT-MDP indicate it would be a superior adjuvant to alum or other traditional adjuvants in vaccine formulations.","publish_time":"2007-10-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kelly, Cassandra D; O\u0027Loughlin, Chris; Gelder, Frank B; Peterson, Johnny W; Sower, Laurie E; Cirino, Nick M","journal":"J Immune Based Ther Vaccines","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e046152bb9c537c62ed4c4616a0b627ccfc992a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2104530.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2104530/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQ1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Anti-PA83 IgG","recombinant PA83","Anti-PA83 F","NT-MDP","protection levels","bacterium Bacillus anthracis","acute anthrax infections","symptomatic human anthrax patients","early stages of anthrax infection","d post-infection","Bacillus anthracis Ames spores","IgG fraction","anthracis protective antigen","anthracis exotoxin accumulation","ab","RESULTS","GMP-grade caprine immunotherapeutics post-exposure","cell toxin neutralization assay","ease of production","similar neutralization","vaccine formulations","exposed individuals","hyper-immunized goats","biological warfare agent","ease of covalent attachment","promising vaccine candidate","lethal toxin mediated intoxication","potential biological weapons of mass destruction","intranares inoculation","times","vaccines","mortality","morbidity","major contributing factors","traditional adjuvants","immunostimulatory activity","h post spore challenge","alum","survival","pilot murine model","novel non-toxic muramyl dipeptide","fragments","\u03BCg","clear need","emerging diseases","bioterrorism event","body weight","single bolus dose","potent inducer of neutralizing antibodies","bipartite exotoxins","superior adjuvant","bioterrorist weapon","course","affinity","antibiotic therapy","effect","LD","METHODS","BACKGROUND","weeks","Mice","derivatives","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Here, we dissect the contributions of the individual complement activation pathways to the protection from WNV disease. Genetic deficiencies in C1q, C4, factor B, or factor D all resulted in increased mortality in mice, suggesting that all activation pathways function together to limit WNV spread. In the absence of alternative pathway complement activation, WNV disseminated into the central nervous system at earlier times and was associated with reduced CD8(\u002B) T cell responses yet near normal anti-WNV antibody profiles. Animals lacking the classical and lectin pathways had deficits in both B and T cell responses to WNV. Finally, and somewhat surprisingly, C1q was required for productive infection in the spleen but not for development of adaptive immune responses after WNV infection. Our results suggest that individual pathways of complement activation control WNV infection by priming adaptive immune responses through distinct mechanisms.","publish_time":"2006-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mehlhop, Erin; Diamond, Michael S.","journal":"J Exp Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b8ec6abf589bfc9738475e02cb3a6d18eaba5b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2121216.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2121216/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQ2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["WNV disease","individual pathways of complement activation control WNV infection","individual complement activation pathways","activation pathways function","severe infection","productive infection","T cell responses","lectin pathways","near normal anti-WNV antibody profiles","development of adaptive immune responses","factor B","central nervous system","C1q","mice","factor D","vertebrate animals","C4","deficits","protection","earlier times","reduced CD8","critical role","increased mortality","spleen","distinct mechanisms","contributions","absence of alternative pathway","Genetic deficiencies","West Nile virus","humans","results","Prior studies","receptor"],"language":"en"},

The applied methodology for behaviour evaluation was instantaneous sampling (scan). The behaviour of each adult was recorded at one\u2010minute intervals. Location in the enclosure and spatial proximity were also recorded. The results suggest that Maned wolves are inactive for large parts of the day and that they prefer secluded areas within an enclosure. The results also suggest that only the \u2642 is directly involved in rearing the offspring and that \u2640 participation is limited to protection only. The time that the \u2642 stays with the pups is at a maximum on the days immediately following birth, but this time decreases considerably as the pups grow. At around day 50, when lactation has ceased, contact between the \u2642 and pups is minimal and the pups have their own resting places within the enclosure.

In order to explore the virus\u2010host interactions, the histological features of the demyelinating disease were correlated with the spatial and temporal distribution of viral transcripts and the expression of oligodendrocyte\u2010specific genes (myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, myelin\u2010associated glycoprotein, and 2\u2032, 3\u2032 cyclic nucleotide 3\u2032\u2010phosphohydrolase) in the spinal cord of diseased mice. Three distinct phases in the disease were identified. In the first phase, 1 week postinfection (1 WPI), virus replication was widespread in both gray and white matter but was preferentially occurring in glial cells. In the ventral and dorsal root zones where viral transcripts were most abundant, all myelin gene transcripts were decreased before demyelination was seen. During the second phase of the disease (2\u20133 WPI), viral transcripts decreased in abundance and became restricted to the white matter. Numerous demyelinating lesions were observed and were characterized by inflammatory cells, paucity of oligodendrocytes, and a profound decrease of all myelin gene transcripts. In the third phase of the disease (4\u20136 WPI) no viral transcripts were detected, and remyelination began. In the lesions and the tissue surrounding them, transcripts of all myelin genes increased to levels above normal. The increased expression of myelin gene transcripts occurred in a synchronized manner and with a cellular distribution reminiscent of that seen in developmental myelination. These molecular events correlated with efficient remyelination and clinical recovery in this murine demyelinating disease.","publish_time":"2004-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jordan, Craig A.; Friedrich, Victor L.; Godfraind, Catherine; Cardellechio, Christine B.; Holmes, Kathryn V.; Dubois\u2010Dalcq, Monique","journal":"Glia","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/21c29b82b24ba74060c1434cf92099785cf28086.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165873/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["increased expression of myelin gene transcripts","myelin genes","temporal distribution of viral transcripts","murine demyelinating disease","CNS demyelinating disease","myelin basic protein","WPI","Numerous demyelinating lesions","virus replication","white matter","A59 strain of mouse hepatitis virus","proteolipid protein","specific genes","expression of oligodendrocyte","efficient remyelination","N mice","inflammatory cells","glial cells","cellular distribution reminiscent","spinal cord of diseased mice","clinical recovery","synchronized manner","histological features","profound decrease","dorsal root zones","MHV","paucity of oligodendrocytes","host interactions","phosphohydrolase","ventral","weeks of age","associated glycoprotein","abundance","molecular events","week postinfection","levels","demyelination","developmental myelination","cyclic nucleotide","C57BI","order","distinct phases","tissue"],"language":"en"},

To gain deeper insight into determinants of replication, persistence, and treatment, we established a homogenous cell\u2010culture model allowing a thorough comparison of RNA replication of both viruses. By screening different human liver\u2010derived cell lines with subgenomic reporter replicons of HAV as well as of different HCV genotypes, we found that Huh7\u2010Lunet cells supported HAV\u2010 and HCV\u2010RNA replication with similar efficiency and limited interference between both replicases. HAV and HCV replicons were similarly sensitive to interferon (IFN), but differed in their ability to establish persistent replication in cell culture. In contrast to HCV, HAV replicated independently from microRNA\u2010122 and phosphatidylinositol 4\u2010kinase III\u03B1 and \u03B2 (PI4KIII). Both viruses were efficiently inhibited by cyclosporin A and NIM811, a nonimmunosuppressive analog thereof, suggesting an overlapping dependency on cyclophilins for replication. However, analysis of a broader set of inhibitors revealed that, in contrast to HCV, HAV does not depend on cyclophilin A, but rather on adenosine\u2010triphosphate\u2013binding cassette transporters and FK506\u2010binding proteins. Finally, silibinin, but not its modified intravenous formulation, efficiently inhibited HAV genome replication in vitro, suggesting oral silibinin as a potential therapeutic option for HAV infections. Conclusion: We established a cell\u2010culture model enabling comparative studies on RNA replication of HAV and HCV in a homogenous cellular background with comparable replication efficiency. We thereby identified new host cell targets and potential treatment options for HAV and set the ground for future studies to unravel determinants of clearance and persistence.

Prevalence estimates of these four hazards are affected by the sampling strategy and diagnostic procedure. Individual prevalence estimates for pig carriage (from digestive contents or lymph nodes collected at slaughterhouse) were higher than individual prevalence estimates for pig shedding (from faeces). Among risk factors described in the literature, poor pen cleaning and disinfection after pig departure to slaughterhouse and poor bio\u2010security measures are of major significance. Moreover, whereas wet feed increases the risk of pig infection by L. monocytogenes, dry feed is a risk factor for Salm. enterica. Mixing batches of pigs, notably in fattening herds, represents a risk for the transmission of Salm. enterica and Y. enterocolitica. Whereas small herds are more infected by thermophilic campylobacters and Y. enterocolitica, higher prevalence of Salmonella is observed in large herds due to a more frequent mixing of batches. Antibiotic treatment during the finishing period increases the risk of transmission of Salm. enterica.

Fossil penguins also were studied using measurements from 111 skeletal elements representing 18 species. Most external and skeletal measurements follow interspecific rankings in body mass; the latter span a 30\u2010fold range from 1 kg in Eudyptula minor to 30 kg in Aptenodytes forsteri. Flighted Pelecanoides is only one\u2010tenth the mass of the smallest spheniscid. Wing areas and body masses of penguins maintain approximate geometric similitude among species; the allometric coefficient is 0.62 \u00B1 0.04. Several skeletal elements are less derived in conformation in the fossil penguins than in modern confamilials. Despite great variation in the lengths of wing and leg skeletons, penguins show relative consistency in proportions of wing elements; pelvic proportions were more variable within the Spheniscidae. Proportions within both limbs are distinctly different from those of Pelecanoides. Analysis of correlation structures within species of penguin revealed three major subsets of skeletal variables that are highly intercorrelated: trunk\u2010skull lengths, appendicular\u2010trunk widths, and appendicular lengths. Within these groups, measurements tend to separate by anatomical region and, to a lesser degree, by limb. Canonical analysis of skin and skeletal measurements revealed groupings of spheniscids on the basis of size and relatively complex shape variables. Cluster analyses of taxa on the canonical variates confirmed the similarity of congeners in Eudyptes, Eudyptula and Spheniscus; species of Aptenodytes and, to a lesser degree, Pygoscelis, are more heterogeneous. A cluster analysis of principal components of myological measurements tabulated by Schreiweis (1972) corresponded closely with phenetic groupings using external and skeletal variables. A canonical contrast between spheniscids and Pelecanoides indicated that the families differ in a relatively complex skeletal dimension that only in part reflects overall size. Multivariate assessment of sexual dimorphism in external and skeletal variables indicated that: Eudyptula is least dimorphic; Aptenodytes, Eudyptes, Megadyptes and Spheniscus are moderately dimorphic; and Pygoscelis is most dimorphic. Pelecanoides shows comparatively low dimorphism. Among\u2010species and within\u2010species first principal components of skeletal measurements (multivariate axes of skeletal \u2018size\u2019) differ from one another in their orientation, and both deviate from isometric size. The first principal component for skeletons of Pelecanoides also deviated from isometric size, but the direction of this allometry is fundamentally different from that in penguins. Estimates of body mass for fossil penguins, based on principal components of available skeletal measurements, indicate that fossil species ranged from 3 kg to 81 kg in total mass; the largest fossil species was approximately 2.5 times as massive as the largest extant spheniscid. Much of the morphometric variation in the Spheniscidae is explainable on locomotory, ecological and thermodynamic grounds, and the associated phenetic groupings conform broadly with traditional generic classifications. The evolutionary significance of mensural correlations, allometric trends and differences between fossil and Recent species are discussed, and the need for a phylogenetic analysis of this highly specialized family of winged\u2010propelled diving birds is stressed.","publish_time":"2009-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Livezey, Bradley C.","journal":"J Zool (1987)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73fc4f8b7f396115a97ef63c20ee7d78d182814b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166393/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjsxMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Spheniscidae"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["skeletal elements","species of Aptenodytes","Fossil penguins","largest fossil species","principal components of skeletal measurements","species of penguin","fighted species","Recent species of Spheniscidae","principal components of available skeletal measurements","multivariate axes of skeletal","complex skeletal dimension","skeletons of Pelecanoides","major subsets of skeletal variables","Flighted Pelecanoides","body masses of penguins","cluster analysis of principal components of myological measurements","Pelecanoides urinator","isometric size","flighted ancestor of penguins","lengths of wing","proportions of wing elements","Canonical analysis of skin","total mass","basis of size","overall size","Estimates of body mass","appendicular lengths","groupings of spheniscids","phylogenetic analysis","complex shape variables","skull lengths","associated phenetic groupings","leg skeletons","pelvic proportions","Wing areas","Spheniscus","canonical variates","Eudyptula minor","Eudyptes","canonical contrast","Analysis of correlation structures","Aptenodytes forsteri","lesser degree","Pygoscelis","morphometric variation","Schreiweis","largest extant spheniscid","allometric trends","common diving","trunk widths","Multivariate assessment of sexual dimorphism","allometric coefficient","myological data","skin specimens","low dimorphism","great variation","smallest spheniscid","morphometric patterns","specialized family of winged","propelled diving birds","Cluster analyses of taxa","differences","relative consistency","approximate geometric similitude","thermodynamic grounds","times","interspecific rankings","similarity of congeners","evolutionary significance of mensural correlations","locomotory","petrel","Megadyptes","conformation","traditional generic classifications","direction","families","anatomical region","authorities","need","modern confamilials","fold range","allometry","limbs","orientation","groups"],"language":"en"},

As a follow\u2010up to an in vitro study on the effect of oral antiseptics on Herpes simplex virus, Type 1, this study was undertaken to evaluate the in vivo effect of an essential oil containing oral antiseptic on the reduction of viral titer in saliva during active viral infection. Method: Patients were recruited and evaluated in a single visit protocol at the onset of a perioral outbreak, consistent historically and clinically with recurrent Herpes labialis. Direct immunofluorescence of cytological smears of the lesions/oral fluids was used to confirm Herpes simplex virus types I or II. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: (1) active ingredient and (2) sterile water control. The viral lesion was evaluated as to clinical stage according to standard protocol. Salivary fluid samples were taken: (1) at baseline; (2) immediately following a 30 s rinse; (3) 30 min. after the 30 s rinse; and (4) on the repeat trial, also at 60 min. after the 30 s rinse. All samples were evaluated for viral titer and results compared. Results: In Trial 1, the sample population consisted of 19 males and 21 females with an average age of 29.2 and in Trial 2, 21 males, 19 females with an average age of 28. In both Trials 1 and 2, recoverable infectious virions were reduced to zero after a 30 s experimental rinse; whereas, the control rinse resulted in a non\u2010significant (p\u003E0.05) reduction. The experimental group also demonstrated a continued significant (p\u003C0.05) reduction 30 min. post rinse when compared with baseline while the control group returned to baseline levels. In Trial 2, the 60 min. post rinse follow\u2010up demonstrated a 1\u20132 log residual reduction from baseline in the experimental group; however, this was not significant. Conclusions: There is clinical efficacy in utilizing an oral rinse with the antimicrobial agent Listerine(\u00AE) Antiseptic in reducing the presence of viral contamination in oral fluids for at least 30 min. after oral rinse. The risk of viral cross contamination generated from these oral fluids in person to person contact or during dental treatment may be reduced.","publish_time":"2005-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meiller, Timothy F.; Silva, Arley; Ferreira, Sonia M.; Jabra\u2010Rizk, Mary Ann; Kelley, Jacqueline I.; DePaola, Louis G.","journal":"J Clin Periodontol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fdde98d7e110b1a207fcb343142cdb2012c699e2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166778.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166778/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjsyNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["oral rinse","s rinse","control rinse","oral fluids","s experimental rinse","reduction of viral titer","post rinse follow\u2010up","viral lesion","effect of oral antiseptics","anti\u2010viral efficacy of oral antimicrobial rinses","presence of viral contamination","active viral infection","control group","experimental group","risk of viral cross contamination","clinical efficacy","baseline levels","repeat trial","Herpes simplex virus types","person","log residual reduction","clinical stage","females","study","average age","results","Patients","recurrent Herpes labialis","sterile water control","active ingredient","terms of potential clinical significance","standard protocol","treatment groups","dental treatment","antimicrobial agent Listerine","single visit protocol","Salivary fluid samples","onset","lesions","Direct immunofluorescence of cytological smears","essential oil","perioral outbreak","sample population","recoverable infectious virions","Trials","Conclusions","Method"],"language":"en"},

Results have been compared with those obtained by complement fixation (CF), neutralization (Nt), and indirect hemagglutination (IHA) tests. The IAHA method has been shown to be as sensitive as the CF, Nt, and IHA tests in detecting cases of acute 229E infection. However, in a seroepidemiological survey of 343 healthy people of all ages, IAHA detected 229E antibody in 254 individuals (74.0%), Nt in 166 (48.3%), IHA in 89 (25.9%), and CF in 30 (8.7%). A study of the prevalence of coronavirus 229E IAHA antibody in the different age groups has shown that during the second decade of life nearly 100% of the population acquire this type of antibody, whereas only 50% are positive at the end of the first decade. In the older age groups, the high frequency of CF antibody (\u201Cmarker\u201D of recent infection) indirectly confirms the high rate of 229E reinfections and the nonprotective nature of IAHA antibody. CF titer \u2A7E 1:8 in 90% of cases corresponded to IAHA titers \u2A7E 1:64. However, sera with IAHA titers of \u2A7E 1:128 were often CF\u2010negative. Recent 229E infections (or reinfections), as determined by the presence of CF antibody, were more frequent in April\u2010May than in October\u2010November. Three cases of acute infection showing 229E seroconversion (two adults and one child) were observed during the winter\u2010spring season.

Additionally, sera were tested for Vesivirus genome by three methods: dot\u2010blot and two reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) methods. The calculated seroprevalence against Vesivirus virions within these groups (N = 765) was 12%, 21%, 29%, and 47%, respectively (P \u003C 0.001 for group differences).

In order to design primer sets for the detection of a wide range of NVs, NVs were categorized into three groups, that is, genogroup I (GI), prevalent GII, and minor GII; three sets of primers were developed for each group. Clinical specimens of patients suffering from enteric RNA viruses, such as NV, group A and C rotavirus, and sapovirus were examined using these primer sets. Various genotypes of NVs were detected in clinical specimens from patients infected with NV where no false positive reaction was observed with other enteric RNA viruses. Additionally, 88 samples of acute gastroenteritis outbreaks were analyzed by an RT\u2010LAMP assay and compared with the results of routine RT\u2010PCR. The results of the RT\u2010LAMP assay corresponded well to that of RT\u2010PCR. These findings suggest the practical application of the RT\u2010LAMP assay for the detection of NVs in clinical specimens. Consequently, the RT\u2010LAMP system and conventional detection kits (NVGI and NVGII detection kits; Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd., Japan) were compared. The detection rate of the prevalent and minor GII primer sets was similar to that of the conventional NVGII kit, while the detection rate of the GI primer set is different because it can detect several genotypes better than the conventional NVGI kit. This is an initial report that the RT\u2010LAMP system is able to detect NVs in clinical specimens within a wide range. J. Med.

This study aimed to determine whether non\u2010replicating FMDV could induce apoptosis of the host immune cells. In this study, we have demonstrated that bone morrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were induced to undergo apoptosis in a dose\u2010dependent manner, which was determined by the annexin\u2010V staining, DNA fragmentation, and TUNEL staining methods, after they were treated with the chemically inactivated FMDV in vitro. The initiation of apoptosis was apparently via an interaction of the integrin receptor on BMDCs and the RGD motif within the VP1 capsid protein of FMDV. The initiation activated a cascade of apoptotic pathway including reduced expression of Bcl\u20102, activation of caspases, and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Pretreatment with BMDCs with LPS prevented the inactivated FMDV induced apoptosis, suggesting immature BMDCs are susceptible to such apoptosis. Taken together, the data demonstrate that the inactivated FMDV induces the apoptosis in BMDCs via the integrin receptor and subsequently triggers the apoptosis signal, suggesting that such induction of apoptosis is likely to impair immune responses against FMDV infection.

A distinct coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) has been identified as the aetiological agent of SARS. Recently, a metallopeptidase named angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS\u2010CoV. Although ACE2 mRNA is known to be present in virtually all organs, its protein expression is largely unknown. Since identifying the possible route of infection has major implications for understanding the pathogenesis and future treatment strategies for SARS, the present study investigated the localization of ACE2 protein in various human organs (oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain). The most remarkable finding was the surface expression of ACE2 protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine. Furthermore, ACE2 was present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs studied. In conclusion, ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, which might provide possible routes of entry for the SARS\u2010CoV. This epithelial expression, together with the presence of ACE2 in vascular endothelium, also provides a first step in understanding the pathogenesis of the main SARS disease manifestations.

DESIGN: Retrospective electronic medical record review of prospectively collected data from critically ill children receiving peramivir for influenza A or B viral infections in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). SETTING: A 189\u2010bed, freestanding children\u0027s tertiary care teaching hospital in Philadelphia, PA. PATIENTS: Critically ill children admitted to the PICU who were infected with influenza between January 1, 2016 and March 31, 2018. INTERVENTIONS: None. RESULTS: Eleven patients, two females (18%) and nine males (82%), accounted for 24 peramivir samples for therapeutic drug management. The median age was 5 years (interquartile range 1.5\u20136.5 yrs) with a median weight of 16.4 kg (interquartile range 14\u201324 kg). Ten (91%) patients demonstrated a larger volume of distribution, 11 (100%) patients demonstrated an increase in clearance, and 11 (100%) patients demonstrated a shorter half\u2010life estimate as compared with the package insert and previous pediatric trial data for peramivir. Eight (73%) patients tested positive for a strain of influenza A and 3 (27%) patients tested positive for influenza B; 4 of 11 (36%) patients tested positive for multiple viruses. All patients had adjustments made to their dosing interval to a more frequent interval. Ten (91%) patients were adjusted to an every\u201012\u2010hour regimen and 1 (9%) patient was adjusted to an every\u20108\u2010hour regimen. No adverse events were associated with peramivir treatment. CONCLUSION: The pharmacokinetics of PRV demonstrated in this PICU cohort differs in comparison to healthy pediatric and adult patients, and alterations to dosing regimens may be needed in PICU patients to achieve pharmacodynamic exposures. Additional investigations in the PICU population are needed to confirm these findings.","publish_time":"2019-10-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cies, Jeffrey J.; Moore, Wayne S.; Enache, Adela; Chopra, Arun","journal":"Pharmacotherapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2503aa9036bf546348aace94f0375026ae5f379.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167779.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167779/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs0NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PICU","PRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PICU patients","adult patients","influenza B","peramivir samples","PICU cohort","PICU population","peramivir treatment","ill children","strain of influenza","B viral infections","pharmacokinetics of PRV","interquartile range","dosing interval","hour regimen","pediatric intensive care unit","previous pediatric trial data","median age","median weight","frequent interval","freestanding children\u0027s tertiary care teaching hospital","Philadelphia","bed","comparison","Retrospective electronic medical record review","DESIGN","package","therapeutic drug management","years","yrs","alterations","regimens","adverse events","Additional investigations","larger volume of distribution","multiple viruses","adjustments","pharmacodynamic exposures","shorter half\u2010life","CONCLUSION","increase","clearance","RESULTS","females","findings","SETTING","OBJECTIVE","INTERVENTIONS"],"language":"en"},

They provided direct patient care under modified conditions. They revised drug distribution procedures and developed new ones to meet more stringent infection\u2010control standards. Collaborative teamwork with key stakeholders was important in accomplishing tasks in an efficient and timely manner. Regular communication with health care staff took place internally and externally. Education and updated information for pharmacists was crucial. Conclusion. Pharmacists can play a vital role during crises in the areas of drug distribution, drug information, and direct patient care. Collaborative teamwork and close communication are keys to success. Pharmacists must be proactive and take a leadership role in assuming pharmacy\u2010related responsibilities. By evaluating what worked and what didn\u0027t, pharmacists can develop procedures for future crises requiring pharmacy support.","publish_time":"2012-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chin, Thomas W.

However, because of the absence of structural information of the monomer, the reasons for this remain unknown. To investigate it, two molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in water for dimer and monomer models have been carried out, using the crystal structure of protomer A of the dimer as the starting structure for the monomer. During the MD simulation of dimer, three interest phenomena of protomer A have been observed: (i) the distance between NE2 of His41 and SG of Cys145 averages 3.72 \u00C5, which agrees well with the experimental observations made by X\u2010ray crystallography; (ii) His163 and Glu166 form the \u201Ctooth\u201D conformational properties, resulting in the specificity for glutamine at substrate P1 site; and (iii) the substrate\u2010binding pocket formed by loop 140\u2013146 and loop 184\u2013197 is large enough to accommodate the substrate analog. However, during the MD simulation of the monomer complex, the three structural characteristics are all absent, which results directly in the inactivation of the monomer. Throughout the MD simulation of the dimer, the N\u2010terminus of protomer B forms stable hydrogen bonds with Phe140 and Glu166, through which His163, Glu166, and loop 140\u2013146 are kept active form. Furthermore, a water\u2010bridge has been found between the N\u2010terminus of protomer B and Gly170, which stabilizes His172 and avoids it moving toward Tyr161 to disrupt the H\u2010bond between Tyr161 and His163, stabilizing the conformation of His163. The interactions between the N\u2010terminus and another monomer maintain the activity of dimer.

Using a wood mouse population in the UK as a model we identified significant temporal clusters of individuals with extreme expression of immunological mediators across multiple loci, typical of an acute microbial infection. These clusters were circumstantially associated with demographic perturbation in the summertime wood mouse population. Animals in one cluster also had significantly higher individual macroparasite burdens than contemporaries with \u201Cnormal\u201D expression patterns. If the extreme transcriptional profiles observed are induced by an infectious agent then this implicates macroparasites as a possible player in mediating individual susceptibility or resilience to infection.

We aimed to investigate the relationship between influenza infection and IPD in Ontario, Canada, using several complementary methodological tools. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We evaluated a total number of 38,501 positive influenza tests in Central Ontario and 6,191 episodes of IPD in the Toronto/Peel area, Ontario, Canada, between 1 January 1995 and 3 October 2009, reported through population-based surveillance. We assessed the relationship between the seasonal wave forms for influenza and IPD using fast Fourier transforms in order to examine the relationship between these two pathogens over yearly timescales. We also used three complementary statistical methods (time-series methods, negative binomial regression, and case-crossover methods) to evaluate the short-term effect of influenza dynamics on pneumococcal risk. Annual periodicity with wintertime peaks could be demonstrated for IPD, whereas periodicity for influenza was less regular. As for long-term effects, phase and amplitude terms of pneumococcal and influenza seasonal sine waves were not correlated and meta-analysis confirmed significant heterogeneity of influenza, but not pneumococcal phase terms. In contrast, influenza was shown to Granger-cause pneumococcal disease. A short-term association between IPD and influenza could be demonstrated for 1-week lags in both case-crossover (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] for one case of IPD per 100 influenza cases = 1.10 [1.02\u20131.18]) and negative binomial regression analysis (incidence rate ratio [95% confidence interval] for one case of IPD per 100 influenza cases = 1.09 [1.05\u20131.14]). CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the hypothesis that influenza influences bacterial disease incidence by enhancing short-term risk of invasion in colonized individuals. The absence of correlation between seasonal waveforms, on the other hand, suggests that bacterial disease transmission is affected to a lesser extent.

The structure reveals surface features not present in the prototype HBV/A genotype. HBV/G is novel in that it has a unique 36- bp insertion downstream of the core gene start codon. This results in a twelve amino acid insertion at the N-terminal end of the core protein, and two stop codons in the precore region that prevent the expression of HBeAg. HBV/G replication in patients is associated with co-infection with another genotype of HBV, suggesting that HBV/G may have reduced replication efficiency in vivo. We localized the N-terminal insertion in HBV/G and show that it forms two additional masses on the core surface adjacent to each of the dimer-spikes and have modelled the structure of the additional residues within this density. We show that the position of the insertion would not interfere with translocation of nucleic acids through the pores to the core interior compartment.

In this study, we investigated the systemic alterations of mtDNA-depleted (\u03C1(0)) mitochondria by using network analysis of gene expression data. By modularizing the quantified proteomics data into protein functional networks, systemic properties of mitochondrial dysfunction were analyzed. We discovered that up-regulated and down-regulated proteins were organized into two predominant subnetworks that exhibited distinct biological processes. The down-regulated network modules are involved in typical mitochondrial functions, while up-regulated proteins are responsible for mtDNA repair and regulation of mt protein expression and transport. Furthermore, comparisons of proteome and transcriptome data revealed that \u03C1(0) cells attempted to compensate for mtDNA depletion by modulating the coordinated expression/transport of mt proteins.

TfR1 residues essential for this interaction have been described, and a co-crystal of MACV GP1 bound to TfR1 suggests GP1 residues important for this association. We created MACV GP1 variants and tested their effect on TfR1 binding and virus entry to evaluate the functional significance of some of these and additional residues in human and simian cells. We found residues R111, D123, Y122, and F226 to be essential, D155, and P160 important, and D114, S116, D140, and K169 expendable for the GP1-TfR1 interaction and MACV entry.

However, its mechanism of evolution and contribution to the epidemic spread of S. suis 2 remain unknown. In this study, the potential for mobilization of 89K was evaluated, and its putative transfer mechanism was investigated. We report that 89K can spontaneously excise to form an extrachromosomal circular product. The precise excision is mediated by an 89K-borne integrase through site-specific recombination, with help from an excisionase. The 89K excision intermediate acts as a substrate for lateral transfer to non-89K S. suis 2 recipients, where it reintegrates site-specifically into the target site. The conjugal transfer of 89K occurred via a GI type IV secretion system (T4SS) encoded in 89K, at a frequency of 10(\u22126) transconjugants per donor. This is the first demonstration of horizontal transfer of a Gram-positive PAI mediated by a GI-type T4SS.

Caseins, the major milk proteins, are secreted in the form of a micelle consisting of protein and calcium-phosphate. We have analysed the role of the milk protein \u03B1-casein by inactivating the corresponding gene in mice. Absence of \u03B1-casein protein significantly curtails secretion of other milk proteins and calcium-phosphate, suggesting a role for \u03B1-casein in the establishment of casein micelles. In contrast, secretion of albumin, which is not synthesized in the mammary epithelium, into milk is not reduced. The absence of \u03B1-casein also significantly inhibits transcription of the other casein genes. \u03B1-Casein deficiency severely delays pup growth during lactation and results in a life-long body size reduction compared to control animals, but has only transient effects on physical and behavioural development of the pups.

Although the interaction of lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) on leukocytes and its ligand, intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), plays essential roles in most inflammatory reactions, its pathogenetic role in the EMT of RTECs remains to be clarified. In the present study, we investigated the effect of the interaction of LFA-1 on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and ICAM-1 on HK-2 cells after stimulation with TGF-\u03B2(1) on the EMT of RTECs. ICAM-1 was highly expressed in HK-2 cells. After TGF-\u03B2(1) stimulation, the chemokines CCL3 and CXCL12 increased on HK-2 cells. After co-culture of PBMCs and HK-2 cells pre-stimulated with TGF-\u03B2(1) (0.1 ng/ml) (HK-2-TGF-\u03B2(1) (0.1)), the expression of the active form of LFA-1 increased on PBMCs; however, total LFA-1 expression did not change. The expression of the active form of LFA-1 on PBMCs did not increase after co-culture with not CCL3 but CXCL12 knockdown HK-2-TGF-\u03B2(1) (0.1). The expression of epithelial cell junction markers (E-cadherin and occludin) further decreased and that of mesenchymal markers (vimentin and fibronectin) further increased in HK-2-TGF-\u03B2(1) (0.1) after co-culture with PBMCs for 24 hrs (HK-2-TGF-\u03B2(1) (0.1)-PBMCs).

Although the migration and invasion of HK-2 cells induced full EMT by a high dose (10.0 ng/ml) and long-term (72\u201396 hrs) TGF-\u03B2(1) stimulation increased, that of HK-2-TGF-\u03B2(1) (0.1)-PBMCs did not increase.

Platelets are sentinel markers of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation. Experiments were designed to evaluate the time course and mechanism of direct interactions between platelets and leukocytes following acute activation of TLR4 by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Blood from age-matched male and female wild type (WT) and TLR4 gene deleted (dTLR4) mice was incubated with ultra-pure E. coli LPS (500 ng/ml) for up to one hour. At designated periods, leukocyte antigen positive platelets, platelet antigen positive leukocytes and cell-derived MV were quantified by flow cytometry. Numbers of platelet- or leukocyte-derived MV did not increase within one hour following in vitro exposure of blood to LPS. However, with LPS stimulation numbers of platelets staining positive for both platelet- and leukocyte-specific antigens increased in blood derived from WT but not dTLR4 mice. This effect was blocked by inhibition of TLR4 signaling mediated by My88 and TRIF. Seven days after a single intravenous injection of LPS (500 ng/mouse or 20 ng/gm body wt) to WT mice, none of the platelets stained for leukocyte antigen. However, granulocytes, monocytes and apoptotic bodies stained positive for platelet antigens. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Within one hour of exposure to LPS, leukocytes exchange surface antigens with platelets through TLR4 activation. In vivo, leukocyte expression of platelet antigen is retained after a single exposure to LPS following turn over of the platelet pool. Acute expression of leukocyte antigen on platelets within one hour of exposure to LPS and the sustained expression of platelet antigen on leukocytes following a single acute exposure to LPS in vivo explains, in part, associations of platelets and leukocytes in response to bacterial infection and changes in thrombotic propensity of the blood.","publish_time":"2011-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiong, Jing; Miller, Virginia M.; Hunter, Larry W.; Li, Yunman; Jayachandran, Muthuvel","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/264e7bc2caec36fca2b89d1f21198b8abb4a2d3e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3180459.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3180459/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozgz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["MV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["leukocyte antigen positive platelets","platelet antigen positive leukocytes","leukocyte expression of platelet antigen","LPS stimulation numbers of platelets","platelet antigens","associations of platelets","coli LPS","Acute expression of leukocyte antigen","TLR4 activation","exposure of blood","hour of exposure","leukocyte-derived MV","sustained expression of platelet antigen","acute activation of TLR4","single exposure","platelet pool","single acute exposure","WT mice","single intravenous injection of LPS","leukocyte-specific antigens","cell-derived MV","TLR4 gene","inhibition of TLR4","leukocytes exchange surface antigens","receptor-mediated activation","dTLR4 mice","cell-cell interaction","gm body wt","bacterial infection","bacterial lipopolysaccharide","age-matched male","female wild type","changes","mechanism of direct interactions","apoptotic bodies","response","Pro-coagulant membrane microvesicles","thrombotic propensity","mouse","turn","designated periods","time course","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","BACKGROUND","monocytes","My88","circulation","markers of toll","granulocytes","days","METHODOLOGY","TRIF","apoptosis","flow cytometry","SIGNIFICANCE","CONCLUSIONS","effect","Experiments"],"language":"en"},

The genes of these collectins (SFTPA1, SFTPA2 and SFTPD) are located in a cluster at 10q21-24. The objective of this study was to evaluate the existence of linkage disequilibrium (LD) among these genes, and the association of variability at these genes with susceptibility and outcome of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We also studied the effect of genetic variability on SP-D serum levels. METHODS: Seven non-synonymous polymorphisms of SFTPA1, SFTPA2 and SFTPD were analyzed. For susceptibility, 682 CAP patients and 769 controls were studied in a case-control study. Severity and outcome were evaluated in a prospective study. Haplotypes were inferred and LD was characterized. SP-D serum levels were measured in healthy controls. RESULTS: The SFTPD aa11-C allele was significantly associated with lower SP-D serum levels, in a dose-dependent manner. We observed the existence of LD among the studied genes. Haplotypes SFTPA1 6A(2 )(P = 0.0009, odds ration (OR) = 0.78), SFTPA2 1A(0 )(P = 0.002, OR = 0.79), SFTPA1-SFTPA2 6A(2)-1A(0 )(P = 0.0005, OR = 0.77), and SFTPD-SFTPA1-SFTPA2 C-6A(2)-1A(0 )(P = 0.00001, OR = 0.62) were underrepresented in patients, whereas haplotypes SFTPA2 1A(10 )(P = 0.00007, OR = 6.58) and SFTPA1-SFTPA2 6A(3)-1A (P = 0.0007, OR = 3.92) were overrepresented. Similar results were observed in CAP due to pneumococcus, though no significant differences were now observed after Bonferroni corrections. 1A(10 )and 6A-1A were associated with higher 28-day and 90-day mortality, and with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) respectively. SFTPD aa11-C allele was associated with development of MODS and ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that missense single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes of SFTPA1, SFTPA2 and SFTPD are associated with susceptibility to CAP, and that several haplotypes also influence severity and outcome of CAP.","publish_time":"2011-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garc\u00EDa-Laorden, M Isabel; Rodr\u00EDguez de Castro, Felipe; Sol\u00E9-Viol\u00E1n, Jordi; Rajas, Olga; Blanquer, Jos\u00E9; Border\u00EDas, Luis; Aspa, Javier; Briones, M Luisa; Saavedra, Pedro; Marcos-Ramos, J Alberto; Gonz\u00E1lez-Quevedo, Nereida; Sologuren, Ithaisa; Herrera-Ramos, Estefan\u00EDa; Ferrer, Jos\u00E9 M; Rello, Jordi; Rodr\u00EDguez-Gallego, Carlos","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f4a004209c6ba0dccef04dd78c2caf7ea0bda3c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3221990.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3221990/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzEyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SFTPD","LD","CAP","ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SFTPA1-SFTPA2","SFTPD-SFTPA1","haplotypes SFTPA2","Haplotypes SFTPA1","haplotypes of SFTPA1","SFTPA2 C","studied genes","SFTPD aa11-C allele","susceptibility","CAP patients","lower SP-D serum levels","non-synonymous polymorphisms of SFTPA1","existence of LD","prospective study","effect of genetic variability","association of variability","outcome of community","ARDS","case-control study","Severity","development of MODS","day mortality","healthy controls","Similar results","organ dysfunction syndrome","existence of linkage disequilibrium","missense single nucleotide polymorphisms","acute respiratory distress syndrome","pulmonary surfactant proteins","extent","clearance of microorganisms","collectins","significant differences","dose-dependent manner","METHODS","pneumococcus","INTRODUCTION","pneumonia","Bonferroni corrections","inflammatory response","CONCLUSIONS","odds ration","cluster","10q21","objective"],"language":"en"},

These mutants exhibit wild-type activity at permissive temperatures and reduced activity at restrictive temperatures. Although random mutagenesis can be used to generate TS mutants, the procedure is laborious and unfeasible in multicellular organisms. Further, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the TS phenotype are poorly understood. To elucidate TS mechanisms, we used a machine learning method\u2013logistic regression\u2013to investigate a large number of sequence and structure features. We developed and tested 133 features, describing properties of either the mutation site or the mutation site neighborhood. We defined three types of neighborhood using sequence distance, Euclidean distance, and topological distance. We discovered that neighborhood features outperformed mutation site features in predicting TS mutations. The most predictive features suggest that TS mutations tend to occur at buried and rigid residues, and are located at conserved protein domains. The environment of a buried residue often determines the overall structural stability of a protein, thus may lead to reversible activity change upon temperature switch. We developed TS prediction models based on logistic regression and the Lasso regularized procedure. Through a ten-fold cross-validation, we obtained the area under the curve of 0.91 for the model using both sequence and structure features. Testing on independent datasets suggested that the model predicted TS mutations with a 50% precision. In summary, our study elucidated the molecular basis of TS mutants and suggested the importance of neighborhood properties in determining TS mutations. We further developed models to predict TS mutations derived from single amino acid substitutions. In this way, TS mutants can be efficiently obtained through experimentally introducing the predicted mutations.","publish_time":"2011-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lockwood, Svetlana; Krishnamoorthy, Bala; Ye, Ping","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3b36cbef6bc5cbbd9ca8a7ce0d8581a3f7788c3.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9f5eb4cb37108793e2cf0ed3d5a68fea14620866.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9effda40334841573b2aa2600f56566a9faf71ff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3229608.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229608/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzEzNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TS mechanisms","TS phenotype","predicting TS mutations","model predicted TS mutations","molecular basis of TS mutants","TS prediction models","predicted mutations","structure features","predictive features","mutation site neighborhood","outperformed mutation site features","sequence distance","types of neighborhood","importance of neighborhood properties","logistic regression","reduced activity","Euclidean distance","topological distance","study","wild-type activity","reversible activity change","large number of sequence","underlying molecular mechanisms","permissive temperatures","restrictive temperatures","temperature switch","Temperature-sensitive","buried residue","Lasso regularized procedure","conserved protein domains","powerful tools","machine learning method","overall structural stability","single amino acid substitutions","independent datasets","multicellular organisms","gene function","fold cross-validation","area","Testing","environment","curve","summary","way","precision","rigid residues","random mutagenesis"],"language":"en"},

However, certain topic areas lack representation in terms of the quantity and quality of review literature available. The objectives of this paper are to identify the quantity, as well as quality, of review-level evidence available on the effectiveness of public health interventions for public health decision makers. METHODS: Searches conducted on http://www.health-evidence.ca produced an inventory of public health review literature in 21 topic areas. Gaps and areas of wealth in the review literature, as well as the proportion of reviews rated methodologically strong, moderate, or weak were identified. The top 10 topic areas of interest for registered users and visitors of http://www.health-evidence.ca were extracted from user profile data and Google Analytics. RESULTS: Registered users\u0027 top three interests included: 1) healthy communities, 2) chronic diseases, and 3) nutrition. The top three preferences for visitors included: 1) chronic diseases, 2) physical activity, and 3) addiction/substance use. All of the topic areas with many (301\u002B) available reviews were of interest to registered users and/or visitors (mental health, physical activity, addiction/substance use, adolescent health, child health, nutrition, adult health, and chronic diseases). Conversely, the majority of registered users and/or visitors did not have preference for topic areas with few (\u2264 150) available reviews (food safety and inspection, dental health, environmental health) with the exception of social determinants of health and healthy communities. Across registered users\u0027 and visitors\u0027 topic areas of preference, 80.2% of the reviews were of well-done methodological quality, with 43.5% of reviews having a strong quality rating and 36.7% a moderate review quality rating. CONCLUSIONS: In topic areas in which many reviews are available, higher level syntheses are needed to guide policy and practice. For other topic areas with few reviews, it is necessary to determine whether primary study evidence exists, or is needed, so that reviews can be conducted in the future. Considering that less than half of the reviews available on http://www.health-evidence.ca are of strong methodological quality, the quality of the review-level evidence needs to improve across the range of public health topic areas.","publish_time":"2011-10-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tirilis, Daiva; Husson, Heather; DeCorby, Kara; Dobbins, Maureen","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9ba1128dfcbbe8a753c6e1a7dbeed0e95a981917.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3229615.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229615/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzEzNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["available reviews","reviews available","range of public health topic areas","child health","adolescent health","dental health","adult health","environmental health","public health policy","quality of review literature available","inventory of public health review literature","visitors\u0027 topic areas of preference","areas of wealth","review-level evidence available","proportion of reviews","effectiveness of public health interventions","public health decision makers","moderate review quality rating","certain topic areas lack representation","High-quality review evidence","strong quality rating","strong methodological quality","visitors of","exception of social determinants of health","Registered users\u0027","well-done methodological quality","chronic diseases","majority of registered users","addiction","physical activity","substance use","quantity","nutrition","healthy communities","primary study evidence","higher level syntheses","practice decisions","inspection","terms","food safety","interests","user profile data","Google Analytics","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","Searches","paper","Gaps","half","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","objectives","preferences","future"],"language":"en"},

Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a pattern-recognition molecule, which functions as a first line of host defense. Pandemic H1N1 (pdmH1N1) influenza A virus caused massive infection in 2009 and currently circulates worldwide. Avian influenza A H9N2 (H9N2/G1) virus has infected humans and has the potential to be the next pandemic virus. Antiviral function and immunomodulatory role of MBL in pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 virus infection have not been investigated. Methods. In this study, MBL wild-type (WT) and MBL knockout (KO) murine models were used to examine the role of MBL in pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 virus infection. Results. Our study demonstrated that in vitro, MBL binds to pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 viruses, likely via the carbohydrate recognition domain of MBL. Wild-type mice developed more severe disease, as evidenced by a greater weight loss than MBL KO mice during influenza virus infection. Furthermore, MBL WT mice had enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines compared with MBL KO mice, suggesting that MBL could upregulate inflammatory responses that may potentially worsen pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 virus infections. Conclusions. Our study provided the first in vivo evidence that MBL may be a risk factor during pdmH1N1 and H9N2/G1 infection by upregulating proinflammatory response.","publish_time":"2011-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ling, Man To; Tu, Wenwei; Han, Yan; Mao, Huawei; Chong, Wai Po; Guan, Jing; Liu, Ming; Lam, Kwok Tai; Law, Helen K.

Our study aim is to clarify the role of sPLA2 and its modulators in the pathogenesis and clinical severity of hyaline membrane disease, infection related respiratory failure, meconium aspiration syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome. sPLA2 genes will also be sequenced and possible genetic involvement will be analysed.

Several clinical, respiratory and outcome data will be recorded. Laboratory researchers who perform the bench part of the study will be blinded to the clinical data. DISCUSSION: This study, thanks to its multicenter design, will clarify the role(s) of sPLA2 and its pathway in these diseases: sPLA2 might be the crossroad between inflammation and surfactant dysfunction.

During its replication, dengue virus induces dramatic alterations in the intracellular membranes of infected cells. This phenomenon is observed both in human and vector-derived cells. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry of mosquito cells, we show that this membrane remodeling is directly linked to a unique lipid repertoire induced by dengue virus infection. Specifically, 15% of the metabolites detected were significantly different between DENV infected and uninfected cells while 85% of the metabolites detected were significantly different in isolated replication complex membranes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that intracellular lipid redistribution induced by the inhibition of fatty acid synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme in lipid biosynthesis, is sufficient for cell survival but is inhibitory to dengue virus replication. Lipids that have the capacity to destabilize and change the curvature of membranes as well as lipids that change the permeability of membranes are enriched in dengue virus infected cells. Several sphingolipids and other bioactive signaling molecules that are involved in controlling membrane fusion, fission, and trafficking as well as molecules that influence cytoskeletal reorganization are also up regulated during dengue infection. These observations shed light on the emerging role of lipids in shaping the membrane and protein environments during viral infections and suggest membrane-organizing principles that may influence virus-induced intracellular membrane architecture.","publish_time":"2012-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perera, Rushika; Riley, Catherine; Isaac, Giorgis; Hopf-Jannasch, Amber S.; Moore, Ronald J.; Weitz, Karl W.; Pasa-Tolic, Ljiljana; Metz, Thomas O.; Adamec, Jiri; Kuhn, Richard J.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5fa62370245d4ad73220d6f42f8cb66064627aaa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3310792.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3310792/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzI4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dengue virus infected cells","dengue virus replication","dengue virus infection","Dengue virus causes","dengue infection","intracellular membranes of infected cells","uninfected cells","intracellular membrane architecture","membrane fusion","membrane remodeling","curvature of membranes","permeability of membranes","intracellular lipid redistribution","vector-derived cells","isolated replication complex membranes","lipid biosynthesis","DENV infected","molecules","metabolites","high-resolution mass spectrometry of mosquito cells","unique lipid repertoire","emerging role of lipids","viral infections","human pathogen","dramatic alterations","rate","cell survival","inhibition of fatty acid synthase","enzyme","protein environments","light","trafficking","observations","aggressive arthropod","fission","principles","cytoskeletal reorganization","sphingolipids","capacity","phenomenon","year"],"language":"en"},

Data on risk factors associated with death of pregnant women and neonates with pH1N1 infections are limited outside of developed countries. METHODS: Retrospective observational study in 394 severe or critical pregnant women admitted to a hospital with pH1N1 influenza from Sep. 1, 2009 to Dec. 31, 2009. rRT-PCR testing was used to confirm infection. In-hospital mortality was the primary endpoint of this study. Univariable logistic analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to investigate the potential factors on admission that might be associated with the maternal and neonatal mortality. RESULTS: 394 pregnant women were included, 286 were infected with pH1N1 in the third trimester. 351 had pneumonia, and 77 died. A PaO(2)/FiO(2 )\u2264 200 (odds ratio (OR), 27.16; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.64-279.70) and higher BMI (i.e. \u2265 30) on admission (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.47) were independent risk factors for maternal death. Of 211 deliveries, 146 neonates survived. Premature delivery (OR, 4.17; 95% CI, 1.19-14.56) was associated neonatal mortality. Among 186 patients who received mechanical ventilation, 83 patients were treated with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and 38 were successful with NIV. The death rate was lower among patients who initially received NIV than those who were initially intubated (24/83, 28.9% vs 43/87, 49.4%; p = 0.006). Septic shock was an independent risk factor for failure of NIV. CONCLUSIONS: Severe hypoxemia and higher BMI on admission were associated with adverse outcomes for pregnant women. Preterm delivery was a risk factor for neonatal death among pregnant women with pH1N1 influenza infection. NIV may be useful in selected pregnant women without septic shock.","publish_time":"2012-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Peng-jun; Li, Xiao-li; Cao, Bin; Yang, Shi-gui; Liang, Li-rong; Gu, Li; Xu, Zhen; Hu, Ke; Zhang, Hong-yuan; Yan, Xi-xin; Huang, Wen-bao; Chen, Wei; Zhang, Jing-xiao; Li, Lan-juan; Wang, Chen","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f878c22a305dd438a73a4cae73cb5446d801dc17.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3311613.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3311613/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzI5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["death of pregnant women","critical pregnant women","selected pregnant women","neonatal death","independent risk factors","pH1N1 influenza infection","pH1N1 infections","maternal death","patients","failure of NIV","admission","neonatal mortality","CI","increased risk of severe illness","death rate","hospital mortality","Severe hypoxemia","Septic shock","potential factors","higher BMI","neonates","Univariable logistic analysis","multivariate logistic regression analysis","mechanical ventilation","non-invasive ventilation","Preterm delivery","Premature delivery","Retrospective observational study","adverse outcomes","primary endpoint","CONCLUSIONS","pandemic H1N1","METHODS","BACKGROUND","Data","rRT-PCR testing","developed countries","vs","confidence interval","RESULTS","PaO","FiO","odds ratio","deliveries","trimester","pneumonia"],"language":"en"},

The humoral immune response plays an important role in the defense against these viruses, providing protection mainly by producing antibodies directed against the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein. However, their high genetic variability allows the virus to evade the host immune response and the potential protection offered by seasonal vaccines. The emergence of resistance to antiviral drugs in recent years further limits the options available for the control of influenza. The development of alternative strategies for influenza prophylaxis and therapy is therefore urgently needed. In this study, we describe a human monoclonal antibody (PN-SIA49) that recognizes a highly conserved epitope located on the stem region of the HA and able to neutralize a broad spectrum of influenza viruses belonging to different subtypes (H1, H2 and H5). Furthermore, we describe its protective activity in mice after lethal challenge with H1N1 and H5N1 viruses suggesting a potential application in the treatment of influenza virus infections.","publish_time":"2012-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Marco, Donata; Clementi, Nicola; Mancini, Nicasio; Solforosi, Laura; Moreno, Guisella J.; Sun, Xiangjie; Tumpey, Terrence M.; Gubareva, Larisa V.; Mishin, Vasiliy; Clementi, Massimo; Burioni, Roberto","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b51562f63de5739f2b7ebf5f9c34365ac6ee545.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3319592.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3319592/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzMwMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza prophylaxis","control of influenza","broad spectrum of influenza viruses","H5N1 viruses","treatment of influenza virus infections","potential protection","important human pathogens","host immune response","humoral immune response","potential application","important role","human monoclonal antibody","lethal challenge","recent years","annual epidemics","H1N1","different subtypes","antiviral drugs","mice","stem region","options available","development of alternative strategies","PN-SIA49","emergence of resistance","H2","protective activity","therapy","defense","conserved epitope","devastating pandemics","hemagglutinin","high genetic variability","antibodies","seasonal vaccines","glycoprotein","study"],"language":"en"},

A therapeutic antibody against the viral envelope (E) protein represents a promising immunotherapy for disease control. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We generated seventeen novel mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with high reactivity against E protein of dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2). The mAbs were further dissected using recombinant E protein domain I-II (E-DI-II) and III (E-DIII) of DENV-2. Using plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and mouse protection assay with lethal doses of DENV-2, we identified four serotype-specific mAbs that had high neutralizing activity against DENV-2 infection. Of the four, E-DIII targeting mAb DB32-6 was the strongest neutralizing mAb against diverse DENV-2 strains. Using phage display and virus-like particles (VLPs) we found that residue K310 in the E-DIII A-strand was key to mAb DB32-6 binding E-DIII. We successfully converted DB32-6 to a humanized version that retained potency for the neutralization of DENV-2 and did not enhance the viral infection. The DB32-6 showed therapeutic efficacy against mortality induced by different strains of DENV-2 in two mouse models even in post-exposure trials. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We used novel epitope mapping strategies, by combining phage display with VLPs, to identify the important A-strand epitopes with strong neutralizing activity. This study introduced potential therapeutic antibodies that might be capable of providing broad protection against diverse DENV-2 infections without enhancing activity in humans.","publish_time":"2012-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Pi-Chun; Liao, Mei-Ying; Cheng, Ping-Chang; Liang, Jian-Jong; Liu, I-Ju; Chiu, Chien-Yu; Lin, Yi-Ling; Chang, Gwong-Jen J.; Wu, Han-Chung","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6848f444e963e825730c6fbcf63b78b65d0efd3d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3341331.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3341331/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzQ0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diverse DENV","neutralization of DENV","binding E-DIII","different strains of DENV","lethal doses of DENV","mAb DB32","E protein of dengue virus type","recombinant E protein domain","high neutralizing activity","strongest neutralizing mAb","strong neutralizing activity","mouse protection assay","mouse models","novel mouse monoclonal antibodies","potential therapeutic antibodies","therapeutic efficacy","therapeutic antibody","phage display","VLPs","viral infection","serotype-specific mAbs","high reactivity","broad protection","strand epitopes","viral envelope","novel epitope mapping strategies","plaque reduction neutralization test","PRNT","significant public health threat","subtropical regions","promising immunotherapy","mortality","infections","key","SIGNIFICANCE","post-exposure trials","potency","particles","residue K310","disease control","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","humanized version","world","study","BACKGROUND","METHODOLOGY","CONCLUSIONS","humans"],"language":"en"},

Here, we characterized this process relative to (1) specific 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA cleavage sites and (2) identity of specific upstream signaling elements in this pathway. Capillary electrophoresis indicated that DON at concentrations as low as 200 ng/ml evoked selective rRNA cleavage after 6 h and that 1000 ng/ml caused cleavage within 2 h. Northern blot analysis revealed that DON exposure induced six rRNA cleavage fragments from 28S rRNA and five fragments from 18S rRNA. When selective kinase inhibitors were used to identify potential upstream signals, RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR), hematopoietic cell kinase (Hck), and p38 were found to be required for rRNA cleavage, whereas c-Jun N-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase were not. Furthermore, rRNA fragmentation was suppressed by the p53 inhibitors pifithrin-\u03B1 and pifithrin-\u03BC as well as the pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. Concurrent apoptosis was confirmed by acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining and flow cytometry. DON activated caspases 3, 8, and 9, thus suggesting the possible coinvolvement of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in rRNA cleavage. Satratoxin G (SG), anisomycin, and ricin also induced specific rRNA cleavage profiles identical to those of DON, suggesting that ribotoxins might share a conserved rRNA cleavage mechanism. Taken together, DON-induced rRNA cleavage is likely to be closely linked to apoptosis activation and appears to involve the sequential activation of PKR/Hck \u2192p38\u2192p53\u2192caspase 8/9\u2192caspase 3.","publish_time":"2012-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Kaiyu; Zhou, Hui-Ren; Pestka, James J.","journal":"Toxicological Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e780acee813f0a8ed30ad3e2db8b957201c78a8b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3355321.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article-pdf/127/2/382/16684710/kfs134.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzQ2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Satratoxin G"],"organizations":["DON","PKR/Hck"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rRNA cleavage fragments","selective rRNA cleavage","S rRNA","DON-induced rRNA cleavage","rRNA fragmentation","conserved rRNA cleavage mechanism","specific rRNA cleavage profiles identical","S ribosomal RNA cleavage sites","DON exposure","selective kinase inhibitors","RNA-activated protein kinase","N-terminal kinase","hematopoietic cell kinase","extracellular signal-regulated kinase","Hck","identity of specific","p38","apoptosis activation","p53 inhibitors pifithrin-\u03B1","sequential activation of PKR","pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD","pifithrin-\u03BC","Concurrent apoptosis","known translational inhibitor","potential upstream signals","acridine orange","ethidium bromide staining","intrinsic apoptotic pathways","ricin","anisomycin","concentrations","Northern blot analysis","flow cytometry","SG","FMK","ribotoxins","possible coinvolvement","trichothecene mycotoxin deoxynivalenol","Satratoxin G","elements","Capillary electrophoresis","process relative","caspases"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: The sequence similarity between TCoV and IBV was lower than that among TCoV isolates or that among IBV strains. The variation of sequences between TCoV and IBV was mainly contributed by the S protein gene. The sequence similarity of S gene between TCoV and IBV was lower than that among TCoV isolates or that among IBV strains.

CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that TCoV probably shared the same origin with that of IBV and acquired sequences of S gene for turkey intestine tropism during the process of evolution in a separate environment.","publish_time":"2006-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Loa, Chien Chang; Wu, Ching Ching; Lin, Tsang Long","journal":"Intervirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd3591e712d11a84aa52501d8cfb0b502260be0a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7179528.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7179528/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs5OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":["Indiana"],"keyphrases":["isolates of TCoV","TCoV isolates","different IBV strains","S protein region","S protein gene","structural protein","sequences of S gene","sequence similarity of S gene","region of turkey coronavirus","variation of sequences","phylogenetic tree","RESULTS","different topology","separate environment","separate clusters","corresponding sequences of infectious bronchitis virus","turkey intestine tropism","Indiana","outbreaks of acute enteritis","groups","process of evolution","North Carolina","genes","Minnesota","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","origin","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Twenty-two children with repaired cleft palate were allocated into two age groups: younger children (YC: n = 13) and older children (OC: n = 9). VOT measurements from monosyllabic words (/pa/, /ta/, and /ka/) and intraspeaker VOT variability estimated by coefficients of variation (CoV) of two age groups were compared. RESULTS: Age was found to have a statistically significant effect on VOT and VOT variability. Specifically, OC had significantly longer VOT (F(1,66) = 4.196, p \u003C 0.05) and less VOT variability (F(1,66) = 6.007, p \u003C 0.05) for English voiceless stops than YC. No statistically significant main effect for speech sample or age by speech sample interaction was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our data supplement the existing literature by adding VOT and VOT variability information for older children/adolescents with repaired cleft palate. Findings from the study suggest VOT patterns acquired at younger age appear to be further exaggerated and stabilized during the adolescent period among children with repaired cleft palate. A future study is necessary to determine different sources of VOT variability in children with a history of cleft palate, which may have clinical therapeutic implications.","publish_time":"2019-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bae, Youkyung","journal":"Folia Phoniatr Logop","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cfc904085dde037ed282fdf8404ebd7a1c2b2792.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7179555.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7179555/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VOT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VOT patterns","VOT measurements","longer VOT","VOT variability information","intraspeaker VOT variability","different sources of VOT variability","repaired cleft palate","older children","younger children","effect of age","younger age","age groups","history of cleft palate","significant effect","significant main effect","YC","OC","speech sample interaction","future study","adolescents","existing literature","voice onset time","coefficients of variation","data supplement","adolescent period","monosyllabic words","CoV","English voiceless stops","CONCLUSIONS","clinical therapeutic implications","Findings","ka","METHODS","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

We report their application to the swine-origin pandemic H1N1 virus (S-OIV). A database of all influenza A viruses, for which complete genome sequences were available in Genbank by October 2009, was created and dynamic programming was used to compute distances between all corresponding segments. A reassortment network was created to obtain the minimum cost evolutionary paths from all viruses to the exemplar S-OIV A/California/04/2009. This analysis took 35 hours on the Cray Extreme Multithreading (XMT) supercomputer, which has special hardware to permit efficient parallelization. Six specific H1N1/H1N2 bottleneck viruses were identified that almost always lie on minimum cost paths to S-OIV. We conjecture that these viruses are crucial to S-OIV evolution and worthy of careful study from a molecular biology viewpoint. In phylogenetics, ancestors are typically medians that have no functional constraints. In our method, ancestors are not inferred, but rather chosen from previously observed viruses along a path of mutation and reassortment leading to the target virus. This specificity and functional constraint render our results actionable for further experiments in vitro and in vivo.","publish_time":"2011-06-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bokhari, Shahid H.; Pomeroy, Laura W.; Janies, Daniel A.","journal":"IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df596a3cbca4e5dc29fd6dbe365f1a24b35d1f87.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7186031.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7186031/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Cray Extreme Multithreading"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["observed viruses","S-OIV evolution","evolution of segmented viruses","exemplar S-OIV","H1N2 bottleneck viruses","Reassortment Networks","minimum cost paths","ancestors","minimum cost evolutionary paths","specific H1N1","path of mutation","target virus","functional constraints","swine-origin pandemic H1N1 virus","worthy of careful study","supercomputer","Cray Extreme Multithreading","complete genome sequences","XMT","special hardware","results actionable","molecular biology viewpoint","distances","hours","Genbank","medians","efficient parallelization","application","specificity","Prior research","influenza","California","dynamic programming","corresponding segments","experiments","analysis","phylogenetics","database","method"],"language":"en"},

For hydrogel generation, control, COPD GOLD IV, and fibrotic human lung tissues were decellularized, lyophilized, ground into powder, porcine pepsin solubilized, buffered with PBS, and gelled at 37\u00B0C. Rheological properties from tissues and hydrogels were assessed with a low-load compression tester measuring the stiffness and viscoelastic properties in terms of a generalized Maxwell model representing phases of viscoelastic relaxation. The ECM hydrogels had a greater stress relaxation than tissues. ECM hydrogels required three Maxwell elements with slightly faster relaxation times (\u03C4) than that of native tissue, which required four elements. The relative importance (R(i)) of the first Maxwell element contributed the most in ECM hydrogels, whereas for tissue the contribution was spread over all four elements. IPF tissue had a longer-lasting fourth element with a higher R(i) than the other tissues, and IPF ECM hydrogels did require a fourth Maxwell element, in contrast to all other ECM hydrogels.

Although a few studies have assessed these topics in a laboratory setting, little is known about the magnitude of discomfort and the level of exertion experienced by workers while they deliver health care to patients for prolonged periods. The purpose of this study was to determine the magnitude of discomfort and level of exertion experienced by health care workers while wearing respiratory protection for periods up to 8 hr when performing their typical occupational duties. This project was a multiple cross-over field trial of 27 health care workers, aged 24\u201365, performing their typical, hospital-based occupational duties. Each participant served as his/her own control and wore one of seven respirators or a medical mask for 8 hr (or as long as tolerable) with interposed doffing periods every 2 hr. Self-perceived discomfort and exertion were quantified before each doffing: self-perceived level of discomfort using a visual analog scale, and self-perceived level of exertion using a Borg scale. Overall, and as would be expected, discomfort increased over time with continual respirator use over an 8-hr period. Interestingly, exertion increased only marginally over the same time period. The relatively low level of exertion associated with eight respiratory protective devices, including models commonly used in the U.S. health care workplace, is not likely to substantially influence workers\u2019 tolerability or occupational productivity. However, the magnitude of discomfort does appear to increase significantly over time with prolonged wear. These results suggest that respirator-related discomfort, but not exertion, negatively influences respirator tolerance over prolonged periods. Discomfort may also interfere with the occupational duties of workers.","publish_time":"2011-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shenal, Brian V.; Radonovich, Lewis J.; Cheng, Jing; Hodgson, Michael; Bender, Bradley S.","journal":"J Occup Environ Hyg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dec004e1d86c83df7737395a72b77a7551042782.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7196691.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7196691/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsyNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["magnitude of discomfort","self-perceived level of discomfort","self-perceived level of exertion","low level of exertion","Self-perceived discomfort","nature of discomfort","health care workers","respirator-related discomfort","health care workplace","occupational duties of workers","prolonged periods","typical occupational duties","respiratory protection","occupational productivity","hr period","time period","interposed doffing periods","respirator tolerance","prolonged wear","respiratory protective devices","continual respirator use","Borg scale","visual analog scale","field trial","multiple cross","workers\u2019 tolerability","models","patients","topics","respirators","medical mask","results","hospital","laboratory setting","project","study","purpose","studies","control","participant"],"language":"en"},

RNA-seq analysis revealed that ZIKV infection alters several and diverse biological processes, including stress, locomotion, lipid metabolism, imaginal disc morphogenesis and regulation of JAK/STAT signaling. To explore the interaction between ZIKV infection and JAK/STAT signaling regulation, we generated genetic constructs overexpressing ZIKV-specific non-structural proteins NS2A, NS2B, NS4A and NS4B. We found that ectopic expression of non-structural proteins in the developing Drosophila eye significantly restricts growth of the larval and adult eye and correlates with considerable repression of the in vivo JAK/STAT reporter, 10XStat92E-GFP. At the cellular level, eye growth defects are associated with reduced rate of proliferation without affecting the overall rate of apoptosis. In addition, ZIKV NS4A genetically interacts with the JAK/STAT signaling components; co-expression of NS4A along with the dominant-negative form of domeless or StatRNAi results in aggravated reduction in eye size, while co-expression of NS4A in HopTuml (also known as hop(Tum)) mutant background partially rescues the hop-induced eye overgrowth phenotype. The function of ZIKV NS4A in regulating growth is maintained in the wing, where ZIKV NS4A overexpression in the pouch domain results in reduced growth linked with diminished expression of Notch targets, Wingless (Wg) and Cut, and the Notch reporter, NRE-GFP. Thus, our study provides evidence that ZIKV infection in Drosophila results in restricted growth of the developing eye and wing, wherein eye phenotype is induced through regulation of JAK/STAT signaling, whereas restricted wing growth is induced through regulation of Notch signaling.

One of its major ligands, IGF2, is critical for long-term memory formation and strengthening. Using CIM6P/IGF2R inhibition in rats and neuron-specific knockdown in mice, here we show that hippocampal CIM6P/IGF2R is necessary for hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation, but dispensable for learning, memory retrieval, and reconsolidation. CIM6P/IGF2R controls the training-induced upregulation of de novo protein synthesis, including increase of Arc, Egr1, and c-Fos proteins, without affecting their mRNA induction. Hippocampal or systemic administration of mannose-6-phosphate, like IGF2, significantly enhances memory retention and persistence in a CIM6P/IGF2R-dependent manner. Thus, hippocampal CIM6P/IGF2R plays a critical role in memory consolidation by controlling the rate of training-regulated protein metabolism and is also a target mechanism for memory enhancement.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Xiao-Wen; Pandey, Kiran; Katzman, Aaron C; Alberini, Cristina M","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cf1a3f2c99ff8a8ee51ec7dbaf37cfe580dd730d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7200152.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7200152/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjszNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hippocampal CIM6P","IGF2R inhibition","memory retrieval","memory retention","memory enhancement","hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation","IGF2R-dependent manner","long-term memory formation","phosphate receptor","critical role","rate of training","growth factor","novo protein synthesis","training-induced upregulation","regulated protein metabolism","systemic administration of mannose","Cation-independent mannose","rats","learning","Egr1","neuron-specific knockdown","increase of Arc","insulin","target mechanism","c-Fos proteins","important roles","mice","persistence","development","major ligands","reconsolidation","mature nervous system","mRNA induction","functions"],"language":"en"},

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: From 1987 through 2005, of 5792 patients referred to blood transfusion services at two Japanese university hospitals for autologous blood donations, 314 children younger than 16 years old served as subjects for assessment. RESULTS: Of 314 children, 7 were not suitable as autologous donors. In most cases this was due to uncooperative behavior. Over a follow\u2010up period of 19 years, the authors encountered 53 cases (17.3%) of donation\u2010related problems, and this rate was higher than the 6 percent rate recorded for adult cases (316/5305).

Meteorological patterns have a decisive influence on the inter\u2010annual dynamics of therophyte pastures under Mediterranean climatic conditions. The germination behaviour of annual pasture species was studied by subjecting two collections of seeds taken from plants and soil\u2010seed banks to two phytotron\u2010simulated weather patterns: early and late autumn rains.

The most common diseases identified in association with PTE were neoplasia, anemia of unidentified cause, and pancreatitis. Cats with glomerulonephritis, encephalitis, pneumonia, heart disease, and hepatic lipidosis were also represented in this study. Most cats with PTE demonstrated dyspnea and respiratory distress before death or euthanasia, but PTE was not recognized ante mortem in any cat studied. In conclusion, PTE can affect cats of any age and is associated with a variety of systemic and inflammatory disorders.

Given the apparent high mortality associated with the novel swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus (S-OIV) in Mexico, we aimed to study the cytokine profiles induced by S-OIV and the effect of immunomodulators. Methods. We assayed cytokines and their messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in culture supernatants of human macrophages infected with H5N1, S-OIV California/04/2009 (S-OIV-CA), S-OIV Hong Kong/415742 (S-OIV-HK), or seasonal H1N1 with or without celecoxib and mesalazine. Results. Among the 12 cytokines showing detectable levels, levels of 8 proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL] 2R, IL-6, interferon [IFN] \u03B1, macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP] \u03B1, MIP-1b, IFN-induced protein 10, regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted [RANTES], and monocyte chemotactic protein [MCP] 1) were higher in cells infected by H5N1 but similar among cells infected with H1N1, S-OIV-CA, or SOIV- HK. The levels of the other 4 cytokines were similar for H5N1, H1N1, S-OIV-CA and S-OIV-HK. Among the 8 cytokines induced by H5N1, 6 were suppressed by celecoxib and mesalazine. The mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor a, IFN-\u03B3, IL-6, and MCP-1 induced by H5N1 were higher than the levels of other cytokines at 12 and/or 24 h. Conclusions. No major cytokine storm, as seen in H5N1 infection, is associated with S-OIV infection of cell lines. The mainstay of treatment for uncomplicated S-OIV infections should be antiviral agents without immunomodulators. For individual S-OIV-infected patients with severe primary viral pneumonia, severe sepsis, and multiorgan failure, immunomodulators may be considered as an adjunctive therapy in clinical trials.","publish_time":"2010-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Woo, Patrick C.

Thus, alternated attenuation method was sought to reduce the reactogenicity of strain rSC0011. Herein, we described another recombinant attenuated S.

RESULTS: The strain rSC0012 strain with the \u0394P(fur88)::TT araC P(BAD)fur mutation induced less production of inflammatory cytokines than strain rSC0011 with the \u0394P(crp527)::TT araC P(BAD)crp mutation in mice. When delivering the same pS-SaoA plasmid, the intraperitoneal LD(50) of rSC0012 was 18.2 times higher than that of rSC0011 in 3-week-old BALB/C mice. rSC0012 with either pS-SaoA or pYA3493 was cleared from spleen and liver tissues 7 days earlier than rSC0011 with same vectors after oral inoculation. The strain rSC0012 synthesizing SaoA induced high titers of anti-SaoA antibodies in both systemic (IgG in serum) and mucosal (IgA in vaginal washes) sites, as well as increased level of IL-4, the facilitator of Th2-type T cell immune response in mice.

However, there is a lack of early signs suggesting right ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction prior to acute cor pulmonale development. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analytical cohort study of patients for acute respiratory distress syndrome undertaking an echocardiography during admission in the cardiothoracic intensive care unit. Patients were divided according to treatment: conventional protective ventilation (38 patients, 38%); interventional lung assist (23 patients, 23%); veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (37 patients, 37%). Systolic and diastolic function was studied assessing, respectively: right ventricular systolic longitudinal function (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion) and systolic contraction duration (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion length); right ventricular diastolic filling time and right ventricular diastolic restrictive pattern (presence of pulmonary valve presystolic ejection wave). Correlation between the respiratory mechanics and systo-diastolic parameters were analysed. RESULTS: In 98 patients studied, systolic dysfunction (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion \u003C16 mm) was present in 33.6% while diastolic restrictive pattern was present in 64%.

Pulmonary valve presystolic ejection wave was associated with tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (P\u003C0.0001), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion length (P\u003C0.0001), right ventricular diastolic filling time (P\u003C0.0001), positive end-expiratory pressure (P\u003C0.0001) and peak inspiratory pressure (P\u003C0.0001). CONCLUSION: Diastolic restrictive pattern is present in a remarkable percentage of patients with respiratory distress syndrome. Bedside echocardiography allows a mechanistic evaluation of systolic and diastolic interaction of the right ventricle.","publish_time":"2019-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tavazzi, Guido; Bergsland, Niels; Alcada, Joana; Price, Susanna","journal":"Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7094e2913085b75ad19bc3d7f1719c85102a5a7b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206565.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206565/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs0NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion length","systolic dysfunction","ventricular systolic longitudinal function","diastolic dysfunction","diastolic function","ventricular diastolic restrictive pattern","ventricular diastolic filling time","systolic contraction duration","mechanistic evaluation of systolic","diastolic interaction","right ventricle","pathophysiology of right ventricular failure","systo-diastolic parameters","remarkable percentage of patients","acute respiratory distress syndrome","respiratory mechanics","retrospective analytical cohort study of patients","severe respiratory insufficiency","presence of pulmonary valve presystolic ejection wave","Bedside echocardiography","negative correlation","peak inspiratory pressure","acute cor pulmonale development","positive end-expiratory pressure","admission","veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","incidence","cardiothoracic intensive care unit","treatment","conventional protective ventilation","lack of early signs","CONCLUSION","interventional lung assist","METHODS","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The field has advanced dramatically over the past 40 years, driven in part by major advances in isolation and manufacturing technologies that have brought these important biologics to the forefront of modern medicine. However, the global uptake of monoclonal antibody (mAb) biologics is impeded by biophysical and biochemical liabilities, production limitations, the need for cold-chain storage and transport, as well as high costs of manufacturing and distribution. Some of these hurdles may be overcome through transient in vivo gene delivery platforms, such as non-viral synthetic plasmid DNA and messenger RNA vectors that are engineered to encode optimized mAb genes. These approaches turn the body into a biological factory for antibody production, eliminating many of the steps involved in bioprocesses and providing several other significant advantages, and differ from traditional gene therapy (permanent delivery) approaches. In this review, we focus on nucleic acid delivery of antibody employing synthetic plasmid DNA vector platforms, and RNA delivery, these being important approaches that are advancing simple, rapid, in vivo expression and having an impact in animal models of infectious diseases and cancer, among others.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patel, Ami; Bah, Mamadou A.; Weiner, David B.","journal":"BioDrugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce29d6fd830328479838bff6e1e4f5372702abeb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211204.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7211204/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs0NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA delivery","antibody production","gene delivery platforms","permanent delivery","nucleic acid delivery of antibody","Antibody immunotherapy","important approaches","important biologics","synthetic plasmid DNA vector platforms","global uptake of monoclonal antibody","non-viral synthetic plasmid DNA","forefront of modern medicine","production limitations","manufacturing technologies","messenger RNA vectors","traditional gene therapy","high costs of manufacturing","optimized mAb genes","need","animal models of infectious diseases","transport","impact","biochemical liabilities","cold-chain storage","major advances","biological factory","expression","cancer","isolation","significant advantages","bioprocesses","distribution","years","review","steps","field","hurdles"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to explore the associations between MetS risk factors and the lung function. SUBJECTS/METHODS: The cross-sectional study included 6945 participants attending health examination between 2010 and 2012 in Taiwan. MetS was assessed according to the criteria of National Cholesterol Education Program III. Spirometric parameters were measured to define lung function. The relationships were tested using multiple linear regression and logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The prevalence of MetS was significantly higher in males (16.2%) than females (3.8%). Although the prevalence of restrictive lung disease (RLD) was comparable between genders (20.7 and 21.0%), males with co-existent MetS had a higher prevalence of RLD than females (27.4 vs. 18.0%). Abdominal obesity, indicated by waist circumference (WC) and weight-to-height ratio (WHtR), was the most significant factor associated with lung function decline. Other components of MetS also showed statistically significant relationships, but very weak, with lung function. There was a trend toward an increased prevalence of RLD with the increasing number of MetS scores in males, independent of age, smoking, and body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal obesity was the key component of MetS associated with mechanical effect on lung function impairment in a prime-age adult population. Although RLD was not associated with increased probability of having MetS, the participants with more MetS scores were at a higher risk of losing lung function.","publish_time":"2019-08-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Yi-Yen; Tsao, Yu-Chung; Yang, Chih-Kai; Chuang, Chung-Hsun; Yu, Wei; Chen, Jih-Chang; Li, Wen-Cheng","journal":"Eur J Clin Nutr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be9262b345607607ffd91ac898ab9a6ed128e1a0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7214249.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7214249/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs0ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MetS","National Cholesterol Education Program III","RLD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prevalence of MetS","lung function impairment","components of MetS","lung function decline","MetS risk factors","key component of MetS","co-existent MetS","higher prevalence of RLD","increased prevalence of RLD","increasing number of MetS scores","prevalence of restrictive lung disease","higher risk","Increased evidence","increased probability","participants","Abdominal obesity","significant relationships","females","independent of age","significant factor","cross-sectional study","multiple linear regression","logistic regression analyses","prime-age adult population","mechanical effect","smoking","weight","waist circumference","metabolic syndrome","criteria of National Cholesterol Education Program","OBJECTIVES","health examination","associations","body mass index","height ratio","WC","WHtR","SUBJECTS","METHODS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","trend","Spirometric parameters","genders","RESULTS","Taiwan"],"language":"en"},

This becomes a necessity in the case of infectious agents such as respiratory viruses that cause diseases with very similar signs and symptoms. Such tools will permit rapid and accurate diagnosis of different agents causing respiratory infection leading to the most adequate prevention and/or treatment measures. In this article a reverse\u2010line blot hybridization (RLB) assay for the detection of a wide range of respiratory viruses is presented and evaluated for its usefulness in routine diagnosis. This assay employs an array of 18 oligonucleotide probes immobilized on a nylon membrane. Biotin\u2010labeled PCR products obtained with two multiplex reverse transcription (RT)\u2010polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays described previously, which allow for the detection of fourteen different groups of respiratory viruses, were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. Detection was performed using a chemiluminescent method. The standardization of the method showed that the RLB assay could be an alternative to the nested PCR assay for enhancing the sensitivity in the detection of the amplified products, avoiding the problem of cross\u2010over contamination, increasing the specificity, and therefore simplifying the method. This is of main interest in laboratories with few facilities. The feasibility and accuracy of the RT\u2010PCR\u2010RLB assay for detecting respiratory viruses proves that such approach could be a first stage to develop a microarray assay for routine diagnosis of infectious diseases.

A subset of these act as peripheral sentinels, specializing in the uptake, processing and presentation of antigenic material combined with an ability to detect a wide variety of \u2018danger\u2019 signals. These \u2018danger\u2019 or activation signals induce profound changes in dendritic cell physiology, facilitating the efficient stimulation of both adaptive and innate immunity. In the present review, a number of recent advances in the understanding of DC biology are discussed. These advances offer insights into the pathogenesis of a wide variety of diseases and point towards future strategies for immunotherapy.","publish_time":"2000-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stockwin, Luke H; McGonagle, Dennis; Martin, Iain G; Blair, G Eric","journal":"Immunol Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be48a509300c6920dd211aec21224efffd0e638a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159383.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159383/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs1MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dendritic cells","NK cells","group of cells","Immunological effector cells","activation signals","environmental signals","ability","danger","wide variety of diseases","present review","dendritic cell physiology","number of recent advances","advances offer insights","understanding of DC biology","profound changes","efficient stimulation","pathogenesis","uptake","related family","presentation of antigenic material","peripheral sentinels","processing","antigens","professional antigen","innate immunity","future strategies","subset","fingerprints of specific infections","immunotherapy"],"language":"en"},

On the basis of size and shape 7 distinct viral types were detected: 24 nm parvovirus\u2010like particles, 30 nm astrovirus, 30 nm picornavirus\u2010like particles, reovirus, rotavirus, coronavirus and a 75 nm \u201Ctogavirus\u2010like\u201D particle. The incidence of these particles in the 208 cats was 11%, 7%, 6%, 0.4%, 5%, 1% and 1% respectively. Virus isolation studies using 40 of the faecal samples succeeded in isolating reovirus 1 in 2 cases. Immune electron microscope studies demonstrated the presence of antibody in a human serum to cat astrovirus, but failed to clarify the identity of the parvovirus\u2010like particles and picornavirus\u2010like particles, other than showing that some of the parvovirus\u2010like particles were not related to feline panleukopenia virus.

Parvovirus\u2010like particles, astrovirus, picornavirus\u2010like particles and rotavirus could be excreted in high concentration in normal faeces. There was no simple relationship between age and diarrhoea in the population of cats studied.

The specificities of such responses are governed by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)\u2010restricted presentation of SARS\u2010derived peptide epitopes. Exact knowledge of how the immune system handles protein antigens would allow for the identification of such linear sequences directly from genomic/proteomic sequence information (Lauemoller et al., Rev Immunogenet 2001: 2: 477\u201391). The latter was recently established when a causative coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) was isolated and full\u2010length sequenced (Marra et al., Science 2003: 300: 1399\u2013404). Here, we have combined advanced bioinformatics and high\u2010throughput immunology to perform an HLA supertype\u2010, genome\u2010wide scan for SARS\u2010specific CTL epitopes. The scan includes all nine human HLA supertypes in total covering \u003E99% of all individuals of all major human populations (Sette \u0026 Sidney, Immunogenetics 1999: 50: 201\u201312). For each HLA supertype, we have selected the 15 top candidates for test in biochemical binding assays. At this time (approximately 6 months after the genome was established), we have tested the majority of the HLA supertypes and identified almost 100 potential vaccine candidates. These should be further validated in SARS survivors and used for vaccine formulation. We suggest that immunobioinformatics may become a fast and valuable tool in rational vaccine design.","publish_time":"2004-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sylvester\u2010Hvid, C.; Nielsen, M.; Lamberth, K.; R\u00F8der, G.; Justesen, S.; Lundegaard, C.; Worning, P.; Thomadsen, H.; Lund, O.; Brunak, S.; Buus, S.","journal":"Tissue Antigens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc42fc360f1a18e72a2db1517715b48cbe4d069d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7161580.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161580/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs2OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HLA","Sette \u0026 Sidney"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human HLA supertypes","SARS survivors","vaccine formulation","restricted presentation of SARS","potential vaccine candidates","specific CTL epitopes","rational vaccine design","responses","genome","major human populations","human leukocyte antigen","wide scan","specific cytotoxic T","derived peptide epitopes","effective Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","Lauemoller","proteomic sequence information","throughput immunology","valuable tool","immune system","Sette","Sidney","components","lymphocyte","linear sequences","total covering","identification","protein antigens","Marra","advanced bioinformatics","test","biochemical binding assays","individuals","Rev Immunogenet","Exact knowledge","Science","Immunogenetics","causative coronavirus","immunobioinformatics","months","majority","time","specificities"],"language":"en"},

The VP1 protein of BTV is the viral RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is responsible for the replication of the viral genome. Currently there is no structural information available for VP1. By manual alignment of BTV, Reovirus and other viral RdRps we have generated a model for the structure of VP1, the RdRp of BTV. The structure can be divided into three domains: an N\u2010terminal domain, a C\u2010terminal domain, and a central polymerase domain. Mutation of the putative catalytic site in the central polymerase domain by site\u2010directed mutagenesis abrogated in vitro replicase activity. Each of the domains was expressed individually and subsequently partially purified to obtain direct evidence for the location of polymerase activity and the nucleoside triphosphate binding site. The nucleoside triphosphate binding site was located by showing that CTP only bound to the full\u2010length protein or to the polymerase domain and not to either of the other two domains. None of the domains had catalytic activity when tested individually or in tandem but when all three domains were mixed together the RdRp activity was reconstituted.

There has been no test for warm temperate rain forests (WTRFs), but they offer a promising testing ground because they differ widely in the extent of disturbance. WTRF is dominated by microphylls sensu Raunkiaer and has a simpler structure and range of physiognomy than tropical or subtropical rain forests. It occurs in six parts of the world: eastern Asia, New Zealand, Chile, South Africa, SE Australia and the Azores. On the Azores it has been mostly destroyed, so we studied instead the subtropical montane rain forest (STMRF) on the Canary Islands which also represents a relict of the kind of WTRF that once stretched across southern Eurasia. We sought to find whether in these six regions the proportion of tree species needing canopy gaps for establishment reflects the frequency and/or extent of canopy disturbance by wind, landslide, volcanic eruptions (lava flow and ash fall), flood or fire. We used standard floras and ecological accounts to draw up lists of core tree species commonly reaching 5 m height. We excluded species which are very rare, very localized in distribution, or confined to special habitats, e.g. coastal forests or rocky sites. We used published accounts and our own experience to classify species into three groups: (1) needing canopy gaps for establishment; (2) needing either light shade throughout or a canopy gap relatively soon (a few months or years) after establishment; and (3) variously more shade\u2010tolerant. Group 1 species were divided according the kind of canopy opening needed: tree\u2010fall gap, landslide, lava flow, flood or fire. Only some of the significant differences in proportion of Group 1 species were consistent with differences in the extent of disturbance; even in some of those cases other factors seem likely to have had a major determining influence during evolution. We also sought to determine whether the species that are at least \u2018short\u2010term persistent\u2019 in the soil seed bank (lasting 2\u20134 years) are all species needing canopy gaps for establishment. The answer was negative; large numbers of seeds of some shade\u2010tolerants accumulate in the soil, and these species are able to benefit from soil disturbance in deep shade. We found a significant and strong positive relationship in Japan between mean seed mass and mature tree height, a weak positive relationship in New Zealand and no relationship in any of the other four regions. When comparing the seed mass values of Group 1 and Group 3 species we obtained different answers depending on whether or not we confined ourselves to taxonomically controlled contrasts. In only two of the four regions with an appreciable number of species in Group 1 is the mean seed mass of such species significantly lower than that of Group 3 species when taxonomic relatedness is ignored.","publish_time":"2013-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grubb, Peter J.; Bellingham, Peter J.; Kohyama, Takashi S.; Piper, Frida I.; Valido, Alfredo","journal":"Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a47eafce2e7e546cc5898ad7317014cce0aa017e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7161821.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161821/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs3MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WTRF","SE Australia","Group"],"locations":["Asia","New Zealand","Chile","South Africa","Azores","Canary Islands","Japan"],"keyphrases":["proportion of tree species","appreciable number of species","large\u2010scale disturbances tree species","lists of core tree species","proportion of Group","canopy gaps","extent of canopy disturbance","kind of canopy","establishment","seed mass values of Group","soil disturbance","extent of disturbance","subtropical rain forests","mean seed mass","light shade","regions","tropical lowland rain forests","mature tree height","soil seed bank","coastal forests","warm temperate rain forests","deep shade","weak positive relationship","New Zealand","landslide","strong positive relationship","lava flow","larger proportion","subtropical montane rain forest","significant differences","kind of WTRF","flood","years","Azores","ecological accounts","ash fall","published accounts","Chile","Japan","volcanic eruptions","South Africa","simpler structure","eastern Asia","STMRF","range of physiognomy","high demand","wind","SE Australia","large numbers of seeds","world","microphylls sensu Raunkiaer","frequency","special habitats","distribution","results of tests","relict","WTRFs","experience","Denslow","areas","months","major determining influence","Canary Islands","rocky sites","evolution","parts","standard floras","tolerants","groups","different answers","taxonomic relatedness","promising testing ground","cases","factors","southern Eurasia","controlled contrasts"],"language":"en"},

Our aim was to study the prevalence of adverse skin reactions to PPE among healthcare workers in Singapore during the SARS outbreak. Healthcare staff in the National Skin Centre and Tan Tock Seng Hospital were surveyed using questionnaires. Of those asked to participate, 322 (94.7%) agreed. 14.3% of the respondents were doctors, 73.0% nurses, and 12.7% other ancillary staff. Mean age of respondents was 32.4 years, with the majority being women (85.7%) and Chinese (53.7%). 109 (35.5%) of the 307 staff who used masks regularly reported acne (59.6%), facial itch (51.4%), and rash (35.8%) from N95 mask use. 64 (21.4%) of the 299 who used gloves regularly reported dry skin (73.4%), itch (56.3%), and rash (37.5%). The use of PPE is associated with high rates of adverse skin reactions.

These glycoproteins, which are called biliary glycoproteins, were highly expressed in B lymphocytes, including cells of the B\u2010la (CD5(\u002B)) lineage, and in macrophages, but were not detectable in resting T lymphocytes. Similarly, murine cell lines of B cell and macrophage origin expressed messenger RNA encoding CEA\u2010related molecules, while the corresponding mRNA was only slightly detectable in a T cell line. These CEA\u2010related cell adhesion glycoproteins were also expressed in endothelial cells. Therefore, their specific interaction with their so far unknown ligand may be of functional importance in cellular interactions in the immune response.

Rising to this challenge requires organizing ecological information derived from diverse sources and formally assimilating data with models of ecological processes. The study of infectious disease has depended on strategies for integrating patterns of observed disease incidence with mechanistic process models since John Snow first mapped cholera cases around a London water pump in 1854. Still, zoonotic and vector\u2010borne diseases increasingly affect human populations, and methods used to successfully characterize directly transmitted diseases are often insufficient. We use four case studies to demonstrate that advances in disease forecasting require better understanding of zoonotic host and vector populations, as well of the dynamics that facilitate pathogen amplification and disease spillover into humans. In each case study, this goal is complicated by limited data, spatiotemporal variability in pathogen transmission and impact, and often, insufficient biological understanding. We present a conceptual framework for data\u2013model fusion in infectious disease research that addresses these fundamental challenges using a hierarchical state\u2010space structure to (1) integrate multiple data sources and spatial scales to inform latent parameters, (2) partition uncertainty in process and observation models, and (3) explicitly build upon existing ecological and epidemiological understanding. Given the constraints inherent in the study of infectious disease and the urgent need for progress, fusion of data and expertise via this type of conceptual framework should prove an indispensable tool.","publish_time":"2011-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"LaDeau, Shannon L.; Glass, Gregory E.; Hobbs, N.

Increases in the resistance of the distal conduit of the model with increasing body mass index have been linked to peripheral airway compression by mass loading of the chest wall. Nevertheless, how the two compartments and conduits of this simple model map onto the vastly more complicated structure of an actual lung remain unclear. To investigate this issue, we developed a multiscale branching airway tree model of the respiratory system that predicts realistic input impedance spectra between 5 and 20 Hz with only four free parameters. We use this model to study how the finite elastances of the conducting airway tree and the proximal upper airways affect impedance between 5 and 20 Hz. We show that progressive constriction of the peripheral airways causes impedance to appear to arise from two compartments connected in series, with the proximal compartment being a reflection of the elastance of upper airway structures proximal to the tracheal entrance and the lower compartment reflecting the pulmonary airways and tissues. We thus conclude that while this simple inverse model allows evaluation of overall respiratory system impedance between 5 and 20 Hz in the presence of upper airway shunting, it does not allow the separate contributions of central versus peripheral pulmonary airways to be resolved.","publish_time":"2019-01-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bates, Jason H.

Routine haematoxylin and eosin (H\u0026E) staining was used to study all of the tissues from the three cases. The lung tissue specimens were studied further with Macchiavello staining, viral inclusion body staining, reticulin staining, PAS staining, immunohistochemistry, ultrathin sectioning and staining, light microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The first symptom was hyperpyrexia in all three cases, followed by progressive dyspnoea and lung field shadowing. The pulmonary lesions included bilateral extensive consolidation, localized haemorrhage and necrosis, desquamative pulmonary alveolitis and bronchitis, proliferation and desquamation of alveolar epithelial cells, exudation of protein and monocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells in alveoli, hyaline membrane formation, and viral inclusion bodies in alveolar epithelial cells. There was also massive necrosis of splenic lymphoid tissue and localized necrosis in lymph nodes. Systemic vasculitis included oedema, localized fibrinoid necrosis, and infiltration of monocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells into vessel walls in the heart, lung, liver, kidney, adrenal gland, and the stroma of striated muscles. Thrombosis was present in small veins. Systemic toxic changes included degeneration and necrosis of the parenchyma cells in the lung, liver, kidney, heart, and adrenal gland. Electron microscopy demonstrated clusters of viral particles, consistent with coronavirus, in lung tissue. SARS is a systemic disease that injures many organs. The lungs, immune organs, and systemic small vessels are the main targets of virus attack, so that extensive consolidation of the lung, diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation, respiratory distress, and decreased immune function are the main causes of death.

Nipah virus (NiV) is an emergent paramyxovirus that causes fatal encephalitis in up to 70% of infected patients, and there is increasing evidence of human\u2010to\u2010human transmission. NiV is designated a priority pathogen in the NIAID Biodefense Research Agenda, and could be a devastating agent of agrobioterrorism if used against the pig farming industry. Endothelial syncytium is a pathognomonic feature of NiV infections, and is mediated by the fusion (F) and attachment (G) envelope glycoproteins. This review summarizes what is known about the pathophysiology of NiV infections, and documents the identification of the NiV receptor. EphrinB2, the NiV and HeV receptor, is expressed on endothelial cells and neurons, consistent with the known cellular tropism for NiV. We discuss how the identification of the henipahvirus receptor sheds light on the pathobiology of NiV infection, and how it will spur the rational development of effective therapeutics. In addition, ephrinB3, a related protein, can serve as an alternative receptor, and we suggest that differential usage of ephrinB2 versus B3 may explain the variant pathogenic profiles observed between NiV and HeV. Thus, identifying the NiV receptors opens the door for a more comprehensive analysis of the envelope\u2013receptor interactions in NiV pathobiology. Finally, we also describe how galectin\u20101 (an innate immune defense lectin) can interact with specific N\u2010glycans on the Nipah envelope fusion protein, underscoring the potential role that innate immune defense mechanisms may play against emerging pathogens.","publish_time":"2007-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"LEE, BENHUR","journal":"Ann N Y Acad Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da31726ad557c2569a8d786068ba343890831ce0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168073.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168073/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs1NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hendra"],"organizations":["NIAID Biodefense Research Agenda"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NiV pathobiology","NiV receptors","pathobiology of NiV infection","pathophysiology of NiV infections","HeV receptor","pathognomonic feature of NiV infections","receptor interactions","alternative receptor","Nipah envelope fusion protein","henipahvirus receptor sheds light","envelope glycoproteins","identification","Nipah virus","innate immune defense lectin","immune defense mechanisms","related protein","endothelial cells","Endothelial syncytium","evidence of human","human transmission","known cellular tropism","differential usage of ephrinB2","potential role","members","glycans","priority pathogen","NIAID Biodefense Research Agenda","neurons","attachment","specific N","variant pathogenic profiles","Hendra","emergent paramyxovirus","defined Henipavirus genus","comprehensive analysis","viruses","door","emerging pathogens","rational development of effective therapeutics","devastating agent of agrobioterrorism","Paramyxoviridae","fatal encephalitis","addition","ephrinB3","pig farming industry","galectin","infected patients","review"],"language":"en"},

Over the past several decades, studies in numerous laboratories have demonstrated that morphogenic proteolysis plays a major and essential role during the assembly and maturation of infectious poxvirus virions. In this review we describe the history of vaccinia virus proteolysis as a prototypic viral system.

Data from published clinical studies indicate that the infectivity of influenza A virus is probably very high, so that transmission of infection may involve low doses of virus. At low doses, the relation between dose and the probability of infection is approximately linear, so that the reduction in infection risk is proportional to the reduction in exposure due to particle retention of the mask. A population transmission model was set up to explore the impact of population\u2010wide mask use, allowing estimation of the effects of mask efficacy and coverage (fraction of the population wearing masks) on the basic reproduction number and the infection attack rate. We conclude that population\u2010wide use of face masks could make an important contribution in delaying an influenza pandemic. Mask use also reduces the reproduction number, possibly even to levels sufficient for containing an influenza outbreak.","publish_time":"2010-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brienen, Nicole C.

Reduction of various contaminating bacteriae, viruses and parasites by few to several log steps and efficiency to prevent GVHD has been shown. Aim To evaluate and compare advantages and disadvantages of PRT available for practical application in platelets. Materials and Methods PRT for the treatment of platelets is currently offered by two formats: Amotosalen (INTERCEPT, Cerus, Concord, CA, USA) and vitamin B2 (Mirasol, Caridian, Denver, USA). Results from different studies and our own experiences with the two techniques are compared and discussed. Results and Discussion For both technologies, different groups of investigators have shown acceptable in\u2010vitro results with respect to functional and storage data for platelets stored for up to 5 days after production and before transfusion. Initial clinical studies showed no inferiority of the treated platelets in comparison to untreated controls in thrombocytopenic patients. However for both techniques a tendency towards lower CCI has been reported, which may be more pronounced in the platelets treated with the Intercept process. For introduction of PRT many countries require not only CE mark but licensing with the respective authorities since treatment for pathogen reduction is regarded as creating a \u2018new\u2019 blood product. With respect to a platelet loss during pathogen reduction it seems recommendable to increase the lower limit of platelet content of the product to 2.5 \u00D7 10(11). Particularly for the Intercept system, where a considerable amount of platelets is lost in the purification of the product from Amotosalen, a change in the production process to increase the platelet yield may be necessary. Data from our group show a tendency for improved functional and storage parameters for platelets treated with the Mirasol process. Compared to conventional manufacturing of platelets by apheresis or pooling of buffy coats, pathogen reduction requires additional labour, space, and quality control. Shelf life of platelets is limited in most countries because of the risk of bacterial contamination (in Germany presently to 4 days). A prolongation to 5 or more days after pathogen reduction seems feasible but remains a topic for future studies. Conclusion Results of in vitro and clinical studies of pathogen reduced platelets are promising. Larger clinical trials will help to determine whether PRT proves to be beneficial (reduction of transmission of infections, less alloimmunisation) and overall cost effective (bearing in mind that additional costs may be compensated for by omission of gamma irradiation and potential longer shelf life).","publish_time":"2010-06-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gathof, B.

The chapter describes these techniques and then illustrates with some of the results obtained. These methods should be applicable to any virus larger than 50 nm. The chapter discusses the way these techniques have generated data that cannot be obtained with classical binding or entry assays. Vaccina virus is the prototype of the poxvirus family. These are DNA viruses that replicate in the cell cytoplasm and have genomes between 150 and 300 kbp. These techniques are presented with a study of the binding and entry of VV. The methods have been particularly useful for studying VV because this virus produces two different forms of infectious virion that are antigenically and biologically distinct and are produced in widely differing amounts. Moreover, the extracellular enveloped virus (EEV) form of VV cannot be purified from contaminating IMV without disrupting the integrity of the outer envelope.","publish_time":"2004-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vanderplasschen, Alain; Smith, Geoffrey L.","journal":"Methods Enzymol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172951/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs4NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["study of virus binding","virus larger","virus purification","Vaccina virus","study vaccinia virus","entry of","techniques","extracellular enveloped virus","chapter","absolute numbers of virus particles","classical binding","entry assays","study new approaches","form of VV","data","confocal microscopy","methods","individual cells","EEV","different forms of infectious virion","integrity","prototype","discussion","cell cytoplasm","genomes","contaminating IMV","way","DNA viruses","poxvirus family","outer envelope","nm","differing amounts","kbp","results"],"language":"en"},

This membrane traffic recycles components from the cell surface to the interior of the cell and back to the cell surface again. The membrane traffic between the ER and the cell surface involves a major sorting problem. Little is known of how the animal cell has solved this problem in molecular terms. One experimental tool in this direction is provided by some enveloped animal viruses, which mature at the cell surface of infected cells. Such viruses include influenza virus, Semliki Forest virus (SFV), Sindbis virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). They are extremely simple in makeup and hence are very well characterized. The purpose of this article is to illustrate the use of the enveloped viruses as tools in the study of membrane traffic in the animal cell. This is done in the context of the life cycle of the virus in the host cell. The article will be concerned mainly with Semliki Forest virus (SFV), which is the virus that has been worked upon in the chapter.

In many cases, the characteristic timescale of environmental changes as well as their correlations play a fundamental role in the way living systems adapt and respond to it. A proper mathematical approach to understand population dynamics, thus, requires approaches more refined than, e.g., simple white-noise approximations. To shed further light onto this problem, in this paper we propose a unifying framework based on different analytical and numerical tools available to deal with \u201Ccolored\u201D environmental noise. In particular, we employ a \u201Cunified colored noise approximation\u201D to map the original problem into an effective one with white noise, and then we apply a standard path integral approach to gain analytical understanding. For the sake of specificity, we present our approach using as a guideline a variation of the contact process\u2014which can also be seen as a birth-death process of the Malthus-Verhulst class\u2014where the propagation or birth rate varies stochastically in time. Our approach allows us to tackle in a systematic manner some of the relevant questions concerning population dynamics under environmental variability, such as determining the stationary population density, establishing the conditions under which a population may become extinct, and estimating extinction times. We focus on the emerging phase diagram and its possible phase transitions, underlying how these are affected by the presence of environmental noise time-correlations.","publish_time":"2017-10-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Spanio, Tommaso; Hidalgo, Jorge; Mu\u00F1oz, Miguel A.","journal":"Phys Rev E","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8758b0e7492fdfd29fe3b4069fd42a29216abab4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217512.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217512/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs1MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["population dynamics","white noise","environmental variability","presence of environmental noise time-correlations","unified colored noise approximation","simple white-noise approximations","stationary population density","proper mathematical approach","characteristic timescale of environmental changes","standard path integral approach","birth-death process","analytical understanding","external conditions","contact process","birth rate","original problem","emerging phase diagram","possible phase transitions","organization of biological systems","relevant questions","important consequences","Malthus-Verhulst class","numerical tools available","unifying framework","propagation","fundamental role","guideline","variation","systematic manner","way","paper","cases","approaches","extinction times","sake of specificity","light"],"language":"en"},

Unnecessary antibiotic use increases the risk of antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, prolonged antibiotic use increases the risk of mortality and morbidity in neonates. Proactive measures including empiric antibiotic de-escalation are crucial to overcome these problems. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study conducted in the neonatal intensive care units of two public hospitals in Malaysia. Neonates with a gestational age greater than 34 weeks who were started on empiric antibiotics within 72 h of life were screened. The data were then stratified according to de-escalation and non-de-escalation practices, where de-escalation practice was defined as narrowing down or discontinuation of empiric antibiotic within 72 h of treatment. RESULTS: A total of 1045 neonates were screened, and 429 were included. The neonates were then divided based on de-escalation (n = 207) and non-de-escalation (n = 222) practices. Neonates under non-de-escalation practices showed significantly longer durations of antibiotic use compared to those under de-escalation practices (p \u003C 0.05), with no difference in treatment outcomes. Five factors were found to be associated with de-escalation of antibiotics. They are cesarean section delivery, exposure to antenatal steroids, nil history of maternal pyrexia, absence of meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and normal C-reactive protein \u2264 0.5 mg/dL (p \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Empiric antibiotic de-escalation appears feasible as a routine form of treatment for EOS in late preterm and term neonates.","publish_time":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ain Ibrahim, Nazedah; Makmor Bakry, Mohd; Mohd Tahir, Nurul Ain; Mohd Zaini, Nur Rashidah; Mohamed Shah, Noraida","journal":"Paediatr Drugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4658cfca9c88c99e3184308c241854ffa479ca0e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7222079.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222079/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs1NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EOS"],"locations":["Malaysia"],"keyphrases":["empiric antibiotic de-escalation","Prolonged empiric antibiotic use","prolonged antibiotic use","discontinuation of empiric antibiotic","de-escalation of antibiotics","Unnecessary antibiotic use","risk of antibiotic resistance","longer durations of antibiotic use","empiric antibiotics","term neonates","non-de-escalation practices","h of treatment","EOS","treatment outcomes","routine form of treatment","risk of mortality","h of life","antenatal steroids","exposure","absence of meconium","nil history of maternal pyrexia","diagnostic uncertainties","stained amniotic fluid","neonatal intensive care units","suspected early onset sepsis","cases","public hospitals","weeks","normal C-reactive protein","prospective cohort study","cesarean section delivery","Proactive measures","gestational age greater","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","Malaysia","significant problem","morbidity","METHODS","difference","RESULTS","total","problems","data","factors"],"language":"en"},

In the wake of Hurricane Maria in September 2017, hospitals across the USA had to quickly and creatively adjust medication preparation and administration techniques in light of decreased availability of intravenous (IV) bags used for compounding a vast amount of medications. Amino acid preparations, essential for compounding parenteral nutrition, were also directly impacted by the hurricane. Upon realization of the impending drug shortages, hospitals resorted to alternative methods of drug administration, such as IV push routes, formulary substitutions, or alternative drug therapies in hopes of preserving the small supply of IV bags available and prioritizing them for them most critical needs. In some cases, alternative drug therapies were required, which increased the risk of medication errors due to the use of less-familiar treatment options. Clinical pharmacists rounding with medical teams provided essential, patient-specific drug regimen alternatives to help preserve a dwindling supply while ensuring use in the most critical cases. Drug shortages also frequently occur in the setting of manufacturing delays or discontinuation and drug recalls, with potential to negatively impact patient care. The seriousness of the drug shortage crisis reached public attention by December 2017, when political and pharmacy organizations called for response to the national drug shortage crisis.

In trauma, alcohol has been associated with poor clot formation; however, its effect on fibrinolysis has not been fully investigated. We assessed the association of blood alcohol levels and fibrinolysis in trauma activation patients. METHODS: We queried our prospective registry of trauma activations from 2014 to 2016. Associations between viscoelastic measurements [rapid thrombelastography (rTEG)] and blood alcohol level (BAL) were determined and adjusted for confounders by a multinomial logistic regression. Lysis phenotypes were defined by the % lysis in 30 min (LY30) as follows: hyperfibrinolysis \u2265 3%, physiologic 0.9\u20132.9%, and fibrinolysis shutdown \u003C 0.9%. RESULTS: Overall, 191 (43.8%) had BAL measured. There were 65 (34%) patients that had no detectable BAL, 32 (16.8%) had BAL of 10\u2013150 mg/dL, and 94 (49.2%) patients had BAL \u003E 150 mg/dL. BAL had a moderate, but significant inverse correlation with LY30 (Rho = \u2212 0.315, p \u003C 0.001), while there were no significant correlations between BAL and other TEG values. The distribution of fibrinolysis phenotypes varied significantly by BAL levels (p \u003C 0.009, with high BAL having more shutdown and less hyperfibrinolysis than the other two BAL level groups. Multinomial logistic regression showed that after adjustment for confounders, BAL levels \u003E 150 mg/dL were independently associated with a threefold increase in the odds of shutdown compared to undetectable BAL (OR 3.37, 95% CI 1.04\u20138.05, p = 0.006). High BAL was also significantly associated with higher odds of shutdown compared to low BAL (OR 2.63, 95% CI 1.15\u20136.06). Compared to physiologic fibrinolysis, fibrinolysis shutdown was associated with increased mortality (OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.41\u20135.83) and VFD \u003C 28 (OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.47\u20134.39). CONCLUSION: In the injured patient, high blood alcohol levels are associated with increased incidence of fibrinolysis shutdown. This finding has implications for postinjury hemostatic resuscitation as these patients may be harmed by anti-fibrinolytics. Further research is needed to assess whether the association with fibrinolysis is modified by the chronicity and type of alcohol consumed and whether anti-fibrinolytic therapy in intoxicated patients produces adverse effects.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stettler, Gregory R.; Moore, Ernest E.; Nunns, Geoffrey R.; Moore, Hunter B.; Huebner, Benjamin R.; Silliman, Christopher C.; Banerjee, Anirban; Sauaia, Angela","journal":"Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/23fdf1a7d80f48aa82e9ab5e8a0554c6603c4f36.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7222146.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222146/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs1OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BAL","VFD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BAL levels","high BAL","low BAL","undetectable BAL","BAL level groups","physiologic fibrinolysis","decreased fibrinolysis","increased incidence of fibrinolysis shutdown","high blood alcohol levels","distribution of fibrinolysis phenotypes","association of blood alcohol levels","High alcohol consumption","type of alcohol","intoxicated patients","higher odds of shutdown","trauma activation patients","confounders","multinomial logistic regression","LY30","hyperfibrinolysis","increased mortality","significant correlations","prospective registry of trauma activations","anti-fibrinolytics","anti-fibrinolytic therapy","significant inverse correlation","rTEG","enhanced thrombosis risk","injured patient","adjustment","rapid thrombelastography","viscoelastic measurements","Rho","cardiovascular disease","adverse effects","Associations","postinjury hemostatic resuscitation","TEG values","poor clot formation","implications","threefold increase","INTRODUCTION","chronicity","METHODS","CONCLUSION","VFD","RESULTS","research"],"language":"en"},

These methods possess high specificity but some genes may be missed, either those unique to a particular genome or those highly divergent from known homologs. To identify potentially missing viral genes we have analyzed all complete viral genomes currently available in GenBank with a specialized and augmented version of the gene finding program GeneMarkS. In particular, by implementing genome-specific self-training protocols we have better adjusted the GeneMarkS statistical models to sequences of viral genomes. Hundreds of new genes were identified, some in well studied viral genomes. For example, a new gene predicted in the genome of the Epstein\u2013Barr virus was shown to encode a protein similar to \u03B1-herpesvirus minor tegument protein UL14 with heat shock functions. Convincing evidence of this similarity was obtained after only 12 PSI-BLAST iterations. In another example, several iterations of PSI-BLAST were required to demonstrate that a gene predicted in the genome of Alcelaphine herpesvirus 1 encodes a BALF1-like protein which is thought to be involved in apoptosis regulation and, potentially, carcinogenesis. New predictions were used to refine annotations of viral genomes in the RefSeq collection curated by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Importantly, even in those cases where no sequence similarities were detected, GeneMarkS significantly reduced the number of primary targets for experimental characterization by identifying the most probable candidate genes. The new genome annotations were stored in VIOLIN, an interactive database which provides access to similarity search tools for up-to-date analysis of predicted viral proteins.","publish_time":"2003-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mills, Ryan; Rozanov, Michael; Lomsadze, Alexandre; Tatusova, Tatiana; Borodovsky, Mark","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-pdf/31/23/7041/9488296/gkg878.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs2MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Center for Biotechnology Information"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["annotations of viral genomes","complete viral genomes","sequences of viral genomes","new genome annotations","missing viral genes","particular genome","Hundreds of new genes","genome of Alcelaphine herpesvirus","Gene annotation","New predictions","up-to-date analysis of predicted viral proteins","similarity search methods","similarity search tools","protein similar","program GeneMarkS","probable candidate genes","iterations of PSI","PSI-BLAST iterations","example","genome-specific self-training protocols","GeneMarkS statistical models","\u03B1-herpesvirus minor tegument protein UL14","GenBank","heat shock functions","access","experimental characterization","augmented version","RefSeq collection","National Center","VIOLIN","viruses","number of primary targets","interactive database","Barr virus","Biotechnology Information","sequence similarities","Epstein","BALF1","high specificity","known homologs","apoptosis regulation","carcinogenesis","cases","Convincing evidence"],"language":"en"},

GS-5734 is a novel nucleotide analog prodrug in the development for treatment of EBOV. METHOD: Antiviral activity of GS-5734 has been established in vitro against a wide range of pathogenic RNA virus families, including filoviruses, coronaviruses, and paramyxoviruses (EC(50) = 37 to 200 nM) (Warren et al., Nature 2016; Sheahan et al., Sci Transl Med 2017; Lo et al., Sci Rep 2017). Herein, we describe the in vivo translation of the broad-spectrum activity of GS-5734 in relevant animal disease models for Ebola, Marburg, MERS-CoV, and Nipah. RESULT: Therapeutic efficacy against multiple filoviruses with 80\u2013100% survival was observed in rhesus monkeys infected with lethal doses of EBOV (Kikwit/1995 or Makona/2014) or Marburg virus and treated with once daily intravenous (IV) administration of 5 to 10 mg/kg GS-5734 beginning 3 to 5 days post-infection (p.i.). In all rhesus monkey filovirus infection models, GS-5734 significantly reduced systemic viremia and ameliorated severe clinical disease signs and anatomic pathology. In mice infected with MERS-CoV, twice daily subcutaneous administration of 25 mg/kg GS-5734 beginning 1 day p.i. significantly reduced lung viral load and improved respiratory function. In rhesus monkeys, once-daily IV administration of 5 mg/kg GS-5734 initiated 1 day prior to MERS-CoV infection reduced lung viral load, improved clinical disease signs, and ameliorated severe lung pathology. Finally, in African green monkeys infected with a lethal dose of Nipah virus therapeutic once-daily IV administration of 10 mg/kg GS-5734, starting 1 day p.i. resulted in 100% survival to at least day 35 without any major respiratory or CNS symptoms. CONCLUSION: GS-5734 is currently being tested in a phase 2 study in male Ebola survivors with persistent viral RNA in semen. Lyophilized drug formulation has been developed that can be administered to humans via a 30-minutes IV infusion and does not require cold chain storage. Together, these results support further development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum antiviral to treat viral infections with high mortality and significant outbreak potential. DISCLOSURES: R.

The chapter presents a list of the known members of the arenaviridae, their origins, and the vertebrate hosts from which isolates have been reported. It discusses the structural components, the infection cycle, and genetic attributes of arenaviruses. In order to determine how arenaviruses code for gene products, the S RNA species of Pichinde virus and that of a viscerotropic strain of LCM virus (LCM-WE) have been cloned into DNA and sequenced. The arenavirus S RNA is described as having an ambisense strategy, to denote the fact that both viral and viral-complementary sequences are used to make gene products.

It was discovered approximately 20 years ago by yeast genetic screens identifying it as a factor responsible for processing the yeast mating a-factor pheromone. In animals, Ste24 processes prelamin A, a component of the nuclear lamina; mutations in the human ortholog of Ste24 diminish its activity, giving rise to genetic diseases of accelerated aging (progerias). Additionally, lipodystrophy, acquired from the standard highly active antiretroviral therapy used to treat AIDS patients, likely results from off-target interactions of HIV (aspartyl) protease inhibitor drugs with Ste24. Ste24 possesses a novel \u201C\u03B1-barrel\u201D structure, consisting of a ring of seven transmembrane \u03B1-helices enclosing a large (\u003E 12,000 \u00C5(3)) interior volume that contains the active-site and substrate-binding region; this \u201Cmembrane-interior reaction chamber\u201D is unprecedented in integral membrane protein structures. Additionally, the surface of the membrane-interior reaction chamber possesses a strikingly large negative electrostatic surface potential, adding additional \u201Cfunctional mystery.\u201D Recent publications implicate Ste24 as a key factor in several endoplasmic reticulum processes, including the unfolded protein response, a cellular stress response of the endoplasmic reticulum, and removal of misfolded proteins from the translocon. Ste24, with its provocative structure, enigmatic mechanism, and recently emergent new biological roles including \u201Ctranslocon unclogger\u201D and (non-enyzmatic) broad-spectrum viral restriction factor, presents far differently than before 2016, when it was viewed as a \u201CCAAX protease\u201D responsible for cleavage of prenylated (farnesylated or geranylgeranylated) substrates.

During peak season, picornaviruses cause 82% of all episodes of acute nasopharyngitis (the common cold), the most frequent manifestation of acute respiratory infection, and produce more restriction of activity and physician consultations annually than any other viral or bacterial source of respiratory illness. Objective: This article reviews the clinical impact and outcomes of picornavirus-induced respiratory infections in specific populations at risk for complications. It also discusses the potential economic impact of the morbidity associated with picornavirus-induced respiratory infection. Methods: Relevant literature was identified through searches of MEDLINE, OVID, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and Lexis-Nexis. The search terms used were picornavirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, viral respiratory infection, upper respiratory infection, disease burden, economic, cost, complications, asthma, COPD, immunocompromised, elderly, otitis media, and sinusitis. Additional publications were identified from the reference lists of the retrieved articles. Conclusions: Based on the clinical literature, picornavirus infections are associated with severe morbidity as well as considerable economic and societal costs. Future research should focus on identifying patterns of illness and the costs associated with management of these infections. New treatments should be assessed not only in terms of their ability to produce the desired clinical outcome, but also in terms of their ability to reduce the burden of disease, decrease health care costs, and improve productivity.","publish_time":"2002-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Monto, Arnold S.; Fendrick, A.Mark; Sarnes, Matthew W.","journal":"Clin Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f119912a3e569e5d5137ab93121c32f308c68731.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172950/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs4NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["International Pharmaceutical Abstracts"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Respiratory infections","viral respiratory infection","respiratory tract","upper respiratory infection","picornavirus infections","frequent manifestation of acute respiratory infection","bacterial source of respiratory illness","outcomes of picornavirus","clinical literature","clinical impact","leading cause of acute morbidity","disease burden","burden of disease","severe morbidity","complications","potential economic impact","societal costs","ability","search terms","episodes of acute nasopharyngitis","health care costs","desired clinical outcome","Relevant literature","patterns of illness","rhinovirus","elderly","COPD","asthma","enterovirus","searches of MEDLINE","International Pharmaceutical Abstracts","specific populations","OVID","individuals","risk","invasion","reference lists","otitis media","physician consultations","restriction of activity","picornaviruses","retrieved articles","sinusitis","Lexis-Nexis","productivity","ages","management","Background","Additional publications","peak season","Future research","Methods","Objective","Conclusions","New treatments"],"language":"en"},

Synthetic peptide mutants of NS4A were found to inhibit NS3 function. The bridging from peptide inhibitors to heterocyclic peptidomimetics of NS4A has not been considered in the literature and, therefore, we decided to explore this strategy for developing a new class of NS3 inhibitors. In this report, a structure-based design approach was used to convert the bound form of NS4A into 1H-imidazole-2,5-dicarboxamide derivatives as first generation peptidomimetics. This scaffold mimics the buried amino acid sequence Ile-25\u0060 to Arg-28\u0060 at the core of NS4A(21\u0060\u201333\u0060) needed to activate the NS3 protease. Some of the synthesized compounds (Coded MOC) were able to compete with and displace NS4A(21\u0060\u201333\u0060) for binding to NS3. For instance, N(5)-(4-guanidinobutyl)-N(2)-(n-hexyl)-1H-imidazole-2,5-dicarboxamide (MOC-24) inhibited the binding of NS4A(21\u0060\u201333\u0060) with a competition half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 1.9 \u00B1 0.12 \u00B5M in a fluorescence anisotropy assay and stabilized the denaturation of NS3 by increasing the aggregation temperature (40% compared to NS4A(21\u0060\u201333\u0060)). MOC-24 also inhibited NS3 protease activity in a fluorometric assay. Molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to rationalize the differences in structure\u2013activity relationship (SAR) between the active MOC-24 and the inactive MOC-26. Our data show that MOC compounds are possibly the first examples of NS4A peptidomimetics that have demonstrated promising activities against NS3 proteins.","publish_time":"2020-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Omar, Abdelsattar M.; Elfaky, Mahmoud A.; Arold, Stefan T.; Soror, Sameh H.; Khayat, Maan T.; Asfour, Hani Z.; Bamane, Faida H.; El-Araby, Moustafa E.","journal":"Biomolecules","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee80518fae300e6cd68a542c6b48dac760b00dc0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7175367.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7175367/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs5NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MOC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["binding of NS4A","core of NS4A","denaturation of NS3","protein NS3","NS3 proteins","NS3 function","NS3 protease activity","heterocyclic peptidomimetics of NS4A","examples of NS4A peptidomimetics","MOC compounds","bound form of NS4A","Coded MOC","inactive MOC","Synthetic peptide mutants of NS4A","new class of NS3 inhibitors","H-imidazole","peptide inhibitors","generation peptidomimetics","n-hexyl","activity relationship","fluorometric assay","synthesized compounds","fluorescence anisotropy assay","structure-based design approach","hepatitis C virus","HCV","maturation","critical factor","buried amino acid sequence Ile","competition half maximal inhibitory concentration","SAR","promising activities","dicarboxamide derivatives","scaffold","differences","bridging","Arg","report","\u00B5M","activation","aggregation temperature","Molecular dynamics simulations","strategy","data","instance","guanidinobutyl","literature"],"language":"en"},

Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) provides an efficient rewarming method with complete cardiopulmonary support. The use of VA-ECMO for this indication has greatly improved the vital and functional prognosis of patients. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 46-year-old patient who was treated for severe hypothermia with a temperature of 22.4 \u00B0C along with initial cardiac arrest, whose progression was favorable after the implementation of VA-ECMO support. Two months after initial cardiac arrest, the patient was reassessed and showed signs of complete recovery with regard to his mental and physical capacities. CONCLUSIONS: The recent international publications and groups of experts recommend the use of VA ECMO as the gold standard therapy to treat severe hypothermia. Therefore, it seems suitable to update the current knowledge on the topic by analysing the latest international publications. The performance of this technique calls into question ethical and economic factors. Two distinct medical teams tried to identify and regroup prognosis factors in predictive survival scores. They raise the question of the utility of these scores in clinical practice. Indeed, according to which survival rate should we proceed to prolonged resuscitation and implement VA-ECMO? Additional studies will be needed for external approval of these survival scores, and additional reflection by experts will be required.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ledoux, Aur\u00E9lien; Saint Leger, Piehr","journal":"Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/25c1785f7aa54f85cb2ae72df2981e81ffe6be3f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7175497.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7175497/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs5NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VA ECMO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VA-ECMO","use of VA ECMO","ECMO support","implementation of VA","severe hypothermia","Severe accidental hypothermia","predictive survival scores","initial cardiac arrest","prognosis factors","survival rate","complete cardiopulmonary support","recent international publications","latest international publications","groups of experts","question ethical","economic factors","year-old patient","additional reflection","Additional studies","CASE PRESENTATION","signs of complete recovery","functional prognosis of patients","efficient rewarming method","gold standard therapy","regard","Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","topic","progression","high morbidity","external approval","prolonged resuscitation","technique","utility","current knowledge","physical capacities","clinical practice","CONCLUSIONS","months","temperature","BACKGROUND","indication","distinct medical teams","mortality","performance"],"language":"en"},

Since clinical trials were first proposed almost 10 years ago, the degree of risk for infection transmitted from the xenograft donor to the recipient has been extensively investigated. A number of potential viral pathogens have been identified including porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV), and porcine lymphotropic herpesvirus (PLHV).

Human\u2010tropic PERV are exogenous recombinants between PERV\u2010A and PERV\u2010C sequences and are present in only a subset of swine. Porcine cytomegalovirus can be excluded from herds of source animals by early weaning of piglets. In contrast, the risks associated with PLHV remain undefined. Microbiologic studies and assays for potential xenogeneic pathogens have furthered understanding of risks associated with xenotransplantation. Thus far, clinical xenotransplantation of pig tissues has not resulted in transmission of viral infection to humans; significant risks for disease transmission from swine to humans have not been confirmed.

The statistical characteristics of the estimator are presented. General reliability conditions on the length of the required signal observation window, i.e., sensing time, for a chosen sampling rate or vice versa are provided amid a sought system performance.

We previously developed a fusion protein composed with truncated peptides of the EV71 capsid protein, which assembled into spherical particles. This study aimed to assess the immunoprotective effects of this fusion protein as a vaccine candidate in a mouse model of EV71 infection. METHODS: To evaluate the protective effect of fusion protein vaccine candidate, neonatal mice born by immunized female mice, as well as normal neonatal mice immunized twice were infected with EV71 virus. Whereafter, the survival rates, clinical scores and viral loads were measured. RESULTS: The high dosage and booster immunization helped induce specific serum antibodies with high neutralization titers, which were transferred to neonatal mice, thereby facilitating effective resistance towards EV71 infection. An active immune response was also observed in neonatal mice which generated following immunization. CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that this fusion protein is a suitable vaccine candidate in treating EV71 infections.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Jiangning; Zhao, Binbin; Xue, Ling; Wu, Jing; Xu, Yanfeng; Liu, Yongdong; Qin, Chuan","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a7750539981af35bced41e47799c28d648bf8fa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7178760.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7178760/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs5OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EV71 infections","EV71 virus","EV71 capsid protein","normal neonatal mice","mouse model of EV71 infection","protective effect of fusion protein vaccine candidate","immunized female mice","suitable vaccine candidate","inactivated virus","booster immunization","effective resistance","high dosage","Prophylactic vaccines","development of vaccines","following immunization","present results","spherical particles","effective preventive strategy","high neutralization titers","specific serum antibodies","hand","truncated peptides","repeated antigens","clinical scores","HFMD","foot","safety","survival rates","viral loads","mouth disease","VLPs","years","immunoprotective effects","human enterovirus","productivity advantages","BACKGROUND","active immune response","study","METHODS","addition","CONCLUSIONS","Children"],"language":"en"},

Carcinoembryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecule 1 (Ceacam1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein found on epithelium, T cells, and many tumors. It regulates a variety of physiologic and pathological processes such as tumor biology, leukocyte activation, and energy homeostasis. Previous studies suggest that Ceacam1 negatively regulates inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease models. METHODS: We studied Ceacam1 as a regulator of GVHD and GVT after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) in mouse models. In vivo, Ceacam1(\u2212/\u2212) T cells caused increased GVHD mortality and GVHD of the colon, and greater numbers of donor T cells were positive for activation markers (CD25(hi), CD62L(lo)). Additionally, Ceacam1(\u2212/\u2212) CD8 T cells had greater expression of the gut-trafficking integrin \u03B1(4)\u03B2(7), though both CD4 and CD8 T cells were found increased numbers in the gut post-transplant. Ceacam1(\u2212/\u2212) recipients also experienced increased GVHD mortality and GVHD of the colon, and alloreactive T cells displayed increased activation. Additionally, Ceacam1(\u2212/\u2212) mice had increased mortality and decreased numbers of regenerating small intestinal crypts upon radiation exposure. Conversely, Ceacam1-overexpressing T cells caused attenuated target-organ and systemic GVHD, which correlated with decreased donor T cell numbers in target tissues, and mortality. Finally, graft-versus-tumor survival in a Ceacam1(\u002B) lymphoma model was improved in animals receiving Ceacam1(\u2212/\u2212) vs. control T cells. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that Ceacam1 regulates T cell activation, GVHD target organ damage, and numbers of donor T cells in lymphoid organs and GVHD target tissues. In recipients of allo-BMT, Ceacam1 may also regulate tissue radiosensitivity. Because of its expression on both the donor graft and host tissues, this suggests that targeting Ceacam1 may represent a potent strategy for the regulation of GVHD and GVT after allogeneic transplantation.","publish_time":"2011-07-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Sydney X.; Kappel, Lucy W.; Charbonneau-Allard, Anne-Marie; Atallah, Ren\u00E9e; Holland, Amanda M.; Turbide, Claire; Hubbard, Vanessa M.; Rotolo, Jimmy A.; Smith, Marsinay; Suh, David; King, Christopher; Rao, Uttam K.; Yim, Nury; Bautista, Johanne L.; Jenq, Robert R.; Penack, Olaf; Na, Il-Kang; Liu, Chen; Murphy, George; Alpdogan, Onder; Blumberg, Richard S.; Macian, Fernando; Holmes, Kathryn V.; Beauchemin, Nicole; van den Brink, Marcel R.

The mechanisms of neural development underlying suppression and de-suppression of differentiation- related genes for cell fate specifications are not well understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By using an in vitro system in which NTera-2 cells were induced to differentiate into an astrocyte-like lineage, we revealed a novel role for Sin3A in maintaining the suppression of GFAP in NTera-2 cells. Sin3A coupled with MeCP2 bound to the GFAP promoter and their occupancies were correlated with repression of GFAP transcription. The repression by Sin3A and MeCP2 may be an essential mechanism underlying the inhibition of cell differentiation. Upon commitment toward an astrocyte-like lineage, Sin3A- MeCP2 departed from the promoter and activated STAT3 simultaneously bound to the promoter and exon 1 of GFAP; meanwhile, olig2 was exported from nuclei to the cytoplasm. This suggested that a three-dimensional or higher-order structure was provoked by STAT3 binding between the promoter and proximal coding regions. STAT3 then recruited CBP/p300 to exon 1 and targeted the promoter for histone H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation. The CBP/p300-mediated histone modification further facilitates chromatin remodeling, thereby enhancing H3K4 trimethylation and recruitment of RNA polymerase II to activate GFAP gene transcription.

OBJECTIVES: The objective was to describe the demographic data, etiology, and pulmonary histopathological findings of different diseases in the autopsies of patients with acute respiratory failure. METHOD: Autopsies of 4,710 patients with acute respiratory failure from 1990 to 2008 were reviewed, and the following data were obtained: age, sex, and major associated diseases. The pulmonary histopathology was categorized as diffuse alveolar damage, pulmonary edema, alveolar hemorrhage, and lymphoplasmacytic interstitial pneumonia. The odds ratio of the concordance between the major associated diseases and specific autopsy findings was calculated using logistic regression. RESULTS: Bacterial bronchopneumonia was present in 33.9% of the cases and cancer in 28.1%. The pulmonary histopathology showed diffuse alveolar damage in 40.7% (1,917) of the cases. A multivariate analysis showed a significant and powerful association between diffuse alveolar damage and bronchopneumonia, HIV/AIDS, sepsis, and septic shock, between liver cirrhosis and pulmonary embolism, between pulmonary edema and acute myocardial infarction, between dilated cardiomyopathy and cancer, between alveolar hemorrhage and bronchopneumonia and pulmonary embolism, and between lymphoplasmacytic interstitial pneumonia and HIV/AIDS and liver cirrhosis. CONCLUSIONS: Bronchopneumonia was the most common diagnosis in these cases. The most prevalent pulmonary histopathological pattern was diffuse alveolar damage, which was associated with different inflammatory conditions.

Preventive behavior such as handwashing and wearing face masks has been recommended. However, little is known about what psychosocial factors might influence people\u0027s decision to adopt such preventive behavior. This study aims to explore risk perception and other factors associated with handwashing and wearing face masks to prevent AI. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An interviewer-administered survey was conducted among 352 traditional market workers and shoppers in Taiwan between December 2009 and January 2010. Factors associated with the recommended AI preventive behavior (i.e., when in a traditional market, wearing a face mask and also washing hands after any contact with poultry) included: having correct knowledge about the fatality rate of AI (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 4.18), knowing of severe cases of AI (AOR = 2.13), being informed of local AI outbreaks (AOR = 2.24), living in northeastern Taiwan (AOR = 6.01), having a senior high-school education (AOR = 3.33), and having a university or higher education (AOR = 6.86). Gender interactive effect was also found among participants with a senior high-school education, with males being less likely to engage in the recommended AI preventive behavior than their female counterparts (AOR = 0.34). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Specific information concerning AI risk perception was associated with the recommended AI preventive behavior. In particular, having correct knowledge about the fatality rate of AI and being informed of severe cases and local outbreaks of AI were linked to increased AI preventive behavior. These findings underscore the importance of transparency in dealing with epidemic information. These results also have practical implications for prevention and policy-making to more effectively promote the recommended AI preventive behavior in the public.","publish_time":"2011-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuo, Pei-Chun; Huang, Jiun-Hau; Liu, Ming-Der","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24d7fe6bbb9945f1536fef5b281d074fe69cfc6a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3166308.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3166308/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzY40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["recommended AI preventive behavior","increased AI preventive behavior","AOR","fatality rate of AI","AI risk perception","severe cases of AI","local AI outbreaks","local outbreaks of AI","face masks","senior high-school education","correct knowledge","handwashing","higher education","psychosocial factors","traditional market workers","Specific information","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","epidemic information","northeastern Taiwan","adjusted odds ratio","female counterparts","interviewer-administered survey","participants","SIGNIFICANCE","people\u0027s decision","practical implications","prevention","hands","poultry","shoppers","males","public","importance of transparency","results","policy","METHODOLOGY","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","Avian influenza","university","Gender interactive effect","contact","study"],"language":"en"},

Recombinant IFNs are used for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection, multiple sclerosis, and certain malignancies. The capability of type I IFN to suppress virus replication and resultant cytopathic effects is frequently used to measure their bioactivity. However, these assays are time-consuming and require appropriate biosafety containment. In this study, an improved IFN assay is presented which is based on a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replicon encoding two reporter proteins, firefly luciferase and green fluorescent protein. The vector lacks the essential envelope glycoprotein (G) gene of VSV and is propagated on a G protein-expressing transgenic cell line. Several mammalian and avian cells turned out to be susceptible to infection with the complemented replicon particles. Infected cells readily expressed the reporter proteins at high levels five hours post infection. When human fibroblasts were treated with serial dilutions of human IFN-\u03B2 prior to infection, reporter expression was accordingly suppressed. This method was more sensitive and faster than a classical IFN bioassay based on VSV cytopathic effects. In addition, the antiviral activity of human IFN-\u03BB (interleukin-29), a type III IFN, was determined on Calu-3 cells. Both IFN-\u03B2 and IFN-\u03BB were acid-stable, but only IFN-\u03B2 was resistant to alkaline treatment. The antiviral activities of canine, porcine, and avian type I IFN were analysed with cell lines derived from the corresponding species. This safe bioassay will be useful for the rapid and sensitive quantification of multi-species type I IFN and potentially other antiviral cytokines.","publish_time":"2011-10-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berger Rentsch, Marianne; Zimmer, Gert","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/32b29df5230354c35d8734b996e5e45501a5111b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3187809.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3187809/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozkw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["classical IFN bioassay","improved IFN assay","antiviral activity of human IFN-\u03BB","serial dilutions of human IFN-\u03B2","avian type","antiviral cytokines","capability of type","reporter proteins","avian cells","VSV cytopathic effects","antiviral activities of canine","treatment of hepatitis C virus infection","virus replication","gene of VSV","reporter expression","G protein","human fibroblasts","Infected cells","recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus","resultant cytopathic effects","sensitive quantification of multi-species","alkaline treatment","cell lines","corresponding species","safe bioassay","family of cytokines","Recombinant IFNs","green fluorescent protein","complemented replicon particles","transgenic cell line","multiple sclerosis","firefly luciferase","essential envelope glycoprotein","high levels","hours","acid-stable","plethora of genes","common cellular receptor","appropriate biosafety containment","interleukin","certain malignancies","assays","vector","study","addition","method","mammalian","interferons","Calu","bioactivity"],"language":"en"},

The distribution and characteristics of the confirmed cases in the initial phase of this pandemic in this country are largely unknown. The present study aimed to characterize the geographic distribution and patient characteristics of H1N1 infection in the 2009 pandemic as well as to identify potential risk factors associated with adverse patient outcome in China, through retrospective analyses of 885 hospitalized cases with confirmed H1N1 infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The proportional hazards model was employed to detect risk factors for adverse outcome; the geo-statistical maps were used to characterize the distribution of all 2668 confirmed H1N1 patients throughout mainland China. The number of new cases increased slowly in May, 2009, but rapidly between June and August of the year. Confirmed cases were reported in 26 provinces; Beijing, Guangdong, Shanghai, Zhejiang and Fujian were the top five regions of the incidence of the virus infection. After being adjusted for gender, age, chronic pulmonary disease and other general symptoms, delay for more than two days before hospital admission (HR: 0.6; 95%CI: 0.5\u20130.7) and delayed onset of the H1N1-specific respiratory symptoms (HR: 0.3; 95%CI: 0.2\u20130.4) were associated with adverse patient outcome. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The 2009 pandemic influenza A affected east and southeast coastal provinces and most populous cities more severely than other regions in mainland China due to higher risk of high level traffic-, high population density-, and high population mobility-associated H1N1 transmission.The clinical symptoms were mild in the initial phase of infection. Delayed hospital admission and delayed appearance of respiratory symptoms were among the major risk factors for poor patient outcome. These findings may have significant implications in the future pandemic preparedness and response.","publish_time":"2011-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Yunning; Wang, Wei; Li, Xia; Wang, Hong; Luo, Yanxia; Wu, Lijuan; Guo, Xiuhua","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ec7aa1d4381bbaa7f5fa69fa8eb7cc1d90a39f1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3192122.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3192122/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Beijing","Guangdong","Zhejiang","Fujian"],"keyphrases":["confirmed H1N1 infection","confirmed cases","confirmed H1N1 patients","patient characteristics of H1N1 infection","adverse patient outcome","adverse outcome","pandemic influenza","mainland China","H1N1-specific respiratory symptoms","poor patient outcome","hospitalized cases","major risk factors","high population mobility-associated H1N1 transmission","potential risk factors","initial phase of infection","clinical symptoms","general symptoms","delayed appearance of respiratory symptoms","virus infection","future pandemic preparedness","Delayed hospital admission","number of new cases","high population density","higher risk of high level traffic","geographic distribution","delayed onset","regions","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","southeast coastal provinces","chronic pulmonary disease","affected east","retrospective analyses","proportional hazards model","Guangdong","Shanghai","populous cities","significant implications","geo-statistical maps","Zhejiang","gender","age","Fujian","Beijing","days","METHODOLOGY","response","incidence","country","SIGNIFICANCE","deaths","present study","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","year"],"language":"en"},

However, data on the effects of bacterial coinfection on these patients are very scarce. Therefore, this study explores the impact of bacterial coinfection on the clinical and laboratory parameters amongst H1N1 hospitalized patients. FINDINGS: This retrospective study involved hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed H1N1 infections (September 2009 to May 2010). Relevant clinical data and the detection of bacterial coinfection from respiratory or sterile site samples were obtained. Multiplex PCR was used to determine the co-existence of other respiratory viruses. Comparison was made between patients with and without bacterial coinfection. The occurrence of coinfection was 34%; 14 (28%) bacterial and only 3 (6%) viral. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 5) was the commonest bacteria followed by Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3). In univariate analysis, clinical factors associated with bacterial coinfection were age \u003E 50 years (p = 0.02), presence of comorbidity (p = 0.04), liver impairment (p = 0.02), development of complications (p = 0.004) and supplemental oxygen requirement (p = 0.02). Leukocytosis (p = 0.02) and neutrophilia (p = 0.004) were higher in bacterial coinfected patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age \u003E 50 years and combined complications were predictive of bacterial coinfection. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial coinfection is not uncommon in H1N1 infected patients and is more frequently noted in the older aged patients and is associated with higher rates of complications. Also, as adjunct to clinical findings, clinicians need to have a higher index of suspicion if neutrophilia was identified at admission as it may denote bacterial coinfection.","publish_time":"2011-11-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dhanoa, Amreeta; Fang, Ngim C; Hassan, Sharifah S; Kaniappan, Priyatharisni; Rajasekaram, Ganeswrie","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d531d9779d5bc0c30087abd118ec5baa4deab7b1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3217982.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3217982/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzExNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Multiplex PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of bacterial coinfection","predictive of bacterial coinfection","impact of bacterial coinfection","effects of bacterial coinfection","bacterial coinfected patients","occurrence of coinfection","H1N1 infected patients","clinical findings","older aged patients","clinical factors","Relevant clinical data","H1N1 infections","clinical characteristics of influenza","higher rates of complications","years","combined complications","development of complications","neutrophilia","higher index of suspicion","laboratory parameters","respiratory viruses","univariate analysis","retrospective study","Multivariate logistic regression analysis","clinicians","sterile site samples","commonest bacteria","Staphylococcus aureus","admission","supplemental oxygen requirement","co-existence","Numerous reports","adjunct","liver impairment","CONCLUSIONS","presence of comorbidity","BACKGROUND","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","Multiplex PCR","Leukocytosis","Comparison"],"language":"en"},

The most suitable reference genes in sheep have been identified for a restricted range of tissues, but no specific data on whole blood are available. The aim of this study was to identify a set of reference genes for normalizing qRT-PCR from ovine whole blood. We designed 11 PCR assays for commonly employed reference genes belonging to various functional classes and then determined their expression stability in whole blood samples from control and disease-stressed sheep. SDHA and YWHAZ were considered the most suitable internal controls as they were stably expressed regardless of disease status according to both geNorm and NormFinder software; furthermore, geNorm indicated SDHA/HPRT, YWHAZ/GAPDH and SDHA/YWHAZ as the best reference gene combinations in control, disease-stressed and combined sheep groups, respectively. Our study provides a validated panel of optimal control genes which may be useful for the identification of genes differentially expressed by qRT-PCR in a readily accessible tissue, with potential for discovering new physiological and disease markers and as a tool to improve production traits (e.g., by identifying expression Quantitative Trait Loci).

As far as taxonomy is concerned, color may help observing various species\u2019 characteristics in correlation with classification. However, choosing the number of subclasses to display is often a complex task: on the one hand, assigning a limited number of colors to taxa of interest hides the structure imbedded in the subtrees of the taxonomy; on the other hand, differentiating a high number of taxa by giving them specific colors, without considering the underlying taxonomy, may lead to unreadable results since relationships between displayed taxa would not be supported by the color code. In the present paper, an automatic color coding scheme is proposed to visualise the levels of taxonomic relationships displayed as overlay on any kind of data plot. To achieve this goal, a dimensionality reduction method allows displaying taxonomic \u201Cdistances\u201D onto a Euclidean two-dimensional space. The resulting map is projected onto a 2D color space (the Hue, Saturation, Brightness colorimetric space with brightness set to 1). Proximity in the taxonomic classification corresponds to proximity on the map and is therefore materialised by color proximity. As a result, each species is related to a color code showing its position in the taxonomic tree. The so called ColorPhylo displays taxonomic relationships intuitively and can be combined with any biological result. A Matlab version of ColorPhylo is available at http://sy.lespi.free.fr/ColorPhylo-homepage.html. Meanwhile, an ad-hoc distance in case of taxonomy with unknown edge lengths is proposed.","publish_time":"2011-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lespinats, Sylvain; Fertil, Bernard","journal":"Evol Bioinform Online","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b44c16070a980ad9258249edfc99db4f17149d99.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3255521.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3255521/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["color proximity","color code","D color space","taxonomic classification","levels of taxonomic relationships","taxonomic tree","case of taxonomy","automatic color coding scheme","underlying taxonomy","displayed taxa","high number of taxa","Brightness colorimetric space","limited number of colors","hand","number of subclasses","complex data","Euclidean two-dimensional space","specific colors","complex task","resulting map","biological result","kind of data plot","Matlab version of ColorPhylo","Hue","Saturation","distances","overlay","unreadable results","various species\u2019 characteristics","dimensionality reduction method","present paper","unknown edge lengths","correlation","position","goal","structure","subtrees"],"language":"en"},

In this review, we aim to emphasize the great leverage provided by the suite of genomic and classical genetic approaches available in flies for decoding details of host-pathogen interactions; these findings can then be applied to studies in higher organisms. We first briefly summarize the general strategies by which Drosophila resists and responds to pathogens. We then focus on how recently developed genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screens conducted in cells and flies, combined with classical genetic methods, have provided molecular insight into host-pathogen interactions, covering examples of bacteria, fungi and viruses. Finally, we discuss novel strategies for how flies can be used as a tool to examine how specific isolated virulence factors act on an intact host.","publish_time":"2011-10-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bier, Ethan; Guichard, Annabel","journal":"Dis Model Mech","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92f249b3f598cb99508ab84d9accac4dea8d7a2c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3255543.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3255543/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host-pathogen interactions","flies","intact host","host responses","decoding details of host","classical genetic methods","genetic tools","pathogens","classical genetic approaches available","molecular insight","Drosophila resists","general strategies","novel strategies","wealth of well-developed molecular","RNAi","screens","suite of genomic","developed genome-wide RNA interference","examples of bacteria","specific isolated virulence factors","cells","cellular mechanisms","findings","key events","studies","fungi","viruses","great leverage","higher organisms","result","evolution","review"],"language":"en"},

The ocular surface represents both a potential site of virus replication and a portal of entry for establishment of a respiratory infection. However, the properties which govern ocular tropism of influenza viruses, the mechanisms of virus spread from ocular to respiratory tissue, and the potential differences in respiratory disease initiated from different exposure routes are poorly understood. Here, we established a ferret model of ocular inoculation to explore the development of virus pathogenicity and transmissibility following influenza virus exposure by the ocular route. We found that multiple subtypes of human and avian influenza viruses mounted a productive virus infection in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets following ocular inoculation, and were additionally detected in ocular tissue during the acute phase of infection. H5N1 viruses maintained their ability for systemic spread and lethal infection following inoculation by the ocular route. Replication-independent deposition of virus inoculum from ocular to respiratory tissue was limited to the nares and upper trachea, unlike traditional intranasal inoculation which results in virus deposition in both upper and lower respiratory tract tissues. Despite high titers of replicating transmissible seasonal viruses in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets inoculated by the ocular route, virus transmissibility to na\u00EFve contacts by respiratory droplets was reduced following ocular inoculation. These data improve our understanding of the mechanisms of virus spread following ocular exposure and highlight differences in the establishment of respiratory disease and virus transmissibility following use of different inoculation volumes and routes.","publish_time":"2012-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Belser, Jessica A.; Gustin, Kortney M.; Maines, Taronna R.; Pantin-Jackwood, Mary J.; Katz, Jacqueline M.; Tumpey, Terrence M.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5881e62ed1be0eec6603b49cf10c413d3c1e560f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3291616.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3291616/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzIzNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory infection","ocular tissue","ocular route","following ocular exposure","virus transmissibility","respiratory tissue","virus deposition","mechanisms of virus","ocular surface","influenza virus exposure","respiratory droplets","productive virus infection","ocular tropism of influenza viruses","establishment of respiratory disease","upper respiratory tract of ferrets","ferret model of ocular inoculation","development of virus pathogenicity","common respiratory pathogen","lower respiratory tract tissues","potential site of virus replication","human infection","Replication-independent deposition of virus inoculum","avian influenza viruses","lethal infection","H5N1 viruses","traditional intranasal inoculation","upper trachea","use of different inoculation volumes","transmissible seasonal viruses","different exposure routes","acute phase of infection","ability","potential differences","systemic spread","multiple subtypes of human","sporadic reports of conjunctivitis","na\u00EFve contacts","portal of entry","nares","high titers","understanding","properties","data"],"language":"en"},

Individuals are influenced by information in complex and unpredictable ways. Emerging infectious diseases, such as the recent swine flu epidemic, may be particular hotspots for a media-fueled rush to vaccination; conversely, seasonal diseases may receive little media attention, despite their high mortality rate, due to their perceived lack of newness. METHODS: We formulate a deterministic transmission and vaccination model to investigate the effects of media coverage on the transmission dynamics of influenza. The population is subdivided into different classes according to their disease status. The compartmental model includes the effect of media coverage on reporting the number of infections as well as the number of individuals successfully vaccinated. RESULTS: A threshold parameter (the basic reproductive ratio) is analytically derived and used to discuss the local stability of the disease-free steady state. The impact of costs that can be incurred, which include vaccination, education, implementation and campaigns on media coverage, are also investigated using optimal control theory. A simplified version of the model with pulse vaccination shows that the media can trigger a vaccinating panic if the vaccine is imperfect and simplified messages result in the vaccinated mixing with the infectives without regard to disease risk. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of media on an outbreak are complex. Simplified understandings of disease epidemiology, propogated through media soundbites, may make the disease significantly worse.","publish_time":"2011-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tchuenche, Jean M; Dube, Nothabo; Bhunu, Claver P; Smith?, Robert J; Bauch, Chris T","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/91cf2912f97c604614f602dcaa4003836a87661f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3317585.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3317585/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzI5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["media soundbites","effects of media coverage","effect of media coverage","vaccination model","little media attention","disease risk","pulse vaccination","disease status","Simplified understandings of disease epidemiology","simplified messages","compartmental model","simplified version","number of individuals","seasonal diseases","deterministic transmission","vaccinated mixing","number of infections","provision of information influences individual risk perception","transmission dynamics of influenza","Emerging infectious diseases","threshold parameter","recent swine flu epidemic","vaccine","high mortality rate","particular hotspots","infectives","regard","implementation","campaigns","local stability","disease-free steady state","basic reproductive ratio","turn","different classes","vaccinating panic","rush","education","perceived lack of newness","urgent need","unpredictable ways","outbreak","optimal control theory","BACKGROUND","evolution of epidemics","population","RESULTS","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","impact of costs"],"language":"en"},

Recently, highly cross-reactive and infection-enhancing pre-membrane (prM)-specific antibodies were found to dominate the anti-DENV immune response in humans, raising concern over vaccine candidates that contain native dengue prM sequences. In this study, we have isolated a broadly cross-reactive prM-specific antibody, D29, during a screen with a non-immunized human Fab-phage library against the four serotypes of DENV. The antibody is capable of restoring the infectivity of virtually non-infectious immature DENV (imDENV) in Fc\u03B3R-bearing K562 cells. Remarkably, D29 also cross-reacted with a cryptic epitope on the envelope (E) protein located to the DI/DII junction as evidenced by site-directed mutagenesis. This cryptic epitope, while inaccessible to antibody binding in a native virus particle, may become exposed if E is not properly folded. These findings suggest that generation of anti-prM antibodies that enhance DENV infection may not be completely avoided even with immunization strategies employing E protein alone or subunits of E proteins.","publish_time":"2012-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, Annie Hoi Yi; Tan, Hwee Cheng; Chow, Angelia Yee; Lim, Angeline Pei Chiew; Lok, Shee Mei; Moreland, Nicole J.; Vasudevan, Subhash G.; MacAry, Paul A.; Ooi, Eng Eong; Hanson, Brendon J.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51a9f0de2c657fd582c5ff023027833d48e4876b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3317930.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3317930/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzI5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV","DI/DII"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DENV infection","serotypes of DENV","cross-reactive prM-specific antibody","non-infectious immature DENV","generation of anti-prM antibodies","native dengue prM sequences","anti-DENV immune response","antibody binding","subunits of E proteins","specific antibodies","cryptic epitope","Dengue virus","D29","native virus particle","humans","vaccine candidates","non-immunized human Fab-phage library","concern","screen","pre-membrane","Fc\u03B3R","imDENV","infectivity","effective treatment","envelope","DII junction","major mosquito","immunization strategies","site","year","pathogen","vaccines","findings","K562 cells","people","mutagenesis","study"],"language":"en"},

Clinical features alone cannot with certainty distinguish SARS from other respiratory illnesses rapidly enough to inform early management decisions. A balanced approach to screening that allows early recognition of SARS without unnecessary isolation of patients with other respiratory illnesses will require clinicians not only to look for suggestive clinical features but also to routinely seek epidemiologic clues suggestive of SARS coronavirus exposure. Key epidemiologic risk factors include 1) exposure to settings where SARS activity is suspected or documented, or 2) in the absence of such exposure, epidemiologic linkage to other persons with pneumonia (i.e., pneumonia clusters), or 3) exposure to healthcare settings. When combined with clinical findings, these epidemiologic features provide a possible strategic framework for early recognition of SARS.","publish_time":"2004-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jernigan, John A.; Low, Donald E.; Helfand, Rita F.","journal":"Emerg Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44f6a983bc7eba1620e1d53ff2721f9a0aea1a6a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3322910.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322910/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzM1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["early recognition of SARS","SARS activity","epidemiologic features","epidemiologic clues suggestive of SARS coronavirus exposure","febrile respiratory illnesses","suggestive clinical features","epidemiologic linkage","early management decisions","clinical findings","severe acute respiratory syndrome","Key epidemiologic risk factors","pneumonia clusters","healthcare settings","unnecessary isolation of patients","rapid diagnostic tests","rapid initiation of infection control precautions","possible strategic framework","important strategies","persons","screening","certainty","balanced approach","absence","clinicians"],"language":"en"},

Virions were spherical, 78 nm in mean diameter, and composed of a helical nucleocapsid within an envelope with surface projections. Herein, we show that infection with the SARS-associated coronavirus resulted in distinct ultrastructural features: double-membrane vesicles, nucleocapsid inclusions, and large granular areas of cytoplasm. These three structures and the coronavirus particles were shown to be positive for viral proteins and RNA by using ultrastructural immunogold and in situ hybridization assays. In addition, ultrastructural examination of a bronchiolar lavage specimen from a SARS patient showed numerous coronavirus-infected cells with features similar to those in infected culture cells.

Finally, we show that in bond percolation, finding the set of nodes in the component containing a given node is equivalent to finding the set of nodes activated if that node is initially activated and the node thresholds are chosen from the appropriate distribution. A consequence of these results is that mathematical techniques developed for the WTM apply to these other models as well, and techniques that were developed for some particular case may in fact apply much more generally.","publish_time":"2016-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miller, Joel C.","journal":"Phys Rev E","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8bd3f0a62ce066bd04ceb41d890f3875faf0cfda.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217504.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217504/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs0OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WTM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bond percolation","core percolation","WTM","site percolation","variants of percolation","heterogeneous bootstrap percolation","fact","generalized epidemic process","Formula","text","set of nodes","given node","node thresholds","behavior of processes","apparent generalization","mathematical techniques","natural generalization","particular case","special case","Watts threshold model","component","network structure","results","recent years","small modification","appropriate distribution","neighbors","consequence","networks","models","individuals","message","probability","terms"],"language":"en"},

It seems that the two strategies should be similar, since shortening the interaction time between susceptible and infected individuals somehow increases the chances for contact between susceptible individuals. However, analytical results indicate that the effectiveness of the former strategy sensitively depends on the infectious intensity and the combinations of different interaction rates, whereas the latter one is quite robust and efficient.

The \u201Csuperblockers,\u201D i.e., the nodes that should be removed from the network to minimize the size of outbreaks, are those nodes that make connected components as small as possible. \u201CSuperspreaders\u201D are instead the nodes such that, if chosen as initiators, they maximize the average size of outbreaks. The identity of superspreaders is expected to depend not just on the topology, but also on the specific dynamics considered. Recently, it has been conjectured that the two optimization problems might be equivalent, in the sense that superblockers act also as superspreaders. In spite of its potential groundbreaking importance, no empirical study has been performed to validate this conjecture. In this paper, we perform an extensive analysis over a large set of real-world networks to test the similarity between sets of superblockers and of superspreaders. We show that the two optimization problems are not equivalent: superblockers do not act as optimal spreaders.","publish_time":"2017-01-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Radicchi, Filippo; Castellano, Claudio","journal":"Phys Rev E","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/85fd457a8703c0b90cf51d8d553954461c611ea3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217522.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217522/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs1MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nodes","optimization problems","sets of superblockers","superblockers act","important problems","identity of superspreaders","structural optimization","average size of outbreaks","extent of outbreaks","small fraction","optimal selection of node sets","optimal spreaders","complex topologies","spreading phenomena","potential groundbreaking importance","large set of real-world networks","extensive analysis","empirical study","connected components","similarity","sense","minimization problem","spite","paper","initiators","specific dynamics","desired goal","topology","conjecture"],"language":"en"},

We consider an epidemic model that is network based and non-Markovian, containing classic Kermack-McKendrick, pairwise, message passing, and spatial models as special cases. For this model, we prove a monotonic relationship between the variability of the infectious period (with fixed mean) and the probability that the infection will reach any given subset of the population by any given time. For certain families of distributions, this result implies that epidemic severity is decreasing with respect to the variance of the infectious period. The striking importance of this relationship is demonstrated numerically. We then prove, with a fixed basic reproductive ratio ([Formula: see text]), a monotonic relationship between the variability of the posterior transmission probability (which is a function of the infectious period) and the probability that the infection will reach any given subset of the population by any given time. Thus again, even when [Formula: see text] is fixed, variability of the infectious period tends to dampen the epidemic. Numerical results illustrate this but indicate the relationship is weaker. We then show how our results apply to message passing, pairwise, and Kermack-McKendrick epidemic models, even when they are not exactly consistent with the stochastic dynamics. For Poissonian contact processes, and arbitrarily distributed infectious periods, we demonstrate how systems of delay differential equations and ordinary differential equations can provide upper and lower bounds, respectively, for the probability that any given individual has been infected by any given time.","publish_time":"2018-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilkinson, Robert R.; Sharkey, Kieran J.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/85984fabe76d459cad576f358cb0875f65f49728.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217532.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217532/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs1MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["given time","infectious disease","given subset","given individual","distributed infectious periods","variability","monotonic relationship","Kermack-McKendrick epidemic models","epidemic severity","message passing","population","posterior transmission probability","Formula","text","fixed mean","infection","ordinary differential equations","classic Kermack-McKendrick","systems of delay differential equations","spatial models","fixed basic reproductive ratio","Numerical results","crucial determinant","Poissonian contact processes","lower bounds","network","respect","function","special cases","certain families of distributions","variance","stochastic dynamics","striking importance","duration"],"language":"en"},

We investigate three objective measures from the literature quantifying the performance of nodes in sentinel surveillance: the time to detection or extinction, the time to detection, and the frequency of detection. As a basis for the comparison, we use the susceptible-infectious-recovered model on static and temporal networks of human contacts. We show that, for some regions of parameter space, the three objective measures can rank the nodes very differently. This means sentinel surveillance is a class of problems, and solutions need to chose an objective measure for the particular scenario in question. As opposed to other problems in network epidemiology, we draw similar conclusions from the static and temporal networks.

One feature that can change spreading dynamics substantially is heterogeneous behavior among different types of individuals in a social network. In this paper, we explore how antiestablishment nodes (e.g., hipsters) influence the spreading dynamics of two competing products. We consider a model in which spreading follows a deterministic rule for updating node states (which indicate which product has been adopted) in which an adjustable probability [Formula: see text] of the nodes in a network are hipsters, who choose to adopt the product that they believe is the less popular of the two. The remaining nodes are conformists, who choose which product to adopt by considering which products their immediate neighbors have adopted. We simulate our model on both synthetic and real networks, and we show that the hipsters have a major effect on the final fraction of people who adopt each product: even when only one of the two products exists at the beginning of the simulations, a small fraction of hipsters in a network can still cause the other product to eventually become the more popular one. To account for this behavior, we construct an approximation for the steady-state adoption fractions of the products on [Formula: see text]-regular trees in the limit of few hipsters. Additionally, our simulations demonstrate that a time delay [Formula: see text] in the knowledge of the product distribution in a population, as compared to immediate knowledge of product adoption among nearest neighbors, can have a large effect on the final distribution of product adoptions. Using a local-tree approximation, we derive an analytical estimate of the spreading of products and obtain good agreement if a sufficiently small fraction of the population consists of hipsters. In all networks, we find that either of the two products can become the more popular one at steady state, depending on the fraction of hipsters in the network and on the amount of delay in the knowledge of the product distribution. Our simple model and analysis may help shed light on the road to success for antiestablishment choices in elections, as such success\u2014and qualitative differences in final outcomes between competing products, political candidates, and so on\u2014can arise rather generically in our model from a small number of antiestablishment individuals and ordinary processes of social influence on normal individuals.","publish_time":"2019-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Juul, Jonas S.; Porter, Mason A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f8de5088366e0cc2da18fc0ccca11db8c8528bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217548.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217548/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs1MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spreading of products","product distribution","small fraction of hipsters","competing products","final distribution of product adoptions","immediate knowledge of product adoption","social network","spreading dynamics","text","antiestablishment nodes","Formula","population","spreading process","final fraction of people","small number of antiestablishment individuals","simple model","final outcomes","normal individuals","success","antiestablishment choices","steady state","immediate neighbors","simulations","remaining nodes","communication networks","real networks","ordinary processes of social influence","steady-state adoption fractions","different types of individuals","large effect","nearest neighbors","major effect","heterogeneous behavior","time delay","spread of opinions","local-tree approximation","qualitative differences","diseases","structure","good agreement","political candidates","analytical estimate","memes","road","node states","light","elections","regular trees","deterministic rule","alternative facts","analysis","limit","adjustable probability","details","conformists","beginning","paper","feature"],"language":"en"},

In real societies, it is expected that these two processes depend on and affect each other. However, little is known about the effects of opinion dynamics over disease dynamics and vice versa, since most studies treat them separately. In this work we study the dynamics of the voter model for opinion formation intertwined with that of the contact process for disease spreading, in a population of agents that interact via two types of connections, social and contact. These two interacting dynamics take place on two layers of networks, coupled through a fraction [Formula: see text] of links present in both networks. The probability that an agent updates its state depends on both the opinion and disease states of the interacting partner. We find that the opinion dynamics has striking consequences on the statistical properties of disease spreading. The most important is that the smooth (continuous) transition from a healthy to an endemic phase observed in the contact process, as the infection probability increases beyond a threshold, becomes abrupt (discontinuous) in the two-layer system. Therefore, disregarding the effects of social dynamics on epidemics propagation may lead to a misestimation of the real magnitude of the spreading. Also, an endemic-healthy discontinuous transition is found when the coupling [Formula: see text] overcomes a threshold value. Furthermore, we show that the disease dynamics delays the opinion consensus, leading to a consensus time that varies nonmonotonically with [Formula: see text] in a large range of the model\u0027s parameters. A mean-field approach reveals that the coupled dynamics of opinions and disease can be approximately described by the dynamics of the voter model decoupled from that of the contact process, with effective probabilities of opinion and disease transmission.","publish_time":"2017-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vel\u00E1squez-Rojas, F\u00E1tima; Vazquez, Federico","journal":"Phys Rev E","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3399885f297ec40a827955a4ec905b5bc843e396.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7219934.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7219934/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs1NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease dynamics","effects of opinion dynamics","disease spreading","interacting dynamics","opinion consensus","Opinion formation","disease transmission","disease states","effects of social dynamics","coupled dynamics of opinions","contact process","statistical properties of disease","effective probabilities of opinion","text","Formula","endemic-healthy discontinuous transition","complex networks","layers of networks","voter model","endemic phase","consensus time","infection probability","interacting partner","threshold value","real magnitude","real societies","studied dynamical processes","epidemics propagation","consequences","misestimation","large range","coupling","place","types of connections","links present","mean-field approach","model\u0027s parameters","fraction","population of agents","layer system","studies"],"language":"en"},

Previously, an international multicenter study reported that this procedure was not inferior to conventional open surgery. However, thoracoscopic surgery is a highly difficult operation for surgeons and anesthesiologists; as a result, the safety and efficacy of the surgery is still under debate. Considering these circumstances, the purpose of this study was to analyze the results of single-center thoracoscopic surgery and to compare the outcomes relative to the patient\u2019s weight at the time of surgery. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients with EA/TEF who underwent thoracoscopic surgery in a single center between October 2008 and February 2017. RESULTS: In total, 41 cases of thoracoscopic repair of EA/TEF were performed. Upon subgrouping by over and under 2000 g of body weight at the time of operation, 34 were found to be over 2000 g and seven were under 2000 g. Intraoperative factors and events were not significantly different between the two groups. Additionally, most of the postoperative outcomes, including the rate of postoperative leakage and strictures, showed no difference. On the other hand, the under 2000 g group had more gastroesophageal reflux requiring fundoplication than did the heavier group (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this center\u2019s thoracoscopic repair of EA/TEF were not inferior to other centers\u2019 outcomes. Additionally, the intraoperative and postoperative outcomes were similar despite differences in weight at operation. Therefore, thoracoscopic repair might be a feasible surgical option for infants weighing less than 2000 g when performed by a surgeon and anesthesiologist team who are experienced in pediatric thoracoscopic surgery.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Son, Joonhyuk; Jang, Yerang; Kim, Wontae; Lee, Sanghoon; Jeong, Ji Seon; Lee, Suk-Koo; Seo, Jeong-Meen","journal":"Surg Endosc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a945b53d489bdc8faf1022c2cebf4165db0b8bbd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7222104.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222104/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs1NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rothenberg"],"organizations":["EA/TEF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["center thoracoscopic surgery","pediatric thoracoscopic surgery","center\u2019s thoracoscopic repair of EA","cases of thoracoscopic repair of EA","time of surgery","TEF","postoperative outcomes","conventional open surgery","g group","g of body weight","outcomes relative","centers\u2019 outcomes","time of operation","results of single","patient\u2019s weight","difficult operation","single center","rate of postoperative leakage","heavier group","routine procedure","Intraoperative factors","international multicenter study","esophageal atresia","distal tracheoesophageal fistula","fundoplication","differences","feasible surgical option","gastroesophageal reflux","strictures","surgeons","anesthesiologists","infants","Rothenberg","status","total","anesthesiologist team","events","safety","efficacy","patients","circumstances","purpose","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","hand","groups","METHODS","subgrouping","debate"],"language":"en"},

However, this also involves a decrease in the surface area of the activated carbon filter. The CO(2) elimination and sevoflurane (SEV) reflection of the old device (ACD-100) were thus compared with the new version (ACD-50) in patients sedated after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. After ERC approval and written informed consent, 23 patients were sedated with SEV, using first the ACD-100 and then the ACD-50 for 60 min each. With each device, patients were ventilated with tidal volumes (TV) of 5 ml/kg of ideal body weight for the first 30 min, and with 7 ml/kg for the next 30 min. Ventilation parameters, arterial blood gases, Bispectral-Index\u2122 (BIS, Aspect Medical Systems Inc., Newton, MA, USA), SEV concentrations exhaled by the patient (SEV-exhaled) and from the expiratory hose (SEV-lost) were recorded every 30 min. A SEV reflection index was calculated: SRI [%] = 100 \u00D7 (1 \u2212 (SEV-lost/SEV-exhaled)). Data were compared using ANOVA with repeated measurements and Student\u2019s T-tests for pairs. Respiratory rates, tidal and minute volumes were not significantly different between the two devices. End tidal and arterial CO(2) partial pressures were significantly higher with the ACD-100 as compared with the ACD-50. SEV infusion rate remained constant. SEV reflection was higher (SRI: ACD-100 vs. ACD-50, TV 5 ml/kg: 95.29 \u00B1 6.45 vs. 85.54 \u00B1 11.15, p = 0.001; 7 ml/kg: 93.42 \u00B1 6.55 vs. 88.77 \u00B1 12.26, p = 0.003). BIS was significantly lower when using the higher TV (60.91 \u00B1 9.99 vs. 66.57 \u00B1 8.22, p = 0.012), although this difference was not clinically relevant. During postoperative sedation, the use of ACD-50 significantly reduced CO(2) retention. SEV reflection was slightly reduced.

During the extension step of the PCR, 5\u2032 nuclease activity of DNA polymerase will cleave quencher dyes of the immobilized probe in the presence of nucleic acids targets. The increase of fluorescence intensities generated by the change in physical distance between reporter fluorophore and quencher moiety of the probes were collected by a confocal scanner. Using this new approach we successfully monitored five different pathogenic genomic DNAs and analyzed the dynamic characteristics of fluorescence intensity changes on the TaqMan probe array. The results indicate that the TaqMan probe array on a planar glass slide monitors DNA targets with excellent specificity as well as high sensitivity.

Zoster Vaccine Live (ZVL or Zostavax\u2122), has been licensed in the U.S. since 2006 to prevent herpes zoster. ZVL protection has been shown to wane with time and estimates of effect can be imprecise. We performed a systematic review of the duration of efficacy and effectiveness of ZVL against herpes zoster (HZ). METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and clinicaltrials.gov for vaccine efficacy or effectiveness (VE) studies of ZVL. Two authors independently screened each title and abstract, and potential VE studies were reviewed in-depth. Eligibility criteria included original data on ZVL prevention of HZ in a general population of immunocompetent recipients \u2264 60 years old. Selected articles were abstracted, independently reviewed, and discrepancies adjudicated. We attempted to locate relevant unpublished work and contacted authors for additional data, where necessary. Measures of association were illustrated on a forest plot and converted to VE (1-hazard ratio or risk ratio or odds ratio). RESULTS: We screened 1302 articles; 17 underwent full text review and 8 met inclusion criteria and were abstracted for this review. Selected studies included 1 phase III randomized controlled trial, 2 quasi experimental and 5 observational studies. One experimental and 5 observational studies estimated VE during the period from vaccination up to 4 years following vaccination; estimates across studies ranged from 33%-55%. Two quasi experimental and 3 observational studies estimated VE for \u2265 4 years following vaccination; estimates ranged from 19%-40%; the median estimate was 24% (Figure). Pooled VE was not calculated due to heterogeneity in length of follow up, age distribution of study subjects, as well as adjustment for factors such as underlying medical conditions. CONCLUSION: Most experimental and observational studies estimate VE just above 50% during the 3 years following receipt of ZVL. Beyond 3 years, ZVL protection wanes, with most studies estimating a VE of \u226424% after 4 years. Information on overall efficacy and duration of protection from ZVL will guide policy decisions regarding its use. DISCLOSURES: E.

We present Week 48 primary results. METHOD: EMERALD (NCT02269917) is a randomized, active-controlled, open-label, international, multicenter, parallel-group, non-inferiority trial. Virologically suppressed (viral load [VL] \u003C 50 c/mL for \u22652 months), HIV-1-infected adults were randomized (2:1) to switch to D/C/F/TAF or continue control. The FDA-stipulated primary endpoint was non-inferiority of D/C/F/TAF vs. control regarding % virologic rebound (confirmed VL \u2265 50 c/mL or premature discontinuations with last VL \u2265 50 c/mL) cumulative through Week 48 (4% margin). RESULT: 1141 patients were randomized and treated (N = 763 D/C/F/TAF; N = 378 control); median age 46; 18% women; 76% white; 58% on \u003E2 previous ARVs (prior to screening regimen); 15% with previous non-DRV virologic failure (VF). Virologic rebound through Week 48 was non-inferior for D/C/F/TAF (2.5%; n = 19) vs. control (2.1%; n = 8) (\u03940.4%, 95% CI: \u20131.5%; 2.2%; P \u003C 0.001). Most rebounders (12/19 [63%] vs. 4/8 [50%]) resuppressed by Week 48 without change in therapy. Week 48 virologic suppression rates (VL \u003C 50 c/mL; FDA Snapshot) were 94.9% vs. 93.7% (\u03941.2%, 95% CI: \u22121.7%;4.1%) and VF rates (VL \u2265 50 c/mL; Snapshot) were 0.8% vs. 0.5% (\u03940.3%, 95% CI: \u22120.7%;1.2%), with no discontinuations for VF. No resistance-associated mutations related to any study drug were observed. Adverse events (AEs) were similar between arms: AE-related discontinuations (1.4% vs. 1.3%); grade 3\u20134 AEs (6.8% vs. 8.2%); serious AEs (4.6% vs. 4.8%); and no deaths. Renal and bone parameters favored D/C/F/TAF vs. control. TC and LDL-C slightly favored control vs. D/C/F/TAF, with no clinically significant difference in TC/HDL-C ratio between arms (Table 1). CONCLUSION: Percentage of virologic rebound after switching to D/C/F/TAF was non-inferior to control cumulative through Week 48, with high suppression rates (94.9%), no resistance development, better bone and renal safety parameters and similar TC/HDL-C ratio. D/C/F/TAF maintains the high genetic barrier to resistance of darunavir with the safety advantages of TAF, even in patients with a history of non-DRV VF. DISCLOSURES: C.

In preclinical studies in rats, IV BCV dosed twice weekly for up to 29 days was not associated with gastrointestinal (GI), hematopoietic, hepatic, or renal toxicity. This study evaluated the safety and PK of IV BCV in healthy subjects. METHODS: In this double-blind study, subjects were randomized 3:1 to receive IV BCV or placebo in sequential single ascending dose cohorts (Table 1). Plasma PK samples were collected over 7 days and assayed by HPLC-MS. Plasma BCV PK parameters were determined by non-compartmental analysis and dose proportionality was assessed. Safety assessments were collected over 14 days. RESULTS: Forty healthy male subjects (18\u201346 years, 83% White) were enrolled and completed the study. Plasma BCV Cmax and AUC\u221E increased in proportion to dose (Table 1). AEs and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations were dose- and infusion duration-related (Table 1). GI AEs were mild. All AEs and ALT elevations were transient and no serious AEs occurred. CONCLUSION: Single doses of BCV 10\u201350 mg administered as a 2h IV infusion were well tolerated and not associated with significant clinical or laboratory abnormalities. BCV IV 10 mg and BCV IV 50 mg achieved geometric mean plasma BCV AUC\u221E similar to and 4.5-fold, respectively, values achieved with BCV oral 100 mg tablets (Cmax = 251 ng/mL and AUC\u221E = 1394 ng hours/mL).

Increased use of diagnostic assays for respiratory viruses has facilitated detection and, since 2014, voluntary reporting of HCoV to the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS). METHODS: We reviewed weekly aggregate test results for HCoV OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1 voluntarily reported to NREVSS by U.S. hospital and clinical laboratories from July 1, 2014\u2012April 30, 2017. Laboratories reporting any HCoV result using PCR were included, and the weekly percentage of positive HCoV tests by type was calculated. For a subset of HCoV detections reported to NREVSS via the Public Health laboratory Interoperability Project (PHLIP), which collects individual-level demographic data, we described age distribution and sex. Age distribution by HCoV type was compared using the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test. RESULTS: 154 laboratories, across all 9 U.S. census divisions, reported 834,742 tests for HCoV; 18,514 (2.2%) were positive for HCoV-OC43, 8,363 (1.0%) for HCoV-NL63, 6,828 (0.8%) for HCoV-229E, and 5,170 (0.6%) for HCoV-HKU1. The percentage of tests positive for HCoV generally peaked between December and March (Figure 1). HCoV-OC43 showed distinct annual peaks with variation in magnitude by year. HCoV-HKU1 and NL63 had similar patterns, each with notable peaks during winter 2016 compared with 2015 or 2017. HCoV-229E showed a discernable peak in 2017 compared with the previous 2 years. Of 20,533 individuals with HCoV test results reported via PHLIP, 1,589 (7.7%) tested positive for any HCoV; 50% of HCoV-positive individuals were male, and the median age was 22 (range 0\u201396) years. Age distribution differed between HCoV types (P \u003C 0.01, Figure 2). CONCLUSION: Over approximately 3 seasons, peak positivity for HCoV occurred during winter months, and annual differences in circulation by HCoV type were observed. Continued testing and surveillance for HCoV will allow for further characterization of circulation trends over time and by geographic region, and improved understanding of the contribution of HCoV to the winter respiratory virus season.

The ten goat breeds included in the study were Kamori, Tapri, Bugi-Turi, Pateri, Kachan, Jattan, Lohri, Chappar, Barri, and Thari. The data were collected using a detailed survey on various productive (birth weight, weaning weight, weaning age, average daily gain, milk yield and lactation length) and reproductive (age at first heat, age at first kidding, kidding interval, service period, number of services per conception and twinning percentage) traits of goats. Up sixteen local farmers of each breed were visited by the investigators and information was recorded/collected on prescribed performas. The highest birth weight was observed in Pateri goat (2.90 \u00B1 0.11kg). In case of weaning weight maximum was observed in Kachan (16.0 \u00B1 0.50kg) and lowest in Thari (11.19 \u00B1 0.40 kg). Moreover weaning age was lowest in Thari (3.0 \u00B1 0.11months) and highest was in Bugi-Turi (8.0 \u00B1 0.14months). The highest milk yield was observed in Tapri and Kamori (~ 3.50 kg) followed by Pateri (~2.90 kg), Bugi Tori, Kacchan, Jattan (~ 2.00 kg) and Lohri, Chapper, Barri and Theri (~1 kg). As far as reproductive traits are concerned; age at first heat was lowest in Pateri (around 7 months) while all other breeds ranged from 11 to 15 months). The maximum twining percentage at first kidding was observed in Chappar (25%). Jattan had lowest kidding interval (5.0 \u00B1 0.16 months). On the basis of overall average pre-weaning growth rate of kids, Tapri and Thari appear to have higher growth potential followed by Kamori and Kachhan. It could be concluded that Tapri, Thari and Kamori may be utilized for meat production under existing circumstances in the order of priority. Similarly, Tapri, Kamori and Pateri may be better utilized as dairy goats as well.

Role of Human bocavirus Respiratory Tract Infection in Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Recipients","doi":"10.1093/ofid/ofz360.1619","pmcid":"PMC6808672","pubmed_id":null,"license":"cc-by-nc-nd","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Limited data exist regarding the impact of human bocavirus (BoV) in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. We examined incidence and disease spectrum of BoV respiratory tract infection (RTI) in HCT recipients. METHODS: In a longitudinal surveillance study of viral RTIs among allogeneic HCT recipients, pre-HCT and weekly post-HCT nasal washes and symptom surveys were collected through day 100, then every 3 months, and whenever respiratory symptoms occurred through 1-year post-HCT. Samples were tested by multiplex semi-quantitative PCR for RSV, parainfluenza virus 1\u20134, influenza A/B, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, and BoV. Plasma samples from BoV\u002B subjects were analyzed by PCR. In addition, we conducted a retrospective review of HCT recipients with BoV detected in bronchoalveolar lavage or lung biopsy. RESULTS: Among 469 patients in the prospective cohort, 21 distinct BoV RTIs (3 pre-HCT and 18 post-HCT) were observed by 1-year post-HCT in 19 patients (median 42 years old, range 0\u201367) without apparent seasonality. BoV was more frequently detected in the latter half of the first 100 days post-HCT (Figure 1). The frequencies of respiratory symptoms in patients with BoV detected did not appear to be higher than those without any virus detected, with the exception of watery eyes (P \u003C 0.01) (Figure 2). Univariable models among patients with BoV RTI post-HCT showed higher peak viral load in nasal samples (P = 0.04) and presence of respiratory copathogens (P = 0.03) were associated with presence of respiratory symptoms; however, BoV detection in plasma was not (P = 0.8). Retrospective review identified 6 allogeneic HCT recipients (range 1\u201364 years old) with BoV detected in lower respiratory tract specimens [incidence rate of 0.4% (9/2,385) per sample tested]. Although all 6 cases presented with hypoxemia, 4 had significant respiratory copathogens or concomitant conditions that contributed to respiratory compromise. No death was attributed mainly to BoV lower RTI. CONCLUSION: BoV is infrequently detected in respiratory tract in HCT recipients. Our studies did not demonstrate convincing evidence that BoV is a significant pathogen in either upper or lower respiratory tracts. Watery eyes were associated with BoV detection.

To begin, we present a generalized model of the condition, illuminated by the application to sickle-cell anemia. Next, we propose a typology of related markets, some of which are currently functioning with available products and services, and others that are widely viewed as imminent. We suggest the manner in which perverse incentives may arise for firms that market genetic intervention in circumstances where heterozygous advantage is possible. Finally, we propose that this misalignment of incentives with social welfare has arisen from both ill-conceived market intervention where markets are capable of achieving efficient outcomes and the lack of market intervention where markets have failed.

This study develops an agent-based model for pandemic simulation, and incorporates individual responsive behavior in the model based on public risk communication literature. The resultant model captures the stochastic nature of epidemic spread process, and constructs a realistic picture of individual reaction process and responsive behavior to pandemic situations. The model is then applied to simulate the spread dynamics of 2009 H1N1 influenza in a medium-size community in Arizona. Simulation results illustrate and compare the spread timeline and scale of this pandemic influenza, without and with the presence of pubic risk communication and individual responsive behavior.

Our previous work reported on an EV71-infected rhesus monkey infant model that presented with histo-pathologic changes of the central nervous system (CNS) and lungs. This study is focused on the correlated modulation of gene expression in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from EV71-infected rhesus monkey infants. The expression of more than 500 functional genes associated with multiple pathways was modulated. The expression of genes associated with immune inflammatory responses was up-regulated during the period from days 4 to 10 post-infection. The expression of two genes (TAC1 and IL17A), which play major roles in inflammatory reactions, was remarkably up-regulated during the infection period. Furthermore, a higher expression level of the TAC1 gene was identified in the CNS compared to the lungs, but a high expression level of the IL-17A gene was observed in the lungs and not in the CNS. The results of this study suggest at least two facts about EV71 infection, which are that: the TAC1 gene that encodes substance P and neurokinin-A is present in both PBMCs and the hypothalamus; and the up-regulation of IL-17A is sustained in the peripheral blood.","publish_time":"2014-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Ying; Yang, Erxia; Pu, Jing; Liu, Longding; Che, Yanchun; Wang, Jingjing; Liao, Yun; Wang, Lichun; Ding, Dong; Zhao, Ting; Ma, Na; Song, Ming; Wang, Xi; Shen, Dong; Tang, Donghong; Huang, Hongtai; Zhang, Zhixiao; Chen, Dai; Feng, Mingfei; Li, Qihan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d2f29c0bf8f5b9bf9d357001a62b42244698b298.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3879270.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3879270/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzEwMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of genes","TAC1 gene","EV71 infection","correlated modulation of gene expression","high expression level","higher expression level","lungs","CNS","infection period","EV71-infected rhesus monkey infants","EV71-infected rhesus monkey infant model","PBMCs","functional genes","study","post-infection","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","major roles","inflammatory reactions","regulation of IL","major pathogen responsible","immune inflammatory responses","foot","fatal hand","central nervous system","histo-pathologic changes","mouth disease","substance P","neurokinin","IL17A","HFMD","hypothalamus","multiple pathways","days","facts","previous work","results","Enterovirus"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, it was the aim of this study to determine the life expectancy, spectrum and incidence of spontaneous neoplasms of the inbred rat strain LEW/Han. A total of 629 LEW/Han rats (305 females and 324 males) from a specified pathogen-free breeding colony were kept from weaning up to their natural death under defined environmental conditions. A complete histological examination was performed on all organs and macroscopically altered tissues of all animals which died during the first three years of the study. These were 296 female (98%) and 213 male (66%) rats. The mean lifespan of the females (27.7\u00B15.1 months) was significantly shorter than that of the males (32.5\u00B16.6 months). In both sexes, the lifespan was mainly determined by the occurrence of neoplasms. Of the large spectrum of 52 histologically different tumour types, the highest incidences were observed for adenomas of the pituitary gland and adenomas/adenocarcinomas of the adrenal cortex in both sexes, mammary gland tumours and endometrial carcinomas in females, and C-cell adenomas/adenocarcinomas of the thyroid gland and tumours of the haemopoietic system in males. Of these, the high incidences of tumours of the haemopoietic system in males (27.7%) and of endometrial carcinomas in females (45.2%) should be considered as characteristic features of the strain.","publish_time":"2011-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baum, Anke; Pohlmeyer, Gabriele; Rapp, Karl G.; Deerberg, Friedrich","journal":"Exp Toxicol Pathol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135737/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjsxMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lewis"],"organizations":["LEW/Han"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["females","Han rats","mammary gland tumours","thyroid gland","adenocarcinomas","pituitary gland","high incidences of tumours","haemopoietic system","endometrial carcinomas","sexes","Lewis rats","study","months","C-cell adenomas","incidence of spontaneous neoplasms","inbred rat strain LEW","highest incidences","spontaneous pathology","large spectrum","life expectancy","life-data","occurrence of neoplasms","mean lifespan","different tumour types","adrenal cortex","specified pathogen-free breeding colony","organs","natural death","defined environmental conditions","altered tissues","total","complete histological examination","biomedical research","animals","characteristic features","aim","years"],"language":"en"},

Consequently, the search for inhibitors of these enzymes has become a very active research field. As a continuation of previous work that showed that 2-thioxanthine (2TX) is an irreversible inhibitor of zinc finger (ZnF)-containing Fpg/Nei DNA glycosylases, we designed and synthesized a mini-library of 2TX-derivatives (TXn) and evaluated their ability to inhibit Fpg/Nei enzymes. Among forty compounds, four TXn were better inhibitors than 2TX for Fpg. Unexpectedly, but very interestingly, two dithiolated derivatives more selectively and efficiently inhibit the zincless finger (ZnLF)-containing enzymes (human and mimivirus Neil1 DNA glycosylases hNeil1 and MvNei1, respectively). By combining chemistry, biochemistry, mass spectrometry, blind and flexible docking and X-ray structure analysis, we localized new TXn binding sites on Fpg/Nei enzymes. This endeavor allowed us to decipher at the atomic level the mode of action for the best TXn inhibitors on the ZnF-containing enzymes. We discovered an original inhibition mechanism for the ZnLF-containing Fpg/Nei DNA glycosylases by disulfide cyclic trimeric forms of dithiopurines. This work paves the way for the design and synthesis of a new structural class of inhibitors for selective pharmacological targeting of hNeil1 in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rieux, Charlotte; Goffinont, St\u00E9phane; Coste, Franck; Tber, Zahira; Cros, Julien; Roy, Vincent; Gu\u00E9rin, Martine; Gaudon, Virginie; Bourg, St\u00E9phane; Biela, Artur; Aucagne, Vincent; Agrofoglio, Luigi; Garnier, Norbert; Castaing, Bertrand","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/509431ab1239d9dade4593a6d3f2b1a37915fe86.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7139703.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7139703/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjsyMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Fpg/Nei"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Fpg","Nei enzymes","Nei DNA glycosylases","best TXn inhibitors","better inhibitors","TX-derivatives","mimivirus Neil1 DNA glycosylases hNeil1","cancer","new structural class of inhibitors","new TXn binding sites","ZnLF","ZnF","neurodegenerative diseases","selective pharmacological targeting of hNeil1","zincless finger","dithiolated derivatives","relevant pharmacological targets","continuation of previous work","irreversible inhibitor of zinc finger","flexible docking","human","X-ray structure analysis","disulfide cyclic trimeric forms of dithiopurines","mass spectrometry","inflammation","mode of action","synthesis","design","MvNei1","biochemistry","ability","original inhibition mechanism","atomic level","way","compounds","active research field","mini-library","thioxanthine","endeavor"],"language":"en"},

ADP-ribosylation is a PTM, which occurs in two flavours: modification of a target with multiple ADP-ribose moieties (poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation or PARylation) or with only one unit (MARylation), which are added by the different enzymes of the PARP family (also known as the ARTD family). PARylation has been relatively well-studied, particularly in the DNA damage response. This has resulted in the development of PARP inhibitors such as olaparib, which are increasingly employed in cancer chemotherapeutic approaches. Despite the fact that the majority of PARP enzymes catalyse MARylation, MARylation is not as well understood as PARylation. MARylation is a dynamic process: the enzymes reversing intracellular MARylation of acidic amino acids (MACROD1, MACROD2, and TARG1) were discovered in 2013. Since then, however, little information has been published about their physiological function. MACROD1, MACROD2, and TARG1 have a \u2018macrodomain\u2019 harbouring the catalytic site, but no other domains have been identified. Despite the lack of information regarding their cellular roles, there are a number of studies linking them to cancer. However, some of these publications oppose each other, some rely on poorly-characterised antibodies, or on aberrant localisation of overexpressed rather than native protein. In this review, we critically assess the available literature on a role for the hydrolases in cancer and find that, currently, there is limited evidence for a role for MACROD1, MACROD2, or TARG1 in tumorigenesis.","publish_time":"2020-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feijs, Karla L.H.; Cooper, Christopher D.O.; \u017Daja, Roko","journal":"Cancers (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/275b44e69314848ad137d5fe66799df1436a460a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7139919.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7139919/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjsyMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PARP","ARTD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MACROD1","MACROD2","TARG1","PARylation","PARP family","majority of PARP enzymes","intracellular MARylation of acidic amino acids","different enzymes","PTM","ADP-ribosylation","development of PARP inhibitors","cancer chemotherapeutic approaches","multiple ADP-ribose moieties","cell\u2019s response","lack of information","ARTD family","little information","DNA damage response","poly","target","aberrant localisation of overexpressed","proteins","dynamic process","cellular roles","Post-translational modifications","native protein","extracellular cues","catalytic site","characterised antibodies","available literature","flavours","number of studies","macrodomain","olaparib","hydrolases","limited evidence","fact","domains","tumorigenesis","unit","physiological function","review","publications"],"language":"en"},

In patients with MMA and moderate-to-severe renal impairment, combined liver\u2013kidney transplantation is indicated. However, clinical experience of these transplantation options in patients with PA and MMA remains limited and fragmented. We undertook an overview of post-transplantation outcomes in patients with PA and MMA using the current available evidence. METHODS: A literature search identified publications on the use of transplantation in patients with PA and MMA. Publications were considered if they presented adequate demographic and outcome data from patients with PA or MMA. Publications that did not report any specific outcomes for patients or provided insufficient data were excluded. RESULTS: Seventy publications were identified of which 38 were full papers. A total of 373 patients underwent liver/kidney/combined liver\u2013kidney transplantation for PA or MMA. The most typical reason for transplantation was recurrent metabolic decompensation. A total of 27 post-transplant deaths were reported in patients with PA [14.0% (27/194)]. For patients with MMA, 18 post-transplant deaths were reported [11% (18/167)]. A total of 62 complications were reported in 115 patients with PA (54%) with cardiomyopathy (n = 12), hepatic arterial thrombosis (HAT; n = 14) and viral infections (n = 12) being the most commonly reported. A total of 52 complications were reported in 106 patients with MMA (49%) with viral infections (n = 14) and renal failure/impairment (n = 10) being the most commonly reported. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation and combined liver\u2013kidney transplantation appears to benefit some patients with PA or MMA, respectively, but this approach does not provide complete correction of the metabolic defect and some patients remain at risk from disease-related and transplantation-related complications, including death. Thus, all treatment avenues should be exhausted before consideration of organ transplantation and the benefits of this approach must be weighed against the risk of perioperative complications on an individual basis.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yap, Sufin; Vara, Roshni; Morais, Ana","journal":"Adv Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad94ba654adf451dc09582410a44d4031718c069.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7141097.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7141097/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjsyNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","MMA","Liver transplantation","kidney transplantation","use of transplantation","transplantation options","transplantation-related complications","combined liver","consideration of organ transplantation","overview of post-transplantation outcomes","publications","total","severe renal impairment","post-transplant deaths","risk of perioperative complications","renal failure","approach","viral infections","disease-related","propionic acidemia","metabolic defect","outcome data","specific outcomes","methylmalonic acidemia","treatment option","insufficient data","treatment avenues","recurrent metabolic decompensation","hepatic arterial thrombosis","typical reason","adequate demographic","literature search","complete correction","HAT","benefits","CONCLUSIONS","current available evidence","individual basis","clinical experience","METHODS","cardiomyopathy","INTRODUCTION","RESULTS","papers"],"language":"en"},

Understanding the molecular basis of the parasite growth and development is essential for the disease diagnosis, management and control. The tetraspanin (TSP) family of proteins are transmembrane proteins with a role in many physiological processes of eukaryotic organisms. TSPs present in the tegumental surface of platyhelminths play pivotal roles in host-parasite interaction. However, little is known about the role of TSPs in growth and development in the Platyhelminthes. To understand the role of TSP1 in the growth and development of E. granulosus we investigated the effect of EgTSP1-specific long dsRNA in different in vitro stages of the parasite. METHODS: Different stages of E. granulosus, protoscoleces and strobilated worms, were cultivated In vitro in di-phasic media. Using long dsRNA and two delivery methods, i.e. electroporation and electro-soaking, EgTSP1 silencing was performed with an EgTSP1-specific dsRNA. The TSP1 expression profile was assessed as well as the biological and ultrastructural properties of the parasites. RESULTS: After three days of dsRNA treatment, EgTSP1 expression was significantly reduced in both stages of E. granulosus as compared to irrelevant/unrelated dsRNA and untreated controls. Silencing expression of EgTSP1 in different stages of E. granulosus resulted in reduced viability and body contractions, inhibition of protoscoleces evagination and distinctive tegumental changes. Ultrastructural morphology of the strobilated worms treated with EgTSP1-specific dsRNA was indicative of the microtriches impairments and vacuolated tegument compared to the control helminths. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the present study suggest that EgTSP1 plays important structural roles in tegument configuration in E. granulosus. EgTSP1 is proved to be a potential target for the development of vaccines and RNAi-based drugs.

Furthermore, the G and F protein-specific antibodies could neutralize the infectivity of the VSV\u0394G*F/G, the NiV F and G envelope glycoproteins of pseudotype recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus expressing green fluorescence protein. The results demonstrated that the F and G proteins expressed by the recombinant baculoviruses could be safe diagnostic antigens for the surveillance and monitoring of NiV and could also be promising subunit vaccines for the prevention of NiV.","publish_time":"2006-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"WANG, Xi-Jun; HU, Sen; GE, Jin-Ying; WANG, Qing-Hua; QIN, Li-Ting; BU, Zhi-Gao","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f8c12586facdad5bd27993c0b5c7a0a6dcec196.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148955/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjszNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NiV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NiV F","G proteins of NiV","rBac-NG","rBac-NF","express F","expressions of recombinant G","F protein-specific antibodies","F protein-specific antibody responses","recombinant baculoviruses","prevention of NiV","monitoring of NiV","G envelope glycoproteins of pseudotype recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus","fusion protein","infected cells","green fluorescence protein","rNF","rNG","serum anti-Nipah virus","specific antigenic reaction","infected insect cells","indirect ELISA","indirect immunofluorescence detection","induction of neutralization antibody","envelope attachment glycoprotein","viral entry","safe diagnostic antigens","key role","surveillance","promising subunit vaccines","infectivity","mice","Western blot","VSV\u0394G","study","Immunization","results"],"language":"en"},

CAP and NP arise in different populations, host different spectra of causative pathogens, and pose different challenges to both the clinician and the radiologist. CAP is generally seen in outpatients, is most frequently caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Chlamydia, and its radiologic diagnosis is relatively straightforward. NP, in contrast, develops in the hospital setting, is commonly caused by gram-negative bacteria, and may generate substantial problems for the radiologist. Overall, both for CAP and NP, imaging is an integral component of the diagnosis, important for classification and differential diagnosis, and helpful for follow-up.","publish_time":"2004-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Herold, Christian J.; Sailer, Johannes G.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ee8e9026b0ce539f14eb58be6752c14bf364bb4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149014/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjszNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAP","NP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NP","CAP","radiologist","different populations","different challenges","differential diagnosis","radiologic diagnosis","nosocomial pneumonia","hospital setting","community","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","Streptococcus pneumoniae","host different spectra of causative pathogens","Haemophilus influenzae","hospitalization","continuous challenge","economic problem","Chlamydia","classification","integral component","mortality","leading causes of morbidity","imaging","substantial problems","health care","gram-negative bacteria","pulmonary infections","follow-up","pneumonias","clinician","contrast","number of characteristics","respects","separate entities","countries","outpatients"],"language":"en"},

Even with Antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV- treated patients had chronic immune activation and lymphocyte apoptosis. However, apoptotic mechanisms have not been investigated during coinfection with DENV. Our attention was attracted to apoptotic cell markers expressions in PBMCs from DENV and DENV/HIV coinfected patients. We found CD4/CD8 ratio inversion in most coinfected patients. CD4 T and CD8 T-cell subsets from DENV and DENV/HIV groups expressed low levels of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Furthermore, CD8 CD95 double positive cells frequency expressing low levels of Bcl-2 were significantly higher in these patients. Additionally, the density of Bcl-2 on classical monocytes (CD14(\u002B\u002B)CD16(\u2212)) was significantly lower during DENV infection. Upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins and anti-apoptotic proteins were found in DENV and DENV/HIV, while catalase, an antioxidant protein, was upregulated mainly in DENV/HIV coinfection.

High genetic diversity among PRRSV strains is problematic for successful disease control by vaccination. Mosaic DNA and vaccinia (VACV) vaccines were developed in order to improve protection against heterologous PRRSV strains. Methods: Piglets were primed and boosted with GP5-Mosaic DNA vaccine and recombinant GP5-Mosaic VACV (rGP5-Mosaic VACV), respectively. Pigs vaccinated with rGP5-WT (VR2332) DNA and rGP5-WT VACV, or empty vector DNA and empty VACV respectively, served as controls. Virus challenge was given to separate groups of vaccinated pigs with VR2332 or MN184C. Necropsies were performed 14 days after challenge. Results: Vaccination with the GP5-Mosaic-based vaccines resulted in cellular reactivity and higher levels of neutralizing antibodies to both VR2332 and MN184C PRRSV strains. In contrast, vaccination of animals with the GP5-WT vaccines induced responses only to VR2332. Furthermore, vaccination with the GP5-Mosaic based vaccines resulted in protection against challenge with two heterologous virus strains, as demonstrated by the significantly lower viral loads in serum, tissues, porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids, and less severe lung lesions after challenge with either MN184C or VR2332, which have only 85% identity. In contrast, significant protection by the GP5-WT based vaccines was only achieved against the VR2332 strain. Conclusions: GP5-Mosaic vaccines, using a DNA-prime/VACV boost regimen, conferred protection in pigs against heterologous viruses.","publish_time":"2020-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cui, Junru; O\u2019Connell, Caitlin M.; Hagen, Connor; Sawicki, Kim; Smyth, Joan A.; Verardi, Paulo H.; Van Kruiningen, Herbert J.; Garmendia, Antonio E.","journal":"Vaccines (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f7c4b6fc91f3143baa4824a7f8050f16d9bcccd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7157218.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7157218/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs0NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GP5-Mosaic vaccines","GP5-WT vaccines","rGP5-Mosaic VACV","recombinant GP5-Mosaic VACV","GP5-Mosaic DNA vaccine","based vaccines","rGP5-WT VACV","VR2332 strain","MN184C PRRSV strains","heterologous PRRSV strains","DNA-prime","vector DNA","heterologous virus strains","Virus challenge","VACV boost regimen","conferred protection","significant protection","heterologous viruses","vaccination of animals","separate groups of vaccinated pigs","contrast","major cause of disease","successful disease control","porcine alveolar macrophages","tissues","serum","cellular reactivity","higher levels of neutralizing antibodies","fluids","PAMs","respiratory syndrome","severe lung lesions","economic loss","order","High genetic diversity","bronchoalveolar lavage","lower viral loads","BAL","Background","responses","vaccinia","Conclusions","Necropsies","days","Piglets","Results","Methods","controls","identity"],"language":"en"},

We describe here a sensitive, conditionally replication-defective yellow fever virus (YFV) entry reporter, YFV\u0394SK/Nluc, to quantitively monitor the translation of incoming, virus particle-delivered genomes. We validated that YFV\u0394SK/Nluc gene expression can be neutralized by YFV-specific antisera and requires known flavivirus entry pathways and cellular factors, including clathrin- and dynamin-mediated endocytosis, endosomal acidification, YFV E glycoprotein-mediated fusion, and cellular LY6E and RPLP1 expression. The initial round of YFV translation was shown to require cellular ubiquitylation, consistent with recent findings that dengue virus capsid protein must be ubiquitylated in order for nucleocapsid uncoating to occur. Importantly, translation of incoming YFV genomes also required valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97, a cellular ATPase that unfolds and extracts ubiquitylated client proteins from large complexes. RNA transfection and washout experiments showed that VCP/p97 functions at a postfusion, pretranslation step in YFV entry. Finally, VCP/p97 activity was required by other flaviviruses in mammalian cells and by YFV in mosquito cells. Together, these data support a critical role for VCP/p97 in the disassembly of incoming flavivirus nucleocapsids during a postfusion step in virus entry.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ramanathan, Harish N.; Zhang, Shuo; Douam, Florian; Mar, Katrina B.; Chang, Jinhong; Yang, Priscilla L.; Schoggins, John W.; Ploss, Alexander; Lindenbach, Brett D.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e0a624018b11784d1935de7589a21a5196850e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7157815.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7157815/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs0NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VCP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["YFV entry","VCP","translation of incoming YFV genomes","YFV-specific antisera","entry reporter","initial round of YFV translation","known flavivirus entry pathways","YFV E glycoprotein-mediated fusion","cellular factors","cellular ubiquitylation","cellular LY6E","postfusion step","cellular ATPase","virus particle","p97 functions","basic mechanisms of flavivirus entry","p97 activity","disassembly of incoming flavivirus nucleocapsids","dengue virus capsid protein","postfusion events","RNA replication","YFV\u0394SK","nucleocapsid disassembly","replication-defective yellow fever virus","Nluc gene expression","pretranslation step","RNA transfection","mammalian cells","mosquito cells","RPLP1 expression","nucleocapsid uncoating","dynamin-mediated endocytosis","ubiquitylated client proteins","recent findings","endosomal acidification","clathrin","washout experiments","flaviviruses","valosin","large complexes","order","critical role","data"],"language":"en"},

The mononitrobenzylidene-HAGs were more active than the dinitro-benzylidene-HAG compound. In general, L1210 cells were more sensitive to the effects of the HAG compounds than were HT-29 cells. There was good agreement between the concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of HT-29 cells and that required to inhibit the growth of L1210 cells. There was also good correlation between the ability of HAG derivatives to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase activity and to inhibit tumor cell growth. Some derivatives, such as 2\u2032,3\u2032,4\u2032- and 3\u2032,4\u2032,5\u2032-trihydroxybenzylidene-HAG inhibited L1210 cell growth by 50% at lower concentrations (7.8 and 11.9 \u03BCM respectively) than the concentrations needed for 50% inhibition of HT-29 cell growth (196 and 234 \u03BCM respectively) and ribonucleotide reductase activity (122 and 188 \u03BCM respectively). The studies of nucleic acid synthesis in L1210 cells using [(3)H]cytidine as a precursor showed that 2\u2032,3\u2032,4\u2032-trihy-droxybenzylidine-HAG inhibited DNA synthesis at a lower concentration (29 \u03BCM for 50% inhibition) than was needed for the inhibition of RNA synthesis and formation of [(3)H]deoxycytidine nucleotides in the acid-soluble fraction (320 and 820 \u03BCM for 50% inhibition respectively). These results indicate that 2\u2032,3\u2032,4\u2032-trihydroxybenzylidine-HAG inhibits DNA synthesis in L1210 cells through other mechanisms rather than exclusively through the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity.","publish_time":"1990-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Masahiko, Matsumoto; Fox, John G.; Pou-Hsiung, Wang; Koneru, Phanesh B.; Lien, Eric J.; Cory, Joseph G.","journal":"Biochem Pharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c2e73c15119b111f62143f5b94bc531963eb799.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7157920/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs0NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["growth of L1210 cells","HAG compounds","growth of HT","trihydroxybenzylidine-HAG","inhibition of HT","\u03BCM","trihydroxybenzylidene-HAG inhibited L1210 cell growth","ability of HAG derivatives","HAG inhibited DNA synthesis","mouse leukemia L1210 cells","inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity","tumor cell growth","inhibition of RNA synthesis","growth of human colon carcinoma HT","studies of nucleic acid synthesis","hydroxy-N","methoxybenzylidene-HAGs","cell-free extracts","trihy-droxybenzylidene","effects","lower concentrations","mononitrobenzylidene-HAGs","hydroxy-benzylidines","acid-soluble fraction","trihy-droxybenzylidine","concentration of drug","series of N","lead compound","monohy-droxybenzylidene","good correlation","good agreement","monohydroxybenzylidene compounds","RCH\uE5FBNNHC","deoxycytidine nucleotides","dinitro-benzylidene","formation","culture","aminoguanidine","mechanisms","NHOH-tosylate","nitrobenzylidines","R position","methoxybenzylidines","precursor","dihydroxybenzylidene-","results"],"language":"en"},

Given its implication in immune homeostasis and immune surveillance combined with the fact that various lineages of malignant cells exhibit loss-of-function mutations, CD95 was initially classified as a tumor suppressor gene. Nonetheless, in different pathophysiological contexts, this receptor is able to transmit non-apoptotic signals and promote inflammation and carcinogenesis. Although the different non-apoptotic signaling pathways (NF-\u03BAB, MAPK, and PI3K) triggered by CD95 are known, the initial molecular events leading to these signals, the mechanisms by which the receptor switches from an apoptotic function to an inflammatory role, and, more importantly, the biological functions of these signals remain elusive.","publish_time":"2020-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fouqu\u00E9, Am\u00E9lie; Legembre, Patrick","journal":"Cancer Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19df05ebe2ea59b92285463121a95271806b56ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122270.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122270/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-apoptotic signals","apoptotic function","immune homeostasis","immune surveillance","receptor switches","immune response","infected cells","tumor necrosis factor receptor","tissue homeostasis","various lineages of malignant cells","function mutations","different pathophysiological contexts","tumor suppressor gene","natural killer","loss","pathways","plasma membrane of activated T-lymphocytes","NF-\u03BAB","member","TNFR","fundamental process","MAPK","NK","superfamily","inflammation","implication","initial molecular events","biological functions","PI3K","inflammatory role","development","elimination","mechanisms","carcinogenesis","Apoptosis","Fas","ligand","CD95L"],"language":"en"},

They arise from a wide spectrum of developmental, genetic, inflammatory, infectious, and reactive disorders. In the past, there has been a paucity of information and limited understanding regarding their pathogenesis, natural history, imaging findings, and histopathologic features, which often resulted in enormous diagnostic challenges and confusion. In recent years, there has been a substantial improvement in the understanding of interstitial lung disease in pediatric patients due to the development of a structured classification system based on the etiology of the lung disease, established pathologic criteria for consistent diagnosis, and the improvement of thoracoscopic techniques for lung biopsy. Imaging plays an important role in evaluating interstitial lung diseases in infants and children by confirming and characterizing the disorder, generating differential diagnoses, and providing localization for lung biopsy for pathological diagnosis. In this chapter, the authors present the epidemiology, challenges, and uncertainties of diagnosis and amplify a recently developed classification system for interstitial lung disease in infants and children with clinical, imaging, and pathological correlation.","publish_time":"2019-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Edward Y.","journal":"Imaging in Pediatric Pulmonology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f91c39aeb6d2f51a5f034bbd8c729a5d78cf063.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122367.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122367/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung biopsy","interstitial lung diseases","understanding of interstitial lung disease","children","infants","pathological diagnosis","rare heterogeneous group of parenchymal lung disorders","imaging findings","consistent diagnosis","uncertainties of diagnosis","developed classification system","structured classification system","clinical syndromes","limited understanding","substantial improvement","reactive disorders","pathological correlation","improvement of thoracoscopic techniques","enormous diagnostic challenges","pathogenesis","natural history","localization","pediatric patients","tachypnea","pathologic criteria","etiology","important role","wide spectrum of developmental","epidemiology","paucity of information","dyspnea","histopathologic features","differential diagnoses","crackles","authors","confusion","chapter","hypoxemia","recent years","past"],"language":"en"},

As in animal viruses, the \u22121 ribosomal frameshift site in the viral mRNA consists of a canonical shifty heptanucleotide followed by a highly structured frameshift stimulatory element, and the gene translated as a result of frameshifting usually encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. In plant viruses, the \u22121 frameshift stimulatory element consists of either (i) a small pseudoknot stabilized by many triple-stranded regions and a triple base pair containing a protonated cytidine at the helical junction, (ii) an unusual apical loop\u2013internal loop interaction in which a stem-loop in the 3(\u2032) untranslated region 4 kb downstream base pairs to a bulged stem-loop at the frameshift site, or (iii) a potential simple stem-loop. Other less well-characterized changes in reading frame occur on plant viral RNAs, including a possible \u002B1 frameshift, and net \u22121 reading frame changes that do not utilize canonical frameshift signals.

The term chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is being increasingly used to refer to recipients with late allograft dysfunction that meets the spirometric criteria for the diagnosis of BOS, but clinicians should recognize that such dysfunction can occur for a variety of reasons other than BOS. The recently identified entity of restrictive allograft syndrome, which is now recognized as a relatively distinct phenotype of CLAD, has features that differentiate it from classic obstructive BOS. A number of other entities that can also significantly affect allograft function must also be considered when significant allograft dysfunction is encountered following lung transplantation.","publish_time":"2013-06-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meyer, Keith C.; Glanville, Allan R.","journal":"Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome in Lung Transplantation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28961154326f33653b99879ebb2254933f94fbf7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122385.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122385/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BOS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["allograft rejection","significant allograft dysfunction","late allograft dysfunction","allograft function","term chronic lung allograft dysfunction","major cause of delayed allograft dysfunction","entity of restrictive allograft syndrome","diagnosis of BOS","classic obstructive BOS","majority of lung transplant recipients","following lung transplantation","number of associated events","acute rejection","Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome","distinct phenotype of CLAD","infections","gastroesophageal reflux","spirometric criteria","intense immunosuppression","recipient death","setting of alloimmune responses","autoimmune reactions","conditions","year","clinicians","variety of reasons","risk","entities","quality of life"],"language":"en"},

Improvements in diagnostic testing and standardized approaches to antifungal therapy, when available, have made considerable impact in the management of this infection. While the widespread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has improved the outcome of cryptococcosis in many HIV-infected patients, cryptococcosis remains an entity of considerable morbidity and mortality in many parts of the world, and restoration of host immunity can present management challenges that require individualized management. As immunocompromised populations continue to expand, it is likely that cryptococcosis will remain an important opportunistic fungal infection of humans requiring ongoing investigation.","publish_time":"2014-11-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maziarz, Eileen K.; Perfect, John R.","journal":"Diagnosis and Treatment of Fungal Infections","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aeae02422064ce1408bd3e64e04da1a2083b6fd5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122569.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122569/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsxNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cryptococcus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["important opportunistic infection","cryptococcal infection","outcome of cryptococcosis","important opportunistic fungal infection of humans","management challenges","individualized management","immunocompromised populations","antifungal therapy","Cryptococcus gattii","setting of HIV","infectious disease","considerable impact","active antiretroviral therapy","HIV-infected patients","entity of considerable morbidity","encapsulated fungi Cryptococcus neoformans","uncommon cause of human disease","standardized approaches","central nervous system","CNS","past","diagnostic testing","organ transplantation","malignancies","world","infections","parts","mortality","AIDS","restoration of host immunity","ongoing investigation","treatment","Improvements","HAART","widespread use","decades","Clinical manifestations","immunocompetent hosts","conditions"],"language":"en"},

These agents are effective at treating the signs and symptoms of influenza in patients infected with susceptible viruses. Clinical failure has been demonstrated in patients infected with viruses with primary resistance, i.e., antivirals can be present in the virus initially infecting the patient, or resistance may emerge during the course of therapy [3\u20135]. NA inhibitors are active against all nine NA subtypes recognized in nature [6], including highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 and recent low-pathogenic avian influenza A/H7N9 viruses [7]. Since seasonal influenza is usually an acute, self-limited illness in which viral clearance usually occurs rapidly due to innate and adaptive host immune responses, the emergence of drug-resistant variants would be anticipated to have limited effect on clinical recovery in otherwise healthy patients, as has been demonstrated clinically [3, 8, 9]. Unfortunately, immunocompromised or immunologically na\u00EFve hosts, such as young children and infants or those exposed to novel strains, are more likely to have mutations that confer resistance emergence during therapy; such resistant variants may also result in clinically significant adverse outcomes [10\u201313].","publish_time":"2016-11-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"van der Vries, Erhard; Ison, Michael G.","journal":"Antimicrobial Drug Resistance","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09feeb326c67f5b9ab4fb7fa30b979c43bacffad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122614.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122614/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsxOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of influenza","symptoms of influenza","seasonal influenza","NA inhibitors","resistance emergence","recent low-pathogenic avian influenza","healthy patients","primary resistance","resistant variants","NA subtypes","H7N9 viruses","susceptible viruses","agents","emergence of drug","M2 ion channel inhibitors","clinical recovery","Clinical failure","course of therapy","H5N1","amantadine","laninamivir","rimantadine","zanamivir","oseltamivir","neuraminidase","signs","self-limited illness","adaptive host immune responses","na\u00EFve hosts","infants","young children","antivirals","limited effect","peramivir","mutations","viral clearance","protease inhibitor","novel strains","classes of antiviral drugs","favipiravir","selected countries","significant adverse outcomes","nature"],"language":"en"},

Recently, next-generation sequencing technologies have allowed the discovery of new enteric viruses (novel astroviruses, kobuviruses, saliviruses, etc.). Noroviruses are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis outbreaks and sporadic cases in children and adults worldwide and they still remain refractory to routine cell culture propagation. Recent studies have shown that histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) are cellular carbohydrates that serve as receptors and host susceptibility factors for human noroviruses. They evolve based on antigenic changes and differential glycan binding specificities. In the last years there have been significant advances in the knowledge of their replication mechanisms, pathogenicity and genetic evolution. The strain diversity and the evolution of rotaviruses are also a matter of concern, despite the introduction of rotavirus vaccines. Similarly, molecular analyses of orally transmitted viruses causing hepatitis are clarifying the phylogenetic relationships between these viruses and other viral genera, as well as their pathophysiological mechanisms.","publish_time":"2016-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Buesa, Javier; Rodriguez-D\u00EDaz, Jes\u00FAs","journal":"Viruses in Foods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2aaaf9c1398af1503a1504572b119de5343de962.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122688.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122688/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsyMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Foodborne"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["waterborne viruses","transmitted viruses","hepatitis E virus","discovery of new enteric viruses","evolution of rotaviruses","human noroviruses","leading cause of acute gastroenteritis outbreaks","novel astroviruses","enteric adenoviruses","replication mechanisms","genetic evolution","pathophysiological mechanisms","sporadic cases","HBGAs","receptors","range of illnesses","histo-blood group antigens","host susceptibility factors","antigenic changes","differential glycan binding specificities","cellular carbohydrates","knowledge","children","pathogenicity","caliciviruses","kobuviruses","sapoviruses","routine cell culture propagation","adults","matter of concern","phylogenetic relationships","significant advances","molecular analyses","generation sequencing technologies","introduction of rotavirus vaccines","saliviruses","viral genera","strain diversity","Recent studies","years","diseases"],"language":"en"},

The EU has called this as \u201Can unprecedented displacement crisis\u201D and has aimed at devising a comprehensive approach to tackle it, which has been widely criticized. Concerns about public healthcare aspects of the crisis have permanently entered the media and policy discourse even though no systematic association between migration and the importation of infectious diseases has been recorded. In this context, the literature has not filled the existing gap between discourse and evidence, and almost no publications with reliable empirical data exist, both thematic (epidemiology) and geographical (Eastern Europe and Bulgaria). Among the existing publications, the focus has been on TB and HIV (Odone et al., Euro J Public Health 25(3):506\u2013512, 2015). In light of this, the aim of this research is to contribute to the debate by providing an overview of the refugee situation in Bulgaria, as a primary entry-point for refugees entering the EU. In order to achieve this, the article analyses the case of the refugee camp in city of Harmanly, close to the Bulgarian-Turkish border, and assesses the public health risks related to this specific situation. Based on a study of 128 patients with different symptoms we aim to draw wider implications about the linkages between public health and migration. The in-depth review of this specific case shows that both the probability and impact of migration on public health increases when the hosting country is relatively poor, the domestic public healthcare system is not efficient, and there is lack of trust in the government and public services. The study contributes to understanding better these risks in order to identify potential mitigation strategies in the region and the EU as a whole.","publish_time":"2018-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mihaylova-Garnizova, Raynichka; Garnizov, Vasil","journal":"Defence Against Bioterrorism","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af0df64171c3febb83507d3a75cd43c67daf945d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122854.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122854/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsyODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EU"],"locations":["Eastern Europe","Bulgaria","Europe"],"keyphrases":["public health risks","public health increases","public services","public healthcare aspects","Euro J Public Health","refugee crisis","domestic public healthcare system","refugee situation","impact of migration","specific case","refugee camp","specific situation","existing publications","study","aim","unprecedented displacement crisis","Eastern Europe","policy discourse","recent data","existing gap","number of refugees","reliable empirical data","Odone","hosting country","HIV","epidemiology","city of Harmanly","potential mitigation strategies","systematic association","wider implications","linkages","probability","different symptoms","Bulgarian-Turkish border","region","drop","focus","evidence","overview","importation of infectious diseases","primary entry","TB","literature","patients","in-depth review","trust","government","media","Concerns","article","debate","research","asylum","comprehensive approach","context","light"],"language":"en"},

Summaries of specific conditions follow, which provide brief high-yield facts on background, clinical presentation, evaluation, and management. Specific conditions are grouped similarly to the content outline for the ABP into conditions of the upper airway, lower airway, pulmonary parenchyma, chest wall disease, and disorders in breathing. More extensive summaries regarding asthma and cystic fibrosis are also included.","publish_time":"2019-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mart\u00EDnez-Fern\u00E1ndez, Tanya; Rivera-S\u00E1nchez, Yadira; Sharma, Preeti","journal":"Pediatric Board Study Guide","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8be76e4a74807da6576c1af78e4023e7d440ab00.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122857.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122857/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsyODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ABP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["quick review of common respiratory conditions","Summaries of specific conditions","evaluation of respiratory diseases","respiratory medicine","recommended evaluation","chapter","management of general signs","review of common diagnostic testing methods","lower airway","upper airway","general pediatrician","extensive summaries","pulmonary parenchyma","background","chest wall disease","clinical presentation","brief high-yield facts","differential diagnosis","ABP","symptoms","certifying board exam","disorders","asthma","cystic fibrosis","content outline","breathing","description","children","reader"],"language":"en"},

On the one hand, there are the unspecific, non-adaptive immune reactions, which recognize and eliminate invading foreign pathogens. This so-called natural or innate immune system becomes primarily active after a virus has overcome the external physical protection barriers of the body (skin, mucous membranes). It consists of dendritic cells, granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages and natural killer cells (NK cells). They have proteins that serve as receptors, e.g. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and complement receptors, for specific structures of pathogens and for the soluble products of the innate immune system (acute-phase proteins, factors of the complement system, cytokines, chemokines and interferons). The effects and functions of cytokines, chemokines and interferons will be discussed separately in Chap. 8. The specific, adaptive immune response is the second line of defence, and is developed only during or after the establishment of an infection. It includes antibody-producing B cells \u2013 the humoral immune system \u2013 as well as T-helper (T(H)) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which collectively constitute the cellular defence system. The adaptive immune reactions can selectively recognize certain pathogen types or subtypes, and in the case of a reinfection, they are able to recognize the pathogens again and eliminate them. They are long-lasting and a subset of stimulated lymphocytes transform into memory cells during their development, which confers on the organism an efficient protective immunity against infections with the same pathogen. The systems of the specific and non-specific immune responses are in close contact with each other, particularly via cytokines, chemokines and interferons. An immune response is generally triggered by antigens. These may be the infectious pathogens, individual protein components or sugar structures. The immune system recognizes these as foreign, and thus can distinguish between endogenous and exogenous components. However, the antigens must be of a certain size to trigger different immune responses. Molecules with a molecular mass of less than 3\u20134 kDa are usually incapable of doing that.","publish_time":"2013-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Modrow, Susanne; Falke, Dietrich; Truyen, Uwe; Sch\u00E4tzl, Hermann","journal":"Molecular Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e3bc0c71ea4326bc063f7e783013d32045ba5bbe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122902.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122902/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjszMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["innate immune system","humoral immune system","adaptive immune response","immune defence mechanisms","non-specific immune responses","different immune responses","non-adaptive immune reactions","complement system","memory cells","NK cells","B cells","dendritic cells","cellular defence system","natural killer cells","receptors","specific structures of pathogens","chemokines","interferons","foreign pathogens","infectious pathogens","cytotoxic T lymphocytes","T-helper","functions of cytokines","line of defence","antigens","systems","certain pathogen types","certain size","organism combats viral infections","sugar structures","exogenous components","acute-phase proteins","individual protein components","subset of stimulated lymphocytes","monocytes","macrophages","factors","external physical protection barriers","soluble products","skin","virus","granulocytes","close contact","efficient protective immunity","subtypes","mucous membranes","Toll","TLRs","effects","development","Molecules","molecular mass","reinfection","case","antibody","establishment","kDa","hand"],"language":"en"},

Many viruses cause self-limiting and relatively mild infections, but several, including human immunodeficiency virus and influenza virus, are responsible for millions of deaths every year throughout the world. Several factors contribute to the enormous impact that viruses have on human health. For example, there are very few therapeutic options available for the treatment of viral infections, and many of those that are available possess a limited spectrum of activity or are designed for the treatment of diseases caused by specific viruses (e.g., oseltamivir is intended for the treatment of influenza only). In addition, the rapid evolution of viruses has led to the emergence of drug-resistant strains against which no currently available therapeutics are effective. Coupled with these and other issues are the appearance of never before seen viruses and the emergence of known but previously underappreciated viruses. Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, numerous \u201Cnew\u201D viruses, including the coronaviruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the 2009 pandemic influenza A virus, and Lujo hemorrhagic fever virus, have made their debut and have proved to be formidable threats to human health. Recently, the appearance of Ebola virus (Zaire ebolavirus) in West Africa, a region that has not previously seen an outbreak of this virus, was marked by an epidemic that afflicted nearly 30,000 individuals and killed more than 11,000 of those who were infected. Most recently, the far-reaching and rapid spread of Zika virus, a mosquito-borne virus that was discovered in the 1940s in Uganda, in the Western Hemisphere has invoked considerable public and scientific attention and has given rise to perhaps the largest concerted effort by scientists to rapidly develop a vaccine to halt the transmission of a virus. Each of these points underscores the importance of further research into improved surveillance, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of viral diseases.","publish_time":"2017-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Relich, Ryan F.","journal":"Atlas of Infectious Disease Pathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/347b2a3b32f80759f283ecb007cf37ed991f6598.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122910.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122910/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjszMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","West Africa","Western Hemisphere"],"keyphrases":["influenza virus","human immunodeficiency virus","appearance of Ebola virus","specific viruses","underappreciated viruses","treatment of influenza","treatment of diseases","rapid evolution of viruses","rapid spread of Zika virus","Lujo hemorrhagic fever virus","treatment of viral infections","human health","prevention of viral diseases","pandemic influenza","available therapeutics","human infectious disease burden","therapeutic options available","Middle East respiratory syndrome","coronaviruses responsible","severe acute respiratory syndrome","applied research","emergence of drug","mild infections","SARS","Zaire ebolavirus","MERS","availability","large proportion","rise","Western Hemisphere","considerable public","improved surveillance","diagnosis","scientific attention","West Africa","resistant strains","millions of deaths","enormous impact","scientists","largest concerted effort","importance","major advances","year","century","vaccines","mosquito","formidable threats","limited spectrum of activity","Uganda","debut","addition","oseltamivir","world","beginning","region","factors","points","epidemic","transmission","individuals","example","issues","outbreak"],"language":"en"},

As the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and Europe, COPD results in a substantial and ever increasing economic and social burden [1]. Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are frequently encountered in the intensive care unit (ICU). Although there is no standardized definition, AECOPD are characterized by a significant change in patient symptoms from baseline accompanied by overall increased airway resistance [2]. These exacerbations carry a significant risk to patients, with 10 % in-hospital mortality and 1-year and 2-year all-cause mortality rates of 43 % and 49 %, respectively, in patients with hypercapnic exacerbations [3]. Other studies note in-hospital mortality rates as high as 30 % with worse outcomes associated with older age, severity of respiratory and non-respiratory organ dysfunction, and hospital length of stay [4]. Given that patients transferred to the ICU with AECOPD are at high risk for complications and adverse outcomes, early diagnosis and management are critical to improve patient outcomes and survival in this population.","publish_time":"2016-10-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kassutto, Stacey M.; Kayser, Joshua B.","journal":"Principles of Adult Surgical Critical Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97433e220f22ce9cb6f3a5ea8b3df20b6f851692.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122996.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122996/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjszNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["United States","Europe"],"keyphrases":["AECOPD","patients","progressive chronic disease","hospital mortality rates","patient outcomes","Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","adverse outcomes","severity of respiratory","worse outcomes","high risk","respiratory impairment","significant risk","year all-cause mortality rates","ICU","hypercapnic exacerbations","hospital length of stay","non-respiratory organ dysfunction","COPD results","patient symptoms","significant change","leading cause of death","baseline","management","complications","United States","Europe","early diagnosis","older age","airflow limitation","survival","increased airway resistance","intensive care unit","population","studies","social burden","standardized definition"],"language":"en"},

First of all the basic characteristics of life and the types of biological contaminants and potentially infectious agents of pharmaceutical products will be discussed: viz. prions, viruses, mollicutes, bacteria, fungi, and endotoxins. In the next section factors affecting survival and growth of micro-organisms are discussed. In addition to well-known factors such as time, temperature, and chemical and physical characteristics of the environment, attention will be paid to biofilm formation. Primary microbiological contamination is prevented by implementing an adequate microbiological quality control and quality assurance program and by following cGMPs during production. Microbiological quality control of pharmaceutical preparations and monitoring of production areas depend on the detection and quantification of micro-organisms. The classical, growth based, methods and some of the commercially available alternative methods are discussed. Understanding essential microbiological concepts is necessary in designing both microbiologically stable pharmaceutical products and ensuring an effective quality control and monitoring program within the manufacturing or preparation facility.","publish_time":"2015-02-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Doorne, Hans; Roesti, David; Staerk, Alexandra","journal":"Practical Pharmaceutics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1756c4684128ec45d03182400dceffdea3ddfdc4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123110.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123110/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs0NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Microbiological quality control of pharmaceutical preparations","adequate microbiological quality control","effective quality control","pharmaceutical microbiology","quality assurance program","stable pharmaceutical products","Microbial contamination of pharmaceutical preparations","growth of micro-organisms","essential microbiological concepts","Primary microbiological contamination","infectious agents of pharmaceutical products","monitoring program","essential properties of micro-organisms","quantification of micro-organisms","monitoring of production areas","physical characteristics","well-known factors","section factors","altered pH","basic characteristics of life","available alternative methods","temperature","types of biological contaminants","loss of consistency","bacteria","allergic reaction","infection","attention","time","turbidity","health hazard","manufacturing","fungi","viruses","mollicutes","therapeutic activity","patient","prions","environment","general introduction","decrease","detection","survival","cGMPs","preparation facility","addition","chapter"],"language":"en"},

Indeed, many bat species can be defined as synanthropic, i.e., they have a strong ecological association with humans. Bats have been observed using buildings as roosting and foraging sites, temporary shelters, for reproduction and hibernation. A synanthropic lifestyle may result in direct fitness benefits owing to energetic advantages in warmer roosts, which may ultimately lead to more rapid gestation and faster development of juveniles, or by being less exposed to natural predators in urban environments. All these benefits may allow bats to use buildings as stepping stones to exploit habitats otherwise devoid of roosting structures and may even lead to the expansion of geographic ranges. Yet, the coexistence with humans also comes with some risks. Bats may be exposed to chemical pollutants, particularly preservation chemicals used on lumber or during pest control measures. Bats may also be at risk of direct persecution or they may die accidently if trapped within buildings. In general, eviction of bats from buildings should follow the general rule of avoidance\u2013mitigation\u2013compensation. When considering conservation measures for synanthropic bats, it is most important to assess the role of the building for different life stages of bats. Construction work at buildings should be conducted in a manner that minimizes disturbance of bats. Artificial roosts can replace lost roosts, yet bats will often not accept alternative roosts. Demographic changes in human populations may lead to the abandonment of buildings, for example, in rural areas and to increased conflicts in urban areas when old buildings are replaced by new buildings or when previously unoccupied space in buildings is renovated. We advocate maintenance and enhancement of roosts for synanthropic bats, in addition to outreach and education campaigns, to improve the tolerance of humans for synanthropic bats.","publish_time":"2015-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Voigt, Christian C.; Phelps, Kendra L.; Aguirre, Luis F.; Corrie Schoeman, M.; Vanitharani, Juliet; Zubaid, Akbar","journal":"Bats in the Anthropocene: Conservation of Bats in a Changing World","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f02eac27bb8f96925adea277a27b22bf32710b77.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123121.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123121/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs0NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["synanthropic bats","eviction of bats","disturbance of bats","old buildings","new buildings","abandonment of buildings","different life stages of bats","synanthropic lifestyle","warmer roosts","lost roosts","enhancement of roosts","Artificial roosts","alternative roosts","tolerance of humans","urban areas","direct fitness benefits","urban environments","rural areas","conservation measures","general rule of avoidance","devoid of roosting structures","pest control measures","risk of direct persecution","temporary shelters","energetic advantages","conflicts","addition","foraging sites","lumber","habitats","outreach","preservation chemicals","faster development of juveniles","human populations","rapid gestation","role","reproduction","education campaigns","mitigation","natural predators","chemical pollutants","example","unoccupied space","stones","Demographic changes","compensation","hibernation","strong ecological association","maintenance","manner","thousands of years","expansion of geographic ranges","primitive huts","bat species","Construction work","coexistence","risks"],"language":"en"},

Generally, acute rhinitis is associated with environmental allergies or respiratory viral infections. Viral microbes with numerous types and subtypes can infect the respiratory epithelium of the nasal cavity in a repetitive fashion throughout the year, or during a specific period of time such as winter or fall. Among all forms of inflammatory diseases of the nasal mucosa, acute viral rhinitis (AVR) has unique epidemiological, clinical, and therapeutic characteristics. As the most prevalent type of rhinitis, AVR is also the most common form of any infectious disease of the human body. Although it is almost always self-limiting, in rare circumstances disease might progress and the clinical scenario could become complicated. Common complaints and physical findings related to AVR are similar to those seen with other types of rhinitis such as allergic, hormonal, senile, or drug induced. The clinician must interpret these symptoms and findings in the context of other parameters such as \u201Cduration, environmental factors, and patient characteristics\u201D to establish an accurate diagnose and appropriate therapeutic management. In this chapter, we aim to discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical findings, differential diagnosis, and therapeutic management of AVR in light of the recent literature knowledge.

These receptors trigger inflammatory responses, activate innate immune responses, and prime adaptive immune responses to eradicate invading microbes [1]. TLR are members of a family of pattern-recognition receptors, which recognize molecular structures of bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa (pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs), as well as endogenous structures and proteins released during inflammation (damage/danger-associated molecular patterns or DAMPs). To date, ten different TLR have been identified in humans and twelve in mice. TLR are expressed on all cells of the immune system, but also on parenchymal cells of many organs and tissues. The binding of a PAMP to a TLR results in cellular activation and initiates a variety of effector functions, including cytokine secretion, proliferation\u2019 co-stimulation or phagocyte maturation. To facilitate microbial recognition and to amplify cellular responses, certain TLR require additional proteins, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding protein (LBP), CD14, CD36 and high mobility group box-l protein (HMGB-l).

Ad12 replicates in human cells but undergoes a completely abortive cycle in Syrian hamster cells. Ad12 induces neuro-ectodermal tumors in newborn hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Each tumor cell or Ad12-transformed hamster cell carries multiple copies of integrated Ad12 DNA. Ad12 DNA usually integrates at one chromosomal site which is not specific since Ad12 DNA can integrate at many different locations in the hamster genome. Epigenetic research occupies a prominent role in tumor biology. We have been using the human Ad12 Syrian hamster cell system for the analysis of epigenetic alterations in Ad12-infected cells and in Ad12-induced hamster tumors. Virion or free intracellular Ad12 DNA remains unmethylated at CpG sites, whereas the integrated viral genomes become de novo methylated in specific patterns. Inverse correlations between promoter methylation and activity were described for the first time in this system and initiated active research in the field of DNA methylation and epigenetics. Today, promoter methylation has been recognized as an important factor in long-term genome silencing. We have also discovered that the insertion of foreign (Ad12, bacteriophage lambda, plasmid) DNA into mammalian genomes can lead to genome-wide alterations in methylation and transcription patterns in the recipient genomes. This concept has been verified recently in a pilot study with human cells which had been rendered transgenomic for a 5.6 kbp bacterial plasmid. Currently, we study epigenetic effects on cellular methylation and transcription patterns in Ad12-infected cells and in Ad12-induced hamster tumor cells. These epigenetic alterations are considered crucial elements in (viral) oncogenesis.","publish_time":"2017-05-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Doerfler, Walter","journal":"Epigenetics of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/554bb38256b103d739ec821a01ff15b864b0b723.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120421.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120421/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ad12 replicates","Ad12-infected cells","Ad12-induced hamster tumor cells","Ad12-induced hamster tumors","free intracellular Ad12 DNA","human Ad12 Syrian hamster cell system","human cells","multiple copies of integrated Ad12 DNA","Syrian hamster cells","hamster genome","field of DNA methylation","promoter methylation","cellular methylation","Epigenetic research","analysis of epigenetic alterations","integrated viral genomes","transcription patterns","epigenetic effects","specific patterns","tumor biology","genome-wide alterations","mammalian genomes","human adenovirus type","viral oncology","recipient genomes","long-term genome silencing","molecular biology","active research","pilot study","neuro-ectodermal tumors","kbp bacterial plasmid","CpG sites","newborn hamsters","bacteriophage lambda","basic mechanisms","abortive cycle","activity","crucial elements","transgenomic","prominent role","novo","Mesocricetus auratus","important factor","different locations","laboratory","Inverse correlations","Virion","chromosomal site","insertion of foreign","oncogenesis","time","epigenetics","concept"],"language":"en"},

Pathogens more likely to be diagnosed using lung biopsy for which there are characteristic pathologic changes are highlighted in this chapter and listed in Table 4.1.","publish_time":"2018-09-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Chen; Myers, Jeffrey L.","journal":"Atlas of Lung Pathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0859c2960d439ee53036d78cc5631ace21c4ff2d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120464.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120464/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Lung biopsy","common lung infections","unusual infections","Pulmonary infections","common respiratory viruses","pyogenic bacteria","microbiologic studies","conventional microbiologic methods","Streptococcus pneumoniae","immunocompetent hosts","cultures","wide range of pathogenic microorganisms","treatment strategies","characteristic pathologic changes","serology tests","chapter","fungi","mycoplasma","life-threatening pneumonia","Patients","parasites","Table","Pathogens","diagnoses"],"language":"en"},

In a poorly-infrastructure country such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), with inadequate health staff and laboratories, it is difficult to respond rapidly to an epidemic, especially in rural areas. As the DRC\u2019s health system has three levels (peripheral, regional and national), from the production of health data at the peripheral level to the national level that makes the decision, meantime the disease can spread to many people. Lack of communication between health centres of the same health zone and Health zones of the same Health Provincial Division does not contribute to the regional response. This article, an extended version of [1], proposes a well elaborated solution track to deal with this problem by using an agent-centric approach to study by simulation how to improve the process. A new experiment is described by arranging twenty-eight health zones of Kinshasa to show how their collaboration can provide unique health data source for all stakeholders and help reducing disease propagation. It concerns also 47 health centres, 1 medical laboratory, 1 Provincial Health Division and 4 Rapid Riposte Teams. The simulation data, provided by Provincial Health Division of Kinshasa, concerned cholera outbreak from January to December 2017. The interaction between these agents demonstrated that Health Zone Agent can automatically alert his neighbours whenever he encountered a confirmed case of an outbreak. This action can reduce disease propagation as population will be provided with prevention measures. These interactions between agents have provided models to propose to the current system in order to find out the best that can help reducing decision time.","publish_time":"2019-07-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tshilenge Mfumu, Jean-Claude; Mercier, Annabelle; Occello, Michel; Verdier, Christine","journal":"Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36db93a2311b6bac1f434724834f643ae8258902.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120616.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120616/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsxNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DRC","Provincial Health Division","Rapid Riposte","Health Zone Agent"],"locations":["Democratic Republic of Congo","Kinshasa"],"keyphrases":["health centres","Health Provincial Division","production of health data","Health Zone Agent","health zones of Kinshasa","DRC\u2019s health system","Provincial Health Division of Kinshasa","inadequate health staff","inefficiency of health structures","unique health data source","simulation data","disease propagation","peripheral level","national level","agents","help","current system","cholera outbreak","decision time","regional response","agent-centric approach","stakeholders","levels","medical laboratory","population","collaboration","Democratic Republic of Congo","sub-Saharan countries","past decade","Rapid Riposte Teams","problem","models","neighbours","study","laboratories","epidemic","infrastructure country","best","order","confirmed case","outbreaks","Lack of communication","elaborated solution track","infectious diseases","article","extended version","rural areas","prevention measures","interactions","new experiment","process","people"],"language":"en"},

It can be caused by a constellation of disorders which presents with hemoptysis, anemia, and diffuse alveolar infiltrates. Respiratory failure from DAH can be so severe that it has been called an ARDS mimic/imitator. Early recognition is crucial because prompt diagnosis and treatment are required for survival. DAH should be distinguished from other causes of pulmonary hemorrhage caused by localized pulmonary abnormalities and the bronchial circulation. Early bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is generally required to confirm the diagnosis of DAH and rule out infection. Progressively bloody bronchoalveolar lavage samples can distinguish DAH. Systemic vasculitis is one of the most common causes of DAH and can be pathologically defined by the presence of cellular inflammation, vessel destruction, tissue necrosis, and eventually, organ dysfunction. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents remain the gold standard for the treatment. The following case illustrates a patient who was dependent on dialysis, then presented with hemoptysis. Bronchoscopy demonstrated progressively bloody bronchoalveolar lavage samples consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Serologic testing was consistent with microscopic polyangiitis.

The supply of active exogenous protein requires its production on large scale to fulfill the growing demand. The process is complex, requiring higher protein expression, purification, and processing. Each product needs unique settings or standardizations for large-scale production and purification. As only large-scale production can fulfill the growing demand, thus it needs to be cost-effective. The tools of genetic engineering are utilized to produce the proteins of human origin in bacteria, fungi, insect, or mammalian host. Usage of recombinant DNA technology for large-scale production of proteins requires ample amount of time, labor, and resources, but it also offers many opportunities for economic growth.

This latter problem has increasingly serious ramifications for conservation efforts, as growing numbers of ecotourists and researchers serve as potential vectors of disease. Here, we present an analysis of major cross-species transmission events between human and nonhuman primates. In particular, we consider HIV and malaria as case studies in which nonhuman primate pathogens emerged and became permanent fixtures in human populations. The human practices that facilitate such events are considered, as well as the evolutionary consequences of these events. In addition, we describe human-to-nonhuman primate transmission events and discuss the potential of human pathogens to adapt to nonhuman primate hosts. The topic of emerging infections is addressed, in both human and nonhuman species, in light of changing patterns of contact and novel adaptations on the part of pathogens and hosts.","publish_time":"2013-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harper, Kristin N.; Zuckerman, Molly K.; Turner, Bethany L.; Armelagos, George J.","journal":"Primates, Pathogens, and Evolution","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/577c53f86addf224a1092bd2ca25766a2ef790e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120702.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120702/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsxOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nonhuman primate pathogens","nonhuman species","nonhuman primate transmission events","nonhuman primates","potential of human pathogens","nonhuman primate hosts","nonhuman primate origin","potential pathogens","human populations","human practices","analysis of major cross-species transmission events","pathogen transmission","humans","potential vectors of disease","conservation efforts","researchers","light of changing patterns of contact","case studies","growing numbers of ecotourists","permanent fixtures","novel adaptations","malaria","direction","serious ramifications","HIV","problem","world","topic of emerging infections","evolutionary consequences","addition"],"language":"en"},

ANV has also been detected in turkeys, ducklings, pigeons, and guinea fowl; and TAstrovirus-2-like viruses have also been found in guinea fowl. Astroviruses are commonly associated with enteric disease syndromes in poultry including runting-stunting syndrome of broilers (RSS), poult enteritis complex or syndrome (PEC or PES), poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS), and enteritis in guinea fowl. The molecular characterization of the different avian astroviruses shows great genetic variability among each type, and this variability influences the ability to detect these viruses by molecular and serological techniques.

In addition, the evidence so far indicates that the incorporation of these principles into a MTP will also contribute to less transfused units by minimizing variability of transfusion practices. Importantly, fewer units transfused will contribute to fewer complications associated with transfusions. These conclusions will need to be verified, especially with regard to the effect of MTPs incorporating higher ratios of FFP:PRBC:platelets effect on varying mechanism of injury, the timing of transfusions, and the number of units actually transfused.

Given these important roles, zinc has a sophisticated transport system to regulate its homeostasis. Determination of zinc status, however, is difficult to determine as serum levels are closely maintained and are not an accurate reflection of total body zinc or metabolism at the organ level. Fortunately, the discovery of zinc-specific fluorescent dyes has allowed for a much better assessment of zinc status in the respiratory system and has revealed that alcoholism perturbs this highly developed zinc metabolism such that its distribution to the lung and alveolar space is significantly decreased. As a result, this pulmonary zinc deficiency impairs function in the alveolar macrophage, which is the primary host immune cell within the lower airway. Experimental models have demonstrated that correction of this zinc deficiency restores immune function to the alveolar macrophage as best reflected by improved bacterial clearance in response to infection. While the precise mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced zinc deficiency are still under investigation, there is experimental evidence of several important connections with granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor and oxidative stress, suggesting that alteration of zinc homeostasis may be a fundamental mechanism underlying the cellular pathology seen in the alcohol lung phenotype. This chapter reviews zinc homeostasis and offers insight into our understanding of zinc deficiency in the setting of alcoholism and the potential of zinc as a therapeutic modality in the vulnerable alcoholic host.","publish_time":"2013-08-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mehta, Ashish J.; Guidot, David M.","journal":"Alcohol Use Disorders and the Lung","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0127a56b27dc0d30b3513b4f50875abc0193e2af.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120872.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120872/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsyNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["potential of zinc","discovery of zinc","understanding of zinc deficiency","pulmonary zinc deficiency","alteration of zinc homeostasis","developed zinc metabolism","Determination of zinc status","alcohol-induced zinc deficiency","chapter reviews zinc homeostasis","better assessment of zinc status","accurate reflection of total body zinc","immune function","alveolar macrophage","macrophage colony","alveolar space","primary host immune cell","alcohol lung phenotype","human body","important connections","setting of alcoholism","important roles","respiratory system","experimental evidence","Experimental models","sophisticated transport system","vulnerable alcoholic host","enzymatic activity","numerous biological processes","insight","protein synthesis","presence","granulocyte","therapeutic modality","distribution","cellular pathology","factor","oxidative stress","fundamental mechanism","investigation","correction","lower airway","precise mechanisms","abundant trace elements","specific fluorescent dyes","bacterial clearance","wound healing","organ level","response","infection","result","serum levels"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, we propose a novel lumping scheme based on a partitioning of the nodes. By imposing different types of counting abstractions, we obtain coarse-grained Markov models with a natural MPM representation that approximate the original systems. This makes it possible to transfer the rich pool of approximation techniques developed for MPMs to the computational analysis of complex networks\u2019 dynamics.

Throughout history, those caring for the injured, dying and dead put themselves at risk of harm, infection or contamination. Recent events include the 2014\u20132016 infectious outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa and the targeting of health facilities in the conflict in Syria. Decisions by HCWs to care for others in the face of such risks have been lauded as heroic whether undertaken for personal moral reasons or in response to an ethical duty to care. However, some have questioned whether such a duty to care is ethically obligatory in the face of some CBRNE events. Ethical analysis of the SARS outbreak found that additional ethical reflection was needed on HCWs\u2019 obligations during CBRNE events. The ethical arguments used to justify the duty to care are reviewed in this chapter. However, other duties exist for HCWs which may conflict with the duty to care. The World Health Organization\u2019s guidance on ethics in pandemics notes that the duty to provide care in pandemics is not unlimited, and that employers and governments have reciprocal obligations to provide training and protective equipment to HCWs during CBRNE. Empirical research raises questions about whether health care organisations are adequately prepared for CBRNE, particularly for the ethical decision-making that will be required. Rather than taking a regulatory or legal approach to this issue, this chapter will argue that the ethical virtues of courage and volunteerism should be fostered in HCW training. In keeping with a virtue ethics approach, leadership takes on an important role in ethical decision-making, as well as praising those who respond to CBRNE by caring for others in spite of the personal risks and their conflicting obligations.","publish_time":"2019-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u2019Math\u00FAna, D\u00F3nal P.","journal":"Ethics and Law for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear \u0026 Explosive Crises","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e294d06f78dfc78efb03a686f61f138d38751d84.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120971.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120971/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjszMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","World Health Organization"],"locations":["West Africa","Syria"],"keyphrases":["ethical duty","HCWs","CBRNE events","ethical decision-making","health care organisations","Health care workers","Ethical analysis","ethical arguments","additional ethical reflection","ethical virtues of courage","Recent events","targeting of health facilities","reciprocal obligations","conflicting obligations","pandemics","personal risks","chapter","face","World Health Organization\u2019s guidance","virtue ethics approach","SARS outbreak","legal approach","HCW training","personal moral reasons","infectious outbreak of Ebola virus disease","West Africa","protective equipment","chemical","leadership","governments","volunteerism","explosive","questions","response","important role","risk of harm","brunt of injuries","employers","issue","Empirical research","dead","infection","contamination","Syria","spite","praising","history","Decisions","duties"],"language":"en"},

The pathophysiology of this anemia includes decreased production of erythropoietin (EPO), impaired bone marrow response to erythropoietin, and reduced red cell survival.","publish_time":"2009-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marik, Paul Ellis","journal":"Handbook of Evidence-Based Critical Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a81bba78277d1f60d23c49b476c121548dd4a8c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120999.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120999/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjszNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ill patients","development of anemia","etiology of anemia","maintenance of anemia","outcome of ICU patients","blood transfusions","gastrointestinal blood loss","Red cell production","decreased production of erythropoietin","red cell survival","day of ICU admission","subnormal hemoglobin","EPO","critical illness","impaired bone marrow response","multi-factorial","surgical procedures","Repeated phlebotomy","current guidelines","pathophysiology","half"],"language":"en"},

Additionally, HIV-infected individuals are susceptible to a number of pulmonary diseases for unknown reasons. Alcohol, the most commonly abused drug in the world, continues to exact an enormous toll on morbidity and mortality in individuals living with HIV. Chronic alcohol abuse has been shown to affect lung immunity, resulting in significant lung injury. There is a paucity of literature on the additive effects of HIV and alcohol, two diseases of immune senescence, in the lung. This chapter begins by discussing the latest literature evaluating the epidemiology of HIV, alcohol use, and lung health focusing on two prevalent infections, tuberculosis and pneumococcal pneumonia. In parallel, we discuss the interactions of alcohol and HIV on the risk for acute lung injury and subsequent morbidity and mortality. We then discuss the pathophysiology of how these two diseases of immune dysfunction affect the lung, with a focus on the oxidative stress, alveolar macrophage host immune capacity, and immunomodulatory role of zinc in the airway. Finally, we review the latest literature on how HIV and alcohol affect other pulmonary disorders including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, and lung cancer.","publish_time":"2013-08-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cribbs, Sushma K.; Rimland, David","journal":"Alcohol Use Disorders and the Lung","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c106dd0778c3b39ad8e477933fbcb869922f01cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121129.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121129/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs0MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung disease","lung health","lung immunity","lung cancer","HIV-infected individuals","acute lung injury","significant lung injury","epidemiology of HIV","alcohol use","interactions of alcohol","additive effects of HIV","Chronic alcohol abuse","number of pulmonary diseases","pulmonary hypertension","pulmonary disorders","latest literature","diseases of immune senescence","diseases of immune dysfunction","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","mortality","paucity of literature","prevalent infections","viral infections","subsequent morbidity","alveolar macrophage host immune capacity","oxidative stress","immunomodulatory role of zinc","risk","leading cause of death","human immunodeficiency virus type","tuberculosis","pneumococcal pneumonia","focus","enormous toll","unknown reasons","antiretroviral therapy","world","airway","influenza","pneumococcus","abused drug","chapter","pathophysiology"],"language":"en"},

Control measures must be taken based on the principles of biosecurity and disease management and at the same time making public aware of the precautionary measures at the verge of outbreak. Creation of protection and surveillance zones, various vaccination strategies viz. routine, preventive, emergency, mass and targeted vaccination programmes using live, inactivated and recombinant vaccines are the common strategies adopted in different parts of the globe. The new generation vaccines include recombinant vaccines and recombinant fusion vaccine. The pro-poor disease control programmes, giving compensation and subsidies to the farmers along with effective and efficient Veterinary Services forms integral part of control of HPAI. Following biosecurity principles and vaccination forms integral part of control programme against swine and equine influenza as well. Use of neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (Zanamivir and Oseltamivir) for the treatment of human influenza has been widely accepted worldwide. The threat of increasing resistance of the flu viruses to these antivirals has evoked interest in the development of novel antiviral drugs for influenza virus such as inhibitors of cellular factors and host signalling cascades, cellular miRNAs, siRNA and innate immune peptides (defensins and cathelicidins). Commercial licensed inactivated vaccines for humans against influenza A and B viruses are available consisting of three influenza viruses: influenza type A subtype H3N2, influenza type A subtype H1N1 (seasonal) virus strain and influenza type B virus strain. As per WHO, use of tetravaccine consisting of antigens of influenza virus serotypes H3N2, H1N1, B and H5 is the most promising method to control influenza pandemic. All healthy children in many countries are required to be vaccinated between 6 and 59 months of age. The seasonal vaccines currently used in humans induce strain-specific humoral immunity as the antibodies. Universal influenza virus vaccines containing the relatively conserved ectodomain of M2 (M2e), M1, HA fusion peptide and stalk domains, NA, NP alone or in combination have been developed which have been shown to induce cross-protection. The T cell-based vaccines are another recent experimental approach that has been shown to elicit broad-spectrum heterosubtypic immunity in the host. As far as HPAI is concerned, various pandemic preparedness strategies have been documented.","publish_time":"2014-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kapoor, Sanjay; Dhama, Kuldeep","journal":"Insight into Influenza Viruses of Animals and Humans","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f769e174f8d0996239b3eb5d1d348042e6dbab4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121144.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121144/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs0MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPAI","Commercial","NP"],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["influenza viruses","influenza pandemic","equine influenza","Universal influenza virus vaccines","influenza type B virus strain","recombinant vaccines","control of HPAI","pathogenic avian influenza","treatment of human influenza","seasonal vaccines","antigens of influenza virus serotypes H3N2","Control measures","new generation vaccines","B viruses","Commercial licensed inactivated vaccines","T cell-based vaccines","various vaccination strategies","pro-poor disease control programmes","vaccination forms integral","humans","subtype H3N2","targeted vaccination programmes","subtype H1N1","recombinant fusion vaccine","common strategies","flu viruses","various pandemic preparedness strategies","principles of biosecurity","biosecurity principles","strain-specific humoral immunity","inhibitors of cellular factors","cellular miRNAs","disease management","precautionary measures","Creation of protection","cross-protection","host signalling cascades","HA fusion peptide","public health apprehension","broad-spectrum heterosubtypic immunity","siRNA","mass","preventive","emergency","innate immune peptides","stalk domains","surveillance zones","M1","M2e","compensation","efficient Veterinary Services","development of novel antiviral drugs","farmers","defensins","time","Zanamivir","Oseltamivir","subsidies","H5","conserved ectodomain of M2","swine","promising method","recent experimental approach","Asia","regional poultry industry","cathelicidins","NP","different parts","threat of increasing resistance","steps","verge of outbreak","antibodies","antivirals","neuraminidase","outbreaks","tetravaccine","healthy children","countries","globe","combination","months of age"],"language":"en"},

These complications may be classified into infectious versus noninfectious, and early versus late based on the time of occurrence post-transplant. Thus, exclusion of infectious etiologies is the first step in the diagnoses of pulmonary complications. Late onset noninfectious pulmonary complications typically occur 3 months post-transplant. Bronchiolitis obliterans is the major contributor to late-onset pulmonary complications, and its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and current therapeutic approaches are discussed. Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome is another important complication which usually occurs early, although its onset may be delayed. Organizing pneumonia is important to recognize due to its responsiveness to corticosteroids. Other late onset noninfectious pulmonary complications discussed here include pulmonary venoocclusive disease, pulmonary cytolytic thrombi, pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis, thoracic air leak syndrome, and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders.","publish_time":"2019-07-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dsouza, Kevin; Pywell, Cameron; Thannickal, Victor J.","journal":"Oncologic Critical Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2250361fa963f4ff0f25744faf5a310966dd93aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123191.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123191/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs0OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSCT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["late-onset pulmonary complications","Late onset noninfectious pulmonary complications","diagnoses of pulmonary complications","pulmonary cytolytic thrombi","pulmonary venoocclusive disease","HSCT","Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome","months post-transplant","time of occurrence post-transplant","important complication","established therapeutic modality","current therapeutic approaches","thoracic air leak syndrome","exclusion of infectious etiologies","pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis","major contributor","clinical presentation","number of malignant","pathogenesis","posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders","step","Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","Bronchiolitis obliterans","increased mortality","nonmalignant conditions","morbidity","responsiveness","corticosteroids"],"language":"en"},

Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) have the capacity to spread rapidly from one region of the world to another, within a very short time, due to world travel and increased global interdependence. The impact of this varies from one region to another. Resource poor countries suffer the most due to an already high disease burden, poor infrastructures, lack of clean, potable water and sanitation, as well as an acute shortage of qualified health personnel to manage, control and contain the crisis/spread. Poor and marginalized communities are the most vulnerable because infectious diseases cause not only suffering and death, but also severe economic hardship. The outbreak of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in the developing world has shown the extent to which economic and social conditions can affect vulnerable populations. These socio-economic, cultural and environmental conditions accelerate the spread of, and exacerbate the negative impact of emerging pathogens. This chapter will undertake an analysis of the trend in global emerging pathogens, their economic impact, the global vulnerability status and ethical implications.","publish_time":"2019-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tosam, Mbih Jerome; Ambe, J.

Further studies are needed to define the epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of these infections; this data will help inform decisions regarding development of antiviral therapy and infection prevention strategies.","publish_time":"2016-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Waghmare, Alpana; Boeckh, Michael","journal":"Transplant Infections","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/77cd45ecb2219deb6da525c81e3f055aabddff41.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123292.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123292/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs1NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["common respiratory viruses","Respiratory viral infections","clinical outcomes","immunocompromised population","significant clinical impact","data","immunocompromised hosts","upper respiratory tract of hematopoietic cell transplant","lung transplant recipients","significant cause of morbidity","development of antiviral therapy","evidence","mortality","EVs","infection prevention strategies","bocavirus","coronaviruses","decisions","epidemiology","risk factors","characterization","enteroviruses","Newer molecular detection assays","Human rhinoviruses","CoVs","pulmonary disease","studies"],"language":"en"},

The emerging evidence for a role of CCR2 and CCR5 receptors in human inflammatory diseases led to a growing interest in CCR2- and CCR5-selective antagonists. In this review, we focus on the recent development of selective CCR2/CCR5 receptor ligands and dual antagonists. Several compounds targeting CCR2, e.g., INCB8761 and MK0812, were developed as promising candidates for clinical trials, but failed to show clinical efficacy as presumed from preclinical models. The role of CCR5 receptors as the second co-receptor for the HIV-host cell fusion led to the development of various CCR5-selective ligands. Maraviroc is the first CCR5-targeting drug for the treatment of HIV-1 infections on the market. The role of CCR5 receptors in the progression of inflammatory processes fueled the use of CCR5 antagonists for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Unfortunately, the use of maraviroc for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis failed due to its inefficacy. Some of the ligands, e.g., TAK-779 and TAK-652, were also found to be dual antagonists of CCR2 and CCR5 receptors. The fact that CCR2 and CCR5 receptor antagonists contribute to the treatment of inflammatory diseases renders the development of dual antagonists as promising novel therapeutic strategy.","publish_time":"2014-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Junker, Anna; Kokornaczyk, Artur Kamil; Strunz, Ann Kathrin; W\u00FCnsch, Bernhard","journal":"Chemokines","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6c2b70378ceb955eef5dcbb10bd65f91e32c8dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123309.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123309/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs1NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CCR5 receptor antagonists","CCR5-selective antagonists","use of CCR5 antagonists","CCR5 receptor ligands","role of CCR5 receptors","dual antagonists of CCR2","role of CCR2","development of various CCR5-selective ligands","development of dual antagonists","recent development of selective CCR2","chemokine receptor","treatment of inflammatory diseases","co-receptor","treatment of HIV","treatment of rheumatoid arthritis","progression of inflammatory processes","human inflammatory diseases","use of maraviroc","TAK","promising candidates","clinical trials","clinical efficacy","promising novel therapeutic strategy","HIV-host cell fusion","important mediators of leukocyte trafficking","MK0812","fact","preclinical models","INCB8761","infections","emerging evidence","drug","market","inefficacy","compounds","review"],"language":"en"},

Medicines manufactured in the modern era are associated with major controversies such as non\u2013target specificity, resistance, repeated administration, immune rejection, and other adverse effects on the body. Thus, there is a great need to find drugs that do not raise the aforementioned issues. Nature is an excellent hub providing a diverse range of phytoconstituents that open the way to phototherapeutics, which need a scientific path to deliver the active elements in a supported way to increase patient compliance and reduce the need for repeated administration. To discover a novel phytochemical as a lead compound for a therapeutic purpose is a real challenge. In former times, drug discovery was a complex process, as it took several years to find a lead compound for use against a particular disease. Nowadays, however, virtual screening methods have been developed, which are target specific, time consuming, and cost effective. To avoid increased and repeated administration of a drug, nanosized drug delivery systems for herbal drugs have been developed to enhance the activity and overcome problems associated with synthetic medicines. This review summarizes three main fields: drug discovery, docking for drug design, and last\u2014but not least\u2014drug delivery systems. Nowadays, nanobased drug delivery systems are in demand for delivery of herbal medicines used for therapeutic purposes. Herbonanoceuticals\u2014herbal drugs of a nanosize\u2014have better remedial value and fewer detrimental effects than modern medicines.

Almost 30 years later, China\u2019s 2009 health reforms were a response to deep inequity in access to affordable, quality healthcare resulting from three decades of marketization, including de facto privatization of the health sector, along with decentralized accountability and, to a large degree, financing of public health services. The reforms are built on earlier, equity-enhancing initiatives, particularly the reintroduction of social health insurance since 2003, and are planned to continue until 2020, with gradual achievement of overarching objectives on universal and equitable access to health services. The second phase of reform commenced in early 2012. China\u2019s health reforms remain encouragingly specific but not prescriptive on strategy; set in the decentralized governance structure, they avoid the issue of reliance on local government support for the national equity objective, leaving the detailed design of health service financing, human resource distribution and accountability, essential drug lists and application of clinical care pathways, etc. to local health authorities answerable to local government, not the Ministry of Health. Community engagement in government processes, including in provision of healthcare, remains limited.

Acute respiratory failure in these patients is a threatening event, with a very poor outcome, particularly when mechanical ventilation (MV) is required. For many years, oncologists and intensivists had a pessimistic vision of the dismal outcome of those hematological patients requiring admission to the ICU. The bleak experience in this population led some authors to suggest early withdrawal of support, or even withholding the option of mechanical ventilation altogether. However, over the last years this vision seems to be changing. Great progress has been made in stem cell transplantation that can be ascribed to a better understanding of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system for donor selection, more effective and less toxic immunosupression for prevention and treatment of graft-versus host disease (GVHD), and significant advances in infectious disease therapy. Also improvements in ventilatory and supportive care, such as the early implantation of noninvasive ventilation (NIV), may avoid intubation in a significant percentage of patients suffering from acute respiratory failure. As a result of all this, the proportion of both hematological patients requiring management in the ICU and those requiring MV is decreasing. Also the survival rate of HSCT recipients admitted to the ICU has been steadily improving. In this chapter we will report on the epidemiology of acute respiratory failure in patients with hematological malignancies.","publish_time":"2010-08-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Agust\u00ED, Carlos; Lucena, Carmen; Torres, Antoni","journal":"Pulmonary Involvement in Patients with Hematological Malignancies","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7faa98d247154196c167c8b5e4efbb7679837da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123526.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123526/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs3MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","MV","HSCT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hematological patients","ICU","significant percentage of patients","hematological malignancies","epidemiology of acute respiratory failure","hematological stem cell transplant","significant advances","admission","option of mechanical ventilation","years","MV","early implantation of noninvasive ventilation","stem cell transplantation","poor outcome","dismal outcome","supportive care","host disease","pessimistic vision","intensive care unit","early withdrawal of support","infectious disease therapy","survival rate of HSCT recipients","system","human leukocyte antigen","HLA","treatment of graft","toxic immunosupression","prevention","donor selection","authors","NIV","GVHD","better understanding","population","oncologists","intensivists","threatening event","proportion","Pulmonary complications","intubation","management","improvements","ventilatory","bleak experience","Great progress","result","chapter"],"language":"en"},

Today, a large share of enzyme products is manufactured using recombinant microorganisms. This chapter focuses on major industrial fungal species belonging to the ascomycetes like Aspergillus niger, A. oryzae, and Trichoderma reesei. Many of the commercially available recombinant enzymes are manufactured using fungi. Examples of fungal enzymes used in food products are described. The enzyme industry is to a large extent cost-driven, so the enzyme product needs to meet strict COGS (cost of goods sold) targets. Therefore, the cell factory must be very efficient to produce the enzyme in high titers and efficiently utilize raw materials. Secondly, it must be designed for a robust and generic fermentation process. When developing fungal hosts for enzyme production, several properties of the system need to be considered relating to efficiency of the cell factory, purity of the product, and safety of both the cell factory and the product. Purity is secured by engineering of the cell factory, and properties related to safety must also be engineered into the fungal host. The methods used for strain improvement are continuously being developed to increase yields and are described herein. More automation using precision tools for modification of the genome (i.e., CRISPR) and low-cost sequencing have vastly expanded the possibilities and enabled fast strain development. Using systems biology approaches, better understanding of cellular processes is now possible enabling advanced engineering of fungal cell factories. Surprisingly, a survey of innovation in the field revealed a decrease in the number of patent applications in recent years. Finally, the requirements for enzyme approval, especially in food and feed, have increased significantly worldwide in the last few years. A description of the regulatory landscape and its challenges in food and feed is included.","publish_time":"2019-09-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arnau, Jos\u00E9; Yaver, Debbie; Hjort, Carsten M.","journal":"Grand Challenges in Fungal Biotechnology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e650e14d444c3047eeacf6446d607a0b3b8507c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123961.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123961/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs5ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell factory","enzyme production","enzyme industry","enzyme approval","enzyme product needs","fungal hosts","Examples of fungal enzymes","advanced engineering of fungal cell factories","large share of enzyme products","food products","Industrial enzymes","major industrial fungal species","properties","available recombinant enzymes","recombinant microorganisms","purity","safety","feed","large extent cost","cost of goods","recent years","strain improvement","fast strain development","better understanding of cellular processes","ascomycetes","strict COGS","number of patent applications","oryzae","decrease","systems biology approaches","possibilities","high titers","genome","precision tools","modification","field","Aspergillus niger","regulatory landscape","challenges","chapter","generic fermentation process","CRISPR","low-cost sequencing","automation","raw materials","fungi","efficiency","survey of innovation","Trichoderma reesei","description","methods","targets","requirements","century","yields"],"language":"en"},

Vaccines have emerged as effective treatments to prevent or reduce the burdens of already developed diseases. This is achieved by means of activating various components of the immune system to generate systemic inflammatory reactions targeting infectious agents or diseased cells for control/elimination. DNA virus-based genetic vaccines gained significant attention in the past decades owing to the development of DNA manipulation technologies, which allowed engineering of recombinant viral vectors encoding sequences for foreign antigens or their immunogenic epitopes as well as various immunomodulatory molecules. Despite tremendous progress in the past 50 years, many hurdles still remain for achieving the full clinical potential of viral-vectored vaccines. This chapter will present the evolution of vaccines from \u201Clive\u201D or \u201Cattenuated\u201D first-generation agents to recombinant DNA and viral-vectored vaccines. Particular emphasis will be given to human adenovirus (Ad) for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. Ad biological properties related to vaccine development will be highlighted along with their advantages and potential hurdles to be overcome. In particular, we will discuss (1) genetic modifications in the Ad capsid protein to reduce the intrinsic viral immunogenicity, (2) antigen capsid incorporation for effective presentation of foreign antigens to the immune system, (3) modification of the hexon and fiber capsid proteins for Ad liver de-targeting and selective retargeting to cancer cells, (4) Ad-based vaccines carrying \u201Carming\u201D transgenes with immunostimulatory functions as immune adjuvants, and (5) oncolytic Ad vectors as a new therapeutic approach against cancer. Finally, the combination of adenoviral vectors with other non-adenoviral vector systems, the prime/boost strategy of immunization, clinical trials involving Ad-based vaccines, and the perspectives for the field development will be discussed.","publish_time":"2014-07-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Borovjagin, Anton V.; Gomez-Gutierrez, Jorge G.; Shirwan, Haval; Matthews, Qiana L.","journal":"Novel Technologies for Vaccine Development","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e735e575e537ee76608d6f4950833a7ed2f07acc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121347.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121347/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs1MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ad-based vaccines","genetic vaccines","therapeutic vaccines","viral-vectored vaccines","evolution of vaccines","Ad capsid protein","oncolytic Ad vectors","Ad biological properties","Ad liver de-targeting","clinical potential of viral","engineering of recombinant viral vectors","recombinant DNA","cancer cells","immune system","vaccine development","development of prophylactic","field development","development of DNA manipulation technologies","infectious agents","combination of adenoviral vectors","intrinsic viral immunogenicity","immune adjuvants","DNA virus","infectious diseases","potential hurdles","effective presentation of foreign antigens","fiber capsid proteins","antigen capsid incorporation","diseased cells","first-generation agents","clinical trials","past decades","genetic modifications","effective treatments","various components","Particular emphasis","new therapeutic approach","various immunomodulatory molecules","non-adenoviral vector systems","systemic inflammatory reactions","transgenes","selective retargeting","sequences","boost strategy of immunization","immunogenic epitopes","arming","significant attention","great global health impacts","immunostimulatory functions","control","hexon","society","years","human adenovirus","perspectives","tremendous progress","elimination","burdens","advantages","chapter"],"language":"en"},

Contrasting the meaning(s) of the concept of \u201Cvirulence\u201D in molecular pathology and evolutionary ecology, we review different explanations proposed as to why, and under what conditions, parasites cause harm to their host: whereas the former uses molecular techniques and concepts to explain changes and the nature of virulence seen as a categorical trait, the latter conceptualizes virulence as a phenotypic quantitative trait (usually related to a reduction in the host\u2019s fitness). After describing the biology of emerging influenza viruses we illustrate how the ecological and the molecular approaches provide distinct (but incomplete) explanations of the 1918\u201319 influenza pandemic. We suggest that an evolutionary approach is necessary to understand the dynamics of disease transmission but that a broader understanding of virulence will ultimately benefit from articulating and integrating the ecological dynamics with cellular mechanisms of virulence. Both ecological and functional perspectives on host-pathogens\u2019 interactions are required to answer the opening question but also to devise appropriate health-care measures in order to prevent (and predict?) future influenza pandemics and other emerging threats. Finally, the difficult co-existence of distinct explanatory frameworks reflects the fact that scientists can work on a same problem using various methodologies but it also highlights the enduring tension between two scientific styles of practice in biomedicine.","publish_time":"2014-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"M\u00E9thot, Pierre-Olivier; Alizon, Samuel","journal":"Classification, Disease and Evidence","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c8092cc2eac8542e04678321190ba5ed4e91cd3d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121464.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121464/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs1ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nature of virulence","ecological dynamics","evolutionary ecology","evolutionary biology","broader understanding of virulence","cellular mechanisms of virulence","molecular approaches","molecular pathology","molecular techniques","evolutionary approach","biology of emerging influenza viruses","host-pathogens\u2019 interactions","future influenza pandemics","parasites cause harm","public health","emerging threats","recurrent question","categorical trait","opening question","different explanations","dynamics of disease transmission","phenotypic quantitative trait","appropriate health-care measures","difficult co-existence of distinct explanatory frameworks","functional perspectives","changes","scientific styles of practice","biomedical sciences","enduring tension","scientists","order","fact","concepts","problem","biomedicine","reduction","epidemiology","implications","conditions","articulating","various methodologies","host\u2019s fitness","meaning"],"language":"en"},

Being the first database of its scale in the immune epitope domain, it was necessary for the IEDB to devise an adequate data structure at the outset of the project with the goal that it should be capable of capturing the context of immune recognition. Early on, it became readily apparent that an unambiguous description of the information being captured is imperative for consistent curation across journal articles and among curators. Accordingly, an initial ontology was developed (Sathiamurthy et al. 2005) based upon consultations with domain experts and guidance from expert ontologists.

Mature nsPs are generated by precise processing of these polyproteins. Both the precursors and mature nsPs are essential for CHIKV replication. Similar to other alphaviruses, CHIKV nsPs not only perform virus RNA replication but are also crucial for other activities essential for virus infection and pathogenesis. Thus far the best-studied CHIKV ns-protein is nsP2, for which protease, NTPase, RNA triphosphatase, and RNA helicase activities have been demonstrated. In addition, nsP2 is crucial for shut-off of host cell transcription and translation and it counteracts cellular antiviral responses. Compared to their homologues from the well-studied Sindbis and Semliki Forest viruses, CHIKV nsP1, nsP3, and nsP4 have been subjected to only few studies. Nevertheless, there are strong indirect pieces of evidence indicating that these CHIKV proteins have the same enzymatic activities as their counterparts in the other alphaviruses. Information concerning the specific interaction of CHIKV nsPs with host components is beginning to emerge.

When sepsis is complicated by multi-organ failure, it is regarded as severe, while septic shock is diagnosed when sepsis coexists with a state of acute circulatory failure (Levy et al. 2003).","publish_time":"2013-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Argent, Andrew C.; Kissoon, Niranjan \u201CTex\u201D","journal":"Pediatric and Neonatal Mechanical Ventilation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f57cdefffc3099f3b849b71e5eb13111d987610b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121784.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121784/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs3NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Goldstein"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe sepsis","term sepsis","septic shock","Levy","Goldstein","presence of clinical","result of infection","multi-organ failure","state of acute circulatory failure","temperature","SIRS","systemic inflammatory response syndrome","leucocyte abnormalities","laboratory evidence","abnormal vital signs","continuum of increasing severity","present definitions","world","tissue","fluid","body cavity","day thousands of children","microbe","Brilli"],"language":"en"},

Numerous viruses are also pathogenic to animals and plants, and many of them, mutating, become pathogenic also to humans. Several cases of affecting humans by originally animal viruses have been confirmed. Viral infections cause significant morbidity and mortality in humans, the increase of which is caused by general immunosuppression of the world population, changes in climate, and overall globalization. In spite of the fact that the pharmaceutical industry pays great attention to human viral infections, many of clinically used antivirals demonstrate also increased toxicity against human cells, limited bioavailability, and thus, not entirely suitable therapeutic profile. In addition, due to resistance, a combination of antivirals is needed for life-threatening infections. Thus, the development of new antiviral agents is of great importance for the control of virus spread. On the other hand, the discovery and development of structurally new antivirals represent risks. Therefore, another strategy is being developed, namely the reformulation of existing antivirals into nanoformulations and investigation of various metal and metalloid nanoparticles with respect to their diagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic antiviral applications. This chapter is focused on nanoscale materials/formulations with the potential to be used for the treatment or inhibition of the spread of viral diseases caused by human immunodeficiency virus, influenza A viruses (subtypes H3N2 and H1N1), avian influenza and swine influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis B and C viruses, Ebola and Marburg viruses, Newcastle disease virus, dengue and Zika viruses, and pseudorabies virus. Effective antiviral long-lasting and target-selective nanoformulations developed for oral, intravenous, intramuscular, intranasal, intrarectal, intravaginal, and intradermal applications are discussed. Benefits of nanoparticle-based vaccination formulations with the potential to secure cross protection against divergent viruses are outlined as well.","publish_time":"2019-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jamp\u00EDlek, Josef; Kr\u00E1\u013Eov\u00E1, Katar\u00EDna","journal":"Nanotheranostics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d23eb821ba26191f3915eaa6641333e2265a9ca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121811.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121811/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs3NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Various viruses","C viruses","Zika viruses","Marburg viruses","divergent viruses","animal viruses","Numerous viruses","swine influenza viruses","human immunodeficiency virus","pseudorabies virus","control of virus","human viral infections","new antivirals","respiratory syncytial virus","herpes simplex virus","Newcastle disease virus","human cells","combination of antivirals","spread of viral diseases","therapeutic antiviral applications","avian influenza","frequent causes of human diseases","potential","development of new antiviral agents","reformulation of existing antivirals","life-threatening infections","cases of affecting humans","great importance","great attention","intradermal applications","target-selective nanoformulations","investigation of various metal","based vaccination formulations","suitable therapeutic profile","Ebola","hepatitis B","dengue","changes","intrarectal","respect","metalloid nanoparticles","diagnostic","pharmaceutical industry","H1N1","mortality","subtypes H3N2","mild illnesses","climate","world population","prophylactic","toxicity","significant morbidity","cross protection","general immunosuppression","Benefits of nanoparticle","fact","limited bioavailability","nanoscale materials","animals","inhibition","discovery","overall globalization","serious sicknesses","increase","resistance","treatment","risks","chapter","spite","plants","hand"],"language":"en"},

Attempts to use reverse vaccinology to generate an HIV-1 vaccine on the basis of the structure of viral epitopes bound to monoclonal neutralizing antibodies have failed so far because it was not possible to extrapolate from an observed antigenic structure to the immunogenic structure required in a vaccine. Vaccine immunogenicity depends on numerous extrinsic factors such as the host immunoglobulin gene repertoire, the presence of various cellular and regulatory mechanisms in the immunized host and the process of antibody affinity maturation. All these factors played a role in the appearance of the neutralizing antibody used to select the epitope to be investigated as potential vaccine immunogen, but they cannot be expected to be present in identical form in the host to be vaccinated. It is possible to rationally design and optimize an epitope to fit one particular antibody molecule or to improve the paratope binding efficacy of a monoclonal antibody intended for passive immunotherapy. What is not possible is to rationally design an HIV-1 vaccine immunogen that will elicit a protective polyclonal antibody response of predetermined efficacy. An effective vaccine immunogen can only be discovered by investigating experimentally the immunogenicity of a candidate molecule and demonstrating its ability to induce a protective immune response. It cannot be discovered by determining which epitopes of an engineered antigen molecule are recognized by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody. This means that empirical immunogenicity trials rather than structural analyses of antigens offer the best hope of discovering an HIV-1 vaccine.","publish_time":"2019-09-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Van Regenmortel, Marc H V","journal":"HIV/AIDS: Immunochemistry, Reductionism and Vaccine Design","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122000.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122000/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs4Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Vaccine immunogenicity","neutralizing antibody","neutralizing monoclonal antibody","potential vaccine immunogen","effective vaccine immunogen","particular antibody molecule","structure-based HIV","structure of viral epitopes","immunogenic structure","protective polyclonal antibody response of predetermined efficacy","monoclonal neutralizing antibodies","process of antibody affinity maturation","immunized host","observed antigenic structure","candidate molecule","nature of protein epitopes","protective immune response","engineered antigen molecule","empirical immunogenicity trials","host immunoglobulin gene repertoire","numerous extrinsic factors","paratope binding efficacy","presence of various cellular","structural analyses of antigens","regulatory mechanisms","ability","basis","best hope","misconceptions","appearance","immunological specificity","identical form","role","passive immunotherapy","reverse vaccinology","claim"],"language":"en"},

In African rangelands, species such as African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus), cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), lions (Panthera leo), leopards (Panthera pardus), and spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) may kill livestock and are therefore themselves killed by local pastoralists. Such conflict has led to the extirpation of these species from many areas, and also impacts the livelihoods of local livestock farmers. To investigate the possibilities for coexistence of people, livestock, and large predators in community rangelands, we measured the effectiveness of traditional livestock husbandry in reducing depredation by wild carnivores, using a case\u2013control approach. Different measures were effective against different predator species but, overall, the risk of predator attack by day was lowest for small herds, accompanied by herd dogs as well as human herders, grazing in open habitat. By night, the risk of attack was lowest for herds held in enclosures (\u2018bomas\u2019) with dense walls, pierced by few gates, where both men and domestic dogs were present. Unexpectedly, the presence of scarecrows increased the risks of attack on bomas. Our findings suggest that improvements to livestock husbandry can contribute to the conservation and recovery of large carnivores in community rangelands, although other measures such as prey conservation and control of domestic dog diseases are also likely to be necessary for some species.","publish_time":"2007-10-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Woodroffe, Rosie; Frank, Laurence G.; Lindsey, Peter A.; ole Ranah, Symon M.

Even though influenza affects people of all different ages, it can be extremely hazardous to people of 65 years of age or older since that is the population that makes up the high majority of the death toll caused by influenza-related diseases. Elderly individuals suffer the effects of immunosenescence as they age, which is the diminishing of the overall immune response. Immunosenescence occurs by specifically affecting the adaptive immune response which controls the establishment of immunity after vaccination or infection. There are many studies under way that are trying to find a resolution to the problem of the influenza vaccine not providing enough protection in the elderly population. One of the possible strategies is to seek the use of an optimal adjuvant, an immunological agent that can enhance immune responses, with the current vaccine formulation. Here, we used the murine model to review the effects of adjuvants on the antibody response to influenza vaccines in aged mice. Since adjuvants can enhance the production of important inflammatory cytokines and activation of dendritic cells, the stimulation of these cells are boosted to increase the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine in aged mice which would hopefully translate to the elderly.","publish_time":"2014-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Concannon, Mark A.; Jiang, Jiu","journal":"Front Biol (Beijing)","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089211/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjsxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza vaccines","influenza-related diseases","elderly population","adaptive immune response","overall immune response","antibody response","immune responses","aged mice","effects of adjuvants","current vaccine formulation","people","effects of immunosenescence","Elderly individuals","years of age","activation of dendritic cells","production of important inflammatory cytokines","death toll","researchers","immunological agent","establishment of immunity","major threat","public health","use","optimal adjuvant","high majority","stimulation","efficacy","effectiveness","protection","different ages","vaccination","infection","diminishing","problem","universal solution","murine model","possible strategies","resolution","studies","way"],"language":"en"},

There has been a recent surge in both small-scale backyard chickens and larger scale broiler production associated with growth in the human population and the tourist industry. With increased poultry production, concerns have been expressed about the increasing risk of transfer of disease from chickens to native Gal\u00E1pagos bird species that may have little resistance to introduced pathogens [Wikelski, M., Foufopoulos, J., Vargas, H., Snell, H., 2004. Gal\u00E1pagos birds and diseases: invasive pathogens as threats for island species. Ecology and Society 9(5). Available from: URL:http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol9/iss1/art5]. This study evaluates risks posed by chicken disease to endemic and native Gal\u00E1pagos bird species, based on empirical evidence of pathogens present in chickens on the islands and a literature review of effects of these pathogens in wild species. Pathogens identified in domestic chicken populations of immediate avian conservation concern are Newcastle disease, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, and the proventricular parasite Dispharynx sp. Newcastle disease (avian paramyxovirus-1) poses an imminent threat to Gal\u00E1pagos penguins (Spheniscus mendiculus), flightless cormorants (Phalacrocorax harrisi), and lava gulls (Larus fuliginosus), species with very small population sizes (less than 1500 animals each). Additionally, litter from broiler farms could affect ecological processes in local ecosystems. Improved poultry biosecurity measures are urgently needed on the Gal\u00E1pagos Islands for avian disease management, yet developing these strategies presents political, social, and economic challenges.","publish_time":"2005-08-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gottdenker, Nicole L.; Walsh, Timothy; Vargas, Hernan; Merkel, Jane; Jim\u00E9nez, Gustavo U.; Miller, R.

Because various infection agents are associated with STIs, and because infected persons sometimes show no symptoms, the diagnosis of STIs using nucleic acid amplification tests(NAATs) has required not only simultaneous multi-targeting, but also sensitive detection. Here, we compare microarray and real-time PCR for the detection of three common STIs agents, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma genitalium, and Chlamydia trachomatis, using human urine samples. The detection results showed that microarray and real-time PCR technology are both effective tools for the detection of STI agents. In conclusion, real-time PCR detection offers more sensitivity and specificity than microarray, because of the quantitative method employed.

Arctonyx is usually regarded as monotypic, comprising the single species A. collaris F. Cuvier, 1825, but taxonomic boundaries in the genus have never been revised on the basis of sizeable series from throughout this geographical range. Based on a review of most available specimens in world museums, we recognize three distinctive species within the genus, based on craniometric analyses, qualitative craniodental features, external comparisons, and geographical and ecological considerations. Arctonyx albogularis (Blyth, 1853) is a shaggy-coated, medium-sized badger widely distributed in temperate Asia, from Tibet and the Himalayan region to eastern and southern China. Arctonyx collaris F. Cuvier, 1825, is an extremely large, shorter-haired badger, distributed throughout Southeast Asia, from eastern India to Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. The world\u0027s largest extant badger, A. collaris co-occurs with A. albogularis in eastern India and probably in southern China, and fossil comparisons indicate that its geographical range may have extended into central China in the middle Pleistocene. The disjunctly distributed species Arctonyx hoevenii (Hubrecht, 1891), originally described within the order \u2018Edentata\u2019 by a remarkable misunderstanding, is the smallest and darkest member of the genus and is endemic to the Barisan mountain chain of Sumatra. Apart from A. hoevenii, no other Arctonyx occurs on the Sunda Shelf below peninsular Thailand. The natural history of each species of Arctonyx, so far as is known, is briefly reviewed.

Cytokines plays an important role in the pathogenesis of viral, bacterial, and immunologic diseases. This study aimed to investigate the role of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-gamma levels in the severity of infection and clinical outcome of patients with CCHF. METHODS: Patients with confirmed CCHF were divided into two groups (severe cases: Patients who exhibited hemorrhage during their hospital stay, and mild/moderate cases: Patients who displayed no hemorrhage during their hospital stay). Demographic characteristics, laboratory tests on admission of all patients with CCHF were investigated, and serum TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-gamma levels were measured. RESULTS: A total of 154 patients with confirmed CCHF were investigated. Forty-six (29.9%) of these patients were in the severe group. In patients with severe CCHF, significantly higher serum levels of TNF-alpha (68.2 \u00B1 23.5; P = 0.008) and IL-6 (73.1 \u00B1 41.6; P = 0.003) were detected, compared with cytokine levels in patients who mild/moderate CCHF (Table 1). No differences in serum IL-10 and IFN-gamma levels between patients who severe CCHF and those who mild/moderate CCHF were detected (P \u003E 0.05). CONCLUSION: Cytokines, chemokines, and other inflammatory mediators function in a manner, acting on many different cell types to regulate the host\u2019s immune response. When cytokines present in high concentrations, they might toxic or even lethal effects. In accordance with this view, we have detected increased serum TNF-alpha, IL-6 levels in the patients with severe CCHF.

Pregnant women who become infected with influenza have hospitalization rates comparable to non-pregnant women with high-risk medical conditions. Other than influenza, little is known about the consequences of viral-related ARI on the pregnant woman and the fetus. Our objective was to determine the respiratory viruses causing ARI and their clinical outcomes during pregnancy. METHODS: Pregnant women in their second and third trimester were enrolled prospectively at a Houston clinic between October 1, 2015 and April 30, 2016 during their regular prenatal visits. Pregnant women were enrolled if they reported having symptoms of ARI or were healthy within the preceding two weeks. Nasal-pharyngeal secretions were evaluated for respiratory viruses by real time-PCR. Clinical outcomes and complications of illness were obtained at enrollment and two weeks after the initial visit. RESULTS: A total of 155 pregnant women were enrolled. The average age at enrollment was 30.7 years among women with ARI and 29.7 among healthy controls. Average gestational age at enrollment was 26.0 weeks among women with ARI and 26.3 among healthy controls. Among the 91 healthy controls, 10 (11%) tested positive for a respiratory virus, with rhinovirus (n = 6) being the most common of the viruses detected. On the other hand, of the 81 cases of ARI, 51 (63%) tested positive for a virus. The most frequently detected viruses were rhinovirus (n = 22), coronavirus (n = 14), and respiratory syncytial virus (n = 8). Twelve patients reported fever during the course of their ARI. Seventeen ARI patients reported at least one symptom of lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI). Of those patients with LRTI, two reported decreased fetal heart rate and one was hospitalized for her illness. CONCLUSION: Respiratory viruses were frequently detected in pregnant women with ARI. One-third of pregnant women with viral ARI had evidence of LRTI. Hospitalization and non-reassuring fetal heart tones were among the complications reported by pregnant women with LRTI. Viral ARI during pregnancy appears common and is associated with significant morbidity.

Despite this, little is known about their epidemiological dynamics, including the role of asymptomatic shedding in transmission; the durations of virus incubation and shedding; and the effect of immune responses on risk for re-infection during the same season. We studied respiratory virus shedding in military recruits, and used mathematical models to measure pathogen-specific transmission rates and durations of incubation, shedding, and immune protection. METHODS: We tested for shedding of HCoVs, rhinoviruses, and NPEVs in nasal samples collected from 78 military recruits entering basic training and then at staggered, biweekly visits over 65 days during winter 2017. We developed a continuous-time Markov chain model for virus acquisition and clearance, and used Bayesian methods to estimate model parameters for each of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, rhinoviruses, and NPEVs. RESULTS: We observed widespread transmission of HCoV-229E, rhinoviruses, and NPEVs within the first week after entry into basic training, and a subsequent phase of transmission predominantly involving HCoV-OC43 during the second month (Figure). We estimated pre-epidemic reproductive numbers ranging from 1.97 (95% credible interval: 1.49, 2.60) for HCoV-OC43 to 5.69 (3.92, 7.98) for HCoV-229E (Table). Subjects re-acquired HCoV-229E, rhinoviruses, and NPEVs despite previous exposure; for these pathogens, we estimated reversion to pre-infection susceptibility to occur, on average, 28.5 (15.8, 49.7) days, 52.2 (22.3, 151.1), and 144.7 (61.3, 812.5) days, respectively, following clearance of viral shedding. CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic shedding is a source of transmission of common respiratory viruses in the close-contact basic training environment. Protection against re-acquisition is short-lived, and may be inadequate to prevent re-infection by rhinoviruses and NPEVs within a season. Estimated durations of shedding and incubation periods provide a basis for modeling pathogen spread and informing isolation protocols. DISCLOSURES: J.

Passive immunotherapy is a fast method of protection, but large-scale administration of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in unpractical. The delivery of mAbs using a viral vector can be an attractive alternative to direct mAbs injection. Integrase-defective lentiviral vectors (IDLV) have several advantages including the absence of pre-existing anti-vector immunity and the safety features of non-integration and non-replication. IDLV are maintained in non-dividing cells, and can express steady levels of functional proteins in vivo. We engineered IDLV to express mAbs against the influenza A virus (IAV) hemagglutinin, and tested their ability to protect from IAV in vivo. METHODS: IDLV were produced by co-transfection of transfer, packaging, and envelope plasmids in 293T cells and purification on sucrose gradients. IDLV were normalized using a colorimetric reverse transcriptase assay. Plasmid expressing mAb VN04-2 was provided by B. Hanson. mAb in the supernatant of transduced cells were detected by western blot and quantified by the Easy-Titer Human IgG Assay Kit. For in vivo studies, groups of 6\u20138 weeks old mice received IDLV either by intranasal (in) or intramuscular (im) route. mAb production was detected by western blot and ELISA. Mice were challenged using the recombinant IAV VNH5N1-PR8/CDC-RG derived from IAV A/Vietnam/1203/2004. RESULTS: We engineered IDLV producing the humanized mAb VN04-2 (IDLV-VN4-2), which is broadly neutralizing against H5 IAV. We found that after transduction of 293T cell with different dosages IDLV-VN4-2, the production of mAb was time and dose dependent. mAb were also functional, and bind specifically H5 HA but not other IAV proteins. We also measured VN04-2 production in the serum of mice 3, 6, 9, 14, 21 and 30 days after in or im administration of IDLV-VN4-2. We found that levels of mAb were sustained. In separate experiments 5/5 mice receiving IDLV-VN4-2 by the in route and 2/5 mice receiving it by the im route were protected from lethal IAV challenge. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that IDLV may represent an attractive candidate for vector-mediated immunization against infectious disease.

This study assessed the impact of a risk stratification guideline for empiric antimicrobial selection relative to acceptance rates and clinical outcomes. METHODS: In 2017, a guideline for inpatients with HCAP was launched. High risk (HR) of MDR GN was defined as patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), or with \u003E1 risk factor including: receipt of any antimicrobial within 30 days or broad spectrum antimicrobials within 90 days, hemodialysis dependence, or immunocompromised. HR patients were recommended to receive antimicrobials covering MDR GN and low-risk patients to narrower CAP regimens. Patients treated for HCAP post guideline implementation were compared with a historic 2014 cohort for guideline concordance, antimicrobial selection, and clinical outcomes. AST interventions were also assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 105 patients in the post-implementation period were compared with 309 historic patients. Guideline-concordant risk-stratified therapy increased 13% [95% CI (3%, 24%)] overall. Clinical failure rates were similar with 11% vs 10% (P = 0.608) in the pre- and post-implementation periods, with an 84% AST acceptance rate (Figure 1). Treatment length decreased [8.1 to 6.6 days (P \u003C 0.001)] and de-escalation increased [31% to 72% (P \u003C 0.001)] as seen in Table 1. CONCLUSION: Introduction of a risk stratified guideline through AST intervention changed practice by matching MDR risk with empiric HCAP therapy. Failure rates were comparable. Secondary benefits included: decreased treatment duration and hospital stay, increased de-escalation rates and decreased MDR GN antimicrobial use in low-risk patients.

In this task, automatic summaries are produced in response to a specific information request, or topic, stated by the user. The system we have designed to accomplish this task comprises four main components: a generic extractive summarization system, a topic-focusing component, sentence simplification, and lexical expansion of topic words. This paper details each of these components, together with experiments designed to quantify their individual contributions. We include an analysis of our results on two large datasets commonly used to evaluate task-focused summarization, the DUC2005 and DUC2006 datasets, using automatic metrics. Additionally, we include an analysis of our results on the DUC2006 task according to human evaluation metrics. In the human evaluation of system summaries compared to human summaries, i.e., the Pyramid method, our system ranked first out of 22 systems in terms of overall mean Pyramid score; and in the human evaluation of summary responsiveness to the topic, our system ranked third out of 35 systems.","publish_time":"2007-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vanderwende, Lucy; Suzuki, Hisami; Brockett, Chris; Nenkova, Ani","journal":"Inf Process Manag","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115785.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7115785/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs2MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human evaluation of system summaries","human summaries","DUC2006 task","task-focused summarization","human evaluation metrics","generic extractive summarization system","automatic summaries","topic-focused multi-document summarization","human evaluation of summary responsiveness","DUC2006 datasets","lexical expansion of topic words","automatic metrics","systems","results","analysis","main components","Pyramid method","large datasets","terms of overall mean Pyramid score","DUC2005","sentence simplification","response","specific information request","experiments","individual contributions","paper details","recent years","user"],"language":"en"},

Similar results were obtained with serum from rabbits inoculated with whole virus and structural components. All three preparations stimulated the formation of agglutinating antibodies, as demonstrated by sedimentation analysis and filtration studies with radiolabelled virus. The immunoglobulin classes responsible for neutralising antibody activity in sows inoculated by the intramammary route were examined. In each case where the immunoglobulin class was determined, IgG was found. One sow that received surface projections also had IgA with neutralising activity in her colostrum. In contrast, infection of sows with live whole virus resulted in neutralising antibody of the IgG, IgM and IgA classes.","publish_time":"2002-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garwes, D.J.; Lucas, M.H.; Higgins, D.A.; Pike, B.V.; Cartwright, S.F.","journal":"Vet Microbiol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117557/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs2Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["preparations of virus surface projections","radiolabelled virus","neutralising antibody activity","neutralising antibody formation","neutralising activity","preparations of surface projections","inactivated transmissible gastroenteritis virus","subviral particles","infection of sows","Pregnant sows","serum","IgA classes","IgG","colostrum","immunoglobulin classes responsible","formation of agglutinating antibodies","sedimentation analysis","filtration studies","IgM","detergent treatment","rabbits","animals","contrast","Similar results","intramammary route","structural components","case"],"language":"en"},

Mutations causing abnormal hemoglobin formation in this disease lead to structural abnormalities and cumulative damage to the cellular membrane of sickled erythrocytes. Polymerization and aggregation of these cells within the microvasculature results in severe vaso-occlusive pain crisis, chronic hemolytic anemia, and multiorgan pathology in patients. Pulmonary manifestations of SCD, including the acute chest syndrome (ACS), are a leading cause of hospitalization and mortality. ACS is a severe type of acute lung injury, defined as the development of a new pulmonary infiltrate, involving at least one complete lung segment, that is accompanied by fever, chest pain, tachypnea, wheezing, or cough in a patient with SCD. The etiology of ACS is multifactorial, with the most common mechanisms including infection, fat and bone marrow embolism, and direct microvascular vaso-occlusion. Despite recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis and clinical management of ACS in SCD, patient outcomes remain unacceptably poor. This chapter reviews the epidemiology, diagnosis, management, and outcomes of ACS in SCD.

The investigation focuses on the role of symbolic language in informing stakeholders about food-borne crisis situations. To narrow the scope of the research, the study concentrates on metaphors and their role in risk cognition, especially in the face of information overload. This approach allows the author to study the metaphorical dimension of risk cognition as well as its dynamics connected with the necessity of a constant response to changing internal and external conditions. Theoretical investigations on metaphors in food, health and risk discourse are often supported by empirical analyses on the use of metaphors in communicating food-borne diseases. This study encompasses selected materials on food-borne diseases gathered from Italian online sources and covers the corpus of investigated verbal metaphors. The aim of this chapter is to show whether metaphors strengthen or weaken risk cognition, and how far they determine the risk communication of food-borne diseases.","publish_time":"2015-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bielenia-Grajewska, Magdalena","journal":"Risk and Cognition","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3c3499dcca64a2db2b958191b3be920f34c1798.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120074.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120074/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs4OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["risk communication of food","communicating food","diseases","use of metaphors","risk discourse","verbal metaphors","study","metaphorical dimension of risk cognition","aim","role of symbolic language","informing stakeholders","corpus","health","constant response","empirical analyses","Italian online sources","selected materials","external conditions","crisis situations","important issues","Theoretical investigations","author","necessity","research","dynamics","face of information overload","contribution","scope","chapter","approach"],"language":"en"},

However, such important immune functions are known to decline with age in many mammals, including humans. It is a matter of clinical importance that the incidence of various age-associated diseases such as infections, cancer and vascular disorders increases with a decrease in immunological vigor. The extent of immunologic decline is variable and exhibits wide inter-individual variations. Thus, it is important to assess the extent of immunologic decline in both patients suffering from various diseases and in healthy people in order to maintain healthy conditions. To this end, we have developed a scoring system that analyzes immune parameters according to a database of known age-associated immune changes obtained from a healthy population. Using this scoring system, we can combine several different immunological parameters and express the immune status of individuals as a simple numeral. After determining immunological vigor for individuals, it is necessary to replenish immune defects and restore them to normalcy for individuals with depressed immunological scores. This chapter provides methods of immunological restoration in animal models and introduces some similar attempts in humans. The effect of any immunological restoration varies with the individual and must therefore verified. Currently, the proposed immune scoring system proposed is useful to determine whether the methods employed are effective for the restoration of immune functions.","publish_time":"2008-08-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hirokawa, Katsuiku; Utsuyama, Masanori; Kikuchi, Yuko; Kitagawa, Masanobu","journal":"Handbook on Immunosenescence","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f65bee8a6e0de7af3d87f01064036410a32f5924.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120189/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs5NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune system","immune parameters","immune changes","immune defects","restoration of immune functions","important immune functions","proposed immune scoring system","immune status of individuals","immunological vigor","methods of immunological restoration","different immunological parameters","depressed immunological scores","extent of immunologic decline","various diseases","incidence of various age-associated diseases","healthy people","database of known age","healthy conditions","healthy population","important role","humans","wide inter-individual variations","infections","animal models","normalcy","cancer","protection","patients","vascular disorders","maintenance","similar attempts","matter of clinical importance","decrease","simple numeral","internal environment","chapter","body","mammals","effect","end"],"language":"en"},

Origin-associated proteins are themselves subject to multilayered regulation, notably by posttranslational modification and proteasomal degradation. Origins are organized into replicons and replicon clusters, whose firing occurs at discrete subnuclear bodies known as replication foci. A still poorly characterized nuclear matrix structure might be involved in the attachment of replication units and the formation of replication foci. Preferential genomic sequences responsible for these attachments have been reported, as well as factors playing roles in their regulation. There appears to be great flexibility in the choice of origins used in each S-phase, being affected by factors including cell identity and replication stresses. Origin selection also changes dramatically during embryogenesis in concert with developmental signaling pathways. Dysregulation of origin positioning and recognition are implicated in human disease, as mutations in origin-binding proteins have been found in developmental disorders, and expansions in repeat-containing genomic regions promote genome instability. This chapter summarizes current understanding about replication origins, the most recent discoveries, and outlines key unanswered questions in this exciting field.","publish_time":"2015-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hutchins, James R.

The focus was on infectious diseases which could be transmitted to the finishing units with delivered growers, and which might have some influence on partial carcass condemnations (PCC) in meat inspection. Farm visits were done by a veterinarian (senior author) assisted by a technician. Colostrum samples (average 22 per herd) were taken in 100 herds, and analyzed for Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (A. pleur) and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M.hyo) antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Only nine of 114 herds were judged to be free of mange. It was concluded that all finishing units received mange-infected feeder pigs each time the unit was filled. One or more acute erysipelas outbreaks had occurred in every fifth herd during the previous year. The risk of a finishing unit receiving feeder pigs carrying erysipelas was considered to be high. Swine dysentery (Serpulina hyodysenteriae) was not found to be a problem in the LSO area. Clostridium perfringens type C enteritis was found in eight (7%) herds. Seven of these herds were located in those supply areas where the PCC percentage of feeder pigs was high. In spite of statistical connection no causality between this disease and PCC was presumed. There were no previous diagnoses of respiratory diseases but spontaneous coughing was observed in 5% of the herds. Provocation testing induced coughing in 22% of herds but not serious coughing in any herd. Managers had observed coughing in 15% of herds. Ninety-one herds were positive in a colostrum ELISA for A. pleur antibodies, and eight herds were positive for M.hyo antibodies. A.pleur-positive herds had several positive or samples suspected of being positive in each herd bu M.hyo-positive herds had only one or two positive or suspected samples per herd. Six of the M.hyo herds were located in the high PCC area, two in the average PCC area and none in the low PCC area.

At the farm level, data were stratified by season, with two six-month seasons (winter and summer) per year. The odds of farms with particular management strategies having above-median morbidity were calculated. At the individual calf level, the odds of a calf being treated, controlling for farm of origin and month of birth, were calculated for different management practices. Larger farms had significantly greater odds of experiencing mortality than smaller farms in both winter and summer. Farms which had policies of attending calvings and ensuring that calves received their first colostrum had significantly lower odds of experiencing winter mortality than farms which did not have these policies. Farms which housed calves in hutches had significantly lower odds, and those which housed calves in group pens had significantly higher odds, of experiencing summer mortality, than farms which used individual indoor calf-pens. A policy of teat removal between four weeks of age and weaning was associated with increased odds of summer mortality. At the individual calf level, calving ease, sire, navel treatment, assistance at first colostrum feeding, administration of vitamins A, D and E and anti-scour vaccines to the pregnant dam, and place of calving, were all associated with significantly altered odds of dying. However, several interactions entered the statistical models, and the effects of those management practices were not all straightforward.","publish_time":"2002-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Waltner-Toews, D.; Martin, S.W.; Meek, A.H.","journal":"Prev Vet Med","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134175/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsxMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Holstein"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["odds of farms","lower odds","higher odds","greater odds","increased odds of summer mortality","smaller farms","Larger farms","winter mortality","individual calf level","heifer calf management","calves","selected Holstein dairy farms","individual indoor calf-pens","farm level","different management practices","particular management strategies","colostrum","policies","calving ease","place of calving","group pens","farm of origin","sire","anti-scour vaccines","pregnant dam","navel treatment","weeks of age","assistance","southwestern Ontario","administration of vitamins","month of birth","weaning","effects","six-month seasons","Associations","policy of teat removal","hutches","median morbidity","statistical models","data","calvings","interactions","year"],"language":"en"},

However, before implementing such an FC, teachers face the challenge of creating content in the form of materials and activities and finding a suitable development method. This is very time-consuming, which is why circumstances such as lack of time and personnel can make implementation difficult. In other areas, agile approaches have already proven to be effective in enabling flexible and efficient development. We use this opportunity to overcome different barriers in the context of FC development by creating an agile model for FC development. To achieve this, we first examined the previous research on agile development approaches concerning the implementation of an FC by a systematic literature review, concluding that no appropriate model exists yet. Building upon this, we designed an Agile(FC) Development Model, which can be used by teachers to create their FC. This model is very generally designed so that it can be easily adopted. On the other hand, it can be adjusted to a particular situation without effort. We also illustrate the application of the model using a small case study.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bl\u00F6mer, Linda; Voigt, Christin; Droit, Alena; Hoppe, Uwe","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f1db303f50f67c7ed31f405b404e0ebfc8e39cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134251.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134251/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsxNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Digital","FC","FC) Development Model"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Development Model","context of FC development","agile model","agile development approaches","efficient development","agile approaches","appropriate model","suitable development method","teachers","implementation difficult","activities","Flipped Classroom","different barriers","systematic literature review","form of materials","lack of time","content","personnel","challenge","previous research","Digital course designs","small case study","enriching university education","circumstances","particular situation","effort","opportunity","application","areas","hand"],"language":"en"},

Governments, in their quest to serve citizens, harness ICT to streamline their service delivery processes. e-Government transforms administrations into \u201Csmart governments\u201D enhancing the social, political and economic inclusion and the quality of life of its citizens. However, the governments of developing countries are still facing challenges regarding transformation due to a myriad of obstacles, which include the lack of interoperability of e-government, lack of resources and lack of management commitment. Therefore, the aim of this study is to define an e-government implementation framework for developing countries. The 12 critical success factors identified for developing countries were mapped to the variables of Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) Theory in order to create the proposed implementation framework. The framework was then applied in a single case study at a government department in South Africa (SA) where the opinions of 110 managers were collected through an on-line questionnaire. By considering the e-government implementation framework, government departments are guided and enabled to prioritise specific elements in their implementation plan focusing on improved e-government delivery.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Apleni, Anele; Smuts, Hanlie","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/217440565ecf34a01ddbb8a6a7eef7541138d4bb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134271.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134271/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsxODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Information and Communication Technology"],"locations":["South Africa"],"keyphrases":["e-government implementation framework","government departments","improved e-government delivery","e-Government transforms administrations","proposed implementation framework","implementation plan","implementation of Information","governments of developing countries","lack of resources","lack of interoperability","smart governments","citizens","effective delivery of business","lack of management commitment","service delivery processes","harness ICT","single case study","order","economic inclusion","Innovation","DOI","Theory","South Africa","quality of life","variables of Diffusion","transformation","organisational mandates","challenges","Communication Technology","managers","opinions","myriad of obstacles","critical success factors","means","specific elements","on-line questionnaire","aim"],"language":"en"},

Existing research consists of two diverse approaches: the first consists of checklist approaches or normative guidelines on how to assess the information whereas the second provides descriptive models and theories of how users actually go about when assessing credibility. The above mentioned approaches consider aspects related to the presentation and content of the information. However, the reasoning in the content is not a concern that is covered in these approaches. Critical thinking is considered an increasingly important 21st century work place skill. This paper investigates the potential value of using critical thinking in assessing the credibility of online information. The paper commences with an overview of existing approaches for assessing the credibility of online information. It then argues that the presence of a well-developed argument in online information to be an indication of credibility. Critical thinking also helps to evaluate the credibility of evidence. These thinking skills can be developed through training. It is shown how a group of first year Information Systems students were able to more critically engage with the content of online news after a course on critical thinking. This paper contributes to the literature on the assessment of the credibility of online information.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Zyl, Albie; Turpin, Marita; Matthee, Machdel","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ee838f69d3f1b92ae24ade8a03ca91b1b7672bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134292.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134292/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsyMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Information Systems"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["credibility of online information","Critical thinking","indication of credibility","credibility of evidence","prevalence of unverified information","content of online news","year Information Systems students","checklist approaches","diverse approaches","mentioned approaches","thinking skills","paper","overview of existing approaches","theories","potential value","descriptive models","number of models","Existing research","associated potential adverse effect","internet","society","course","century work place skill","development","group","aspects","users","well-developed argument","presentation","assessment","normative guidelines","presence","literature","training","concern","reasoning"],"language":"en"},

As a result, it is difficult to effectively accumulate relevant knowledge and experiences. In this research, we attempt to explore research streams and trends by analyzing why existing studies were conducted, what outcomes were produced, and what methods were used in these studies.

The result shows the complexity of this area, the importance of balancing technical factors and non-technical factors, the challenges brought by non-functional requirements. Despite the importance of EA frameworks, few studies have been found in which government or city relevant requirements were addressed in a general way.

It grows within a wide temperature range (15\u201333\u00B0C), survives between 7 and 10\u00B0C for several months without alterations in its further virus susceptibility and growth characteristics, and degenerates at 37\u00B0C. Its karyotype is 2n=96. It propagates most of the systemic infection viruses of the fish families Salmonidae, Cyprinidae, Anguillidae and Esocidae, as well as Indiana-type vesicular stomatitis virus. Despite the origin of EPC cells, we were unable to demonstrate the presence of herpes virus in them. Their transformation was reflected in their karyotype (normally 2n=100) and by their growth ability in soft agar medium; monolayer growth, however, was inhibited at a density of 3\u00D710(6) cells/cm(2). The temperature growth range, good splitting ratio (1/10) and virus susceptibility make EPC cells a highly suitable material both for fish pathology and for comparative virology studies.","publish_time":"2006-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fijan, N.; Sulimanovi\u0107, D.; Bearzotti, M.; Muzini\u0107, D.; Zwillenberg, L.O.; Chilmonczyk, S.; Vautherot, J.F.; de Kinkelin, P.","journal":"Ann Inst Pasteur Virol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135074/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjszNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EPC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus susceptibility","temperature growth range","presence of herpes virus","growth ability","monolayer growth","growth characteristics","origin of EPC cells","carp epidermal herpes virus","karyotype","Indiana-type vesicular stomatitis virus","wide temperature range","fish pathology","fish families Salmonidae","soft agar medium","good splitting ratio","hyperplastic lesions","suitable material","Cyprinidae","Anguillidae","Epithelioma papulosum cyprini","systemic infection viruses","cell line","Esocidae","comparative virology studies","degenerates","alterations","esta","months","rise","subcultures","transformation","density"],"language":"en"},

With the ability to identify high-potential development directions, science foresight can be a useful tool to support the management and planning of future research activities. Science foresight analysts can choose from a rather large variety of approaches. There is, however, relatively little information about how the various approaches can be applied in an effective way. This paper describes a three-step methodological framework for science foresight on the basis of published research papers, consisting of (i) life-cycle analysis, (ii) text mining and (iii) knowledge gap identification by means of automated clustering. The three steps are connected using the research methodology of the research papers, as identified by text mining. The potential of combining these three steps in one framework is illustrated by analyzing scientific literature on wind catchers; a natural ventilation concept which has received considerable attention from academia, but with quite low application in practice. The knowledge gaps that are identified show that the automated foresight analysis is indeed able to find uncharted research areas. Results from a sensitivity analysis further show the importance of using full-texts for text mining instead of only title, keywords and abstract. The paper concludes with a reflection on the methodological framework, and gives directions for its intended use in future studies.","publish_time":"2017-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rezaeian, M.; Montazeri, H.; Loonen, R.C.G.M.","journal":"Technol Forecast Soc Change","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126682.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7126682/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjsxMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Science foresight analysts","research methodology","automated foresight analysis","text mining","planning of future research activities","expected research trends","uncharted research areas","basis of published research papers","future status of different fields of science","future studies","step methodological framework","sensitivity analysis","steps","life-cycle analysis","high-potential development directions","automated clustering","little information","various approaches","knowledge gaps","knowledge gap identification","large variety of approaches","natural ventilation concept","wind catchers","past","management","considerable attention","scientific literature","range of methods","useful tool","academia","intended use","title","low application","ability","keywords","importance","technology","texts","reflection","practice","Results","effective way"],"language":"en"},

The identification at species level among the 18 established Bcc members is an essential tool for epidemiological studies and infection control policies. In the early 2000s the epidemiology of Burkholderia cepacia (Bcc) in Argentina was characterized by the occurrence of a B. contaminans outbreak that took place in major CF centres. This situation was quite different from other countries where B. cenocepacia and B. multivorans have been the most frequent Bcc infecting species in CF patients. Although B. contaminans outbreak was studied, little is known about the evolution of Bcc epidemiology during the last years. The aim of this study was to analyse Bcc infections in CF patients (pt) attending Hospital de Ni\u00F1os \u201CR. Guti\u00E9rrez\u201D in 3 different periods between 2004 and 2014. Incidence and distribution of Bcc species have been described. 2004\u20132005: Incidence 13.5% (22/163 pt). B. contaminans 55.6% (10/18), B. cepacia 16.7% (3/18), B. cenocepacia and B. seminalis 11.1% (2/18), B. multivorans 5.6% (1/18), 4 nonviable strains. 2007\u20132009: Incidence 6.6% (12/181 pt). B. contaminans 72.7% (8/11), B. cepacia 27.3% (3/11), 1 nonviable strain. 2012\u20132014: Incidence 5.4% (10/184 pt). B. contaminans 90% (9/10), B. cepacia 10% (1/10). CONCLUSION: B. contaminans remains the most frequent isolated species among the new cases of infection. Although incidence values have decreased, these results suggest the situation with B. contaminans hasn\u0027t been solved yet. More studies specially focusing on the transmission of these bacteria and the possible sources of infection are needed.","publish_time":"2015-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ibarra, L.; Degrossi, J.; Vargas, L.

In the United States, more than one million cases of pneumonias afflict children under the age of 5 years, costing hundreds of millions of dollars annually. The majority of these infections are caused by a handful of common viruses. Knowledge of the epidemiology of these viruses combined with new rapid diagnostic techniques will provide faster and more, reliable diagnoses in the future. Although the basic clinical epidemiology of these viruses has been carefully investigated over the last 30 years, new molecular techniques are greatly expanding our understanding of these agents and the diseases they cause. Antigenic and genetic variations are being discovered in many viruses previously thought to be homogeneous. The exact roles and the biological significance of these variations are just beginning to be explored, but already evidence of differences in pathogenicity and immunogenicity has been found in many of these substrains. All of this information clearly will impact the development of future vaccines and antiviral drugs. Effective drugs exist for prophylaxis against influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus, and specific therapy exists for influenza A. Ribarivin is approved for use in respiratory synctial virus infections, and it alone or in combination with other agents (eg, IGIV) may be effective in immunocompromised patients, either in preventing the development of pneumonia or in decreasing morbidity and mortality. Many new antiviral agents are being tested and developed, and several are in clinical trials.","publish_time":"2006-06-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Henrickson, Kelly J.","journal":"Semin Pediatr Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129604/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjs0Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Antigenic","A.

This vaccine provided remarkable protective efficacy in mouse model compared to the BCG. This vaccine also provided therapeutic efficacy against multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extremely drug resistant TB (XDR-TB) in murine models. Furthermore, we extended our studies to a cynomolgus monkey model, which is currently the best animal model of human tuberculosis. This novel vaccine provided a higher level of the protective efficacy than BCG based upon the assessment of mortality. The BCG prime and HSP65 \u002B IL-12/HVJ vaccine (boost) by the prime-boost method showed a synergistic prophylactic effect in the monkey. Furthermore, this vaccine exerted therapeutic efficacy (100% survival) and augmentation of immune responses in the TB-infected monkeys.HVJ-Envelope/HSP65 DNA \u002B IL-12 DNA vaccine increased the body weight of TB-infected monkeys, improved the ESR, and augmented the immuneresponses (proliferation of PBL and IL-2 production). The enhancement of IL-2 production from monkeys treated with this vaccine was correlated with the therapeutic efficacy of the vaccine. These data indicate that our novel DNA vaccine might be useful against Mycobacterium tuberculosis including XDR-TB and MDR-TB for human therapeutic clinical trials.","publish_time":"2011-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Okada, M.; Kita, Y.; Nakajima, T.; Kanamaru, N.; Kaneda, Y.; Saunderson, P.; Tan, E.V.; McMurray, DN.","journal":"Procedia Vaccinol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4492bbb0a4d59b5d61a3bb13952b5d2e2134b40.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129750/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjs0Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BCG","PBL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HVJ vaccine","novel vaccine","novel DNA vaccine","MDR-TB","TB-infected","XDR-TB","therapeutic efficacy","HSP65 DNA","body weight of TB","multi-drug resistant TB","enhancement of IL","novel tuberculosis","remarkable protective efficacy","DNA vaccines","BCG prime","mouse model","infected monkeys","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","best animal model of human tuberculosis","human therapeutic clinical trials","envelope","cynomolgus monkey model","production","prime-boost method","mycobacterial heat shock protein","synergistic prophylactic effect","higher level","survival","combination","augmentation of immune responses","immuneresponses","liposome","proliferation of PBL","hemagglutinating virus of Japan","ESR","studies","murine models","interleukin","data","assessment of mortality"],"language":"en"},

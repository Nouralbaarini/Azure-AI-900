The goal of this report is to provide an update on the epidemic and review current progress in the development, evaluation and deployment of prevention and treatment strategies for EVD. Relevant information was identified through a comprehensive literature search using Medline, PubMed and CINAHL Complete and using the search terms Ebola, Ebola virus disease, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, West Africa outbreak, Ebola transmission, Ebola symptoms and signs, Ebola diagnosis, Ebola treatment, vaccines for Ebola and clinical trials on Ebola. Through 22 July 2015, a total of 27,741 EVD cases and 11,284 deaths were reported from all affected countries. Several therapeutic agents and novel vaccines for EVD have been developed and are now undergoing evaluation. Concurrent with active case investigation, contact tracing, surveillance and supportive care to patients and communities, there has been rapid progress in the development of new therapies and vaccines against EVD. Continued focus on strengthening clinical and public health infrastructure will have direct benefits in controlling the spread of EVD and will provide a strong foundation for deployment of new drugs and vaccines to affected countries when they become available. The unprecedented West Africa Ebola outbreak, response measures, and ensuing drug and vaccine development suggest that new tools for Ebola control may be available in the near future.

Identification of sustainable and effective measures to mitigate PRRSV transmission is a pressing problem. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of PRRSV plays a crucial role in inhibiting host innate immunity during PRRSV infection. In the current study, a new host-restricted factor, tripartite motif protein 25 (TRIM25), was identified as an inhibitor of PRRSV replication. Co-immunoprecipitation assay indicated that the PRRSV N protein interferes with TRIM25\u2013RIG-I interactions by competitively interacting with TRIM25. Furthermore, N protein inhibits the expression of TRIM25 and TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination to suppress interferon \u03B2 production. Furthermore, with increasing TRIM25 expression, the inhibitory effect of N protein on the ubiquitination of RIG-I diminished. These results indicate for the first time that TRIM25 inhibits PRRSV replication and that the N protein antagonizes the antiviral activity by interfering with TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination. This not only provides a theoretical basis for the development of drugs to control PRRSV replication, but also better explains the mechanism through which the PRRSV N protein inhibits innate immune responses of the host.","publish_time":"2019-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Kuan; Li, Li-Wei; Jiang, Yi-Feng; Gao, Fei; Zhang, Yu-Jiao; Zhao, Wen-Ying; Li, Guo-Xin; Yu, Ling-Xue; Zhou, Yan-Jun; Tong, Guang-Zhi","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/571a758d7e806ab33a5860c071ce5c8afd5bec10.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117424.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.05.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113519301269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31176400/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113519301269","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsyMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV N"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein of PRRSV","PRRSV N protein","PRRSV transmission","PRRSV infection","expression of TRIM25","TRIM25-mediated RIG","inhibitor of PRRSV replication","inhibitory effect of N protein","increasing TRIM25 expression","ubiquitination of RIG","tripartite motif protein","inhibiting host innate immunity","new host-restricted factor","reproductive disorders","respiratory syndrome","respiratory diseases","PRRS virus","innate immune responses","crucial role","piglet","effective measures","development of drugs","antiviral activity","Co-immunoprecipitation assay","time","Identification of sustainable","current study","interferon \u03B2 production","theoretical basis","sow","pressing problem","interactions","nucleocapsid","mechanism","results"],"language":"en"},

In this study, microRNA, mRNA and cytokine/chemokine secretion profiling were investigated for human monocyte-derived macrophages infected in-vitro with Influenza virus A/H1N1 and/or Streptococcus pneumoniae. We observed that the in-vitro co-infection synergistically increased interferon-\u03B3-induced protein-10 (CXCL10, IP-10) expression compared to the singly-infected cells conditions. We demonstrated that endogenous miRNA-200a-3p, whose expression was synergistically induced following co-infection, indirectly regulates CXCL10 expression by targeting suppressor of cytokine signaling-6 (SOCS-6), a well-known regulator of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Additionally, in a subsequent clinical pilot study, immunomodulators levels were evaluated in samples from 74 children (\u22645 years-old) hospitalized with viral and/or bacterial community-acquired pneumonia. Clinically, among the 74 cases of pneumonia, patients with identified mixed-detection had significantly higher (3.6-fold) serum IP-10 levels than those with a single detection (P = 0.03), and were significantly associated with severe pneumonia (P \u003C 0.01). This study demonstrates that viral and bacterial co-infection modulates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and leads to exacerbated IP-10 expression, which could play a major role in the pathogenesis of pneumonia.","publish_time":"2016-12-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoffmann, Jonathan; Machado, Daniela; Terrier, Olivier; Pouzol, Stephane; Messaoudi, M\u00E9lina; Basualdo, Wilma; Esp\u00EDnola, Emilio E; Guillen, Rosa M.; Rosa-Calatrava, Manuel; Picot, Valentina; B\u00E9net, Thomas; Endtz, Hubert; Russomando, Graciela; Paranhos-Baccal\u00E0, Gl\u00E1ucia","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef3d6cabc804e5eb587b34249b539c1b5efa4cc4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5138590.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep38532; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27922126/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsyNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bacterial co-infection","vitro co-infection","CXCL10 expression","pathogenesis of pneumonia","cases of pneumonia","severe pneumonia","clinical implications of co-infection","bacterial community","JAK-STAT","bacterial infections","serum IP","exacerbated IP","pathway","subsequent clinical pilot study","identified mixed-detection","immunomodulators levels","suppressor of cytokine","induced protein","single detection","associated immunopathology","infected cells conditions","increased interferon-\u03B3","chemokine secretion profiling","mRNA","human monocyte-derived macrophages","H1N1","patients","fold","microRNA","Influenza virus","well-known regulator","major role","children","samples","years-old","Streptococcus pneumoniae","SOCS","endogenous miRNA"],"language":"en"},

Principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to acute phase, self-report symptom data from subjects in the Dubbo Infection Outcomes Study (n = 296) to empirically derive indices of fatigue, pain, neurocognitive difficulties, and mood disturbance, as well as overall illness severity. Associations were sought with functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the cytokine genes, interleukin (IL)-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1, interferon (IFN)-\u03B3, and IL-10. The summed individual symptom indices correlated with overall severity and also with functional status.

We initially used a capillary electrophoresis method to gain insight into the role of the VEEV nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3) in viral replication. We identified several regions in nsP3 that are intolerant to small (15 bp) insertions, and thus are presumably functionally important. We also identified nine separate regions in nsP3 that will tolerate small insertions at low temperatures (30\u00B0C), but not at higher temperatures (37\u00B0C, and 40\u00B0C). Because we found this method to be extremely effective at identifying temperature sensitive (ts) mutations, but limited by capillary electrophoresis capacity, we replaced the capillary electrophoresis with massively parallel sequencing and used the improved method to generate a functional map of the entire VEEV genome. We identified several hundred potential ts mutations throughout the genome and we validated several of the mutations in nsP2, nsP3, E3, E2, E1 and capsid using single-cycle growth curve experiments with virus generated through reverse genetics. We further demonstrated that two of the nsP3 ts mutants were attenuated for virulence in mice but could elicit protective immunity against challenge with wild-type VEEV. The recombinant ts mutants will be valuable tools for further studies of VEEV replication and virulence. Moreover, the method that we developed is applicable for generating such tools for any virus with a robust reverse genetics system.","publish_time":"2010-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beitzel, Brett F.; Bakken, Russell R.; Smith, Jeffrey M.; Schmaljohn, Connie S.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c05053ab5281d6f0329a0b2b124acf02fb5875b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2954836.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1001146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20976195/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsyNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VEEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["capillary electrophoresis method","nsP3 ts mutants","entire VEEV genome","capillary electrophoresis capacity","studies of VEEV replication","potential ts mutations","important regions","improved method","wild-type VEEV","VEEV nonstructural protein","recombinant ts mutants","parallel sequencing","virulence","small insertions","separate regions","Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus","valuable tools","robust reverse genetics system","low temperatures","higher temperatures","viral replication","capsid","single-cycle growth curve experiments","transposon","E2","E1","E3","functional map","protective immunity","challenge","role","insight","insertional mutagenesis","high-resolution genomic mapping technique","mice","temperature sensitive","nsP2","bp"],"language":"en"},

By means of this technique, tagged proteins containing a polyhistidine sequence can be obtained up to 95% pure in a single step, but some host proteins also bind with great affinity to metal ions and contaminate the sample. A way to overcome this problem is to include a second tag that is recognized by a preexistent monoclonal antibody (mAb) in the gene encoding the target protein, allowing further purification. With this strategy, the recombinant protein can be directly used as target in capture ELISA using plates sensitized with the corresponding mAb. As a proof of concept, in this study we engineered a Trichinella-derived tag (MTFSVPIS, recognized by mAb US9) into a His-tagged recombinant Fasciola antigen (rFhLAP) to make a new chimeric recombinant protein (rUS9-FhLAP), and tested its specificity in capture and indirect ELISAs with sera from sheep and cattle. FhLAP was selected since it was previously reported to be immunogenic in ruminants and is expressed in soluble form in E. coli, which anticipates a higher contamination by host proteins than proteins expressed in inclusion bodies. Our results showed that a large number of sera from non-infected ruminants (mainly cattle) reacted in indirect ELISA with rUS9-FhLAP after single-step purification by IMAC, but that this reactivity disappeared testing the same antigen in capture ELISA with mAb US9. These results demonstrate that the 6XHis and US9 tags can be combined when double purification of recombinant proteins is required.","publish_time":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Orbegozo-Medina, Ricardo A.; Mart\u00EDnez-Sern\u00E1ndez, Victoria; Perteguer, Mar\u00EDa J.; Hern\u00E1ndez-Gonz\u00E1lez, Ana; Mezo, Mercedes; Gonz\u00E1lez-Warleta, Marta; Romar\u00EDs, Fernanda; Paniagua, Esperanza; G\u00E1rate, Teresa; Ubeira, Florencio M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b5d559562d07c48dfbba720712d27a53ee81504.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6358068.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0211035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707711/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs0MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host proteins","double purification of recombinant proteins","mAb US9","capture ELISA","recombinant Fasciola antigen","rUS9-FhLAP","new chimeric recombinant protein","target protein","corresponding mAb","single-step purification","single step","cattle","coli","IMAC","US9 tags","results","indirect ELISAs","great affinity","immobilized metal affinity chromatography","metal ions","large number of sera","non-infected ruminants","Trichinella-derived tag","rFhLAP","MTFSVPIS","plates","higher contamination","study","sheep","specificity","gene","preexistent monoclonal antibody","inclusion bodies","soluble form","XHis","polyhistidine sequence","proof of concept","problem","sample","reactivity","technique","strategy","way"],"language":"en"},

This appears to be a virus from Rhinolophus bats, but the intermediate host has not yet been identified. The mechanism of infection of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known; it appears to have affinity for cells located in the lower airways, where it replicates. The interhuman transmission of coronaviruses mainly occurs through saliva droplets and direct and indirect contact via surfaces. As of March 10, 2020, the number of cases worldwide was 113,702. Along with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 appears to cause a severe clinical picture in humans, ranging from mild malaise to death by sepsis/acute respiratory distress syndrome. The prognosis is worse in elderly patients with comorbidities. To date, there is no specific therapy for COVID-19. Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection implies strategies that limit the spread of the virus. WHO and other international and national bodies have developed continuously updated strategic objectives and provisions to contain the spread of the virus and infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gabutti, Giovanni; d\u2019Anchera, Erica; Sandri, Federica; Savio, Marta; Stefanati, Armando","journal":"Infect Dis Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f1017af86e750831ac2f1a6e2e03623f82304b5b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7139198.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292686/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40121-020-00295-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["China","Middle Eastern"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","acute respiratory distress syndrome","COVID","infection coronavirus disease","Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome","Prevention of SARS","mechanism of infection","new coronavirus","spread","China","severe clinical picture","number of cases","cases of viral pneumonia","sepsis","death","saliva droplets","indirect contact","mild malaise","humans","MERS","elderly patients","strategic objectives","Rhinolophus bats","province of Hubei","infections attributable","national bodies","cells","interhuman transmission of coronaviruses","prognosis","comorbidities","intermediate host","surfaces","provisions","specific therapy","increase","strategies","lower airways","World Health Organization","affinity","date"],"language":"en"},

Thus, at the household level, the effects resulting from individual-level factors, such as vaccination, may be confounded or modified in some way. We proposed the Bayesian hierarchical random-effects (random intercepts and random slopes) model under the context of generalised linear model to capture heterogeneity and variation on the individual, generation, and household levels. It was applied to empirical surveillance data on the influenza epidemic in Taiwan. The parameters of interest were estimated by using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method in conjunction with the Bayesian directed acyclic graphical models. Comparisons between models were made using the deviance information criterion. Based on the result of the random-slope Bayesian hierarchical method under the context of the Reed\u2013Frost transmission model, the regression coefficient regarding the protective effect of vaccination varied statistically significantly from household to household. The result of such a heterogeneity was robust to the use of different prior distributions (including non-informative, sceptical, and enthusiastic ones). By integrating out the uncertainty of the parameters of the posterior distribution, the predictive distribution was computed to forecast the number of influenza cases allowing for random-household effect.","publish_time":"2015-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hsu, C.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We were collected a total of 460 blood samples from 46 farms with 36 broiler farms and 10 sonali farms (cross-breed) from 2015 to 2017. All the collected serum samples were tested for determining specific antibodies of avian rhinotracheitis (ART) virus, infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) virus, infectious bronchitis (IBV) virus, and Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT) infection using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. RESULTS: The overall seropositivity was highest in ORT (45.9%), followed by IBV (37.6%), ART (2.6%), and ILT (0.4%). Out of 360 broiler samples, highest seropositivity was recorded in ORT (43.3%) and lowest in IBV (31.4%). Surprisingly, no broiler samples were found positive for ART and ILT. In case of sonali, the seropositivity was highest in IBV (60%) and lowest in ILT (2%). With respect to types of birds and age groups, the seropositive percentage of all four pathogens was found higher in sonali than broiler. Between two age groups of sonali, the seropositive percentage of ART (12%), ORT (55%), ILT (2%), and IBV (60%) was highest at 21\u201360 weeks of age compared to 5\u201320 weeks of age. However, based on location, the seropositive of ORT and IBV was highest in Jamalpur (63.3%) and Fulbariya and Trishal (50%) and lowest in Sreepur (16.7%) and Jamalpur (3.3%). CONCLUSION: The four pathogens are ubiquitous in nature for the sonali chickens, and the prevalence of ORT and IBV was the most prevalent viruses in the study areas. This study indicates a need for improved surveillance and characterization of ORT and ART circulating in all types of poultry in Bangladesh.","publish_time":"2019-11-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bhuiyan, Zafar Ahmed; Ali, Md Zulfekar; Moula, Mohammad Moktader; Bary, Md Akramul; Arefin, Nishat; Giasuddin, Md; Khan, Zahed Uddin Mahmood","journal":"J Adv Vet Anim Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/983df610328c1e73e3c12546d42a14d520844f9b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6882717.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31819887/; https://doi.org/10.5455/javar.2019.f383","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","ILT","ORT"],"locations":["Bangladesh","Jamalpur"],"keyphrases":["IBV","seropositive of ORT","ILT","sonali farms","broiler samples","sonali birds","characterization of ORT","broiler farms","prevalence of ORT","age groups of sonali","highest seropositivity","sonali chickens","case of sonali","seropositive percentage of ART","weeks of age","blood samples","collected serum samples","types of birds","overall seropositivity","pathogens","study areas","Jamalpur","infectious laryngotracheitis","infectious bronchitis","types of poultry","selected districts of Bangladesh","infection","available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits","specific antibodies of avian rhinotracheitis","improved surveillance","different respiratory diseases","Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale","prevalent viruses","need","nature","cross-breed","total","RESULTS","respect","METHODS","Fulbariya","CONCLUSION","Trishal","Sreepur","location","MATERIALS","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

While assays detecting nucleic acids were implemented quickly, assays to detect anti-PDCoV antibodies have not been available. In this study, an indirect anti-PDCoV IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the putative S1 portion of the spike protein was developed and utilized to determine the prevalence of anti-PDCoV IgG in U.S. pigs. The diagnostic sensitivity of the PDCoV ELISA was 91% with a diagnostic specificity of 95%. A total of 968 serum samples were tested including samples with confirmed infection with PDCoV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus or porcine respiratory coronavirus. There was no cross-reactivity with any of the other coronaviruses. Among 355 arbitrarily selected serum samples collected in 2014 and originating from 51 farms across 18 U.S. states, anti-PDCoV IgG antibodies were detected in 8.7% of the samples and in 25.5% of the farms whereas anti-PEDV IgG was detected in 22.8% of the samples and in 54.9% of the farms. In addition, anti-PDCoV IgG antibodies were detected in archived samples collected in 2010, perhaps indicating an earlier undetected introduction into the U.S. pig population. Overall, the obtained data suggest that PDCoV seroprevalence in U.S. pigs is lower compared to PEDV and PDCoV may have been introduced to the U.S. prior to PEDV.","publish_time":"2015-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thachil, Anil; Gerber, Priscilla F.; Xiao, Chao-Ting; Huang, Yao-Wei; Opriessnig, Tanja","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/774e74e60cb62c3057145f6b98501fe532acdbdd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4399883.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25881086/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0124363","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs3MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["North America","U.S."],"keyphrases":["anti-PDCoV antibodies","anti-PDCoV IgG antibodies","PDCoV ELISA","prevalence of anti-PDCoV IgG","PDCoV seroprevalence","anti-PEDV IgG","archived samples","indirect anti-PDCoV IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","pigs","selected serum samples","farms","Porcine deltacoronavirus","porcine respiratory coronavirus","porcine coronavirus HKU15","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","assays","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","diagnostic sensitivity","diagnostic specificity","confirmed infection","putative S1 portion","states","spike protein","earlier undetected introduction","study","addition","pig population","urgent need","ecology","nucleic acids","obtained data","enteric disease","total","cross-reactivity","North America","coronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

There is little guidance about which variables should be collected by surveillance systems for strategy-based surveillance. Methods Surveillance forms for dengue, malaria, hepatitis A, typhoid and measles were collected from Australia and New Zealand and information on these compared with national surveillance forms from the UK and Canada by travel health experts. Variables were categorised by information relating to recent travel, demographics and disease severity. Results Travel-related information most commonly requested included country of travel, vaccination status and travel dates. In Australia, ethnicity information requested related to indigenous status, whilst in New Zealand it could be linked to census categories. Severity of disease information most frequently collected were hospitalisation and death. Conclusions Reviewing the usefulness of variables collected resulted in the recommendation that those included should be: overseas travel, reason for travel, entry and departure dates during the incubation period, vaccination details, traveller\u0027s and/or parents\u0027 country of birth, country of usual residence, time resident in current country, postcode, hospitalisation and death details. There was no agreement about whether ethnicity details should be collected. The inclusion of these variables on surveillance forms could enable imported infection-related policy to be formulated nationally and internationally.","publish_time":"2016-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Neave, Penny E.; Heywood, Anita E.; Gibney, Katherine B.; Leder, Karin","journal":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/424d8b917715d31c4f29e31a76c89490482fefc4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110684.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27235839/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893916300400; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2016.05.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893916300400","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs3NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":["Australia","New Zealand","Canada"],"keyphrases":["travel dates","included country of travel","recent travel","overseas travel","Results Travel-related information","travel health experts","ethnicity information","Methods Surveillance forms","surveillance systems","national surveillance forms","Severity of disease information","Summary Background International travel","current country","vaccination details","ethnicity details","death details","usefulness of variables","strategy-based surveillance","country of usual residence","parents\u0027 country of birth","vaccination status","hospitalisation","Australia","New Zealand","disease severity","imported infection-related policy","indigenous status","departure dates","risk of imported diseases","significant public health problem","time resident","postcode","UK","incubation period","malaria","traveller\u0027s","entry","Canada","hepatitis","dengue","reason","demographics","typhoid","measles","inclusion","little guidance","Conclusions","agreement","census categories"],"language":"en"},

The studies on HAdV infection among children with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) are limited. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence, epidemiology, and genotype of HAdV among children with SARI in China. STUDY DESIGN: Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) or induced sputum (IS) was collected from hospitalised children with SARIs in Beijing (representing Northern China; n = 259) and Zhejiang Province (representing Eastern China; n = 293) from 2007 to 2010. The prevalence of HAdV was screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by sequence typing of PCR fragments that targeted the second half of the hexon gene. In addition, co-infection with other human respiratory viruses, related epidemiological profiles and clinical presentations were investigated. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: In total, 76 (13.8%) of 552 SARI patients were positive for HAdV, and the infection rates of HAdV in Northern and Eastern China were 20.1% (n = 52) and 8.2% (n = 24), respectively. HAdV co-infection with other respiratory viruses was frequent (infection rates: Northern China, 90.4%; Eastern China, 70.8%). The peak seasons for HAdV-B infection was winter and spring. Additionally, members of multiple species (Human mastadenovirus B, C, D and E) were circulating among paediatric patients with SARI, of which HAdV-B (34/52; 65.4%) and HAdV-C (20/24, 83.3%) were the most predominant in Northern and Eastern China, respectively. These findings provide a benchmark for future epidemiology and prevention strategies for HAdV.","publish_time":"2015-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yamin; Zhou, Weimin; Zhao, Yanjie; Wang, Yanqun; Xie, Zhengde; Lou, Yongliang; Tan, Wenjie","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c8e391286fba644689754596eaf50c7f32b5a99.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4391708.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25856575/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0123234","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs3NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARI"],"locations":["Beijing","China","Eastern China"],"keyphrases":["HAdV infection","HAdV-B infection","infection rates of HAdV","HAdV co-infection","HAdV-C","prevalence of HAdV","genotype of HAdV","Northern China","Eastern China","severe acute respiratory infection","SARI patients","human respiratory viruses","Human mastadenovirus B","Human adenoviruses","hospitalised children","future epidemiology","PCR fragments","paediatric patients","related epidemiological profiles","NPAs","Beijing","Nasopharyngeal aspirates","benchmark","members of multiple species","prevention strategies","SARIs","clinical presentations","Zhejiang Province","polymerase chain reaction","STUDY DESIGN","half","HAdVs","winter","peak seasons","induced sputum","pathogens","findings","BACKGROUND","sequence","spring","addition","studies","broad spectrum of diseases","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","total","hexon gene","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

Currently, a virulent PEDV CH/YNKM-8/2013 and a CV777 vaccine strain-like AH-M have been successfully isolated from the clinical samples. To dissect out the underlying pathogenic mechanism of virulent PEDV and clarify the differences between virulent and CV777 vaccine strain-like PEDV infections, we performed an iTRAQ-based comparative quantitative proteomic study of Vero cells infected with both PEDV strains. A total of 661 and 474 differentially expressed proteins were identified upon virulent and CV777 vaccine strain-like isolates infection, respectively. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was employed to investigate the canonical pathways and functional networks involved in both PEDV infections. Comprehensive studies have revealed that the PEDV virulent strain suppressed protein synthesis of Vero cells through down-regulating mTOR as well as its downstream targets 4EBP1 and p70S6K activities, which were validated by immunoblotting. In addition, the virulent strain could activate NF-\u03BAB pathway more intensively than the CV777 vaccine strain-like isolate, and elicit stronger inflammatory cascades as well. These data might provide new insights for elucidating the specific pathogenesis of PEDV infection, and pave the way for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Porcine epidemic diarrhea is now worldwide distributed and causing huge economic losses to swine industry. The immunomodulation and pathogenesis between PEDV and host, as well as the difference between virulent and attenuated strains of PEDV infections are still largely unknown. In this study, we presented for the first application of proteomic analysis to compare whole cellular protein alterations induced by virulent and CV777 vaccine strain-like PEDV infections, which might contribute to understand the pathogenesis of PEDV and anti-viral strategy development.","publish_time":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Xiaozhen; Hu, Han; Chen, Fangzhou; Li, Zhonghua; Ye, Shiyi; Cheng, Shuang; Zhang, Mengjia; He, Qigai","journal":"J Proteomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2cf23712be389cb2970e91da35d19cf25829eb4d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102838.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1874391915301184; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2015.09.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1874391915301184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26361011/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs3OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["PEDV virulent strain","virulent PEDV CH","PEDV strains","CV777 vaccine strain","attenuated strains of PEDV infections","underlying pathogenic mechanism of virulent PEDV","specific pathogenesis of PEDV infection","re-emerging porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","protein synthesis of Vero cells","variant related diarrhea","comparative quantitative proteomic study of Vero cells","application of proteomic analysis","Ingenuity Pathway Analysis","isolates infection","cellular protein alterations","NF-\u03BAB pathway","anti-viral strategy development","development of effective therapeutic strategies","iTRAQ","differences","huge economic losses","functional networks","downstream targets 4EBP1","YNKM","p70S6K activities","swine industry","new insights","mTOR","BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE","host","canonical pathways","stronger inflammatory cascades","immunomodulation","AH","Comprehensive studies","data","China","proteins","addition","global distribution","clinical samples","immunoblotting","total"],"language":"en"},

Thus the fluctuation of cystatin C levels might have more clinical implications than a reflection of kidney functions. Here, we summarize the latest development of studies on the pathophysiological functions of cystatin C, with focus on its immune regulatory roles at both cellular and molecular levels including antigen presentation, secretion of cytokines, synthesis of nitric oxide, as well as apoptosis. Finally, we discuss the clinical implications and therapeutic potentials of what this predominantly expressed protease inhibitor can bring to us.","publish_time":"2018-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zi, Mengting; Xu, Yuekang","journal":"Immunology Letters","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5f84a09b491d9530f03b8e21bb627d4a9c5d6cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112947.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29355583/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165247817305461; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165247817305461; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imlet.2018.01.006","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathophysiological functions of cystatin C","fluctuation of cystatin C levels","molecular levels","clinical implications","various immune responses","cysteine protease inhibitor","tumor development","small molecular weight","immune regulatory roles","reflection of kidney functions","latest development of studies","various physiological processes","secretion of cytokines","antigen presentation","easy detection","focus","growing evidences","synthesis of nitric oxide","inflammatory autoimmune diseases","endogenous antigens","measure","organisms","therapeutic potentials","glomerular filtration rate","pathological conditions","apoptosis","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, basic researches for bat immunology and virus-host interactions are important for understanding bat-derived infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2010-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Zhengli","journal":"Protein \u0026 Cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a3d080d5dcf6771db002366691f35e5d6f0e493.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs13238-010-0029-7.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21203979/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13238-010-0029-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bat viruses","bat immunology","bat-derived infectious diseases","genetic diversity of viruses","virus infections","infectious pathogens","healthy bats","human diseases","virus-host interactions","antiviral activity","specific immune system","basic researches","natural reservoir of emerging","different populations","extant mammals","earth","world","flying mammal","studies"],"language":"en"},

Data about the complex social and spatial structure of interpersonal contacts in the ED will aid construction of biologically plausible transmission risk models that can guide cross infection control. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We sought to determine the number and duration of contacts among patients and staff in a large, busy ED. This prospective study was conducted between 1 July 2009 and 30 June 2010. Two 12-hour shifts per week were randomly selected for study. The study was conducted in the ED of an urban hospital. There were 81 shifts in the planned random sample of 104 (78%) with usable contact data, during which there were 9183 patient encounters. Of these, 6062 (66%) were approached to participate, of which 4732 (78%) agreed. Over the course of the year, 88 staff members participated (84%). A radiofrequency identification (RFID) system was installed and the ED divided into 89 distinct zones structured so copresence of two individuals in any zone implied a very high probability of contact \u003C1 meter apart in space. During study observation periods, patients and staff were given RFID tags to wear. Contact events were recorded. These were further broken down with respect to the nature of the contacts, i.e., patient with patient, patient with staff, and staff with staff. 293,171 contact events were recorded, with a median of 22 contact events and 9 contacts with distinct individuals per participant per shift. Staff-staff interactions were more numerous and longer than patient-patient or patient-staff interactions. CONCLUSIONS: We used RFID to quantify contacts between patients and staff in a busy ED. These results are useful for studies of the spread of infections. By understanding contact patterns most important in potential transmission, more effective prevention strategies may be implemented.","publish_time":"2013-08-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lowery-North, Douglas W.; Hertzberg, Vicki Stover; Elon, Lisa; Cotsonis, George; Hilton, Sarah A.; Vaughns, Christopher F.; Hill, Eric; Shrestha, Alok; Jo, Alexandria; Adams, Nathan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5eb34e4b386106962c368bb7c32db8995190e5c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3749132.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23990915/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0070854","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Staff-staff interactions","patient-patient","patient-staff interactions","staff members","Contact events","patient encounters","contact patterns","patients","duration of contacts","usable contact data","high probability of contact","distinct individuals","prospective study","spatial structure of interpersonal contacts","Infectious individuals","RFID tags","study observation periods","cross infection control","potential transmission","substantial risks of cross infection","distinct zones","hour shifts","plausible transmission risk models","emergency department","construction","effective prevention strategies","studies","meter","copresence","system","results","participant","planned random sample","radiofrequency identification","BACKGROUND","year","week","number","median","spread of infections","urban hospital","respect","nature","space","course","METHODS","FINDINGS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

ILI can be caused by numerous pathogens, however; there is limited information on the etiology and epidemiology of ILI in China. METHODS: We performed a one-year surveillance study (2010) of viral etiology causing ILI and investigated the influence of climate on outbreaks of ILI attributed to viruses at the Outpatient Department of Zhuhai Municipal People\u2019s Hospital in Zhuhai, China. RESULTS: Of the 337,272 outpatients who sought attention in the Outpatient Department of Zhuhai Municipal People\u2019s Hospital in 2010, 3,747 (1.11%) presented with ILI. Of these patients presenting with ILI, 24.66% (924/3,747) had available samples and were enrolled in this study. At least one respiratory virus was identified in 411 patients (44.48%) and 42 (4.55%) were co-infected with two viruses. In patients co-infected with two viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected in 50% (21/42). Among common viral pathogens detected, significant differences in age distributions were observed in seasonal influenza virus A (sFulA, H3N2) and B (sFluB), pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza viruses (H1N1pdm09), RSV, and adenovirus (ADV). Infections with sFluA (H3N2), sFluB, RSV, and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) had characteristic seasonal patterns. The incidences of sFluA (H3N2), ADV, and RSV correlated with air temperature. Alternatively, the incidence of sFluB correlated with relative air humidity. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that a wide range of respiratory viral pathogens are circulating in Zhuhai city. This information needs to be considered by clinicians when treating patients presenting with ILI.","publish_time":"2013-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Hongxia; Wei, Quande; Tan, Aijun; Wang, Leyi","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/921a97ffd33121fd2623fb899b386adce87a8562.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3655035.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23651577/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-143","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI","RSV"],"locations":["China","Zhuhai"],"keyphrases":["epidemiology of ILI","outbreaks of ILI","RSV","influenza viruses","respiratory virus","H3N2","seasonal influenza virus","respiratory syncytial virus","patients co-infected","Zhuhai city","viral etiology","wide range of respiratory viral pathogens","Outpatient Department of Zhuhai Municipal People\u2019s Hospital","common viral pathogens","incidence of sFluB","subset of acute respiratory infections","numerous pathogens","China","ADV","RESULTS","significant differences","air temperature","limited information","incidences of sFluA","significant source of morbidity","characteristic seasonal patterns","relative air humidity","year surveillance study","HMPV","ARI","pandemic H1N1","age distributions","H1N1pdm09","human metapneumovirus","sFulA","influence of climate","attention","illnesses","mortality","outpatients","adenovirus","clinicians","BACKGROUND","available samples","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Using a phylogenetic approach we provide evidence that CoV diversity in bats is shaped by both species richness and their geographical distribution, and that CoVs exhibit clustering at the level of bat genera, with these genus-specific clusters largely associated with distinct CoV species. Co-phylogenetic analyses revealed that cross-species transmission has been more common than co-divergence across coronavirus evolution as a whole, and that cross-species transmission events were more likely between sympatric bat hosts. Notably, however, an analysis of the CoV RNA polymerase phylogeny suggested that many such host-jumps likely resulted in short-term spill-over infections, with little evidence for sustained onward transmission in new co-roosting host species.","publish_time":"2018-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leopardi, Stefania; Holmes, Edward C.; Gastaldelli, Michele; Tassoni, Luca; Priori, Pamela; Scaravelli, Dino; Zamperin, Gianpiero; De Benedictis, Paola","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8af66710ff06fc6311d45b32ffe1d74c05be355c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106311.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134818300121; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134818300121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29355607/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2018.01.012","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["species of bat","species richness","cross-species transmission events","distinct CoV species","new co-roosting host species","Bat CoVs exhibit","evolution of bat coronaviruses","onward transmission","CoV diversity","Co-phylogenetic analyses","long-standing host association","level of bat genera","sympatric bat hosts","respective roles of long-term virus-host co-divergence","CoVs exhibit clustering","little evidence","CoV RNA polymerase phylogeny","coronavirus evolution","phylogenetic approach","extensive genetic diversity","broad geographic range","indicative","geographical distribution","bats","genus-specific clusters","infections","analysis","short-term spill"],"language":"en"},

In this study we determine the impact of respiratory viruses and how viral co-detections/infections can affect clinical LRTI severity in children in a hospital setting. METHODS: Patients younger than 3 years of age admitted to a tertiary hospital in Brazil during the months of high prevalence of respiratory viruses had samples collected from nasopharyngeal aspiration. These samples were tested for 13 different respiratory viruses through real-time PCR (rt-PCR). Patients were followed during hospitalization, and clinical data and population characteristics were collected during that period and at discharge to evaluate severity markers, especially length of hospital stay and oxygen use. Univariate regression analyses identified potential risk factors and multivariate logistic regressions were used to determine the impact of specific viral detections as well as viral co-detections in relation to clinical outcomes. RESULTS: We analyzed 260 episodes of LRTI with a viral detection rate of 85% (n = 222). Co-detection was observed in 65% of all virus-positive episodes. The most prevalent virus was Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) (54%), followed by Human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) (32%) and Human Rhinovirus (HRV) (21%). In the multivariate models, infants with co-detection of HRV \u002B RSV stayed 4.5 extra days (p = 0.004), when compared to infants without the co-detection. The same trends were observed for the outcome of days of supplemental oxygen use. CONCLUSIONS: Although RSV remains as the main cause of LRTI in infants our study indicates an increase in the length of hospital stay and oxygen use in infants with HRV detected by RT-PCR compared to those without HRV. Moreover, one can speculate that when HRV is detected simultaneously with RSV there is an additive effect that may be reflected in more severe clinical outcome. Also, our study identified a significant number of children infected by recently identified viruses, such as hMPV and Human Bocavirus (HBov), and this is a novel finding for poor communities from developing countries.","publish_time":"2013-01-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"da Silva, Emerson Rodrigues; Pitrez, M\u00E1rcio Condessa Paulo; Arruda, Eurico; Mattiello, Rita; Sarria, Edgar E; de Paula, Fl\u00E1via Escremim; Proen\u00E7a-Modena, Jos\u00E9 Luis; Delcaro, Luana Sella; Cintra, Ot\u00E1vio; Jones, Marcus H; Ribeiro, Jos\u00E9 Dirceu; Stein, Renato T","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b8bd44173742cd254617aabc5fdf20fb98f4072.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3598993.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23351117/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-13-41","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs5MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LRTI","HRV   RSV","RSV","HRV"],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["co-detection of HRV","viral co-detections","infants","RSV","impact of respiratory viruses","different respiratory viruses","clinical LRTI severity","Respiratory Syncytial Virus","length of hospital","viral detection rate","episodes of LRTI","study","impact of specific viral detections","tertiary hospital","clinical data","hospital setting","clinical outcomes","rt-PCR","months of high prevalence of respiratory viruses","main cause of LRTI","supplemental oxygen use","severe clinical outcome","Lower respiratory tract infection","real-time PCR","samples","prevalent virus","outcome of days","virus-positive episodes","hMPV","Human Bocavirus","Human Metapneumovirus","Human Rhinovirus","severity markers","multivariate models","poor communities","extra days","Patients younger","multivariate logistic regressions","non-affluent communities","significant number of children","major cause of pediatric morbidity","potential risk factors","mortality","infections","Univariate regression analyses","years of age","Brazil","relation","novel finding","developing countries","population characteristics","period","BACKGROUND","hospitalization","increase","nasopharyngeal aspiration","METHODS","discharge","HBov","additive effect","RESULTS","trends","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Personal protective equipment and negative pressure isolation rooms (NPIRs) have not been completely successful in protecting HCWs. We introduced an innovative, integrated infection control strategy involving triaging patients using barriers, zones of risk, and extensive installation of alcohol dispensers for glove-on hand rubbing. This integrated infection control approach was implemented at a SARS designated hospital (\u2018study hospital\u2019) where NPIRs were not available. The number of HCWs who contracted SARS in the study hospital was compared with the number of HCWs who contracted SARS in 86 Taiwan hospitals that did not use the integrated infection control strategy. Two HCWs contracted SARS in the study hospital (0.03 cases/bed) compared with 93 HCWs in the other hospitals (0.13 cases/bed) during the same three-week period. Our strategy appeared to be effective in reducing the incidence of HCWs contracting SARS. The advantages included rapid implementation without NPIRs, flexibility to transfer patients, and re-inforcement for HCWs to comply with infection control procedures, especially handwashing. The efficacy and low cost are major advantages, especially in countries with large populations at risk and fewer economic resources.","publish_time":"2006-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yen, M.-Y.; Lin, Y.

The sensitivity and specificity of published herd definitions for PMWS were tested on the study farms to consider the role of PCV2 in PMWS. Herds were defined as PMWS-affected, -unaffected or -recovered based on current and past postweaning mortality (PWM), grower pigs with clinical signs of rapid wasting, hairiness and pallor and no other known cause of death on the farm. PCV2 antigen and antibody were not used in the definition of PMWS. In each PMWS-affected herd, up to three sick pigs with the clinical signs above and one healthy pig of a similar age were taken for postmortem examination (PME). In all other herds at least one healthy pig was taken for PME. Lymph nodes were analysed for PCV2 antigen and histological changes, and serum samples were analysed for PCV2 antibody. PCV2 antibody was present in all the herds sampled. There was a non-linear association between PCV2 antigen and antibody. There was no association between the presence of high scores of PCV2 antigen in pigs and the presence of high PWM in herds. PCV2 antigen score was significantly higher in sick than healthy pigs within farms, and high PCV2 score was associated with giant cells, coalescence and absence of germinal centres in lymph nodes. These results did not vary by PMWS-affected, -unaffected or -recovered farms. PCV2 antigen was present at high scores in approximately 10% of healthy pigs on all farms. All three herd definitions of PMWS were highly sensitive, defining PMWS-affected herds as affected, but had a specificity ranging from 23% to 43%. We conclude that the current diagnostic tests for PCV2 indicated higher scores of virus in sick pigs but were not useful to define pigs or herds with PMWS. The ubiquity of PCV2 and the lack of specificity of the PCV2 tests indicate that PCV2 may be a necessary but not sufficient cause of PMWS disease. Linking this with the knowledge that the herd breakdowns occurred in a space time epidemic indicates that another infectious co-factor may be necessary for disease to occur.","publish_time":"2009-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Turner, M.

An underdeveloped and underutilized area in microbial forensics is how the host interacts with microorganisms in a way that provides unique signatures for forensic use. For forensic purposes, an immediate goal is to distinguish a potential victim and innocent person from a perpetrator, and to distinguish between a naturally acquired or intentional infection. Principal methods that are sufficiently developed are characterization of the humoral immune response to microbial antigens including vaccine-induced immunity and detection of antibiotics that may be present in a possible perpetrator. This chapter presents central elements of the host response in a simplified fashion and describes a representative example, which, in the appropriate context, has a high potential of providing evidence that may aid an investigation to distinguish a perpetrator from a victim. This chapter also presents information about the immune system so that the interested reader can have a fuller understanding of the immune response in general.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schutzer, Steven E.","journal":"Microbial Forensics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/331ae4d997fef4a77fa504c94de3c6b97cd7e6e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153337.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128153796000143; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128153796000143","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host response","humoral immune response","immune system","potential victim","forensic use","forensic purposes","chapter","possible perpetrator","forensic analysis of microbes","microbial antigens","microbial forensics","high potential","vaccine-induced immunity","fuller understanding","interested reader","way","simplified fashion","detection of antibiotics","unique signatures","immediate goal","underutilized area","characterization","innocent person","central elements","representative example","appropriate context","evidence","microorganisms","toxins","information","investigation","Principal methods","Abstract Advances","intentional infection"],"language":"en"},

It is not yet clear to what extent specific virus and/or bacteria can mediate this effect. The purpose of this study was to assess the role of virus and bacteria in CD4(\u002B) T cell\u2010derived cytokine production in newborns. We compared the effects of five bacteria (Staphlococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium bifidus) and seven virus (adenovirus, coronavirus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, influenza virus, morbillivirus and poliovirus) on the Th1/Th2 cytokine production in mixed lymphocyte reactions using CD4(\u002B) T cells from cord blood cocultured with allogenic myeloid or plasmacytoid dendritic cells. When comparing the baseline cytokine production prior to microbial stimulation, we observed that cord plasmacytoid DC were stronger inducers of Th2 cytokines (IL\u20105 and IL\u201013) compared with cord myeloid DC and to adult DC. When adding microbes to these cultures, bacteria and virus differed in two major respects; Firstly, all enveloped viruses, but none of the bacteria, blocked Th2 (IL\u201013) production by cord CD4(\u002B) cells. Secondly, all Gram\u2010positive bacteria, but none of the virus, induced IL\u201012p40 responses, but the IL\u201012p40 responses did not affect Th1 cytokine production (IFN\u2010\u03B3). Instead, Th1 responses were correlated with the capacity to induce IFN\u2010\u03B1 secretion, which in cord cells were induced by S. aureus and influenza virus alone. These data imply that enveloped virus can deviate Th2 responses in human cord T cells.","publish_time":"2012-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Svensson, A.; Nordstr\u00F6m, I.; Rudin, A.; Bergstr\u00F6m, T.; Eriksson, K.","journal":"Scand J Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5cb1ec7be016bfadb9ca5187b2af593320fb8518.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7190188.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3083.2012.02676.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22229804/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs1Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. aureus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus","cord cells","role of virus","cord CD4","Th2 cytokine production","Th2 responses","Th1 cytokine production","human cord T cells","herpes simplex virus","cord plasmacytoid DC","cord myeloid DC","extent specific virus","cord blood","Th1 responses","induced IL","Gram\u2010positive bacteria","derived cytokine production","baseline cytokine production","12p40 responses","plasmacytoid dendritic cells","blocked Th2","adult DC","IFN","stronger inducers of Th2 cytokines","Staphlococcus aureus","enveloped viruses","beneficial effect","Clostridium difficile","Escherichia coli","cytomegalovirus","Lactobacillus rhamnosus","mixed lymphocyte reactions","Bifidobacterium bifidus","coronavirus","morbillivirus","microbial stimulation","adenovirus","capacity","\u03B1 secretion","poliovirus","risk of allergen sensitization","immune system","newborns","major respects","allergic disease","life","effects","cultures","study","microbes","data","purpose","Infections"],"language":"en"},

Their evaluation has revealed a number of basic insights into specificity, rules of reactivity (tolerance), and memory\u2014namely, (1) Specificity of neutralizing antibodies is defined by their capacity to distinguish between virus serotypes; (2) B cell reactivity is determined by antigen structure, concentration, and time of availability in secondary lymphoid organs; and (3) B cell memory is provided by elevated protective antibody titers in serum that are depending on antigen stimulation. These perhaps slightly overstated rules are simple, correlate with in vivo evidence as well as clinical observations, and appear to largely demystify many speculations about antibodies and B cell physiology. The chapter also considers successful vaccines and compares them with those infectious diseases where efficient protective vaccines are lacking, it is striking to note that all successful vaccines induce high levels of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that are both necessary and sufficient to protect the host from disease. Successful vaccination against infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy, or HIV would require induction of additional long-lasting T cell responses to control infection.","publish_time":"2001-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zinkernagel, Rolf M.; Lamarre, Alain; Ciurea, Adrian; Hunziker, Lukas; Ochsenbein, Adrian F.; Mccoy, Kathy D.; Fehr, Thomas; Bachmann, Martin F.; Kalinke, Ulrich; Hengartner, Hans","journal":"Advances in Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/740a93c04a1ec5b28780fda41258cc880379636c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065277601790013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065277601790013","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["B cell reactivity","B cell memory","Specificity of neutralizing antibodies","successful vaccines","B cell physiology","high levels of neutralizing antibodies","Publisher Summary Neutralizing antibodies","infectious diseases","efficient protective vaccines","rules of reactivity","Successful vaccination","induction of additional long-lasting T cell responses","antigen structure","antigen stimulation","overstated rules","elevated protective antibody titers","time of availability","serum","important effectors of immunity","HIV","tuberculosis","leprosy","number of basic insights","secondary lymphoid organs","concentration","infection","capacity","tolerance","speculations","virus serotypes","host","evidence","viruses","clinical observations","evaluation","chapter"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A systematic review (registration: 10.17605/OSF.IO/6PZ5E) of the health and medical research literature was used to uncover any evidence-based incentives, with pre- and post-empirical data that examined data sharing rates. We were also interested in quantifying and classifying the number of opinion pieces on the importance of incentives, the number observational studies that analysed data sharing rates and practices, and strategies aimed at increasing data sharing rates. RESULTS: Only one incentive (using open data badges) has been tested in health and medical research that examined data sharing rates. The number of opinion pieces (n = 85) out-weighed the number of article-testing strategies (n = 76), and the number of observational studies exceeded them both (n = 106). CONCLUSIONS: Given that data is the foundation of evidence-based health and medical research, it is paradoxical that there is only one evidence-based incentive to promote data sharing. More well-designed studies are needed in order to increase the currently low rates of data sharing.

This study took immune-informatics approaches to identify B- and T-cell epitopes for surface glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2, followed by estimating their antigenicity and interactions with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. We identified four B cell epitopes, two MHC class-I and nine MHC class-II binding T-cell epitopes, which showed highly antigenic features. Allergenicity, toxicity and physiochemical properties analysis confirmed the specificity and selectivity of epitopes. The stability and safety of epitopes were confirmed by digestion analysis. No mutations were observed in all the selected B- and T-cell epitopes across all isolates from different locations worldwide. Epitopes were thus identified and some of them can be potential candidates for vaccine development.","publish_time":"2020-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Lin; Sun, Ting; He, Yufei; Li, Wendong; Fan, Yubo; Zhang, Jing","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/451b48e918674b51899d2afc438849da973ad062.json; document_parses/pdf_json/949feecec7c10e71532e860f7f1230bd696e8234.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.25.965434","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["B cell epitopes","selectivity of epitopes","safety of epitopes","binding T-cell epitopes","SARS-CoV","MHC class","selected B","digestion analysis","physiochemical properties analysis","human leukocyte antigen","surface glycoprotein","large number of deaths","limited existing therapies","specificity","isolates","infected thousands of people","immune-informatics approaches","antiviral medicines","interactions","HLA","alleles","Allergenicity","toxicity","novel coronavirus","desperate need","different locations","potential candidates","vaccine development","vaccines","study","countries","antigenicity","antigenic features","sudden appearance","outbreak","stability","mutations"],"language":"en"},

Early separation is assumed to reduce the risk of transfer of pathogens from dam to neonatal calf, but a wide range of health benefits associated with extended cow-calf contact has also been documented. The aim of this systematic review was to report and synthesize conclusions from the literature on dairy cow and calf health in conventional rearing versus cow-calf contact systems. Peer-reviewed, published manuscripts, written in English, directly comparing dairy cow or calf health in artificial versus suckling systems, were eligible for inclusion. We conducted 7 targeted searches using Web of Science to identify key literature on important health conditions. The resulting manuscripts underwent a 4-step appraisal process, and further manuscripts were sourced from reference lists. This process resulted in a final sample of 70 articles that addressed cow and calf health. Sufficient literature was available to assess mastitis in cows, and scours, cryptosporidiosis, Johne\u0027s disease, pneumonia, immunity, and mortality in calves. The results for cryptosporidiosis, pneumonia, immunity, and mortality were mixed, with some differences between studies likely attributable to flawed comparisons between cohorts. Overall, the articles addressing calf scours and mastitis pointed to beneficial or no effects of suckling. The studies addressing Johne\u0027s disease did not find cow-calf contact to be a significant risk factor. In conclusion, the scientific peer-reviewed literature on cow and calf health provides no consistent evidence in support of early separation.","publish_time":"2019-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beaver, Annabelle; Meagher, Rebecca K.; von Keyserlingk, Marina A.G.; Weary, Daniel M.","journal":"Journal of Dairy Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c8f78a9126bf9f6e7304de755a1c0f6693e4a3d0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094284.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030219304175; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022030219304175; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31079908/; https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-15603","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["calf health","calf scours","early cow-calf separation","neonatal calf","extended cow-calf contact","dairy cow","important health conditions","key literature","wide range of health benefits","Sufficient literature","support of early separation","scientific peer-reviewed literature","artificial rearing","mastitis","immunity","pneumonia","suckling systems","Johne\u0027s disease","cryptosporidiosis","articles","resulting manuscripts","studies","mortality","conventional rearing","risk of transfer","effects of suckling","step appraisal process","significant risk factor","consistent evidence","Web of Science","practice","pathogens","dam","proponents","flawed comparisons","differences","cows","public","conclusions","final sample","cohorts","targeted searches","inclusion","results","English","systematic review","aim","ABSTRACT Concern","reference lists","calves"],"language":"en"},

Vaccination and passive antibody therapies are critical for controlling infectious diseases. Passive antibody administration has limitations, including the necessity for purification and multiple injections for efficacy. Vaccination is associated with a lag phase before generation of immunity. Novel approaches reported here utilize the benefits of both methods for the rapid generation of effective immunity. Methods. A novel antibody-based prophylaxis/therapy entailing the electroporation-mediated delivery of synthetic DNA plasmids encoding biologically active anti\u2013chikungunya virus (CHIKV) envelope monoclonal antibody (dMAb) was designed and evaluated for antiviral efficacy, as well as for the ability to overcome shortcomings inherent with conventional active vaccination and passive immunotherapy. Results. One intramuscular injection of dMAb produced antibodies in vivo more rapidly than active vaccination with an anti-CHIKV DNA vaccine. This dMAb neutralized diverse CHIKV clinical isolates and protected mice from viral challenge. Combination of dMAb and the CHIKV DNA vaccine afforded rapid and long-lived protection. Conclusions. A DNA-based dMAb strategy induced rapid protection against an emerging viral infection. This method can be combined with DNA vaccination as a novel strategy to provide both short- and long-term protection against this emerging infectious disease. These studies have implications for pathogen treatment and control strategies.","publish_time":"2016-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muthumani, Karuppiah; Block, Peter; Flingai, Seleeke; Muruganantham, Nagarajan; Chaaithanya, Itta Krishna; Tingey, Colleen; Wise, Megan; Reuschel, Emma L.; Chung, Christopher; Muthumani, Abirami; Sarangan, Gopalsamy; Srikanth, Padma; Khan, Amir S.; Vijayachari, Paluru; Sardesai, Niranjan Y.; Kim, J.

It has strong foundations rooted in over a century of discoveries in the field of virology and recent advances in molecular biology and sequencing technologies. Historically, most studies have deconstructed the concept of viruses into a simplified perception of viral agents as mere pathogens, which demerits the scope of large-scale viromic analyses. Viruses are, in fact, much more than regular parasites. They are by far the most dynamic and abundant entity and the greatest killers on the planet, as well as the most effective geo-transforming genetic engineers and resource recyclers, acting on all life strata in any habitat. Yet, most of this uncanny viral world remains vastly unexplored to date, greatly hindered by the bewildering complexity inherent to such studies and the methodological and conceptual limitations. Viromic studies are just starting to address some of these issues but they still lag behind microbial metagenomics. In recent years, however, higher-throughput analysis and resequencing have rekindled interest in a field that is just starting to show its true potential. In this review, we take a look at the scientific and technological developments that led to the advent of viral and bacterial metagenomics with a particular, but not exclusive, focus on human viromics from an ecological perspective. We also address some of the most relevant challenges that current viral studies face and ponder on the future directions of the field.","publish_time":"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garc\u00EDa-L\u00F3pez, Rodrigo; P\u00E9rez-Brocal, Vicente; Moya, Andr\u00E9s","journal":"Microbial cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5d1e7636378e32ba1d2228d2ec7b3f82ac2661e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6717880.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.15698/mic2019.09.689; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31528630/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral metagenomics","current viral studies","Viromic studies","advent of viral","field of virology","uncanny viral world","simplified perception of viral agents","burgeoning field of research","concept of viruses","bacterial metagenomics","microbial metagenomics","complete collection of viruses","recent advances","recent years","human viromics","scope of large-scale viromic analyses","resource recyclers","demerits","mere pathogens","molecular biology","effective geo-transforming genetic engineers","greatest killers","sequencing technologies","look","abundant entity","technological developments","higher-throughput analysis","resequencing","date","relevant challenges","bewildering complexity inherent","life strata","century of discoveries","ecological perspective","microbiota","fact","conceptual limitations","future directions","given niche","regular parasites","strong foundations","habitat","planet","true potential","issues","review"],"language":"en"},

Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a mechanism through which dengue viruses, feline coronaviruses, and HIV viruses take advantage of anti-viral humoral immune responses to infect host target cells. Here we describe our observations of SARS-CoV using ADE to enhance the infectivity of a HL-CZ human promonocyte cell line. Quantitative-PCR and immunofluorescence staining results indicate that SARS-CoV is capable of replication in HL-CZ cells, and of displaying virus-induced cytopathic effects and increased levels of TNF-\u03B1, IL-4 and IL-6 two days post-infection. According to flow cytometry data, the HL-CZ cells also expressed angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, a SARS-CoV receptor) and higher levels of the Fc\u03B3RII receptor. We found that higher concentrations of anti-sera against SARS-CoV neutralized SARS-CoV infection, while highly diluted anti-sera significantly increased SARS-CoV infection and induced higher levels of apoptosis. Results from infectivity assays indicate that SARS-CoV ADE is primarily mediated by diluted antibodies against envelope spike proteins rather than nucleocapsid proteins. We also generated monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins and observed that most of them promoted SARS-CoV infection. Combined, our results suggest that antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins may trigger ADE effects. The data raise new questions regarding a potential SARS-CoV vaccine, while shedding light on mechanisms involved in SARS pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2014-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Sheng-Fan; Tseng, Sung-Pin; Yen, Chia-Hung; Yang, Jyh-Yuan; Tsao, Ching-Han; Shen, Chun-Wei; Chen, Kuan-Hsuan; Liu, Fu-Tong; Liu, Wu-Tse; Chen, Yi-Ming Arthur; Huang, Jason C.","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4b1738f5d5f9156ef5b11673d8d454fe9fa4a22.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092860.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25073113/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X14013321; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X14013321; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.07.090","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ADE","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV ADE","SARS-CoV neutralized SARS-CoV infection","SARS-CoV receptor","SARS-CoV spike proteins","increased SARS-CoV infection","potential SARS-CoV vaccine","SARS pathogenesis","observations of SARS","CZ cells","ADE effects","envelope spike proteins","diluted antibodies","nucleocapsid proteins","diluted anti-sera","higher levels of apoptosis","higher concentrations of anti-sera","increased levels of TNF","monoclonal antibodies","days post-infection","host target cells","immunofluorescence staining results","HIV viruses","dengue viruses","cytopathic effects","infectivity assays","Fc\u03B3RII receptor","CZ human promonocyte cell line","advantage of anti-viral humoral immune responses","flow cytometry data","feline coronaviruses","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","enzyme","light","ACE2","new questions","capable of replication","prophylactic strategy","control","Quantitative-PCR","angiotensin","mechanisms","Antibody-dependent enhancement","prevention","reemergence","efforts"],"language":"en"},

Alongside these efforts, there has been an increasing role for quantitative analysis and modeling to support the achievement of these goals through evaluation of the likely impact of interventions, the factors that could undermine these achievements, and the role of new diagnostics and treatments in reducing transmission.

The study objective was to document case management of ECoV in adult horses presented to a referral hospital and compare to a cohort of horses that tested negative for ECoV. A retrospective case series was performed based on positive real-time quantitative PCR results for ECoV on faeces from horses treated at the UC Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital from 1 March 2012 to 31 March 2018. Horses negative for ECoV were matched to the ECoV-positive group as controls. Data collected included signalment, history, exam findings, diagnostics, treatment, and follow-up. Thirty-three horses (median age, 11 years; range, 2\u201337 years) tested ECoV-positive, including three horses with co-infections. Presenting complaints for ECoV-infected horses included historic fevers (n = 25/30; 83%), anorexia (n = 14/30; 47%), and colic (n = 13/30; 43%). ECoV-positive horses had significantly lower white blood cell (median, 3.0 \u00D7 109/L; range, 0.68\u201316.2 \u00D7 109/L), neutrophil (median, 1.26 \u00D7 109/L; range, 0.15\u201314.4 \u00D7 109/L), and lymphocyte (median, 0.86 \u00D7 109/L; range, 0.42\u20133.47 \u00D7 109/L) counts than ECoV-negative horses. Electrolyte and metabolic derangements and scant faeces were common. Twenty-seven horses were hospitalised for a median of 5 days (range, 0.5\u201314 days), with 26/27 (96%) horses surviving to discharge. ECoV infection should be a differential diagnosis for adult horses with fever, colic, anorexia, and leukopenia. The disease has a low mortality rate, but horses may require intensive care to resolve severe leukopenia, systemic inflammation, and metabolic disturbances.","publish_time":"2019-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berryhill, E.

While a sudden increase of such magnitude represents a shock to the health system, threatening the continuity of service delivery and destabilizing governance, it also offers a unique opportunity to study resilience of a health system amidst ongoing crisis. METHODS: We conceptualized resilience as the capacity of a health system to absorb internal or external shocks (for example prevent or contain disease outbreaks and maintain functional health institutions) while sustaining achievements. We explored factors contributing to the resilience of the Lebanese health system, including networking with stakeholders, diversification of the health system, adequate infrastructure and health human resources, a comprehensive communicable disease response and the integration of the refugees within the health system. RESULTS: In studying the case of Lebanon we used input\u2013process\u2013output\u2013outcome approach to assess the resilience of the Lebanese health system. This approach provided us with a holistic view of the health system, as it captured not only the sustained and improved outcomes, but also the inputs and processes leading to them.

Information on the viral aetiology of acute respiratory infections in developing countries is very limited. The study was done to identify viruses associated with acute lower respiratory tract infection among children less than 5 years. METHOD: Nasopharyngeal samples and blood cultures were collected from children less than 5 years who have been hospitalized for acute lower respiratory tract infection. Viruses and bacteria were identified using Reverse Transcriptase Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction and conventional biochemical techniques. RESULTS: Out of 128 patients recruited, 33(25.88%%, 95%CI: 18.5% to 34.2%) were positive for one or more viruses. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) was detected in 18(14.1%, 95%CI: 8.5% to 21.3%) patients followed by Adenoviruses (AdV) in 13(10.2%, 95%CI: 5.5% to 16.7%), Parainfluenza (PIV type: 1, 2, 3) in 4(3.1%, 95%CI: 0.9% to 7.8%) and influenza B viruses in 1(0.8%, 95%CI: 0.0 to 4.3). Concomitant viral and bacterial co-infection occurred in two patients. There were no detectable significant differences in the clinical signs, symptoms and severity for the various pathogens isolated. A total of 61.1% (22/36) of positive viruses were detected during the rainy season and Respiratory Syncytial Virus was the most predominant. CONCLUSION: The study has demonstrated an important burden of respiratory viruses as major causes of childhood acute respiratory infection in a tertiary health institution in Ghana. The data addresses a need for more studies on viral associated respiratory tract infection.","publish_time":"2012-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kwofie, Theophilus B; Anane, Yaw A; Nkrumah, Bernard; Annan, Augustina; Nguah, Samuel B; Owusu, Michael","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b47bb3bca780af716c9e986d983f1d2364136c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3364910.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-78; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22490115/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs4MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Reverse Transcriptase Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction"],"locations":["Ghana"],"keyphrases":["Acute respiratory tract infections","acute lower respiratory tract infection","viral associated respiratory tract infection","Respiratory Syncytial Virus","important burden of respiratory viruses","major causes of childhood acute respiratory infection","viral aetiology of acute respiratory infections","positive viruses","patients","influenza B viruses","bacterial co-infection","young children","developing countries","study","years","major causes of morbidity","Reverse Transcriptase Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction","mortality","studies","symptoms","clinical signs","conventional biochemical techniques","tertiary health institution","rainy season","severity","blood cultures","detectable significant differences","METHOD","Nasopharyngeal samples","need","BACKGROUND","various pathogens","Ghana","Information","RSV","Parainfluenza","PIV type","data","Adenoviruses","AdV","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","total"],"language":"en"},

Thus, computational methods play a pivotal role in generating plausible structures which can be used in the drug development process. In this review the accumulation of structural data is introduced from a historical perspective.

Our objective was to obtain a better understanding of LMTs in order to help travel medicine providers develop improved strategies to decrease the number of LMTs and potentially reduce travel-related morbidity. METHODS: We defined LMTs as travellers with a departure date of 7 days or fewer from the medical encounter. We analysed the characteristics and health preparation of 12 494 LMTs who presented to a network of US clinical practices for pre-travel health advice between January 2009 and December 2015. RESULTS: LMTs comprised 16% of all travellers. More LMTs than non-LMTs travelled for business or to visit friends and relatives (VFR) (26% vs 16% and 15% vs 8%, respectively; P\u003C 0.0001). More LMTs also travelled for longer than 1 month (27% vs 21%; P\u003C0.0001) and visited only urban areas (40% vs 29%; P\u003C0.0001). At least one travel vaccine was deferred by 18% of LMTs because of insufficient time before departure. Vaccines that required multiple vaccinations, such as Japanese encephalitis and rabies, were the most likely to be deferred because of time constraints. CONCLUSION: Interventions to improve the timing of pre-travel health consultations should be developed, particularly for business and VFR travellers. Recently endorsed accelerated vaccine schedules for Japanese encephalitis and rabies may help some LMTs receive protection against these infections despite late presentation for pre-travel health care.","publish_time":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yates, Johnnie A.; Rao, Sowmya R.; Walker, Allison Taylor; Esposito, Douglas H.; Sotir, Mark; LaRocque, Regina C.; Ryan, Edward T.","journal":"Journal of Travel Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b380f4b2e974660b0ccadea0d1f6fcaca77594db.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6736758.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jtm/taz031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31044254/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs4Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["US","VFR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of LMTs","non-LMTs","pre-travel health care","travel vaccine","pre-travel preparation","better understanding of LMTs","pre-travel health advice","vs","timing of pre-travel health consultations","health preparation","health care providers","travel-related morbidity","VFR travellers","insufficient time","Last-minute travellers","Japanese encephalitis","rabies","business","time constraints","recommended vaccinations","medicine providers","multiple vaccinations","departure date","accelerated vaccine schedules","late presentation","present challenges","network of US clinical practices","infections","days","fewer","order","protection","improved strategies","medical encounter","friends","relatives","Interventions","BACKGROUND","characteristics","objective","CONCLUSION","Vaccines","urban areas","METHODS","month","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

In addition, a few inhibitors of the pyrimidine biosynthesis have shown to induce the innate immunity in a yet-to-be-determined manner and inhibit the virus infection. Thus, we also investigated whether the anti-enteroviral activity of gemcitabine is mediated by innate immunity, induction of which is related with the inhibition of the pyrimidine synthesis. In this study, we found that the addition of exogenous cytidine, uridine and uridine mono-phosphate (UMP) effectively reversed the antiviral activity of gemcitabine in enterovirus-infected as well as enteroviral replicon-harboring cells, demonstrating gemcitabine\u2019s targeting of the salvage pathway. Moreover, the expression of several interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs) was significantly induced by the treatment of gemcitabine, which was also suppressed by the co-treatment with cytidine.

However, any misleading information can directly affect patients\u2019 choices of hospitals and drugs, and potentially exacerbate their health condition. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the congruence between crowdsourced information and official government data in the health care domain and identifies the determinants of low congruence where it exists. In-line with infodemiology, we suggest measures to help the patients in the regions vulnerable to inaccurate health information. METHODS: We text-mined multiple online health communities in South Korea to construct the data for crowdsourced information on public health services (173,748 messages). Kendall tau and Spearman rank order correlation coefficients were used to compute the differences in 2 ranking systems of health care quality: actual government evaluations of 779 hospitals and mining results of geospecific online health communities. Then we estimated the effect of sociodemographic characteristics on the level of congruence by using an ordinary least squares regression. RESULTS: The regression results indicated that the standard deviation of married women\u2019s education (P=.046), population density (P=.01), number of doctors per pediatric clinic (P=.048), and birthrate (P=.002) have a significant effect on the congruence of crowdsourced data (adjusted R (2)=.33). Specifically, (1) the higher the birthrate in a given region, (2) the larger the variance in educational attainment, (3) the higher the population density, and (4) the greater the number of doctors per clinic, the more likely that crowdsourced information from online communities is congruent with official government data. CONCLUSIONS: To investigate the cause of the spread of misleading health information in the online world, we adopted a unique approach by associating mining results on hospitals from geospecific online health communities with the sociodemographic characteristics of corresponding regions. We found that the congruence of crowdsourced information on health care services varied across regions and that these variations could be explained by geospecific demographic factors. This finding can be helpful to governments in reducing the potential risk of misleading online information and the accompanying safety issues.","publish_time":"2014-02-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Minki; Jung, Yuchul; Jung, Dain; Hur, Cinyoung","journal":"J Med Internet Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3936264.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/jmir.3078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24496094/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Kendall","Spearman"],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["inaccurate health information","health condition","health care services","spread of misleading health information","congruence of crowdsourced information","multiple online health communities","health care domain","misleading information","mining results of geospecific online health communities","online communities","public health services","congruence of crowdsourced data","ranking systems of health care quality","potential risk of misleading online information","online world","official government data","level of congruence","regression results","associating mining results","determinants of low congruence","effect of sociodemographic characteristics","sociodemographic characteristics of corresponding regions","regions vulnerable","number of doctors","birthrate","population density","actual government evaluations","patients\u2019 choices of hospitals","geospecific demographic factors","pediatric clinic","significant effect","squares regression","South Korea","Spearman rank order correlation coefficients","unique approach","Kendall tau","standard deviation of married women\u2019s education","knowledge","accompanying safety issues","governments","differences","benefit","society","cause","drugs","adjusted R","study","educational attainment","given region","collective intelligence","variance","measures","variations","messages","infodemiology","finding","OBJECTIVE","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

A six-month longitudinal study was conducted in 30 Thoroughbred racehorses (21 two-year-olds, five three-year-olds and four four-year-olds) during the Flat racing season. Sera were tested for the presence of antibodies against equine herpesvirus 1 and 4 (EHV-1 and EHV-4) and equine rhinitis viruses A and B (ERAV and ERBV) by complement fixation (CF) and equine arteritis virus (EAV) by ELISA. Antibodies against equine influenza (EI) were measured by haemagglutination inhibition (HI). Only ERAV was circulating in the yard throughout the six-month study period. Seroconversion to ERAV frequently correlated with clinical respiratory disease and was significantly associated with subsequent failure to race (p = 0.0009). Over 55% of the two-year-olds in the study seroconverted to ERAV in May and June. In contrast, only one seroconversion to ERAV was observed in the older horses. They remained free of any signs of respiratory disease and raced successfully throughout the study period. The importance of ERAV as a contributory factor in the interruption of training programmes for young horses may be underestimated.","publish_time":"2019-10-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Back, Helena; Weld, John; Walsh, Cathal; Cullinane, Ann","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a383f04a8ddfeba2113f27e82c41d0582feb276.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6848918.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635401/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v11100963","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sera"],"organizations":["ERAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["year-olds","importance of ERAV","six-month study period","six-month longitudinal study","equine herpesvirus","equine influenza","respiratory viruses","equine rhinitis viruses","training yard","equine arteritis virus","clinical respiratory disease","signs of respiratory disease","EHV","Seroconversion","elite racehorses","Thoroughbred racehorses","young horses","presence of antibodies","older horses","interruption of training programmes","serological testing of serial samples","contributory factor","impact","CF","EI","fixation","EAV","ERBV","Flat racing season","haemagglutination inhibition","health status","ability","ELISA","subsequent failure","contrast","Sera","aim"],"language":"en"},

A Mpro homodimer structure suitable for docking simulations was prepared using a crystal structure (PDB ID: 6Y2G; resolution 2.20 \u00C5). Structural refinement was performed in the presence of peptidomimetic \u03B1-ketoamide inhibitors, which were previously disconnected from each Cys145 of the Mpro homodimer, and energy calculations were performed.

Some 265 insert-containing clones were studied. Hybridization of these inserts with poly(A)\u002B RNA extracted from infected cells led to the conclusion that they were located at the 3\u2032-end of the genome. After subcloning in M13 phage DNA, clones were sequenced by the Sanger technique. A 1,710-nucleotide sequence corresponding to the gene coding for the viral N-protein was established. It shows 2 overlapping open reading frames (ORF). The 3\u2032-non-coding end of the gene has an 8-nucleotide sequence in common with the homologous genome areas of MHV, TGE and IBV viruses. This sequence may represent the polymerase RNA binding site. An upstream sequence surrounding the first AUG of the smaller ORF corresponds to a potentially functional initiation codon. The sequence of the primary translation product deduced from the DNA sequence predicts a polypeptide of 207 amino acids (22.9 Kd) with a high leucine (19.8%) content, possessing a hydrophobic N-terminal end. The larger ORF has a coding capacity of 448 amino acids (49.4 Kd), corresponding to the N-protein molecular weight. The deduced protein possesses 43 serine residues (9.6% of the total amino acid content) which may be phosporylated and involved in N-protein/RNA binding. N-protein also has 5 regions with a high basic amino acid content. One of them is also serine-rich and has a strong homology site with MHV, TGE and IBV viruses. In the first part of the N-terminal, a 12-amino-acid sequence (PRWYFYYLGTGP) is highly conserved for BECV-F15, JHM, TGE and IBV viruses. BCV Mebus strain and BECV-F15 have only minor differences in their N-protein sequence.","publish_time":"1988-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cruci\u00E8re, C.; Laporte, J.","journal":"Annales de l\u0027Institut Pasteur / Virologie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c42c87fbe3db7e3378903156b6b30d7dba0b8760.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0769261788800121; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0769261788800121","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs1MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sanger"],"organizations":["RNA","ORF","IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["N-protein sequence","N protein","viral N-protein","amino-acid sequence","DNA sequence","nucleotide sequence","upstream sequence","deduced protein","N-protein molecular weight","BECV-F15","amino acids","hydrophobic N-terminal end","TGE","total amino acid content","IBV viruses","high basic amino acid content","gene coding","viral genomic RNA","non-coding end","polymerase RNA binding site","coding capacity","clones","Kd","larger ORF","smaller ORF","bovine enteritic coronavirus-F15 strain","homologous genome areas of MHV","high leucine","serine-rich","serine residues","strong homology site","BCV Mebus strain","M13 phage DNA","JHM","regions","minor differences","PRWYFYYLGTGP","primary translation product","oligo-dT","subcloning","polypeptide","cDNA","functional initiation codon","open reading frames","infected cells","Summary Sequences","PBR322 plasmid","Hybridization","inserts","conclusion","Sanger technique"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to understand the safety partnership preferences of patients and their families. METHOD: We used a discrete choice conjoint experiment to model the safety partnership preferences of 1,084 patients or those such as parents acting on their behalf. Participants made choices between hypothetical safety partnerships composed by experimentally varying 15 four-level partnership design attributes. RESULTS: Participants preferred an approach to safety based on partnerships between patients and staff rather than a model delegating responsibility for safety to hospital staff. They valued the opportunity to participate in point of service safety partnerships, such as identity and medication double checks, that might afford an immediate risk reduction. Latent class analysis yielded two segments. Actively engaged participants (73.3%) comprised outpatients with higher education, who anticipated more benefits to safety partnerships, were more confident in their ability to contribute, and were more intent on participating. They were more likely to prefer a personal engagement strategy, valued scientific evidence, preferred a more active approach to safety education, and advocated disclosure of errors. The passively engaged segment (26.7%) anticipated fewer benefits, were less confident in their ability to contribute, and were less intent on participating. They were more likely to prefer an engagement strategy based on signage. They preferred that staff explain why they thought patients should help make care safer and decide whether errors were disclosed. Inpatients, those with immigrant backgrounds, and those with less education were more likely to be in this segment. CONCLUSION: Health services need to communicate information regarding risks, ask about partnership preferences, create opportunities respecting individual differences, and ensure a positive response when patients raise safety concerns.","publish_time":"2016-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cunningham, Charles E; Hutchings, Tracy; Henderson, Jennifer; Rimas, Heather; Chen, Yvonne","journal":"Patient Prefer Adherence","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/defb3d3bd1f210f27426c5f20d48c398f6600587.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4968982.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27555752/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ppa.s105605","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs1NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["safety education","safety partnership preferences of patients","safety concerns","hypothetical safety partnerships","health service safety","point of service safety partnerships","engaged participants","families","hospital staff","higher education","OBJECTIVE","participating","ability","level partnership design attributes","personal engagement strategy","active approach","Health services","fewer benefits","model delegating responsibility","advocated disclosure of errors","identity","efforts","scientific evidence","positive response","individual differences","discrete choice conjoint experiment","important role","information","risks","opportunities","choices","study","medication double checks","Latent class analysis","segments","outpatients","care safer","immigrant backgrounds","immediate risk reduction","Inpatients","METHOD","CONCLUSION","opportunity","signage","parents","RESULTS","behalf"],"language":"en"},

Here we provide evidence that IFITM proteins, particularly IFITM2 and IFITM3, specifically antagonize the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env), thereby inhibiting viral infection. IFITM proteins interact with HIV-1 Env in viral producer cells, leading to impaired Env processing and virion incorporation. Notably, the level of IFITM incorporation into HIV-1 virions does not strictly correlate with the extent of inhibition. Prolonged passage of HIV-1 in IFITM-expressing T lymphocytes leads to emergence of Env mutants that overcome IFITM restriction. The ability of IFITMs to inhibit cell-to-cell infection can be extended to HIV-1 primary isolates, HIV-2 and SIVs; however, the extent of inhibition appears to be virus strain-dependent. Overall, our study uncovers a mechanism by which IFITM proteins specifically antagonize HIV-1 Env to restrict HIV-1 infection, and provides insight into the specialized role of IFITMs in HIV infection.","publish_time":"2015-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Jingyou; Li, Minghua; Wilkins, Jordan; Ding, Shilei; Swartz, Talia H.; Esposito, Anthony M.; Zheng, Yi-Min; Freed, Eric O.; Liang, Chen; Chen, Benjamin K.; Liu, Shan-Lu","journal":"Cell Reports","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/60cc45f9410eecc3417c81c4487fcbc495ce6ef4.json; document_parses/pdf_json/41dd888191417d965bb185997e7d6bab2bca28ce.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4112df5f3296e53350b58d319e817e202a5d4a99.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4602366.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211124715009523; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2015.08.055; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124715009523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26387945/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs1NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFITM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HIV infection","IFITM proteins","IFITM restriction","Prolonged passage of HIV","level of IFITM incorporation","viral infection","cell infection","impaired Env processing","emergence of Env mutants","extent of inhibition","virion incorporation","ability of IFITMs","viral producer cells","specialized role of IFITMs","T lymphocytes","insight","IFITM2","IFITM3","primary isolates","virus strain-dependent","SIVs","mechanism","evidence","envelope glycoprotein","virions","interferon","study","viruses"],"language":"en"},

This condition has been referred as PCV2-enteric disease (PCV2-ED). The present study analysed retrospectively, from a pathological point of view, the relation between intestinal disorders and PCV2 infection in nursery and growing-finishing pigs. Among the 96 selected pigs suffering from enteric disease and submitted for necropsy between 1998 and 2011, the most prevalent enteric lesions were catarrhal enteritis/colitis (77.1%), followed by fibrinous lesions (11.5%), granulomatous inflammation (4.2%) and other lesions such as haemorrhages or ulceration (4.2%). Seventy-two pigs (75%) were positive for PCV2 by in situ hybridization (ISH). Among positive pigs for PCV2 ISH, 39 animals suffered from PCV2-SD and 33 had no lymphoid lesions but low amount of viral nucleic acid in several lymphoid tissues, therefore, these animals did not qualify for PCVD-ED. In conclusion, all animals with enteric disorders that were positive to PCV2 by ISH had evidence of viral systemic infection. These results suggest that PCV2-ED is probably a negligible condition and PCV2 mainly contributes to enteric clinical disorders in relation to PCV2-SD occurrence.","publish_time":"2015-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bar\u00F3, J.; Segal\u00E9s, J.; Mart\u00EDnez, J.","journal":"Vet Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f0fec8db0ea3eb7ab53b1ed44b0ff631bf297ea9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172167.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113515000085; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2015.01.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113515000085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25631251/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ISH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCV2 infection","PCV2 ISH","PCV2-ED","PCV2-enteric disease","PCV2-systemic disease","PCV2-SD occurrence","enteric disorders","enteric clinical disorders","positive pigs","prevalent enteric lesions","Intestinal disorders","enteric clinical signs","lymphoid lesions","animals","selected pigs","fibrinous lesions","relation","evidence of viral systemic infection","possible restricted intestinal infection","lymphoid tissues","negligible condition","viral nucleic acid","Porcine circovirus type","catarrhal enteritis","nursery","infectious agents","pathological point of view","authors","colitis","conclusion","situ hybridization","PCVD-","haemorrhages","ulceration","necropsy","results","present study","granulomatous inflammation"],"language":"en"},

We examined the mechanism of apoptosis induction by CIV. High CIV doses (CIVXS; 400 \u03BCg/ml), UV-irradiated virus (CIVUV; 10 \u03BCg/ml) and CVPE (CIV protein extract; 10 \u03BCg/ml) induced apoptosis in 60% of treated Choristoneura fumiferana (IPRI-CF-124T) cells. Normal doses of infectious CIV (10 \u03BCg/ml) induced apoptosis in only 10% of C. fumiferana (CF) cells. Apoptosis was inhibited by Z-IETD-FMK, an apical caspase inhibitor, indicating that CIV-induced apoptosis requires caspase activity. The putative caspase in CF cells was designated Cf-caspase-i. CIVUV or CVPE enhanced Cf-caspase-i activity by 80% at 24 h relative to mock-treated cells. Since the MAP kinase pathway induces or inhibits apoptosis depending on the context, we used JNK inhibitor SP600125 and demonstrated drastic suppression of CVPE-induced apoptosis. Thus, the JNK signaling pathway is significant for apoptosis in this system. Virus interaction with the cell surface was not sufficient for apoptosis since CIVUV particles bound to polysterene beads failed to induce apoptosis. Endocytosis inhibitors (bafilomycin or ammonium chloride) negated apoptosis induction by CIVUV, CIVXS or CVPE indicating that entry through this mode is required. Given the weak apoptotic response to infectious CIV, we postulated that viral gene expression inhibited apoptosis. CIV infection of cells pretreated with cycloheximide induced apoptosis in 69% of the cells compared to 10% in normal infections. Furthermore, blocking viral DNA replication with aphidicolin or phosphonoacetic acid suppressed apoptosis and Cf-caspase-i activity, indicating that early viral expression is necessary for inhibition of apoptosis, and de novo synthesis of viral proteins is not required for induction. We show for the first time that, in a member of the family Iridoviridae, apoptosis: (i) requires entry and endocytosis of virions or virion proteins, (ii) is inhibited under conditions permitting early viral expression, and (iii) requires the JNK signaling pathway. This is the first report of JNK signal requirement during apoptosis induction by an insect virus.","publish_time":"2008-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chitnis, Nilesh S.; D\u0027Costa, Susan M.; Paul, Eric R.; Bilimoria, Sh\u00E4n L.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/efed42446734ed8b6ddd5864e39b99219b7fd40c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103334.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682207006022; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682207006022","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CIV","CVPE","CF","JNK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CIV-induced apoptosis","inhibition of apoptosis","cycloheximide induced apoptosis","negated apoptosis induction","mechanism of apoptosis induction","CF cells","phosphonoacetic acid suppressed apoptosis","CIV infection of cells","caspase activity","designated Cf-caspase","CVPE enhanced Cf-caspase","\u03BCg","IPRI-CF","putative caspase","High CIV doses","early viral expression","Normal doses of infectious CIV","apical caspase inhibitor","CIV protein extract","viral gene expression","mock-treated cells","CIVUV particles","insect virus","Virus interaction","viral DNA replication","JNK inhibitor SP600125","novo synthesis of viral proteins","drastic suppression of CVPE","CIVXS","UV-irradiated virus","family Iridoviridae","entry","report of JNK signal requirement","Abstract Chilo iridescent virus","treated Choristoneura fumiferana","MAP kinase pathway","Endocytosis inhibitors","endocytosis of virions","virion proteins","normal infections","ammonium chloride","aphidicolin","bafilomycin","isometric","FMK","cell surface","h relative","type species","polysterene beads","cytoplasmic dsDNA viruses","weak apoptotic response","Z-IETD","member","context","conditions","mode","system","time"],"language":"en"},

To shed some light on the feasibility of detecting airborne pathogens, a sensor integration study has been conducted and computational investigations of contaminant transport in an aircraft cabin have been performed. Our study took into consideration sensor sensitivity as well as the time-to-answer, size, weight and the power of best available commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices. We conducted computational fluid dynamics simulations to investigate three types of scenarios: (1) nominal breathing (up to 20 breaths per minute) and coughing (20 times per hour); (2) nominal breathing and sneezing (4 times per hour); and (3) nominal breathing only. Each scenario was implemented with one or seven infectious passengers expelling air and sneezes or coughs at the stated frequencies. Scenario 2 was implemented with two additional cases in which one infectious passenger expelled 20 and 50 sneezes per hour, respectively. All computations were based on 90 minutes of sampling using specifications from a COTS aerosol collector and biosensor. Only biosensors that could provide an answer in under 20 minutes without any manual preparation steps were included. The principal finding was that the steady-state bacteria concentrations in aircraft would be high enough to be detected in the case where seven infectious passengers are exhaling under scenarios 1 and 2 and where one infectious passenger is actively exhaling in scenario 2. Breathing alone failed to generate sufficient bacterial particles for detection, and none of the scenarios generated sufficient viral particles for detection to be feasible. These results suggest that more sensitive sensors than the COTS devices currently available and/or sampling of individual passengers would be needed for the detection of bacteria and viruses in aircraft.","publish_time":"2011-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hwang, Grace M.; DiCarlo, Anthony A.; Lin, Gene C.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0700c01d64e50ef5ae5943328bd734718cf614f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3022008.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014520; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21264266/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious passengers","nominal breathing","hour","COTS devices","detection of bacteria","spread of infectious disease","sneezes","aircraft cabin","minutes of sampling","types of scenarios","sampling of individual passengers","times","answer","COTS aerosol collector","sensor integration study","sufficient viral particles","sufficient bacterial particles","power of best available commercial off-the-shelf","commercial airliner travel","consideration sensor sensitivity","steady-state bacteria concentrations","computational investigations of contaminant transport","computational fluid dynamics simulations","airborne pathogens","weight","coughs","specifications","sensitive sensors","size","coughing","breaths","sneezing","realistic threat","additional cases","feasibility","manual preparation steps","stated frequencies","viruses","principal finding","light","results","biosensors","computations"],"language":"en"},

Mass vaccination is conducted in Morocco using a vaccine against Massachusetts, which is the most dominant serotype; however no information about the pathogenesis and tissue distribution of the Moroccan Italy 02 genotype was reported. 40 one-day-old specific pathogen free chickens were divided randomly into four groups. Group1, 2 and 3 were inoculated intra oculo-nasally with 103.5 EID50 of Italy02 viruses, and group 4 was kept as control. Chickens in each group were monitored for 14 days post-infection (pi). RESULTS: Chickens in all infected groups showed severe respiratory signs, which most of them have been reproduced on 2dpi, with varying times of appearance and disappearance. The infected birds appeared lethargic, reluctant to move, with specific respiratory clinical signs and macroscopic lesions. However no nephritis lesions or mortality were recorded in all groups. The specific histological lesions finding in all infected birds, exhibited tracheal lesions with mucosal thickening, hyperplasia of the surface epithelium, mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate of lamina propria. Primary and secondary bronchi, epithelial hyperplasia and mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate of the lamina propria were also observed. Tracheal lesions developed in all infected birds, confirm the ability of the three tested strains to induce respiratory disease. The results at 14 dpi also revealed that all strains were able to induce serological response. Virus re-isolation from infected organs and amplification of the viral RNA by real-time PCR proved the presence of the virus in lung and trachea of infected chicks. Neither re-isolation nor significant viral RNA detection were detected in the kidney. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that the three strains Italy02 genotype emerging in Moroccan poultry farms have a wide distribution for respiratory system, without kidney damage and without causing mortality.","publish_time":"2016-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khataby, Khadija; Kichou, Faouzi; Loutfi, Chafiqa; Ennaji, My Mustapha","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d90382cb2b05e6761cea35d274213ee4f5c0cd02.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4898447.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27277076/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-016-0711-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Tracheal"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected birds","infected groups","infected organs","tracheal lesions","specific histological lesions","macroscopic lesions","nephritis lesions","RESULTS","trachea of infected chicks","respiratory system","specific respiratory clinical signs","respiratory disease","severe respiratory signs","strains Italy02 genotype","mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate of lamina propria","Moroccan poultry farms","poultry flocks","Virus re-isolation","important viral diseases of poultry","tested strains","mortality","day-old specific pathogen free chickens","significant viral RNA detection","epithelial hyperplasia","wide distribution","tissue distribution","Moroccan Italy","kidney damage","EID50 of Italy02 viruses","surface epithelium","amplification","mucosal thickening","secondary bronchi","major economic losses","information","presence","real-time PCR","lung","ages","Morocco","BACKGROUND","Avian infectious bronchitis","pathogenesis","ability","days post-infection","Massachusetts","varying times of appearance","disappearance","inoculated intra oculo","serological response","dominant serotype","Mass vaccination","vaccine","Group1","control","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

We provide an overview of the clinical studies that have established the biomarker potential of KPNA2 and describe its functional role with an emphasis on established associations with cancer.","publish_time":"2013-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Christiansen, Anders; Dyrskj\u00F8t, Lars","journal":"Cancer Letters","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7fc6742c367064839ae23cf1fce7be06aa3501b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126488.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304383512007306; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23268335/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304383512007306; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2012.12.013","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cancer tissue","biomarker potential of KPNA2","cancer cells","KPNA2 deregulation","cancer-associated proteins","multiple cancer forms","functional role","potential biomarker","clinical studies","established associations","Karyopherin \u03B1","idea","emphasis","recent years","adverse patient characteristics","Abstract","aberrant high levels","nucleocytoplasmic transport","translocation","virtue","overview","notion","carcinogenesis","malignant transformation"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to analyze the changing patterns and the tempo-geographic features of the COVID-19 epidemic, to provide further evidence for real-time responses. METHODS: Daily data on COVID-2019 cases between 31(st) Dec. 2019 and 26(th) Feb. 2020 were collected and analyzed for Hubei and non-Hubei regions. Observed trends for new and cumulative cases were analyzed through joint-point regressions. Spatial analysis was applied to show the geographic distribution and changing pattern of the epidemic. RESULTS: By 26(th) Feb. 2020, 78,630 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been reported in China. In Hubei, an increasing trend (slope=221) was observed for new cases between 24(th) Jan. and February 7(th) Feb. 2020, after which a decline commenced (slope=-868). However, as the diagnosis criteria changed, a sudden increase (slope=5530) was observed on 12(th) Feb., which sharply decreased afterward (slope=-4898). In non-Hubei regions, the number of new cases increased from 20(th) Jan. to 3(rd) Feb. and started to decline afterward (slope=-53). The spatial analysis identified Chongqing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Changsha, Nanchang, Wenzhou, Shanghai, Xinyang, Jining, and Beijing as the hotspots outside of Hubei province in China. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The joint-point regression analysis indicated that the epidemic might have been under control in China, especially for regions outside of Hubei province. Further improvement in the response strategies based on these new patterns is needed.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weiming, T; Huipeng, L; Gifty, M; Zaisheng, W; Weibin, C; Dan, W; Rongbin, Y","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/419a938878e05cb44860b9592a8d72d3e415f613.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa423; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32296826/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Beijing","China"],"keyphrases":["slope","Hubei province","non-Hubei regions","number of new cases","new patterns","cumulative cases","epidemic","China","Spatial analysis","confirmed COVID","regression analysis","changing patterns","turning point","decline","geographic distribution","tempo-geographic features","Wenzhou","Nanchang","Changsha","Shenzhen","Guangzhou","Xinyang","Jining","Shanghai","Chongqing","hotspots","additional intervention efforts","infectious disease","sudden increase","Beijing","response strategies","Daily data","diagnosis criteria","RELEVANCE","evidence","METHODS","trends","increasing trend","control","real-time responses","BACKGROUND","improvement","CONCLUSION","study","regressions","RESULTS","rd"],"language":"en"},

Uveitis is common in these cats. It was the aim of this study to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of an immunocytochemical assay (ICC) in aqueous humor of cats suspected of having FIP. ANIMALS STUDIED: The study included 26 cats with immunohistochemically confirmed FIP and 12 control cats for which FIP was suspected due to similar clinical or laboratory changes, but which suffered from other diseases confirmed via histopathology. PROCEDURES: All aqueous humor samples were collected postmortem by paracentesis. ICC was carried out as avidin\u2013biotin complex method. Sensitivity, specificity, and the overall accuracy including 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. RESULTS: Immunocytochemistry was positive in 16 of 25 cats with FIP and 2 of 11 control cats (one cat with lymphoma, one with pulmonary adenocarcinoma). Aqueous humor samples of one cat with FIP and of one control cat were excluded from statistical analysis. Sensitivity was 64.0% (95% CI: 42.5\u201382.0); specificity 81.8% (95% CI: 48.2\u201397.7); and overall accuracy 69.4% (95% CI: 51.9\u201383.7). CONCLUSIONS: As false\u2010positive results occurred and specificity is most important in the diagnosis of FIP, the diagnostic utility of ICC in aqueous humor is limited. Further studies are required to clarify the origin of false\u2010positive ICC results.","publish_time":"2017-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Felten, Sandra; Matiasek, Kaspar; Gruendl, Stefanie; Sangl, Laura; Hartmann, Katrin","journal":"Vet Ophthalmol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0904279c3e5be2a2ed0b6b52cbc27c3413159b6b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169266.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28493448/; https://doi.org/10.1111/vop.12474","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIP","ICC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aqueous humor of cats","control cats","diagnosis of FIP","confirmed FIP","specificity","aqueous humor samples","positive ICC results","positive results","sensitivity","diagnostic utility of ICC","overall accuracy","study","origin of false","antemortem diagnosis","immunocytochemical assay","effusion","feline infectious peritonitis","lymphoma","avidin","confidence intervals","postmortem","biotin complex method","laboratory changes","paracentesis","statistical analysis","CONCLUSIONS","PROCEDURES","pulmonary adenocarcinoma","Uveitis","aim","OBJECTIVE","Immunocytochemistry","diseases","histopathology","studies","ANIMALS"],"language":"en"},

Regulation, typically in the form of incentive based price caps, often applies to aviation infrastructure, such as major airports and air navigation services. At the same time, the demand for aviation infrastructure services is uncertain and subject to external shocks. Two case studies in economic regulation of aviation infrastructure are examined. They cover a period of volatile demand associated with the collapse of a major domestic airline which coincided with the September 11 terrorist attacks in the US. One case study involves the application of price caps to newly privatized airports during 1997\u20132002. The other case study examines the development of a long term price path for air navigation services over 2002 to 2004. The case studies illustrate the important role played by regulatory design. The paper concludes that the design of the regulatory framework has an important role in ameliorating the risks associated with uncertainty.","publish_time":"2018-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arblaster, Margaret","journal":"Journal of Air Transport Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb2ca4eb6f10b5df70f76aa79390d048e57bb263.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S096969971730128X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969971730128X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["economic regulation of aviation infrastructure","aviation infrastructure services","good regulation","case studies","case study","regulatory design","air navigation services","application of price caps","regulatory risk","regulatory framework","important role","major airports","uncertainty","paper","long term price path","privatized airports","major domestic airline","period of volatile demand","Australia","background discussion of literature","development","subject","collapse","principles","examination of experience","ways","external shocks","form of incentive","risks","time","terrorist attacks"],"language":"en"},

This pediatric disease follows rapid course leading to 55\u201375% mortality. In the absence of specific treatment, effectiveness of RNA interference (RNAi) was evaluated. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Efficacy of synthetic short interfering RNA (siRNA) or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in protecting mice from CHPV infection was assessed. The target genes were P and M genes primarily because important role of the former in viral replication and lethal nature of the latter. Real time one step RT-PCR and plaque assay were used for the assessment of gene silencing. Using pAcGFP1N1-CHPV-P, we showed that P-2 siRNA was most efficient in reducing the expression of P gene in-vitro. Both quantitative assays documented 2logs reduction in the virus titer when P-2, M-5 or M-6 siRNAs were transfected 2hr post infection (PI). Use of these siRNAs in combination did not result in enhanced efficiency. P-2 siRNA was found to tolerate four mismatches in the center. As compared to five different shRNAs, P-2 siRNA was most effective in inhibiting CHPV replication. An extended survival was noted when mice infected intracranially with 100 LD(50) CHPV were treated with cationic lipid complexed 5 \u00B5g P-2 siRNA simultaneously. Infection with 10LD(50) and treatment with two doses of siRNA first, simultaneously and second 24 hr PI, resulted in 70% survival. Surviving mice showed 4logs less CHPV titers in brain without histopathological changes or antibody response. Gene expression profiles of P-2 siRNA treated mice showed no interferon response. First dose of siRNA at 2hr or 4hr PI with second dose at 24hr resulted in 40% and 20% survival respectively suggesting potential application in therapy.

Abstract Introduction Experimental animal models constitute a useful tool to deepen our knowledge of central nervous system disorders. In the case of multiple sclerosis, however, there is no such specific model able to provide an overview of the disease; multiple models covering the different pathophysiological features of the disease are therefore necessary. Development We reviewed the different in vitro and in vivo experimental models used in multiple sclerosis research. Concerning in vitro models, we analysed cell cultures and slice models. As for in vivo models, we examined such models of autoimmunity and inflammation as experimental allergic encephalitis in different animals and virus-induced demyelinating diseases. Furthermore, we analysed models of demyelination and remyelination, including chemical lesions caused by cuprizone, lysolecithin, and ethidium bromide; zebrafish; and transgenic models. Conclusions Experimental models provide a deeper understanding of the different pathogenic mechanisms involved in multiple sclerosis. Choosing one model or another depends on the specific aims of the study.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Torre-Fuentes, L.; Moreno-Jim\u00E9nez, L.; Pytel, V.; Mat\u00EDas-Guiu, J.

On the other hand, statistical phylogenetics has increasingly been applied to the study of infectious agents.

UPR activates three distinct signalling pathways. Additionally, UPR induces autophagy (UPR-autophagy pathways). On the other hand, it has become clear that some positive-single-strand RNA viruses utilize autophagy. Some groups have used the siRNA silencing approach to show that autophagy is required for HCV RNA replication. However, the mechanism of induction of the UPR-autophagy pathways remain unclear in the cells with HCV. Method and results: we used a genome-length HCV RNA (strain O of genotype 1b) replication system (OR6) in hepatoma cells (HuH-7-derived OR6 cells). As control, we used OR6c cells from which the HCV genome had been removed by treatment with interferon-\u03B1. The UPR-autophagy pathways were activated to a greater degree in the OR6 cells as compared to the OR6c cells. Rapamycin, mTOR-independent autophagy inducer, activated HCV replication in the OR6 cells. On the other hand, HCV replication in the cells was inhibited by 3-methyladenine (3-MA), which is an inhibitor of autophagy. Salubrinal (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2(eIF2)-alpha phosphatase inhibitor), 3-ethoxy-5, 6-dibromosalicylaldehyde (X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1) splicing inhibitor) and sp600125 (c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) inhibitor) inhibited HCV replication and autophagy. Additionally, HCV replication and autophagy were inhibited more strongly by combination of these inhibitors. Conclusion Our results suggest that UPR-autophagy pathways exert an influence on HCV replication. Therefore, control these pathways may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy against replication of HCV.","publish_time":"2013-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shinohara, Yoshiyasu; Imajo, Kento; Yoneda, Masato; Tomeno, Wataru; Ogawa, Yuji; Kirikoshi, Hiroyuki; Funakoshi, Kengo; Ikeda, Masanori; Kato, Nobuyuki; Nakajima, Atsushi; Saito, Satoru","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0dd201016fd7f734d6ca967551f00dd7fc2555f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124205.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X13001939; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.01.103; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23395875/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X13001939","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs4Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UPR","HCV RNA","HCV","JNK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCV replication","replication of HCV","UPR-autophagy pathways","inhibitor of autophagy","HCV RNA replication","HCV genome","OR6c cells","replication system","hepatoma cells","derived OR6 cells","genome-length HCV RNA","mTOR-independent autophagy inducer","distinct signalling pathways","alpha phosphatase inhibitor","results","hand","control","strand RNA viruses","unfolding protein response","X-box binding protein","Abstract Background Hepatitis C virus","strain O of genotype","eIF2","JNK","positive-single","endoplasmic reticulum","turn","dibromosalicylaldehyde","N-terminal kinases","influence","novel therapeutic strategy","Eukaryotic Initiation Factor","greater degree","stress","siRNA silencing approach","XBP","Rapamycin","treatment","Salubrinal","groups","sp600125","mechanism of induction","interferon-\u03B1","methyladenine","combination","Conclusion","inhibitors","Method"],"language":"en"},

The results regarding the LIP2 and SYN4 diagnostic outcomes were compared with the white blood cell (WBC) count and C reactive protein (CRP) levels. METHODS: A total of 110 children \u003C14 years old who were hospitalized for radiologically confirmed CAP were enrolled. Serum samples were obtained upon admission and on day 5 to measure the levels of LIP2, SYN4, and CRP as well as the WBC. Polymerase chain reaction of the respiratory secretions and tests on blood samples were performed to detect respiratory viruses, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. RESULTS: CAP was considered to be due to a probable bacterial infection in 74 children (67.3 %) and due to a probable viral infection in 16 children (14.5 %). Overall, 84 children (76.4 %) were diagnosed with severe CAP. The mean values of the WBC count and the LIP2 and SYN4 levels did not differ among the probable bacterial, probable viral, and undetermined cases. However, the CRP serum concentrations were significantly higher in children with probable bacterial CAP than in those with probable viral disease (32.2 \u00B1 55.5 mg/L vs 9.4 \u00B1 17.0 mg/L, p \u003C 0.05). The WBC count was the best predictor of severe CAP, but the differences among the studied variables were marginal. The WBC count was significantly lower on day 5 in children with probable bacterial CAP (p \u003C 0.01) and in those with an undetermined etiology (p \u003C 0.01). The CRP and LIP2 levels were significantly lower 5 days after enrollment in all of the studied groups, independent of the supposed etiology of CAP (p \u003C 0.01 for all comparisons). No statistically significant variation was observed for SYN4. CONCLUSIONS: Measuring the LIP2 and SYN4 levels does not appear to solve the problem of the poor reliability of routine laboratory tests in defining the etiology and severity of pediatric CAP. Currently, the CRP levels and WBC, when combined with evaluation of clinical data, can be used to limit the overuse of antibiotics as much as possible and to provide the best treatment to the patient.","publish_time":"2016-07-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Esposito, Susanna; Bianchini, Sonia; Gambino, Monia; Madini, Barbara; Di Pietro, Giada; Umbrello, Giulia; Presicce, Maria Lory; Ruggiero, Luca; Terranova, Leonardo; Principi, Nicola","journal":"BMC Pulm Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3cd8bc01f0b6b1199289d110197b2a77503f93f7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4955239.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27439403/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12890-016-0267-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs4NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":["CAP","WBC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["children","levels of LIP2","LIP2 levels","SYN4 levels","probable bacterial CAP","CRP levels","WBC count","probable bacterial infection","probable viral infection","confirmed CAP","probable viral disease","supposed etiology of CAP","best predictor of severe CAP","SYN4 diagnostic outcomes","CRP serum concentrations","undetermined etiology","blood samples","Serum samples","results","respiratory secretions","respiratory viruses","Streptococcus pneumoniae","studied groups","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","best treatment","studied variables","undetermined cases","white blood cell","poor reliability of routine laboratory tests","C reactive protein","differences","order","Polymerase chain reaction","enrollment","mean values","days","severity of pediatric","problem","total","admission","years old","syndecan","evaluation of clinical data","study","overuse of antibiotics","patient","lipocalin","significant variation","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","comparisons","vs"],"language":"en"},

Methods We conducted 23 in-depth interviews with HCWs, of whom 20 worked in a Dutch university hospital and three worked in a regional ambulance service. We invited HCWs who cared for patients with suspected Ebola or who were on the team preparing for admission of such patients in the period 2014\u20132015. Findings The HCWs were stressed and anxious, but most rated their overall experience as positive. We categorized the reported experiences in three main themes, namely, experiences related to: (i) the novelty of the threat, (ii) the risk of infection and fear of transmission, and (iii) the excessive attention.

The single accessory gene of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), ORF3, is dispensable for virus replication in vitro, while viral mutants carrying ORF3 truncations exhibit an attenuated phenotype of which the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we studied the effect of ORF3 deletion on the proliferation of PEDV in Vero cells. To this end, four recombinant porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses (PEDVs) were rescued using targeted RNA recombination, three carrying the full-length ORF3 gene from different PEDV strains, and one from which the ORF3 gene had been deleted entirely. Our results showed that PEDVs with intact or naturally truncated ORF3 replicated to significantly higher titers than PEDV without an ORF3. Further characterization revealed that the extent of apoptosis induced by PEDV infection was significantly lower with the viruses carrying an intact or C-terminally truncated ORF3 than with the virus lacking ORF3, indicating that the ORF3 protein as well as its truncated form interfered with the apoptosis process. Collectively, we conclude that PEDV ORF3 protein promotes virus proliferation by inhibiting cell apoptosis caused by virus infection. Our findings provide important insight into the role of ORF3 protein in the pathogenicity of PEDV.","publish_time":"2020-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Si, Fusheng; Hu, Xiaoxia; Wang, Chenyang; Chen, Bingqing; Wang, Ruiyang; Dong, Shijuan; Yu, Ruisong; Li, Zhen","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e9c68eff528749801ab0531151576ece309ffc07.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7077256.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v12020214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32075094/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs4OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["truncated ORF3","PEDV ORF3 protein","ORF3 truncations","role of ORF3 protein","full-length ORF3 gene","effect of ORF3 deletion","proliferation of PEDV","PEDV infection","pathogenicity of PEDV","virus proliferation","virus infection","virus replication","different PEDV strains","single accessory gene of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","PEDVs","cell apoptosis","truncated form","extent of apoptosis","apoptosis process","recombinant porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses","accessory genes","viral mutants","viral virulence","attenuated phenotype","higher titers","important insight","underlying mechanism","end","targeted RNA recombination","findings","genomes of coronaviruses","Vero cells","characterization","results"],"language":"en"},

While zoonotic diseases originate from a reservoir, most theoretical studies have principally focused on single-host processes, either exclusively humans or exclusively animals, without considering the importance of animal to human transmission (i.e. spillover transmission) for understanding the dynamics of emerging infectious diseases. Here we aim to investigate the importance of spillover transmission for explaining the number and the size of outbreaks. We propose a simple continuous time stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model with a recurrent infection of an incidental host from a reservoir (e.g. humans by a zoonotic species), considering two modes of transmission, (1) animal-to-human and (2) human-to-human. The model assumes that (i) epidemiological processes are faster than other processes such as demographics or pathogen evolution and that (ii) an epidemic occurs until there are no susceptible individuals left. The results show that during an epidemic, even when the pathogens are barely contagious, multiple outbreaks are observed due to spillover transmission. Overall, the findings demonstrate that the only consideration of direct transmission between individuals is not sufficient to explain the dynamics of zoonotic pathogens in an incidental host.","publish_time":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Voinson, Marina; Alvergne, Alexandra; Billiard, Sylvain; Smadi, Charline","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/608eda2b07953fa00b686408c164d3e1322d4f14.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094102.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519318303965; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519318303965; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30121292/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2018.08.017","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs5MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human transmission","importance of spillover transmission","modes of transmission","zoonotic diseases","emerging human infectious diseases","consideration of direct transmission","incidental host","importance of animal","dynamics of zoonotic pathogens","single-host processes","dynamics of emerging infectious diseases","epidemiological processes","reservoir","animal origin","zoonotic species","humans","susceptible individuals","model","epidemic","multiple outbreaks","size of outbreaks","simple continuous time stochastic Susceptible-Infected","recurrent infection","demographics","number","theoretical studies","pathogen evolution","animals","findings","results"],"language":"en"},

We here focus on emerging options to interfere with the influenza virus entry process, which consists of the following steps: attachment of the viral hemagglutinin to the sialylated host cell receptors, endocytosis, M2\u2010mediated uncoating, low pH\u2010induced membrane fusion, and, finally, import of the viral ribonucleoprotein into the nucleus. We review the current functional and structural insights in the viral and cellular components of this entry process, and the diverse antiviral strategies that are being explored. This encompasses small molecule inhibitors as well as macromolecules such as therapeutic antibodies. There is optimism that at least some of these innovative concepts to block influenza virus entry will proceed from the proof of concept to a more advanced stage.

We investigated the protective effect and usefulness of loose-fitting powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) during chest compression. METHODS: This was a single-center simulation study performed from May 2019 to July 2019 in a tertiary hospital. We measured the concentrations of ambient aerosol and particles inside the loose-fitting PAPR during chest compression, and this ratio was set as the simulated workplace protecting factor (SWPF). According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health regulations, the assigned protection factor (APF) of loose-fitting PAPRs is 25. Thus, the loose-fitting PAPRs were assumed to have a protective effect when the SWPF were \u2265 250 (APF \u00D7 10). We measured the SWPF of PAPR in real time during chest compression and also investigated the problems encountered during its use. RESULTS: Ninety-one participants (median age 29 [interquartile range (IQR): 26\u201332] years; 74% female) completed the simulation. None of the participants failed with SWPF below 250 during three sessions of chest compression. The median (IQR) values of SWPF at three cycles were 17,063 (10,145-26,373), 15,683 (9477-32,394), and 16,960 (7695-27,279). There was no disconnection of equipment or mechanical failures during chest compression. In addition, most participants (83%) replied that they rarely or never experienced difficulty in verbal communication and felt that the loose-fitting PAPR was comfortable. CONCLUSIONS: The loose-fitting PAPRs provided sufficient respiratory protection without disturbances during chest compression.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Soo Hyun; Hwang, Sung Yeon; Lee, Guntak; Park, Jong Eun; Kim, Taerim; Shin, Tae Gun; Sim, Min Seob; Jo, Ik Joon; Kim, Seonwoo; Yoon, Hee","journal":"Am J Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8894ea73f92c804ea01c66ee397ade2d99336af6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7163180.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675720301960; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32307296/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675720301960; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.03.054","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Occupational Safety and Health","SWPF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["loose-fitting PAPRs","sessions of chest compression","SWPF of PAPR","values of SWPF","participants","protective effect","usefulness of loose-fitting powered air","sufficient respiratory protection","assigned protection factor","IQR","APF","application of appropriate personal protective equipment","Health regulations","disconnection of equipment","median age","health care workers","single-center simulation study","cornerstone","particles","respirators","disturbances","Occupational Safety","mechanical failures","real time","safe healthcare","National Institute","interquartile range","verbal communication","concentrations of ambient aerosol","simulated workplace","emergency departments","experienced difficulty","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","problems","female","cycles","tertiary hospital","years","METHODS","addition"],"language":"en"},

In 2007, a sentinel surveillance system was established in Madagascar, with the aim of rapidly identifying potential epidemics of febrile or diarrhoeal syndromes and issuing alerts. We present the health and process indicators for the five years during which this system was constructed, showing the spatiotemporal trends, early-warning sign detection capability and process evaluation through timely analyses of high-quality data. Methods: The Malagasy sentinel surveillance network is currently based on data for fever and diarrhoeal syndromes collected from 34 primary health centres and reported daily via the transmission of short messages from mobile telephones. Data are analysed daily at the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar to make it possible to issue alerts more rapidly, and integrated process indicators (timeliness, data quality) are used to monitor the system. Results: From 2007 to 2011, 917,798 visits were reported. Febrile syndromes accounted for about 11% of visits annually, but the trends observed differed between years and sentinel sites. From 2007 to 2011, 21 epidemic alerts were confirmed. However, delays in data transmission were observed (88% transmitted within 24 hours in 2008; 67% in 2011) and the percentage of forms transmitted each week for validity control decreased from 99.9% in 2007 to 63.5% in 2011. Conclusion: A sentinel surveillance scheme should take into account both epidemiological and process indicators. It must also be governed by the main purpose of the surveillance and by local factors, such as the motivation of healthcare workers and telecommunication infrastructure.

Statistical analysis by subgroups revealed that RSV infections were significantly more frequent in the respiratory group (54.1%) than in the nonrespiratory group (6.4%) (P \u003C 0.001). There was no difference for HRV (32.4% and 27.7%) or for the other viruses. No difference in duration of hospitalization or duration of mechanical ventilation was demonstrated depending on the virus detected. DISCUSSION: The use of the very sensitive multiplex PCR technique increased virus detection rates in both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects. CONCLUSION: We have confirmed the frequency of RSV infections in a PICU and found that many patients without respiratory symptoms have respiratory infections caused by viruses. The impact of these infections on patient outcome should now be analyzed in order to demonstrate the role played by respiratory viruses.","publish_time":"2014-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mortamet, G.; Morello, R.; Jokic, M.; Vabret, A.; Leroux, M.; Brouard, J.; Dina, J.","journal":"Arch Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a4ed98767bcbd676115519afdff60de825ac6fa8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7133265.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcped.2014.10.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25534558/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["respiratory symptoms","Viral respiratory infections","epidemiology of respiratory viruses","PICU","children","patients","nonrespiratory group","detected virus","serious infections","frequency of RSV infections","virus detection rates","HRV","difference","Nasal swabs","duration of hospitalization","study period","prospective study","positive samples","single real-time PCR","duration of mechanical ventilation","sensitive multiplex PCR technique","associated illnesses","pediatric intensive care unit","polymerase chain reaction","treatment","admission","University Hospital of Caen","specimens","subgroups","INTRODUCTION","asymptomatic subjects","patient outcome","Statistical analysis","France","impact","role","inclusion criteria","order","winter months","DISCUSSION","CONCLUSION","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine (H1N1 vaccine) became available in the U.S. in October 2009. Purpose To assess 2009 H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccination coverage and identify factors independently associated with vaccination among HCP in the U.S. Methods Data from the 2009\u20132010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) influenza supplemental survey were analyzed in 2011. Multivariable logistic regression and predictive marginal models were performed to identify factors independently associated with vaccination among HCP. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis procedure was used to estimate the cumulative proportion of people vaccinated. Results Among 16,975 HCP surveyed, 2009 H1N1, seasonal, and any-dose vaccination coverage were 34.1% (95% CI=32.7%, 35.5%); 52.4% (95% CI=50.9%, 53.9%); and 58.0% (95% CI=56.5%, 59.5%), respectively, all of which were significantly higher than those for non-HCP (19.1%, 34.9%, and 40.3%, respectively). The H1N1 vaccination coverage among HCP ranged from 18.4% in Mississippi to 56.1% in Massachusetts and seasonal influenza vaccination coverage ranged from 40.4% in Florida to 73.1% in Nebraska. Characteristics independently associated with an increased likelihood of 2009 H1N1, seasonal, and any-dose vaccinations among HCP were as follows: non-Hispanic white, higher income, having a high-risk condition, having health insurance, the ability to see a doctor if needed, and having had a routine checkup in the previous year. Conclusions Vaccination coverage was higher among HCP than non-HCP but still below the national health objective of 90%. Knowledge of national and state-specific H1N1 and seasonal vaccination coverage among HCP is useful for evaluating the vaccination campaign and implementing strategies for increasing yearly seasonal vaccination coverage and improving vaccination coverage among HCP in possible future pandemics.","publish_time":"2012-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Peng-jun; Ding, Helen; Black, Carla L.","journal":"American Journal of Preventive Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6239efbe5833a70352da33f833115ee907ad403.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126459.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0749379712003649; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2012.05.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379712003649; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22898121/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCP","U.S. Methods Data"],"locations":["U.S.","Mississippi","Massachusetts","Florida","Nebraska"],"keyphrases":["H1N1 vaccination coverage","seasonal influenza vaccination coverage","dose vaccination coverage","yearly seasonal vaccination coverage","Conclusions Vaccination coverage","non-HCP","vaccination campaign","Background Seasonal influenza vaccination","H1N1 vaccine","state-specific H1N1","influenza supplemental survey","higher income","factors","national health objective","monovalent vaccine","health insurance","Knowledge of national","dose vaccinations","BRFSS","Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System","predictive marginal models","strategies","Multivariable logistic regression","high-risk condition","Massachusetts","possible future pandemics","Kaplan-Meier survival analysis procedure","increased likelihood","routine checkup","previous year","ability","Methods Data","cumulative proportion of people","healthcare personnel","Characteristics","Florida","Mississippi","Purpose","Nebraska","doctor","Results"],"language":"en"},

A major site of ApoD expression in mice is the central nervous system where evidence suggests that it plays a protective role. Gene expression of ApoD was reported in bone-forming osteoblasts but its impact on bone metabolism remains undocumented. Methods We compared basic bone parameters of ApoD \u2212/\u2212 (null) and transgenic (tg) mice to wild-type (wt) littermates through microCT and histochemistry, as well as ApoD expression and secretion in osteoblasts under various culture conditions through real-time PCR and immunoblotting. Results ApoD-null females displayed progressive bone loss with aging, resulting in a 50% reduction in trabecular bone volume and a 23% reduction in cortical bone volume by 9months of age. Only cortical bone volume was significantly reduced in ApoD-null males by an average of 24%. Histochemistry indicated significantly higher osteoblast surface and number of osteoclasts in femora from ApoD-null females. ApoD gene expression was confirmed in primary cultures of bone marrow mesenchymal cells (MSC), with higher expression levels in MSC from females compared to males. ApoD-null MSC exhibited impaired proliferation and differentiation potentials. Moreover, exogenous ApoD partially rescued the osteogenic potential of null MSC, which were shown to readily uptake the protein from media. ApoD expression was upregulated under low proliferation conditions, by contact inhibition and osteoblastic differentiation in MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells. Conclusion Our results indicate that ApoD influences bone metabolism in mice in a gender-specific manner, potentially through an auto-/paracrine pathway.","publish_time":"2016-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martineau, Corine; Najyb, Ouafa; Signor, C\u00E9line; Rassart, \u00C9ric; Moreau, Robert","journal":"Metabolism","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/980fab09f09736ecdcae23f598486d65025efdba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094319.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2016.05.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27506732/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026049516300221; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0026049516300221","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MSC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ApoD-null MSC","Gene expression of ApoD","ApoD gene expression","exogenous ApoD","ApoD-null males","ApoD influences bone metabolism","basic bone parameters of ApoD","Results ApoD-null females","major site of ApoD expression","cortical bone volume","trabecular bone volume","progressive bone loss","mice","higher expression levels","osteogenic potential of null MSC","primary cultures of bone marrow mesenchymal cells","osteoblasts","histochemistry","reduction","low proliferation conditions","higher osteoblast surface","osteoblastic differentiation","impaired proliferation","differentiation potentials","various culture conditions","MC3T3-E1 osteoblast","contact inhibition","number of osteoclasts","wild-type","wt","femora","secretion","real-time PCR","littermates","tg","central nervous system","impact","lipocalin family","gender-specific manner","Abstract Background Apolipoprotein D","auto","evidence","microCT","immunoblotting","member","aging","small hydrophobic ligands","months of age","Methods","Conclusion","average","uptake","media","paracrine pathway","protective role"],"language":"en"},

In vitro transcribed RNA from a cDNA template that had been constructed from seven cDNA fragments, encompassing the entire genome of IBV, was electroporated into BHK-21 cells. The cells were overlaid onto the susceptible Vero cells and viable virus was recovered from the molecular clone. The molecularly cloned IBV (MIBV) demonstrated growth kinetics, and plaque size and morphology that resembled the parental Beaudette strain IBV. The recombinant virus was further manipulated to express enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) by replacing an open reading frame (ORF) of the group-specific gene, ORF 5a, with the EGFP ORF. The rescued recombinant virus, expressing EGFP (GIBV), replicated to lower viral titers and formed smaller plaques compared to the parental virus and the MIBV. After six passages of GIBV, a minority of plaques were observed that had reverted to the larger plaque size and virus from these plaques no longer expressed EGFP. Direct sequencing of RT-PCR products derived from cells infected with the plaque-purified virus, which had lost expression of EGFP, confirmed loss of the EGFP ORF. The loss of EGFP expression (\u03945a IBV) was also accompanied by reversion to growth kinetics resembling the standard virus and intact recombinant virus.

To better define the genetic variation within the species, VP35 and glycoprotein (GP) genes of representative human isolates from four known episodes of Marburg virus hemorrhagic fever were analyzed. The percentage nucleotide differences in the GP gene coding regions of Marburg viruses (0.1\u201321%) was nearly equal to the percentage amino acid changes (0\u201323%), while the percentage nucleotide differences in VP35 coding regions (0.3\u201320.9%) were higher than the percentage amino acid changes (0.9\u20136.1%), indicating a greater number of nonsynonymous changes occurring in the GP gene. The higher variation in the GP gene and the corresponding protein, especially those changes in the variable middle region of the GP, suggests that the variability may be the result of responses to natural host pressures. Analysis of the GP gene open reading frame shows a nonrandom distribution of nonsynonymous mutations that may indicate positive Darwinian selection is operating within the variable region. A heptad repeat region and an adjoining predicted fusion peptide are found in the C-terminal third of Marburg virus GPs, as has been previously shown for Ebola virus, and are similar to those found in transmembrane glycoproteins of retroviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses, and influenza viruses. Comparative analyses showed that there are two lineages within the Marburg virus species of filoviruses. The most recent isolate from Kenya (1987) represents a separate genetic lineage within the Marburg virus species (21\u201323% amino acid difference). However, this lineage likely does not represent a separate Marburg subtype, as the extent of divergence is less than that separating Ebola virus subtypes.","publish_time":"1998-01-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sanchez, Anthony; Trappier, Sam G.; Str\u00F6her, Ute; Nichol, Stuart T.; Bowen, Michael D.; Feldmann, Heinz","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e95b808d9ffe0b64d7e0040db7f4e5b4f9fdff25.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682297989029; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682297989029","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Kenya"],"keyphrases":["Abstract Marburg virus","Marburg virus GPs","Marburg virus species of filoviruses","GP gene coding regions of Marburg viruses","Ebola virus subtypes","percentage amino acid changes","separate Marburg subtype","known episodes of Marburg virus hemorrhagic fever","Ebola viruses","percentage nucleotide differences","GP gene open reading frame","variable region","amino acid difference","VP35 coding regions","greater number of nonsynonymous changes","separate genetic lineage","variable middle region","genetic variation","higher variation","influenza viruses","nonrandom distribution of nonsynonymous mutations","genes of representative human isolates","paramyxoviruses","result of responses","coronaviruses","positive Darwinian selection","transmembrane glycoproteins of retroviruses","C-terminal","natural host pressures","adjoining","fusion peptide","Analysis","prototype","corresponding protein","lineages","extent of divergence","Kenya","variability","recent isolate","heptad","familyFiloviridae","Comparative analyses"],"language":"en"},

Mechanistic simulation modeling that captures the dynamics between patients, pathogens, and the environment is increasingly being used to improve understanding of epidemiological patterns of HAIs and to facilitate decisions on infection prevention and control (IPC). The purpose of this review is to present a systematic review to establish (1) how simulation models have been used to investigate HAIs and their mitigation and (2) how these models have evolved over time, as well as identify (3) gaps in their adoption and (4) useful directions for their future development. METHODS: The review involved a systematic search and identification of studies using system dynamics, discrete event simulation, and agent-based model to study HAIs. RESULTS: The complexity of simulation models developed for HAIs significantly increased but heavily concentrated on transmission dynamics of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the hospitals of high-income countries. Neither HAIs in other health care settings, the influence of contact networks within a health care facility, nor patient sharing and referring networks across health care settings were sufficiently understood. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review provides a broader overview of existing simulation models in HAIs to identify the gaps and to direct and facilitate further development of appropriate models in this emerging field.","publish_time":"2019-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nguyen, Le Khanh Ngan; Megiddo, Itamar; Howick, Susan","journal":"Am J Infect Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa8a78f830731f32a7c18fb9f32efd050b8dc7c0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7161411.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2019.11.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31862167/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655319309605; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655319309605","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IPC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health care settings","patient health","health care facility","health care systems","study HAIs","complexity of simulation models","systematic review","global health burden","development of appropriate models","broader overview of existing simulation models","understanding of epidemiological patterns of HAIs","discrete event simulation","Mechanistic simulation modeling","system dynamics","systematic search","gaps","transmission dynamics of methicillin","patient sharing","future development","influence of contact networks","significant impact","resistant Staphylococcus aureus","identification of studies","agent-based model","associated infections","decisions","infection prevention","control","hospitals of high-income countries","useful directions","patients","BACKGROUND","emerging field","IPC","adoption","pathogens","RESULTS","environment","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","purpose","time","mitigation"],"language":"en"},

Lung transplant recipients are frequently exposed to respiratory viruses and are particularly at risk for severe complications. The aim of this study was to assess the association among the presence of a respiratory virus detected by molecular assays in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, respiratory symptoms, and acute rejection in adult lung transplant recipients. Methods. Upper (nasopharyngeal swab) and lower (BAL) respiratory tract specimens from 77 lung transplant recipients enrolled in a cohort study and undergoing bronchoscopy with BAL and transbronchial biopsies were screened using 17 different polymerase chain reaction\u2014based assays. Results. BAL fluid and biopsy specimens from 343 bronchoscopic procedures performed in 77 patients were analyzed. We also compared paired nasopharyngeal and BAL fluid specimens collected in a subgroup of 283 cases. The overall viral positivity rate was 29.3% in the upper respiratory tract specimens and 17.2% in the BAL samples (P \u003C .001). We observed a significant association between the presence of respiratory symptoms and positive viral detection in the lower respiratory tract (P = .012). Conversely, acute rejection was not associated with the presence of viral infection (odds ratio, 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.20\u20130.88). The recovery of lung function was significantly slower when acute rejection and viral infection were both present. Conclusions. A temporal relationship exists between acute respiratory symptoms and positive viral nucleic acid detection in BAL fluid from lung transplant recipients. We provide evidence suggesting that respiratory viruses are not associated with acute graft rejection during the acute phase of infection.","publish_time":"2010-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Soccal, P.

However, the long-term impact of SARS on hospital performance needs to be further discussed. METHODS: A municipal hospital in Taipei City was shut down for a month due to SARS and then became the designated SARS and infectious disease hospital for the city. This study collected the outpatient, inpatient and emergency service volumes for every year from April to March over four years. Average monthly service amount \u00B1 standard deviation were used to compare patient volume for the whole hospital, as well as the outpatient numbers accessing different departments. The ARIMA model of outpatient volume in the pre-SARS year was developed. RESULTS: The average monthly service volume of outpatient visits for the base year 2002 was 52317 \u00B1 4204 visits per month, and number for 2003 and the following two years were 55%, 82% and 84% of the base year respectively. The average emergency service volume was 4382 \u00B1 356 visits per month at the base year and this became 45%, 77% and 87% of the base year for the following three years respectively. Average inpatient service volume was 8520 \u00B1 909 inpatient days per month at the base year becoming 43%, 81% and 87% of the base year for the following three years respectively. Only the emergency service volume had recovered to the level of a non-significant difference at the second year after SARS. In addition, the departments of family medicine, metabolism and nephrology reached the 2002 patient number in 2003. The ARIMA (2,1,0) model was the most suitable for outpatient volume in pre-SARS year. The MAPE of the ARIMA (2,1,0) model for the pre-SARS year was 6.9%, and 43.2%, 10.6%, 6.2% for following 3 years. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that if a hospital is completely shut down due to SARS or a similar disease, the impact is longer than previous reported and different departments may experience different recover periods. The findings of this study identify subspecialties that are particularly vulnerable in an infectious disease designated hospital and such hospitals need to consider which subspecialties should be included in their medical structure.","publish_time":"2008-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chu, Dachen; Chen, Ran-Chou; Ku, Chia-Yu; Chou, Pesus","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5f778aafd8e2a94701f7398641519a2041ab303.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2613902.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18990210/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-8-228","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","ARIMA"],"locations":["Taipei City"],"keyphrases":["base year","pre-SARS year","designated SARS","Average inpatient service volume","average emergency service volume","SARS epidemic","years","average monthly service volume of outpatient visits","ARIMA model of outpatient volume","long-term impact of SARS","infectious disease hospital","municipal hospital","emergency service volumes","infectious disease designated hospital","outpatient numbers","different departments","study","hospital performance needs","inpatient days","similar disease","subspecialties","departments of family medicine","different recover periods","medical services","Taipei City","medical structure","standard deviation","nephrology","metabolism","healthcare utilization","level","hospitals","non-significant difference","RESULTS","addition","METHODS","findings","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","MAPE"],"language":"en"},

SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and HCoV-NL63 recognize ACE2 as the natural receptor but present a distinct binding interface to ACE2 and a different network of residue-residue contacts. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have comparable binding affinities achieved by balancing energetics and dynamics. The SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 complex contains a higher number of contacts, a larger interface area, and decreased interface residue fluctuations relative to the SARS-CoV-ACE2 complex. These findings expose an exceptional evolutionary exploration exerted by coronaviruses toward host recognition.

METHODS: Osteoblasts were isolated from rabbit bones and treated with 1 \u03BCM Methylprednisolone for 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. The Beclin1, MAP1LC3, Atg\u20105, Atg\u201012, IFT20 and OFD1 mRNAs and proteins were detected by PCR and Western blotting, and their correlation was statistically analyzed. The lengths of osteoblast cilia were measured under a laser confocal microscope, and the autophagy flux was tracked by transfecting the osteoblasts with GFP\u2010RFP\u2010LC3 lentivirus. RESULTS: Methylprednisolone significantly upregulated Beclin1, MAP1LC3, Atg\u20105, Atg\u201012 and OFD1 mRNAs and proteins in a time\u2010dependent manner, and decreased that of IFT20 (P \u003C 0.05).

Despite immense potential, a viral siRNA efficacy prediction algorithm is still not available. Moreover, performances of the existing general mammalian siRNA efficacy predictors are not satisfactory for viral siRNAs. Therefore, we have developed \u201CVIRsiRNApred\u201D a support vector machine (SVM) based method for predicting the efficacy of viral siRNA. METHODS: In the present study, we have employed a new dataset of 1725 viral siRNAs with experimentally verified quantitative efficacies tested under heterogeneous experimental conditions and targeting as many as 37 important human viruses including HIV, Influenza, HCV, HBV, SARS etc. These siRNAs were divided into training (T(1380)) and validation (V(345)) datasets. Important siRNA sequence features including mono to penta nucleotide frequencies, binary pattern, thermodynamic properties and secondary structure were employed for model development. RESULTS: During 10-fold cross validation on T(1380) using hybrid approach, we achieved a maximum Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.55 between predicted and actual efficacy of viral siRNAs. On V(345) independent dataset, our best model achieved a maximum correlation of 0.50 while existing general siRNA prediction methods showed PCC from 0.05 to 0.18. However, using leave one out cross validation PCC was improved to 0.58 and 0.55 on training and validation datasets respectively. SVM performed better than other machine learning techniques used like ANN, KNN and REP Tree. CONCLUSION: VIRsiRNApred is the first algorithm for predicting inhibition efficacy of viral siRNAs which is developed using experimentally verified viral siRNAs. We hope this algorithm would be useful in predicting highly potent viral siRNA to aid siRNA based antiviral therapeutics development.

This is particularly illustrated over the last 15 years by the emergence of two zoonotic CoVs, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)- and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. Due to their inherent genetic variability, it is inevitable that new cross-species transmission events of these enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses will occur. Research into these medical and veterinary important pathogens\u2014sparked by the SARS and MERS outbreaks\u2014revealed important principles of inter- and intraspecies tropism changes. The primary determinant of CoV tropism is the viral spike (S) entry protein. Trimers of the S glycoproteins on the virion surface accommodate binding to a cell surface receptor and fusion of the viral and cellular membrane. Recently, high-resolution structures of two CoV S proteins have been elucidated by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. Using this new structural insight, we review the changes in the S protein that relate to changes in virus tropism. Different concepts underlie these tropism changes at the cellular, tissue, and host species level, including the promiscuity or adaptability of S proteins to orthologous receptors, alterations in the proteolytic cleavage activation as well as changes in the S protein metastability. A thorough understanding of the key role of the S protein in CoV entry is critical to further our understanding of virus cross-species transmission and pathogenesis and for development of intervention strategies.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hulswit, R.J.G.; de Haan, C.A.M.; Bosch, B.-J.","journal":"Advances in Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/210537df55cdf8f3256cd7d95cdcc3e41913d0e5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112277.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065352716300434; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.aivir.2016.08.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065352716300434; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27712627/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["CoV S proteins","S glycoproteins","S protein metastability","intraspecies tropism changes","virus tropism","adaptability of S proteins","CoV entry","entry protein","primary determinant of CoV tropism","understanding of virus cross-species transmission","SARS","new cross-species transmission events","host species level","viral spike","severe acute respiratory syndrome","virion surface","Middle East respiratory syndrome","zoonotic CoVs","MERS outbreaks","thorough understanding","cellular membrane","important principles of inter-","cell surface receptor","veterinary important pathogens","new structural insight","alterations","pathogenesis","orthologous receptors","binding","fusion","promiscuity","tissue","key role","proteolytic cleavage activation","positive-stranded RNA viruses","single-particle cryo-electron microscopy","high-resolution structures","development of intervention strategies","remarkable potential","inherent genetic variability","emergence","Research","Different concepts","Abstract Coronaviruses","years","Trimers"],"language":"en"},

The number of cases has increased rapidly, but information on the clinical characteristics remains limited. Objectives This paper describes the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19. Early detection and identification of critically ill patients is necessary to facilitate scientific classification and treatment. Study design This study included a retrospective, single-center case series of 99 consecutively hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Chengdu Public Health Clinical Medical Center in Chengdu, China, from January 16 to February 20, 2020. The final date of follow-up was February 23, 2020. We collected and analyzed epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data. We compared outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients. Results Of the 99 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 49 years (minimum, 3 months; maximum, 87 years) and 51 (52 %) were men; 42 (42 %) had traveled to or lived in Wuhan and 48 (49 %) had come into close contact with patients with new coronavirus pneumonia; 41 (41 %) patients had underlying disease. Common symptoms included fever (85 [86 %]), dry cough (84 [85 %]), and fatigue (72 [73 %]). We analyzed the clinical characteristics of patients. We expressed the measurement data as mean \u00B1 standard deviation. We collected data for age (49.39 \u00B1 18.45 years), number of hospital days (12.32 \u00B1 6.70 days), and laboratory indicators. We compared critically ill and noncritically ill patients: p-values for age, C-reactive protein, high-sensitivity troponin T, prothrombin time, fibrin degradation products, D-Dimer, and CD4\u002B count were p \u003C 0.001; and p-values for hospital days, white blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte, creatine kinase isoenzyme, myoglobin, N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide, and CD8\u002B count were p \u003C 0.05. Conclusions We collected data from a single-center case series of 32 hospitalized patients who were critically ill with confirmed COVID-19 in Chengdu, China, and compared data with 67 noncritically ill patients. Elderly patients had chronic underlying diseases, notably cardiovascular disease. Higher C-reactive protein levels, higher levels of myocardial damage, and higher brain natriuretic peptide levels; lower white blood cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes; and lower CD4 and CD8 counts could be used for early detection and identification of critically ill patients, and dynamic Data observation was more important than at a single moment.","publish_time":"2020-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Yongli; Xu, Hong; Yang, Ming; Zeng, Yilan; Chen, Hong; Liu, Ru; Li, Qingfeng; Zhang, Na; Wang, Dan","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9aa3dee00c8ca745ab945dce8188988b98ecd00.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7146675.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104366; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301086; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302954/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301086","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Chengdu Public Health Clinical Medical Center"],"locations":["Wuhan","China","Chengdu"],"keyphrases":["noncritically ill patients","hospitalized patients","Elderly patients","clinical characteristics of patients","clinical characteristics of COVID","treatment data","confirmed COVID","measurement data","p-values","years","China","dynamic Data observation","single-center case series","higher brain natriuretic peptide levels","Higher C-reactive protein levels","Chengdu Public Health Clinical Medical Center","number of hospital days","higher levels of myocardial damage","lower CD4","identification","Early detection","median age","single moment","Study","Wuhan","lower white blood cells","N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide","CD8 counts","outbreak of coronavirus","cardiovascular disease","laboratory indicators","number of cases","chronic underlying diseases","new coronavirus pneumonia","prothrombin time","myoglobin","high-sensitivity troponin T","fibrin degradation products","creatine kinase isoenzyme","D-Dimer","lymphocytes","neutrophils","retrospective","minimum","close contact","scientific classification","mean","standard deviation","months","information","demographic","paper","maximum","outcomes","final date of follow-up","Common symptoms","fever","Abstract Background","Objectives","Conclusions","Results","dry cough","fatigue"],"language":"en"},

Virus inactivation due to physico-chemical properties of the diluent at the time of administration may lead to vaccine failure. The present study aimed to evaluate the survival of NDV live vaccine strain immersed in 5 pH-amended water samples (pH 5.00, pH 6.00, pH 7.00, pH 8.00, and pH 9.00) by sequential determination of virus infectivity on Vero cells for 3 hours. Minimum reduction in virus infectivity was recorded in the water with neutral or slightly alkaline pH, while the virus was relatively less stable at extreme pH conditions. Maximum reduction of infectivity was observed in the water with pH 9.00 in which the virus was completely inactivated within 3 hours. Addition of stabilizers (Cevamune(\u00AE) or skimmed milk) slightly altered the pH and total dissolved solids (TDS) values of the virus-charged water samples. In the stabilizer-added water samples, minimum reduction in infectivity was observed in the water with neutral pH, followed by the ones with a pH of 8.00, 6.00, 5.00, and 9.00. In all types of water samples, T-90 values (time required for 90% reduction in virus infectivity) were highest (485 minutes) at neutral pH (pH 7.00) and lowest (102 to 134 min) at an extreme alkaline condition (pH 9.00). Results of the present study indicate that water with a pH range of 7.00 to 8.00 is suitable for administration of NDV live vaccines. However, the addition of Cevamune(\u00AE) or skimmed milk may have beneficial effects on preserving the infectivity of the virus, even at extreme pH conditions.","publish_time":"2017-10-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tariq, S; Rabbani, M; Javeed, A; Ghafoor, A; Anees, M; Najiullah, M; Hameed, M; Younus, M; Nazir, J","journal":"J Appl Poult Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f626c150b229617c096dc92ecf7f19ee51af205.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109991.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3382/japr/pfx049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288460/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsyMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle","NDV","Cevamune"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neutral pH","alkaline pH","pH range","extreme pH conditions","drinking water","Virus inactivation","types of water samples","sequential determination of virus infectivity","Newcastle disease virus","Maximum reduction of infectivity","Minimum reduction","administration of NDV live vaccines","values","survival of NDV live vaccine strain","time of administration","diluent","skimmed milk","extreme alkaline condition","present study","addition of Cevamune","hours","vaccine failure","Addition of stabilizers","spray","TDS","conventional routes","Vero cells","physico-chemical properties","eye drop","total dissolved solids","minutes","lyophilized form","beneficial effects","reconstitution","ones","Results"],"language":"en"},

This study was conducted to evaluate the distribution of respiratory viruses in patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) through the first teaching hospital-based surveillance scheme for ILI in South Korea. METHODS: Respiratory specimens were obtained from adult patients (\u226518 years) who visited the emergency department (ED) with ILI from week 40, 2011 to week 22, 2012. Multiplex PCR was performed to detect respiratory viruses: influenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, bocavirus, and enterovirus. RESULTS: Among 1,983 patients who visited the ED with ILI, 811 (40.9%) were male. The median age of patients was 43 years. Influenza vaccination rate was 21.7% (430/1,983) during the 2011\u20132012 season. At least one comorbidity was found in 18% of patients. The positive rate of respiratory viruses was 52.1% (1,033/1,983) and the total number of detected viruses was 1,100. Influenza A virus was the dominant agent (677, 61.5%) in all age groups. The prevalence of human metapneumovirus was higher in patients more than 50 years old, while adenovirus was detected only in younger adults. In 58 (5.6%) cases, two or more respiratory viruses were detected. The co-incidence case was identified more frequently in patients with hematologic malignancy or organ transplantation recipients, however it was not related to clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: This study is valuable as the first extensive laboratory surveillance of the epidemiology of respiratory viruses in ILI patients through a teaching hospital-based influenza surveillance system in South Korea.","publish_time":"2013-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Noh, Ji Yun; Song, Joon Young; Cheong, Hee Jin; Choi, Won Suk; Lee, Jacob; Lee, Jin-Soo; Wie, Seong-Heon; Jeong, Hye Won; Kim, Young Keun; Choi, Sung Hyuk; Han, Seung Baik; So, Byung-Hak; Kim, Hyun; Kim, Woo Joo","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0cd911d564b693ebedf57fa37c28b8ea5705c174.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3661466.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0064295; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23717587/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsyMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["Multiplex PCR"],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["ILI patients","epidemiology of respiratory viruses","distribution of respiratory viruses","adult patients","respiratory syncytial virus","Respiratory specimens","positive rate of respiratory viruses","median age of patients","operating influenza surveillance scheme","Influenza vaccination rate","teaching hospital-based influenza surveillance system","total number of detected viruses","parainfluenza virus","teaching hospital-based surveillance scheme","extensive laboratory surveillance","adenovirus","South Korea","years old","week","study","prevalence of human metapneumovirus","age groups","rhinovirus","coronavirus","hematologic malignancy","bocavirus","organ transplantation recipients","public health","emergency department","enterovirus","dominant agent","illness","Multiplex PCR","co-incidence case","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","younger adults","METHODS","cases","clinical outcomes","RESULTS","male","season","comorbidity"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we constructed a computational framework to estimate the probability of virus transmission between potential hosts based on the hypothesis that the major barrier to virus infection is differences in cell-receptor sequences among species. Information regarding host susceptibility to virus infection was collected to classify the cross-species infection propensity between hosts. Evolutionary divergence matrices and a sequence similarity scoring program were used to determine the distance and similarity of receptor sequences. The discriminant analysis was validated with cross-validation methods. The results showed that the primary structure of the receptor protein influences host susceptibility to cross-species viral infections. Pair-wise distance, relative distance, and sequence similarity showed the best accuracy in identifying the susceptible group. Based on the results of the discriminant analysis, we constructed ViCIPR (http://lcbb3.snu.ac.kr/ViCIPR/home.jsp), a server-based tool to enable users to easily extract the cross-species infection propensities of specific viruses using a simple two-step procedure. Our sequence-based approach suggests that it may be possible to identify virus transmission between hosts without requiring complex structural analysis. Due to a lack of available data, this method is limited to viruses whose receptor use has been determined. However, the significant accuracy of predictive variables that positively and negatively influence virus transmission suggests that this approach could be improved with further analysis of receptor sequences.","publish_time":"2019-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cho, Myeongji; Son, Hyeon Seok","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ec27b5a22980a4b6873be42dcb1458c97879a13.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106226.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134818304489; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31026604/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2019.04.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134818304489","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsyNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus infection","analysis of receptor sequences","similarity of receptor sequences","cross-species infection propensity","sequence similarity","probability of virus transmission","species viral infections","cell-receptor sequences","receptor use","discriminant analysis","sequence-based approach","receptor protein influences host susceptibility","cross-species infection propensities of specific viruses","potential hosts","potential host organisms","relative distance","Studies of host factors","complex structural analysis","cross-validation methods","server-based tool","results","risk of emerging infections","Pair-wise distance","best accuracy","significant accuracy of predictive variables","differences","primary structure","major barrier","hypothesis","simple two-step procedure","Evolutionary divergence matrices","possibility","users","program","Information","computational framework","lack of available data","susceptible group","ViCIPR","study"],"language":"en"},

Due to incomplete data on eight patients, 72 patients were eligible for final analysis (median age 58 years). All patients underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) fluid samples were sent for direct microscopy, cultures, and fungal antigen detection, when appropriate. Commercial qualitative amplification assay (PNEUMOTRIS oligomix Alert Kit(\u00AE)), based on nested PCR method, was used to detect specific DNA sequences of L. pneumophila, C. pneumoniae, and M. pneumoniae in BALF. There were 61 (84.7 %) patients with hematologic diseases, 3 (4.2 %) after solid organ transplantation, and 8 (11.1 %) with miscellaneous diseases affecting immune status. Specific sequences of M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and L. pneumophila DNA were found in 7 (9.7 %), 2 (2.8 %), and 0 patients, respectively. In 8 of these patients co-infections with different microorganisms were demonstrated. Co-infection with A. baumanii and P. aeruginosa was diagnosed in three patients who died. We conclude that atypical lower airway infections are uncommon in immunocompromised patients. The majority of these infections are co-infections rather than single pathogen infections.","publish_time":"2016-06-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grabczak, E.

Although the rational drug design traditionally uses information on known 3D structures of viral proteins, intrinsically disordered proteins (i.e., functional proteins that do not possess unique 3D structures), with their multitude of disorder-dependent functions, are crucial for the biology of viruses. Here, viruses utilize disordered regions in their invasion of the host organisms and in hijacking and repurposing of different host systems. Furthermore, the ability of viruses to efficiently adjust and accommodate to their hostile habitats is also intrinsic disorder-dependent. However, little is currently known on the level of penetrance and functional utilization of intrinsic disorder in the ALKV proteome. To fill this gap, we used here multiple computational tools to evaluate the abundance of intrinsic disorder in the ALKV genome polyprotein. We also analyzed the peculiarities of intrinsic disorder predisposition of the individual viral proteins, as well as human proteins known to be engaged in interaction with the ALKV proteins. Special attention was paid to finding a correlation between protein functionality and structural disorder. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first systematic study of the intrinsic disorder status of ALKV proteome and interactome.

Their structural and functional diversity is thought to be reasonably well-understood, especially in retroelements, which transpose via an RNA intermediate copied into cDNA by the element-encoded reverse transcriptase, and are characterized by a compact structure. Here, we report a novel type of expandable eukaryotic retroelements, which we call Terminons. These elements can attach to G-rich telomeric repeat overhangs at the chromosome ends, in a process apparently facilitated by complementary C-rich repeats at the 3\u2032-end of the RNA template immediately adjacent to a hammerhead ribozyme motif. Terminon units, which can exceed 40 kb in length, display an unusually complex and diverse structure, and can form very long chains, with host genes often captured between units. As the principal polymerizing component, Terminons contain Athena reverse transcriptases previously described in bdelloid rotifers and belonging to the enigmatic group of Penelope-like elements, but can additionally accumulate multiple cooriented ORFs, including DEDDy 3\u2032-exonucleases, GDSL esterases/lipases, GIY-YIG-like endonucleases, rolling-circle replication initiator (Rep) proteins, and putatively structural ORFs with coiled-coil motifs and transmembrane domains. The extraordinary length and complexity of Terminons and the high degree of interfamily variability in their ORF content challenge the current views on the structural organization of eukaryotic retroelements, and highlight their possible connections with the viral world and the implications for the elevated frequency of gene transfer.","publish_time":"2017-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arkhipova, Irina R.; Yushenova, Irina A.; Rodriguez, Fernando","journal":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e153843d9aa8fd0655fae9f957f64a844027b682.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8198900b75d855cd82dc34ed8b9872074a9fa937.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5850863.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msx159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28575409/; https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-pdf/34/9/2245/24367412/msx159.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["structural organization of eukaryotic retroelements","structural ORFs","chromosome structure","eukaryotic genomes","complexity of Terminons","Transposable elements","diverse structure","compact structure","novel type of expandable eukaryotic retroelements","chromosome ends","RNA template","RNA intermediate","extraordinary length","Terminon units","Athena reverse transcriptases","G-rich telomeric","multiple cooriented ORFs","complementary C-rich repeats","proteins","coiled-coil motifs","profound impact","ORF content","high degree of interfamily variability","current views","implications","lipases","GDSL esterases","endonucleases","circle replication initiator","DEDDy","bdelloid rotifers","overhangs","principal polymerizing component","GIY-YIG","viral world","possible connections","elevated frequency of gene transfer","exonucleases","transmembrane domains","hammerhead ribozyme motif","host genes","process","enigmatic group of Penelope","cDNA","long chains","evolution","functional diversity"],"language":"en"},

To develop a clinical antibody therapy, we generated a human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody (MAb) ch61 that showed strong neutralizing activity against H5N1 HPAI viruses isolated from humans and evaluated its protective potential in mouse and nonhuman primate models of H5N1 HPAI virus infections. Passive immunization with MAb ch61 one day before or after challenge with a lethal dose of the virus completely protected mice, and partial protection was achieved when mice were treated 3 days after the challenge. In a cynomolgus macaque model, reduced viral loads and partial protection against lethal infection were observed in macaques treated with MAb ch61 intravenously one and three days after challenge. Protective effects were also noted in macaques under immunosuppression. Though mutant viruses escaping from neutralization by MAb ch61 were recovered from macaques treated with this MAb alone, combined treatment with MAb ch61 and peramivir reduced the emergence of escape mutants. Our results indicate that antibody therapy might be beneficial in reducing viral loads and delaying disease progression during H5N1 HPAI virus infection in clinical cases and combined treatment with other antiviral compounds should improve the protective effects of antibody therapy against H5N1 HPAI virus infection.","publish_time":"2014-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Itoh, Yasushi; Yoshida, Reiko; Shichinohe, Shintaro; Higuchi, Megumi; Ishigaki, Hirohito; Nakayama, Misako; Pham, Van Loi; Ishida, Hideaki; Kitano, Mitsutaka; Arikata, Masahiko; Kitagawa, Naoko; Mitsuishi, Yachiyo; Ogasawara, Kazumasa; Tsuchiya, Hideaki; Hiono, Takahiro; Okamatsu, Masatoshi; Sakoda, Yoshihiro; Kida, Hiroshi; Ito, Mutsumi; Quynh Mai, Le; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Miyamoto, Hiroko; Ishijima, Mari; Igarashi, Manabu; Suzuki, Yasuhiko; Takada, Ayato","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4cd3f43501d49e775838473a3edafb55e57d08df.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4055766.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24945244/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MAb ch61","H5N1 HPAI viruses","H5N1 subtype","clinical antibody therapy","protective effects of antibody therapy","macaques","challenge","nonhuman primate models of H5N1 HPAI virus infections","lethal infection","viral loads","humans","combined treatment","partial protection","protective potential","mutant viruses","days","human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody","clinical cases","lethal dose","protected mice","delaying disease progression","peramivir","severe pneumonia","multiple organ failure","strong neutralizing activity","antiviral compounds","reported case fatality rates","cynomolgus macaque model","pathogenic avian influenza","Passive immunization","neutralization","emergence of escape mutants","results","immunosuppression"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: S. pneumoniae was the most frequently detected pathogen, with carriage rates of 75% and 38% in children and mothers respectively. In children, S. pneumoniae carriage was associated with ARTI risk in multivariate analysis (OR 14.1, 95% CI 1.4\u2013137.7). Viral infections were not associated with ARTI risk.

FcRs control the humoral and innate immunity which are essential for appropriate responses to infections and prevention of chronic inflammation or auto-immune diseases. Following their crosslinking by immune complexes, FcRs play various roles such as modulation of the immune response by released cytokines or of phagocytosis. Here, we review FcR involvement in pathologies leading notably to altered intracellular signaling with functionally relevant consequences to the host, and targeting of Fc receptors as therapeutic approaches. Special emphasis will be given to some FcRs, such as the Fc\u03B1RI, the Fc\u03B3RIIA and the Fc\u03B3RIIIA, which behave like the ancient god Janus depending on the ITAM motif to inhibit or activate immune responses depending on their targeting by monomeric/dimeric immunoglobulins or by immune complexes. This ITAM duality has been recently defined as inhibitory or activating ITAM (ITAMi or ITAMa) which are controlled by Src family kinases. Involvement of various ITAM-bearing FcRs observed during infectious or autoimmune diseases is associated with allelic variants, changes in ligand binding ability responsible for host defense perturbation. During auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus or immune thrombocytopenia, the autoantibodies and immune complexes lead to inflammation through FcR aggregation. We will discuss the role of FcRs in autoimmune diseases, and focus on novel approaches to target FcRs for resolution of antibody-mediated autoimmunity. We will finally also discuss the down-regulation of FcR functionality as a therapeutic approach for autoimmune diseases.","publish_time":"2019-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ben Mkaddem, Sanae; Benhamou, Marc; Monteiro, Renato C.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f74928e0d29d3724e184de8839982d6a44fe8bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6481281.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31057544/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.00811","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune complexes","immune responses","auto-immune diseases","immune thrombocytopenia","target FcRs","autoimmune diseases","role of FcRs","ITAM motif","Involvement of various ITAM","ITAM duality","FcR involvement","ITAM-associated receptor family","therapeutic approaches","FcR aggregation","Fc receptors","targeting","regulation of FcR functionality","appropriate responses","novel approaches","various roles","host defense perturbation","prevention of chronic inflammation","Src family kinases","ligand binding ability responsible","allelic variants","rheumatoid arthritis","changes","infections","resolution of antibody","lupus","autoantibodies","innate immunity","dimeric immunoglobulins","modulation","ancient god Janus","mediated autoimmunity","Fc\u03B3RIIIA","relevant consequences","ITAMa","ITAMi","Fc\u03B1RI","pathologies","cytokines","crosslinking","Fc\u03B3RIIA","phagocytosis","Special emphasis"],"language":"en"},

Additional nucleolar functions, not related to ribosome biogenesis, have been discovered within the last decade. Built around multiple copies of the genes for preribosomal RNA (rDNA), nucleolar structure is largely dependent on the process of ribosome assembly. The nucleolus is disassembled during mitosis at which time preribosomal RNA transcription and processing are suppressed; it is reassembled at the end of mitosis in part from components preserved from the previous cell cycle. Expression of preribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) is regulated by the silencing of individual rDNA genes via alterations in chromatin structure or by controlling RNA polymerase I initiation complex formation. Preribosomal RNA processing and posttranscriptional modifications are guided by a multitude of small nucleolar RNAs. Nearly completed ribosomal subunits are exported to the cytoplasm by an established nuclear export system with the aid of specialized adapter molecules. Some preribosomal and nucleolar components are transiently localized in Cajal bodies, presumably for modification or assembly. The nonconventional functions of nucleolus include roles in viral infections, nuclear export, sequestration of regulatory molecules, modification of small RNAs, RNP assembly, and control of aging, although some of these functions are not well established.

The clinical signs of the experimentally infected, symptomatic dogs only disappeared after the complete vaccination. Protection was obtained in 3/5 animals that remained asymptomatic, IDR positive and parasite free, 1 year after infection. Furthermore, the asymptomatic, FML-vaccine treated dogs showed stable anti-FML IgG1 levels, increasing IgG2 levels and 79\u201395% of positive DTH response, during the whole experiment. Twenty-two months after complete vaccination, no obits due to visceral leishmaniasis were recorded and 90% of these dogs were still asymptomatic, healthy and parasite free. On the other hand, 37% (17/46 dogs) kala-azar obits were recorded in a control group that received no treatment during the same period, and that was FML-seropositive and asymtpomatic at the beginning of the assay. Our results indicate that the FML-vaccine was effective in the immunotherapy against visceral leishmaniasis of asymptomatic infected dogs. Normal proportions of CD4 and CD21 lymphocytes were detected in PBMC by FACS analysis, in dogs submitted to immunotherapy, suggesting their non-infectious condition.

Here, we show that the viral glycoprotein (VSV-G) antagonizes tetherin in transfected cells, although with reduced efficiency as compared to the HIV-1 Vpu protein. Tetherin antagonism did not involve alteration of tetherin expression and was partially dependent on a GXXXG motif in the transmembrane domain of VSV-G.

While vaccines are available, there is a requirement for novel vaccine strategies due to high strain variation and poor cross-protection. This requires a more detailed understanding of virus-host cell interactions to identify candidates for targeted virus attenuation. One key area of research in the positive sense RNA virus field, due to its central role in virus replication, is the induction of cellular membrane rearrangements by this class of viruses for the assembly of virus replication complexes. In our recent work, we identified the structures induced by IBV during infection of cultured cells, as well as primary cells and ex vivo organ culture. We identified structures novel to the coronavirus family, which strongly resemble replication sites of other positive sense RNA viruses. We have begun to extend this work using recombinant IBVs, which are chimera of different virus strains to study the role of viral proteins in the induction of membrane rearrangements.","publish_time":"2014-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maier, Helena J; Hawes, Philippa C; Keep, Sarah M; Britton, Paul","journal":"Bioengineered","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/34ccc1c615fa5697b5926c7ce5f1ea21bc06f5fa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4156489.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4161/bioe.29323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25482229/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs1OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detailed understanding of virus","targeted virus attenuation","Infectious bronchitis virus","assembly of virus replication complexes","positive sense RNA virus field","important virus infecting chickens","chimera of different virus strains","positive sense RNA viruses","replication sites","induction of membrane rearrangements","structures novel","induction of cellular membrane rearrangements","primary cells","class of viruses","central role","recent work","novel vaccine strategies","role of viral proteins","infection of cultured cells","high strain variation","host cell interactions","large losses","candidates","poor cross-protection","coronavirus family","key area of research","requirement","organ culture","recombinant IBVs","poultry industry","vaccines"],"language":"en"},

Methods Adult allogeneic HSCT recipients vaccinated with two doses of influenza A/H1N1pdm09 vaccine, separated by 3 weeks, and patients with proven influenza A/H1N1pdm09 infection were included. Antibody responses were measured by hemagglutination-inhibition assay 1) on days 0, 21, 42 and 6 months after the first vaccine injection in vaccinated patients and 2) before pandemic and after influenza A/H1N1pdm09 infection, in patients presented natural infection. Results At baseline, 3% of 59 recipients of adjuvanted vaccine and 0% of 20 infected patients were seroprotected (antibody titer\u22651/40). Seroprotection rate observed 42 days after vaccination was not different from that observed after natural infection (66% and 60% respectively, p =0.78). In vaccinated patients, seroprotection rate increased significantly from 54% to 66% between day 21 and 42 (p =0.015). Moreover, after 6 months, seroprotection rate in 21 vaccinated patients was similar to that observed in 10 infected patients evaluated at least 76 days after infection (D76\u2013217) (60% and 81% respectively, p =0.2). In multivariate analysis, no immunosuppressive treatment or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and longer time between transplantation and vaccination/infection were associated with a stronger humoral response. The adjuvanted vaccine was safe with low rate of GVHD worsening. Conclusion In HSCT recipients, two doses of influenza A/H1N1pdm09 adjuvanted vaccine were safe and induced a humoral response comparable to that triggered by natural infection in these patients.","publish_time":"2014-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dh\u00E9din, Nathalie; Krivine, Anne; Le Corre, Nicole; Mallet, Alain; Lioure, Bruno; Bay, Jacques-Olivier; Rubio, Marie-Th\u00E9r\u00E8se; Agape, Philippe; Thi\u00E9baut, Anne; Le Goff, J\u00E9r\u00F4me; Autran, Brigitte; Ribaud, Patricia","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa9d5bbf9793d156a4a0f58e8dc9ba221378ee89.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115606.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.11.073; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X13016629; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X13016629; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24333120/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs2Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSCT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H1N1pdm09 infection","vaccinated patients","natural infection","H1N1pdm09 vaccine","infected patients","H1N1pdm09 adjuvanted vaccine","group of HSCT patients","recipients of adjuvanted vaccine","H1N1pdm09 vaccination","doses of influenza","vaccine injection","Seroprotection rate","dose influenza","proven influenza","days","Methods Adult allogeneic HSCT recipients","humoral response comparable","stronger humoral response","low rate of GVHD worsening","months","Antibody responses","antibody titer","allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","immunogenicity","longer time","chronic graft","host disease","immunosuppressive treatment","present study","tolerance","weeks","Abstract Background","hemagglutination-inhibition assay","pandemic","multivariate analysis","Conclusion","baseline","D76","Results"],"language":"en"},

Poor water quality, sanitation and hygiene account for some 1.7 million deaths a year world-wide (3.1% of all deaths and 3.7% of all DALY\u2019s), mainly through infectious diarrhoea. Nine out of 10 such deaths are in children and virtually all of the deaths are in developing countries. Major enteric pathogens in these children include: rotavirus, Campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Shigella spp. and Vibrio cholerae O1, and possibly enteropathogenic E. coli, Aeromonas spp. V. cholerae O139, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium difficile and Cryptosporidium parvum.

This is relatively stable over time, occurs across disease severity, and is associated with poorer health outcomes. These patients are therefore a priority for research and treatment. The pathophysiology underlying the frequent exacerbator phenotype is complex, with increased airway and systemic inflammation, dynamic lung hyperinflation, changes in lower airway bacterial colonization and a possible increased susceptibility to viral infection. Frequent exacerbators are also at increased risk from comorbid extrapulmonary diseases including cardiovascular disease, gastroesophageal reflux, depression, osteoporosis and cognitive impairment. Overall these patients have poorer health status, accelerated forced expiratory volume over 1 s (FEV1) decline, worsened quality of life, and increased hospital admissions and mortality, contributing to increased exacerbation susceptibility and perpetuation of the frequent exacerbator phenotype.

RECENT FINDINGS: Adenoidectomy is indicated in children for the treatment of sleep-disordered breathing, nasal airway obstruction, recurrent acute otitis media, and chronic rhinosinusitis. A new recommendation was released in 2016, not supporting adenoidectomy for a primary indication of otitis media in children under 4 years old, including those with prior tympanostomy tubes, unless a distinct indication exists such as nasal obstruction or chronic adenoiditis. Although adenotonsillectomy is the mainstay of treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), recent studies have identified that non-obese patients with moderate OSA and small tonsils have comparable benefits with adenoidectomy alone with less complications. While conventional approaches such as indirect mirror-assisted curette and suction coagulation are still utilized, direct transnasal endoscope-assisted removal of the adenoids has proven to be a safe technique, with good short- and long-term outcomes. Novel non-surgical therapies including immunotherapy have been evaluated. SUMMARY: Adenoidectomy is a safe procedure in the pediatric population and leads to excellent outcomes. Adverse events are rare, and hospitalization is uncommon. Children with sleep disturbance from nasal airway obstruction, ear disease, or chronic rhinosinusitis are the best operative candidates for this procedure.","publish_time":"2018-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schupper, Alexander J.; Nation, Javan; Pransky, Seth","journal":"Curr Otorhinolaryngol Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dca1335a586f541b51725d0d5839f1a15b2fdb81.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100808.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226659/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40136-018-0190-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs3Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OSA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["adenoidectomy procedure","nasal obstruction","children","nasal airway obstruction","treatment of sleep","chronic rhinosinusitis","safe procedure","sleep disturbance","pediatric population","adverse events","chronic adenoiditis","primary indication of otitis media","Novel non-surgical therapies","non-obese patients","obstructive sleep apnea","non-surgical management of adenoid hypertrophy","moderate OSA","recurrent acute otitis media","operative techniques","distinct indication","mainstay of treatment","recent studies","safe technique","RECENT FINDINGS","long-term outcomes","excellent outcomes","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","best operative candidates","surgery","small tonsils","up-to-date indications","ear disease","disordered breathing","comparable benefits","indirect mirror","suction coagulation","years old","prior tympanostomy tubes","direct transnasal endoscope","current state","removal","curette","hospitalization","immunotherapy","future directions","conventional approaches","adenoids","SUMMARY","adenotonsillectomy","complications","new recommendation"],"language":"en"},

The objective of the present study was to find out whether plasma concentrations of MBL and vitamin D are different in patients with dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). THE RESULTS: The plasma concentrations of vitamin D and MBL were assessed in 48 DF cases, 45 DHF cases and 20 apparently healthy controls using ELISA based methods. Vitamin D concentrations were found to be higher among both DF and DHF cases as compared to healthy controls (P \u003C 0.005 and P \u003C 0.001). Vitamin D concentrations were not different between DF and DHF cases. When the dengue cases were classified into primary and secondary infections, secondary DHF cases had significantly higher concentrations of vitamin D as compared to secondary DF cases (P \u003C 0.050). MBL concentrations were not significantly different between healthy controls and dengue cases. MBL concentrations were observed to be lower in DHF cases as compared to DF cases (P \u003C 0.050). Although MBL levels were not different DF and DHF cases based on immune status, the percentage of primary DHF cases (50%) having MBL levels lower than 500 ng/ml were less compared to primary DF cases (P = 0.038).

We discuss how the number of different possible TCRs encoded in the genome (the potential repertoire) and the number of different TCRs present in an individual (the realized repertoire) can be measured. One puzzle is that the potential repertoire greatly exceeds the realized diversity of na\u00EFve T cells within any individual. We show that the existing hypotheses fail to explain why the immune system has the potential to generate far more diversity than is used in an individual, and propose an alternative hypothesis of \u201Cevolutionary sloppiness.\u201D Another immunological puzzle is why mice and humans have similar repertoires even though humans have over 1000-fold more T cells. We discuss how the idea of the \u201Cprotecton,\u201D the smallest unit of protection, might explain this discrepancy and estimate the size of \u201Cprotecton\u201D based on available precursor frequencies data. We then consider T cell cross-reactivity \u2013 the ability of a T cell clone to respond to more than one epitope. We extend existing calculations to estimate the extent of expected cross-reactivity between the responses to different pathogens. Our results are consistent with two observations: a low probability of observing cross-reactivity between the immune responses to two randomly chosen pathogens; and the ensemble of memory cells being sufficiently diverse to generate cross-reactive responses to new pathogens.","publish_time":"2013-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zarnitsyna, Veronika I.; Evavold, Brian D.; Schoettle, Louis N.; Blattman, Joseph N.; Antia, Rustom","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f8f49888663fdad58dabb5d7f9f8556b36d34587.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3872652.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2013.00485; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24421780/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs3ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T cell cross-reactivity","large repertoire of T cells","different pathogens","potential repertoire","T cell clone","realized diversity of na\u00EFve T cells","immune responses","realized repertoire","individual","unique T cell receptors","immune system","new pathogens","diverse array of pathogens","number of different TCRs present","number of different possible TCRs","extent of expected cross-reactivity","humans","cross-reactive responses","ensemble of memory cells","protecton","immunological puzzle","existing calculations","existing hypotheses","mice","genome","low probability","observations","alternative hypothesis","clones specific","similar repertoires","available precursor frequencies data","evolutionary sloppiness","given antigen","smallest unit of protection","discrepancy","results","size","idea","order","epitope"],"language":"en"},

When immune functions are still largely immature, the airway epithelium plays a primary defensive role since, besides providing a physical barrier, it is also involved in the innate and the adaptive immune responses. A study was therefore designed to evaluate in vitro whether pidotimod, a synthetic dipeptide able to stimulate the inflammatory and immune effector cells, could activate bronchial epithelial cell functions involved in response to infections. METHODS: BEAS-2B cell line (human bronchial epithelial cells infected with a replication-defective Adenovirus 12-SV40 virus hybrid) were cultured in the presence of pidotimod, with or without tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1 or zymosan to assess: a) intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 expression, by flow cytometry; b) toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 expression and production, by immunofluorescence flow cytometry and western blotting; d) interleukin (IL)-8 release, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); e) activated extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) phosphorylation and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) activation, by western blotting. RESULTS: The constitutive expression of ICAM-1 and IL-8 release were significant up-regulated by TNF-\u03B1 (ICAM-1) and by TNF-\u03B1 and zymosan (IL-8), but not by pidotimod. In contrast, an increased TLR-2 expression was found after exposure to pidotimod 10 and 100 \u03BCg/ml (p \u003C 0.05) and to the association pidotimod 100 \u03BCg/ml \u002B TNF-\u03B1 (p \u003C 0.05). Western blot analysis substantiated that the constitutive TLR-2 expression was significantly increased after exposure to all the stimuli. Finally, while a remarkable inhibition of TNF-\u03B1 -induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was observed in the presence of pidotimod, both TNF-\u03B1 and pidotimod were effective in inducing NF-kB protein expression in the cytoplasm and its nuclear translocation. CONCLUSION: Through different effects on ERK1/2 and NF-kB, pidotimod was able to increase the expression of TLR-2 proteins, surface molecules involved in the initiation of the innate response to infectious stimuli. The lack of effect on ICAM-1 expression, the receptor for rhinovirus, and on IL-8 release, the potent chemotactic factor for neutrophils (that are already present in sites of infection), may represent protective functions. If confirmed in vivo, these activities may, at least in part, clarify the mechanism of action of this molecule at airway level.","publish_time":"2013-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carta, Sonia; Silvestri, Michela; Rossi, Giovanni A","journal":"Ital J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a7617954fb5dc66e2d7d62b1e5ea2c54f4e02ce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3733658.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1824-7288-39-29; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23663325/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of TLR","TNF-\u03B1","presence of pidotimod","constitutive expression of ICAM","protein expression","association pidotimod","\u03B1 -induced ERK1","constitutive TLR","release","immune functions","increased TLR","remarkable inhibition of TNF","western blotting","bronchial epithelial cell functions","nuclear factor-kappa B","B cell line","phosphorylation","inducing NF","immune effector cells","innate response","receptor","\u03BCg","zymosan","protective functions","exposure","human bronchial epithelial cells","immunofluorescence flow cytometry","potent chemotactic factor","tumor necrosis factor","Western blot analysis","adaptive immune responses","airway epithelium","airway level","nuclear translocation","regulated kinase","infectious stimuli","synthetic dipeptide able","intercellular adhesion molecule","Recurrent respiratory infections","ELISA","replication-defective Adenovirus","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","extracellular-signal","initiation","interleukin","toll","production","SV40 virus hybrid","primary defensive role","neutrophils","surface molecules","BEAS","cytoplasm","proteins","activation","different effects","important causes of morbidity","childhood","sites of infection","BACKGROUND","mechanism of action","CONCLUSION","METHODS","RESULTS","rhinovirus","lack of effect","contrast","physical barrier","study","activities"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed at assessing through a prospective study, the attack rate of pH1N1/2009 virus in Reunion Island and risk factors of infection, during the 2009 season. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A serosurvey was conducted during the 2009 austral winter, in the frame of a prospective population study. Pairs of sera were collected from 1687 individuals belonging to 772 households, during and after passage of the pandemic wave. Antibodies to pH1N1/2009v were titered using the hemagglutination inhibition assay (HIA) with titers \u22651/40 being considered positive. Seroprevalence during the first two weeks of detection of pH1N1/2009v in Reunion Island was 29.8% in people under 20 years of age, 35.6% in adults (20\u201359 years) and 73.3% in the elderly (\u226560 years) (P\u003C0.0001). Baseline corrected cumulative incidence rates, were 42.9%, 13.9% and 0% in these age groups respectively (P\u003C0.0001). A significant decline in antibody titers occurred soon after the passage of the epidemic wave. Seroconversion rates to pH1N1/2009 correlated negatively with age: 63.2%, 39.4% and 16.7%, in each age group respectively (P\u003C0.0001). Seroconversion occurred in 65.2% of individuals who were seronegative at inclusion compared to 6.8% in those who were initially seropositive. CONCLUSIONS: Seroincidence of pH1N1/2009v infection was three times that estimated from clinical surveillance, indicating that almost two thirds of infections occurring at the community level have escaped medical detection. People under 20 years of age were the most affected group. Pre-epidemic titers \u22651/40 prevented seroconversion and are likely protective against infection. A concern was raised about the long term stability of the antibody responses.","publish_time":"2011-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dellagi, Koussay; Rollot, Olivier; Temmam, Sarah; Salez, Nicolas; Guernier, Vanina; Pascalis, Herv\u00E9; G\u00E9rardin, Patrick; Fianu, Adrian; Lapidus, Nathanael; Naty, Nad\u00E8ge; Tortosa, Pablo; Boussa\u00EFd, Karim; Jaffar-Banjee, Marie-Christine; Filleul, Laurent; Flahault, Antoine; Carrat, Fabrice; Favier, Francois; de Lamballerie, Xavier","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee6d70a53e3262cea6f85bd8b226f6b4c8b5f64b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3183080.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21980532/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0025738","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Reunion Island"],"keyphrases":["years of age","Seroincidence of pH1N1","age groups","attack rate of pH1N1","antibody titers","prospective study","Seroconversion rates","community level","Reunion Island","risk factors of infection","prevented seroconversion","Pre-epidemic titers","passage","prospective population study","people","pandemic wave","individuals","epidemic wave","antibody responses","influenza pandemic","medical detection","weeks of detection","clinical surveillance","affected group","clinical symptoms","cumulative incidence rates","virus","frame","long term stability","serosurvey","little information","HIA","true extent","hemagglutination inhibition assay","date","METHODOLOGY","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","Baseline","thirds of infections","significant decline","times","austral winter","concern","inclusion","households","CONCLUSIONS","adults","Pairs of sera","BACKGROUND","Seroprevalence","elderly","season","Antibodies"],"language":"en"},

Global 16S rRNA sequencing confirmed an association between H. influenzae and clinical severity. Interestingly, adjusting for H. influenzae in our gene expression analysis revealed an association between severity and airway lymphocyte accumulation. Exploring the relationship between airway gene expression and the time of onset of clinical symptoms revealed a robust, acute activation of interferon (IFN) signaling, which was absent in subjects with severe illness. Finally, we explored the relationship between IFN activity, airway gene expression and productive RSV infection using a novel in vitro model of bona fide pediatric human airway epithelial cells. Interestingly, blocking IFN signaling, but not IFN ligand production, in these cells leads to increased viral infection. Our data reveal that acute airway interferon responses are physiologically relevant in the context of infant RSV infection and may be a target for therapeutic intervention. Additionally, the airway gene expression signature we define may be useful as a biomarker for efficacy of intervention responses.","publish_time":"2019-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chu, Chin-Yi; Qiu, Xing; McCall, Matthew N.; Wang, Lu; Corbett, Anthony; Holden-Wiltse, Jeanne; Slaunwhite, Christopher; Wang, Qian; Anderson, Christopher; Grier, Alex; Gill, Steven R.; Pryhuber, Gloria S.; Falsey, Ann R.; Topham, David J.; Caserta, Mary T.; Walsh, Edward E.; Mariani, Thomas J","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bddd75ff4f00e94ce274299c608c3500d227b90f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/6a8d26d75bd44c7666c9b7ed782c13a57f409122.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/641795","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["molecular airway gene expression signature of severe illness","gene expression analysis","acute airway interferon responses","airway lymphocyte accumulation","productive RSV infection","time of infection","presence of resident airway microbiota","correlates of severe illness","excessive chemokine expression","pediatric human airway epithelial cells","context of infant RSV infection","IFN activity","cohort of confirmed RSV-infected infants","association","clinical severity","increased viral infection","IFN ligand production","influenzae","relationship","leading cause of severe respiratory disease","acute activation of interferon","efficacy of intervention responses","molecular status","time of onset","clinical symptoms","novel method","therapeutic intervention","Respiratory syncytial virus","model of","known risk factors","data reveal","Rigorous statistical analyses","causes","S rRNA sequencing","biomarker","airways","target","age","subjects"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, a direct comparison of influenza virus production with adherent MDCK and Vero cells in T-flasks, roller bottles, and lab-scale bioreactors was performed in this study. First, virus seeds had to be adapted to Vero cells by multiple passages. Glycan analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein showed that for influenza A/PR/8/34 H1N1, three passages were sufficient to achieve a stable new N-glycan fingerprint, higher yields, and a faster increase to maximum HA titers. Compared to MDCK cells, virus production in serum-free medium with Vero cells was highly sensitive to trypsin concentration. Virus stability at 37 \u00B0C for different virus strains showed differences depending on medium, virus strain, and cell line. After careful adjustment of corresponding parameters, comparable productivity was obtained with both host cell lines in small-scale cultivation systems. However, using these cultivation conditions in lab-scale bioreactors (stirred tank, wave bioreactor) resulted in lower productivities for Vero cells.","publish_time":"2010-07-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Genzel, Yvonne; Dietzsch, Christian; Rapp, Erdmann; Schwarzer, Jana; Reichl, Udo","journal":"Appl Microbiol Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/06ee557e302b25715f9b9d66fb8274e56419a5a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7080112.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-010-2742-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20617311/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Vero"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Vero cells","MDCK cells","Virus stability","virus seeds","direct comparison of influenza virus production","different virus strains","adherent MDCK","host cell lines","comparable cultivation conditions","production of cell culture-derived influenza vaccines","lab-scale bioreactors","small-scale cultivation systems","comparable productivity","Glycan analysis","multiple passages","serum-free medium","maximum HA titers","optimization of corresponding upstream processes","careful adjustment of corresponding parameters","stable new N-glycan fingerprint","Madin Darby canine kidney","one-to-one comparisons","differences","higher yields","wave bioreactor","T-flasks","faster increase","stirred tank","roller bottles","considerable attention","design","lower productivities","hemagglutinin","H1N1","decade","trypsin concentration","protein","numerous publications","study"],"language":"en"},

Acute unilateral cervical lymphadenitis is caused by streptococcal or staphylococcal infection in 40% to 80% of cases.

Generalized lymphadenopathy is often caused by a viral infection, and less frequently by malignancies, collagen vascular diseases, and medications. Laboratory tests are not necessary in the majority of children with cervical lymphadenopathy. Most cases of lymphadenopathy are self-limited and require no treatment.

Systems biology is a holistic approach that considers the entire system as a whole, rather than individual components or molecules. Systems biology based approaches facilitate an unbiased and comprehensive analysis of the antiviral landscape, while allowing for the discovery of emergent properties that are missed by conventional approaches. The antiviral landscape can be viewed as a hierarchy of complexity, beginning at the whole organism level and progressing downward to isolated tissues, populations of cells, and single cells. In this review, we will discuss how systems biology has been applied to better understand the antiviral landscape at each of these layers. At the organismal level, the Collaborative Cross is an invaluable genetic resource for assessing how genetic diversity influences the antiviral responses. Whole tissue and isolated bulk cell transcriptomics serves as a critical tool for the comprehensive analysis of antiviral responses at both the tissue and cellular levels of complexity.

However, discrepancies on target identification of the same viruses by different groups suggest that high throughput RNAi screening strategies need to be carefully designed, developed and optimized prior to the large scale screening. METHODS: Two genome-wide RNAi screens were performed in parallel against the entry of pseudotyped Marburg viruses and avian influenza virus H5N1 utilizing an HIV-1 based surrogate system, to identify host factors which are important for virus entry. A comparative analysis approach was employed in data analysis, which alleviated systematic positional effects and reduced the false positive number of virus-specific hits. RESULTS: The parallel nature of the strategy allows us to easily identify the host factors for a specific virus with a greatly reduced number of false positives in the initial screen, which is one of the major problems with high throughput screening. The power of this strategy is illustrated by a genome-wide RNAi screen for identifying the host factors important for Marburg virus and/or avian influenza virus H5N1 as described in this study. CONCLUSIONS: This strategy is particularly useful for highly pathogenic viruses since pseudotyping allows us to perform high throughput screens in the biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) containment instead of the BSL-3 or BSL-4 for the infectious viruses, with alleviated safety concerns. The screening strategy together with the unique comparative analysis approach makes the data more suitable for hit selection and enables us to identify virus-specific hits with a much lower false positive rate.","publish_time":"2015-11-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Han; Koning, Katie; O\u2019Hearn, Aileen; Wang, Minxiu; Rumschlag-Booms, Emily; Varhegyi, Elizabeth; Rong, Lijun","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a63d851872c31a91cf814a84fc2af7f4fb15ce3d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4657351.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26596270/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-015-0420-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specific virus","virus entry","screening strategy","virus-specific hits","Genome-wide RNAi screening","host factors important","high throughput screening","false positive number of virus","infectious viruses","pathogenic viruses","numerous host factors","avian influenza virus H5N1","high throughput RNAi screening strategies","infection of different viruses","host proteins","genome-wide RNAi screens","BSL","entry of pseudotyped Marburg viruses","high throughput screens","data analysis","large scale screening","unique comparative analysis approach","reduced number of false positives","power","lower false positive rate","different groups","initial screen","parallel nature","replication cycles","alleviated safety concerns","HIV","systematic positional effects","based surrogate system","pseudotyping","biosafety level","major problems","BACKGROUND","target identification","selection","METHODS","discrepancies","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","containment","study"],"language":"en"},

This study compared treatment failure rates of levofloxacin with those of other antibiotics in a large US sample. METHODS|: Medical and pharmacy claims in the nationally representative SDI database were used to identify adults with a new outpatient diagnosis of CAP receiving a study antibiotic (levofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, azithromycin, moxifloxacin) between September 1, 2005 and March 31, 2008. Treatment failure was defined as \u22651 of the following events \u226430 days after index date: a refill for the index antibiotic after completed days of therapy, a different antibiotic dispensed \u003E1 day after the index prescription, or hospitalization with a pneumonia diagnosis or emergency department visit \u003E3 days postindex. Cohorts were propensity score matched for demographic and clinical characteristics. Treatment failure rates were compared between pairs of cohorts for the full sample and for high-risk patients (age \u226565 and/or on Medicaid). RESULTS|: Among the 3994 study patients, the numbers of dispensed index prescriptions were 268 for amoxicillin/clavulanate, 1609 for azithromycin, 1460 for levofloxacin, and 657 for moxifloxacin. Unadjusted treatment failure rates for the sample were 20.8% for levofloxacin, 23.9% for amoxicillin/clavulanate, 23.9% for azithromycin, and 19.9% for moxifloxacin. For high-risk patients, unadjusted treatment failure rates were 19.1% for levofloxacin, 26.1% for amoxicillin/clavulanate, 26.3% for azithromycin, and 24.3% for moxifloxacin. Propensity score-matched treatment failure rates were significantly lower with levofloxacin than azithromycin (19.8% vs. 24.5%, odds ratio [OR] comparator vs. levofloxacin 1.38; 95% CI: 1.14, 1.67), a difference amplified in high-risk patients (19.0% vs. 26.4%, OR 1.61; 95% CI: 1.22, 2.13).

CONCLUSION|: In a large US sample, treatment failure in CAP appeared to be less likely with quinolones (such as levofloxacin) than azithromycin, an effect particularly marked in high-risk patients (age \u226565 and/or on Medicaid).","publish_time":"2010-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hess, Gregory; Hill, Jerrold W.; Raut, Monika K.; Fisher, Alan C.; Mody, Samir; Schein, Jeff R.; Chen, Chi-Chang","journal":"Adv Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f8221cd6d3960c4901166814528f9373a657b78e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20799007/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12325-010-0062-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Medicaid"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment failure rates of levofloxacin","Antibiotic treatment failure","azithromycin","Unadjusted treatment failure rates","Propensity score-matched treatment failure rates","high-risk patients","index antibiotic","study patients","amoxicillin","clavulanate","moxifloxacin","study antibiotic","large US sample","index date","pneumonia diagnosis","days of therapy","numbers of dispensed index prescriptions","days postindex","age","Medicaid","new outpatient diagnosis of CAP","pairs of cohorts","emergency department visit","pharmacy claims","adults","morbidity","demographic","hospitalization","refill","humanistic burdens of community","representative SDI database","mortality","antibiotics","effect","clinical characteristics","following events","healthcare costs","METHODS","comparator","INTRODUCTION","significant differences","paired comparisons","odds ratio","CONCLUSION","quinolones","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

This poses unique challenges for local public health units with their traditional focus on population health and their emphasis on disease prevention, health promotion and protection. Reliance on measures of health status provides an imprecise and partial picture of the performance of a health unit. In 2004 the provincial Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences based in Ontario, Canada introduced a public-health specific balanced scorecard framework. We present the conceptual deliberations and decisions undertaken by a health unit while adopting the framework. DISCUSSION: Posing, pondering and answering key questions assisted in applying the framework and developing indicators. Questions such as: Who should be involved in developing performance indicators? What level of performance should be measured? Who is the primary intended audience? Where and how do we begin? What types of indicators should populate the health status and determinants quadrant? What types of indicators should populate the resources and services quadrant? What type of indicators should populate the community engagement quadrant? What types of indicators should populate the integration and responsiveness quadrants? Should we try to link the quadrants? What comparators do we use? How do we move from a baseline report card to a continuous quality improvement management tool? SUMMARY: An inclusive, participatory process was chosen for defining and creating indicators to populate the four quadrants. Examples of indicators that populate the four quadrants of the scorecard are presented and key decisions are highlighted that facilitated the process.","publish_time":"2009-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weir, Erica; d\u0027Entremont, Nadine; Stalker, Shelley; Kurji, Karim; Robinson, Victoria","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75435342678d143b3fea48a288d1baa113d28a42.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2684743.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-9-127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19426508/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Reliance","Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["types of indicators","population health","health promotion","developing performance indicators","type of indicators","Examples of indicators","measures of health status","local public health units","public-health specific balanced scorecard framework","level of performance","responsiveness quadrants","services quadrant","determinants quadrant","key decisions","key questions","community engagement quadrant","participatory process","emphasis","traditional focus","disease prevention","Canada","continuous quality improvement management tool","Clinical Evaluative Sciences","baseline report card","Ontario","unique challenges","partial picture","aspects","provincial Institute","protection","resources","integration","heath care sector","SUMMARY","Reliance","conceptual deliberations","primary intended audience","BACKGROUND","DISCUSSION","comparators"],"language":"en"},

Human bocavirus (HBoV), a novel virus, is recognized to increasingly associate with previously unknown etiology respiratory infections in young children. In this study, the epidemiological, clinical, and molecular characteristics of HBoV infections were described in hospitalized Vietnamese pediatric patients. From April 2010 to May 2011, 1,082 nasopharyngeal swab samples were obtained from patients with acute respiratory infections at the Children\u0027s Hospital 2, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Samples were screened for HBoV by PCR and further molecularly characterized by sequencing. HBoV was found in 78 (7.2%) children. Co\u2010infection with other viruses was observed in 66.7% of patients infected with HBoV. Children 12\u201324 months old were the most affected age group. Infections with HBoV were found year\u2010round, though most cases occurred in the dry season (December\u2013April). HBoV was possible to cause severe diseases as determined by higher rates of hypoxia, pneumonia, and longer hospitalization duration in patients with HBoV infection than in those without (P\u2010value \u003C0.05). Co\u2010infection with HBoV did not affect the disease severity. The phylogenetic analysis of partial VP1 gene showed minor variations and all HBoV sequences belonged to species 1 (HBoV1). In conclusion, HBoV1 was circulating in Vietnam and detected frequently in young children during dry season. Acute respiratory infections caused by HBoV1 were severe enough for hospitalization, which implied that HBoV1 may have an important role in acute respiratory infections among children. J. Med.

Hygienic practices that have reduced exposure of the immune system to such agents include the use of modern toiletry, disposable diapers and clothes dryers. Historically, the anal region was cleansed following defecation with natural materials that would have brought antigens and infectious agents from the environment into frequent contact with the perianal skin and anal mucosa. This practice was a crude form of transcutaneous and mucosal vaccination, whereby antigenic agents that are topically applied to skin or mucosal surfaces, penetrate into the tissues and stimulate immune responses that can extend to the respiratory tract. Furthermore, until the 1960s, diapers and other cloth items were often dried outdoors where they would have collected environmental antigens that, when applied to the body, could have made contact with the immune system in the skin. Herein, it is hypothesized that prevention of allergic rhinitis and possibly other disorders involving the immune system could be achieved by the daily application of preparations composed of environmental antigens and infectious agents to the anal mucosa and adjacent skin. In support of the proposal, immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis currently involves administration of specific allergens to subcutaneous tissue or to the sublingual mucosa. It is considered that superior protection could be achieved by applying the allergens to the anal region where they would target the immune system in both mucosal tissue and adjacent skin. It is also hypothesized that respiratory viruses applied to the anal region would infect tissues at that site and induce immune responses that would protect the respiratory tract against the common cold and influenza. This approach is supported by evidence that orally administered adenovirus vaccine can induce an infection in the intestinal mucosa that stimulates immunity to protect the respiratory tract. Although other respiratory viruses are unlikely to survive passage through the intestinal tract, rhinovirus has on rare occasion been detected in stool specimens, suggesting the possibility of an infection at the terminal end of the digestive tract. Respiratory syncytial viruses and influenza viruses are amenable to modification by reverse genetics and other techniques and it is expected that natural or modified viruses applied to the anal region could serve to immunize the respiratory tract.","publish_time":"2010-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lloyd Spencer, J.","journal":"Medical Hypotheses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cbcadec27c4f2fd454198bd0e90b786c09eaf6b4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130600.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2009.09.046; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987709006653; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987709006653; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19853382/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory tract","respiratory viruses","anal mucosa","immune system","anal region","Respiratory syncytial viruses","intestinal tract","immune responses","infectious agents","perianal skin","adjacent skin","digestive tract","environmental antigens","influenza viruses","intestinal mucosa","antigenic agents","modified viruses","sublingual mucosa","mucosal tissue","mucosal vaccination","allergic conditions","mucosal surfaces","prevention of allergic rhinitis","tissues","subcutaneous tissue","disposable diapers","frequent contact","natural materials","Summary Exposure","administration of specific allergens","way","use of modern toiletry","modification","passage","rare occasion","crude form of transcutaneous","cloth items","immunotherapy","rhinovirus","following defecation","important role","clothes dryers","reverse genetics","terminal end","virus infections","daily application of preparations","evidence","stool specimens","administered adenovirus vaccine","possibility","techniques","proposal","site","disorders","immunity","dried outdoors","support","Hygienic practices","superior protection","approach","body"],"language":"en"},

Staff completed a standard form and collected a nasopharyngeal swab which was tested for selected respiratory viruses by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: From October 2010\u2013September 2014, we enrolled 332 SARI patients. Fifty\u2010two percent were male and 48% were white non\u2010Hispanic. The median age was 63 years (47% \u226565 years and 5\u00B72% \u003C5 years).

Identifying the underlying mechanisms of variability in pathogenicity is a critical task for understanding influenza virus infection and effective management of highly pathogenic influenza virus disease. We applied a network-based modeling approach to identify critical functions related to influenza virus pathogenicity using large transcriptomic and proteomic datasets from mice infected with six influenza virus strains or mutants. Our analysis revealed two pathogenicity-related gene expression clusters; these results were corroborated by matching proteomics data. We also identified parallel downstream processes that were altered during influenza pathogenesis. We found that network bottlenecks (nodes that bridge different network regions) were highly enriched in pathogenicity-related genes, while network hubs (highly connected network nodes) were significantly depleted in these genes. We confirmed that this trend persisted in a distinct virus: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS). The role of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in influenza pathogenesis, one of the bottleneck regulators with corroborating signals across transcript and protein expression data, was tested and validated in additional mouse infection experiments. We demonstrate that EGFR is important during influenza infection, but the role it plays changes for lethal versus non-lethal infections. Our results show that by using association networks, bottleneck genes that lack hub characteristics can be used to predict a gene\u2019s involvement in influenza virus pathogenicity.

The phenomenon of quasispecies within a viral population is also discussed to reflect virulence and its implications for RNA viruses. An understanding of how such events occur will provide further evidence about whether there are molecular determinants for plaque morphology of RNA viruses or whether different plaque phenotypes arise due to the presence of quasispecies within a population. Ultimately this review gives an insight into whether the intrinsically high error rates due to the low fidelity of RNA polymerases is responsible for the variation in plaque morphology and diversity in virulence.

New LSD outbreaks are currently circulating in the Middle East (ME). Since 2012, severe outbreaks were reported in cattle across the region. Characterizing the spatial and temporal dynamics of LSDV in cattle populations is prerequisite for guiding successful surveillance and control efforts at a regional level in the ME. Here, we aim to model the ecological niche of LSDV and identify epidemic progression patterns over the course of the epidemic. We analyzed publically available outbreak data from the ME for the period 2012\u20132015 using presence-only maximum entropy ecological niche modeling and the time-dependent method for the estimation of the effective reproductive number (R-TD). High-risk areas (probability \u003E0.60) for LSDV identified by ecological niche modeling included parts of many northeastern ME countries, though Israel and Turkey were estimated to be the most suitable locations for occurrence of LSDV outbreaks. The most important environmental predictors that contributed to the ecological niche of LSDV included annual precipitation, land cover, mean diurnal range, type of livestock production system, and global livestock densities. Average monthly effective R-TD was equal to 2.2 (95% CI: 1.2, 3.5), whereas the largest R-TD was estimated in Israel (R-TD = 22.2, 95 CI: 15.2, 31.5) in September 2013, which indicated that the demographic and environmental conditions during this period were suitable to LSDV super-spreading events. The sharp drop of Isreal\u2019s inferred R-TD in the following month reflected the success of their 2013 vaccination campaign in controlling the disease. Our results identified areas in which underreporting of LSDV outbreaks may have occurred. More epidemiological information related to cattle populations are needed to further improve the inferred spatial and temporal characteristics of currently circulating LSDV. However, the methodology presented here may be useful in guiding the design of risk-based surveillance and control programs in the region as well as aid in the formulation of epidemic preparedness plans in neighboring LSDV-free countries.","publish_time":"2016-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alkhamis, Mohammad A.; VanderWaal, Kimberly","journal":"Front Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64f5af205494b75764762ed86fd202387c77b0b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4776163.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26973845/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2016.00019","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LSDV"],"locations":["Middle East","Turkey","Israel"],"keyphrases":["ecological niche of LSDV","occurrence of LSDV outbreaks","temporal dynamics of LSDV","largest R-TD","neighboring LSDV-free countries","LSDV super-spreading events","cattle populations","severe outbreaks","Average monthly effective R-TD","infectious disease of cattle","maximum entropy ecological niche modeling","period","Israel","New LSD outbreaks","epidemic progression patterns","successful surveillance","based surveillance","formulation of epidemic preparedness plans","control efforts","control programs","suitable locations","temporal characteristics","Lumpy skin disease virus","environmental conditions","High-risk areas","global livestock densities","effective reproductive number","important environmental predictors","severe economic implications","type of livestock production system","diurnal range","land cover","annual precipitation","estimation","time-dependent method","design of risk","presence","parts","aid","course","following month","sharp drop of Isreal\u2019s","regional level","publically available outbreak data","vaccination campaign","demographic","epidemiological information","probability","Turkey","Middle East","methodology","results"],"language":"en"},

The impact on pain management fellowships has been significant and will likely last for months, resulting in extraordinary challenges to the administration of pain fellowship programs and the education of our fellows. Several strategies will help address these challenges, including employing telehealth capabilities to continue clinical experiences, and providing trainees with opportunities to continue their professional growth beyond fellowship completion. Together, we can implement innovative solutions to overcome these challenges.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kohan, Lynn; Sobey, Christopher; Wahezi, Sayed; Brancolini, Scott; Przkora, Rene; Shaparin, Naum; Spektor, Boris; Moeschler, Susan; Anitescu, Magdalena","journal":"Pain medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32379882/; https://doi.org/10.1093/pm/pnaa176","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Association of Pain Program Directors"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fellowship directors","panel of pain program directors","administration of pain fellowship programs","BACKGROUND Pain fellowship programs","Association of Pain Program Directors","pain management fellowships","unique challenges","extraordinary challenges","fellowship completion","guidance","Panel members","trainees","Innovative solutions","clinical care","clinical experiences","board members","referral management","today\u0027s fellows","proper education","unprecedented pandemic","post-graduate impact","use of remote","expert opinion","adaptability","best available evidence","virtual platforms","Centers","alterations","officers","employing telehealth capabilities","recommendations","Disease Control","state governments","professional growth","midst","evolving learning environment","opportunities","Restrictions","Prevention","months","well-being","COVID","CONCLUSIONS","country"],"language":"en"},

The aim was to compare the results of IFAT, ELISA and PCR and to investigate the possible associations between seropositivity to Leishmania spp and signalment, living conditions, season of sampling, health status of the cats, and seropositivity to other infectious agents. Low concentrations of anti-Leishmania IgG were detected by IFAT in 10% of the cats and by ELISA in 1%, whereas anti-Leishmania IgM were detected by IFAT in 1%. There was disagreement between the results of IFAT and ELISA for anti-Leishmania IgG (P = 0.039) and between all serological tests and PCR (P \u003C 0.001). The diagnostic sensitivity of all serological tests, using PCR as the gold standard, was very low, but ELISA and IFAT for anti-Leishmania IgM had 100% specificity. The diagnostic sensitivity of all serological tests could not be improved by changing the cut-off values. Seropositivity for Leishmania spp was not associated with signalment, living conditions, season of sampling and health status of the cats or with seropositivity to feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline coronavirus, Toxoplasma gondii and Bartonella henselae.

Viruses and bacteria in acute asthma exacerbations \u2013 A GA(2)LEN\u2010DARE systematic review. Allergy 2011; 66: 458\u2013468. ABSTRACT: A major part of the burden of asthma is caused by acute exacerbations. Exacerbations have been strongly and consistently associated with respiratory infections. Respiratory viruses and bacteria are therefore possible treatment targets. To have a reasonable estimate of the burden of disease induced by such infectious agents on asthmatic patients, it is necessary to understand their nature and be able to identify them in clinical samples by employing accurate and sensitive methodologies. This systematic review summarizes current knowledge and developments in infection epidemiology of acute asthma in children and adults, describing the known impact for each individual agent and highlighting knowledge gaps. Among infectious agents, human rhinoviruses are the most prevalent in regard to asthma exacerbations. The newly identified type\u2010C rhinoviruses may prove to be particularly relevant. Respiratory syncytial virus and metapneumovirus are important in infants, while influenza viruses seem to induce severe exacerbations mostly in adults. Other agents are relatively less or not clearly associated. Mycoplasma and Chlamydophila pneumoniae seem to be involved more with asthma persistence rather than with disease exacerbations. Recent data suggest that common bacteria may also be involved, but this should be confirmed. Although current information is considerable, improvements in detection methodologies, as well as the wide variation in respect to location, time and populations, underline the need for additional studies that should also take into account interacting factors.","publish_time":"2010-11-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Papadopoulos, N.

The evidence base for public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) is weak, however, and previous reviews have noted a substantial proportion of anecdotal event reports. To investigate the body of research excluding the anecdotal reports and better understand primary and analytical research for PHEP, a scoping review was conducted with two objectives: first, to develop a thematic map focused on primary research; and second, to use this map to inform and guide an understanding of knowledge gaps relevant to research and practice in PHEP. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted based on established methodology. Multiple databases of indexed and grey literature were searched based on concepts of public health, emergency, emergency management/preparedness and evaluation/evidence. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied iteratively. Primary research studies that were evidence-based or evaluative in nature were included in the final group of selected studies. Thematic analysis was conducted for this group. Stakeholder consultation was undertaken for the purpose of validating themes and identifying knowledge gaps. To accomplish this, a purposive sample of researchers and practicing professionals in PHEP or closely related fields was asked to complete an online survey and participate in an in-person meeting. Final themes and knowledge gaps were synthesized after stakeholder consultation. RESULTS: Database searching yielded 3015 citations and article selection resulted in a final group of 58 articles. A list of ten themes from this group of articles was disseminated to stakeholders with the survey questions. Survey findings resulted in four cross-cutting themes and twelve stand-alone themes. Several key knowledge gaps were identified in the following themes: attitudes and beliefs; collaboration and system integration; communication; quality improvement and performance standards; and resilience. Resilience emerged as both a gap and a cross-cutting theme. Additional cross-cutting themes included equity, gender considerations, and high risk or at-risk populations. CONCLUSIONS: In this scoping review of the literature enhanced by stakeholder consultation, key themes and knowledge gaps in the PHEP evidence base were identified which can be used to inform future practice-oriented research in PHEP.

Along these lines, the authors decided to detect coronaviruses in dromedary camels in two high-risk areas of Iran by employing an reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. In the present study, nasal swab specimens were collected from 98 camels (C. dromedarius) traditionally reared in southeast and northwest of Iran. The detection of pancoronavirus was carried out, using RT-PCR. Pancoronavirus RNA was observed in seven cases among 98 nasal swab samples. Among these, 4 positive samples belonged to Azerbaijan province located in northwest of Iran and 3 positive samples were taken from southeast of Iran.

These new advances in DNA manipulation have been extended to the level of whole-genome synthesis, as evident from the synthesis of poliovirus, from the resurrection of the extinct 1918 strain of influenza virus and of human endogenous retroviruses and from the restructuring of the phage T7 genome. The largest DNA synthesized so far is the 582,970 base pair genome of Mycoplasma genitalium, although, as yet, this synthetic DNA has not been \u2018booted\u2019 to life. As genome synthesis is independent of a natural template, it allows modification of the structure and function of a virus\u2019s genetic information to an extent that was hitherto impossible. The common goal of this new strategy is to further our understanding of an organism\u2019s properties, particularly its pathogenic armory if it causes disease in humans, and to make use of this new information to protect from, or treat, human viral disease. Although only a few applications of virus synthesis have been described as yet, key recent findings have been the resurrection of the 1918 influenza virus and the generation of codon- and codon pair\u2013deoptimized polioviruses.","publish_time":"2009-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wimmer, Eckard; Mueller, Steffen; Tumpey, Terrence M; Taubenberger, Jeffery K","journal":"Nature Biotechnology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f8f494baf1a8050a35dd64ad5911133fcfb722d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f4ad52dc5cd31513cc22af8923ba315c0b37f54e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2819212.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2819212?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.1593; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20010599/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjszMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genome synthesis","DNA synthesis","synthesis of poliovirus","applications of virus synthesis","new information","DNA manipulation","largest DNA","synthetic DNA","codon pair","resurrection","strain of influenza virus","new strategy","phage T7 genome","new advances","base pair genome of Mycoplasma genitalium","virus\u2019s genetic information","human viral disease","generation of codon","human endogenous retroviruses","large-scale genetic alteration of organisms","restructuring","sequencing","function","pathogenic armory","natural template","organism\u2019s properties","modification","structure","understanding","extent","Rapid progress","deoptimized polioviruses","humans","key recent findings","common goal","level","life"],"language":"en"},

Eight regions with homologous 3D-conformation were derived for 10 proteins of interest. One of the region, R binding (754\u2013766 in SARS-CoV\u0027s RdRp), located in the palm sub-domain mainly constituted of anti-parallel \u03B2-strand-turn-\u03B2-strand hairpin structures that covers two of the three RdRp catalytic sites (Asp 760, Asp761), was also predicted by molecular docking method (based on free energy of binding \u0394G) to be important binding motif recognized by ATA. The existence of this strictly conserved region that incorporated catalytic residues, coupled with the homologous ATA binding pockets and their consistent \u0394G values, suggested strongly ATA may be involved in an analogous inhibition mechanism of SARS-COV\u0027s RdRp in concomitant to the case in m-calpain, PTP and HIV integrase.","publish_time":"2005-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yap, YeeLeng; Zhang, XueWu; Andonov, Anton; He, RunTao","journal":"Computational Biology and Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c2039ed5d9bde2d634fdf12edc9a559bf46fa2a7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106521.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1476927105000393; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1476927105000393","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjszMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ATA","PTP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sites of ATA","ATA binds","homologous ATA binding pockets","SARS-CoV\u0027s RdRp","SARS-CoV replication","R binding","RdRp catalytic sites","potential binding modes","important binding motif","free energy of binding \u0394G","analogous inhibition mechanism of SARS","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","pathogenic positive-strand RNA-viruses","anti-parallel \u03B2-strand","HIV integrase","calpain","PTP","\u03B2-strand hairpin structures","proteins","incorporated protein structural studies","catalytic residues","experimental observation","conserved region","experimental results","consistent \u0394G values","protein tyrosine phosphatase","existing crystal structures","potent anti-viral drug","host cells","negative controls","Ca2","case","fact","palm sub-domain","Aurintricarboxylic Acid","concomitant","molecular docking method","neutral protease","D-conformation","times","regions","Asp761","existence"],"language":"en"},

It finds that the public subsidies and medical insurance reforms have improved the cost efficiency of Chinese hospitals, while the coastal location and 3A class hospital proportion have decreased the cost efficiency of Chinese hospitals.

Thanks to the improvement of the current -omics technologies and the increasing understanding of the molecular relationships, even more studies are evaluating the biological systems through approaches based on graph theory. Genomic and proteomic data are often combined with protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks whose structure is routinely analyzed by algorithms and tools to characterize hubs/bottlenecks and topological, functional, and disease modules. On the other hand, co-expression networks represent a complementary procedure that give the opportunity to evaluate at system level including organisms that lack information on PPIs. Based on these premises, we introduce the reader to the PPI and to the co-expression networks, including aspects of reconstruction and analysis. In particular, the new idea to evaluate large-scale proteomic data by means of co-expression networks will be discussed presenting some examples of application.

The implications of these findings on human health are only beginning to emerge.","publish_time":"2012-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dinman, Jonathan D.","journal":"Advances in Protein Chemistry and Structural Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cf198f9f2ad831b3ae8efa89b0ad68c695f3ca55.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149833.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-386497-0.00004-9; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123864970000049; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123864970000049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22243583/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjszOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["translational recoding","translational reading frame","codon reassignment","codon assignation","conceivable mode of recoding","new avenues","ribosomes","treatment of numerous inborn errors of metabolism","modes","Instances of programmed ribosomal frameshifting","organisms","signals","coding capacity of genomes","rules","genetic code","implications","findings","human health","gene expression","sequences","domains of life","exceptions","posttranscriptional level","Abstract","viruses"],"language":"en"},

Here, we advance the hypothesis that four well-recognized features of aging contribute to the disproportionate SARS-CoV-2 mortality suffered by elderly men: i. the presence of subclinical systemic inflammation without overt disease, ii. a blunted acquired immune system and type I interferon response due to the chronic inflammation; iii. the downregulation of ACE2 (i.e. the SARS-CoV-2 receptor); and iv. accelerated biological aging.

Overall, 8 out of 69 (11.6%) patients died, 7 from cohort A (14.3%) and one from cohort B (5%). Out of 69 patients 43 were migrants, 26/49 (53.1%) in cohort A and 17/20 (85.0%) in cohort B.

As a prototype coronavirus, MHV has been explored extensively and is often used to express foreign proteins. Previously, a 13-residue deletion in the MHV spike (S) protein endodomain was found to reduce syncytium formation dramatically while inhibiting virus replication slightly. In this study, the effects of the S mutation on MHV infectivity and foreign protein expression were further examined in rat or mouse L2, NIH/3T3 and Neuro-2a cells. The replacement of the MHV 2a/haemagglutinin-esterase gene with a membrane-anchored protein hook (HK) and replacement of gene 4 with EGFP did not change the adaptability and cytopathology of recombinant viruses in these cells. However, the cytopathic effect of the recombinants with the partial S deletion was reduced significantly in these cells. The replication and foreign protein expression of the S-mutated recombinants were found to be more efficient in L2 cells than in Neuro-2a and NIH/3T3 cells. Meanwhile, the distribution patterns of HK and EGFP expressed by the recombinant viruses were similar to those in cells transfected with a eukaryotic expression vector. These results suggest that the partial deletion in the S endodomain may increase the usefulness of MHV as a viral vector by attenuation and maintaining foreign protein expression.","publish_time":"2011-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Jinhua; Sun, Zhiping; Wang, Yuyan; Lv, Jun; Qu, Di; Ye, Rong","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de0ccd3f0c46405ba5d43bc0d565ee838e778d5a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112841.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2010.12.018; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093410004593; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093410004593; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21192978/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs0NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV","NIH","EGFP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["foreign protein expression","viral protein expression","protein endodomain","L2 cells","3T3 cells","MHV spike","MHV infectivity","usefulness of MHV","S endodomain","partial S deletion","S mutation","S-mutated recombinants","eukaryotic expression vector","partial deletion","foreign proteins","membrane-anchored protein hook","viral vector","EGFP","mouse L2","NIH","Neuro","residue deletion","virus replication","replacement of gene","cytopathology of recombinant viruses","Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus","haemagglutinin-esterase gene","distribution patterns of HK","attenuation","series of subgenomic RNAs","rat","syncytium formation","adaptability","effects","cytopathic effect","study","prototype coronavirus","results"],"language":"en"},

Many viruses, including herpesviruses, are known to exploit the nucleolar compartment during their replication cycle. In a previous study, we demonstrated the preferential targeting and accumulation of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL83 phosphoprotein (pp65) to the nucleolar compartment and, in particular, to the nucleolar matrix of lytically infected fibroblasts; such targeting was already evident at very early times after infection. Here we have investigated the possible effects of rRNA synthesis inhibition upon the development of HCMV lytic infection, by using either actinomycin D or cisplatin at low concentrations, that are known to selectively inhibit RNA polymerase I activity, whilst leaving RNA polymerase II function unaffected. Following the inhibition of rRNA synthesis by either of the agents used, we observed a significant redistribution of nucleolar proteins within the nucleoplasm and a simultaneous depletion of viral pp65 from the nucleolus; this effect was highly evident in both unextracted cells and in nuclear matrices in situ. Of particular interest, even a brief suppression of rRNA synthesis resulted in a very strong inhibition of the progression of HCMV infection, as was concluded from the absence of accumulation of HCMV major immediate\u2010early proteins within the nucleus of infected cells. These data suggest that a functional relationship might exist between rRNA synthesis, pp65 localization to the nucleolar matrix and the normal development of HCMV lytic infection. J. Cell.

As we consider the use of convalescent plasma in the battle against this new strain of coronavirus, it is prudent to review what is known from past experiences. Accordingly, the aim of this review is to examine in detail studies of convalescent plasma used during previous viral outbreaks and pandemics with particular focus on hemorrhagic fevers, influenza, and other coronaviruses. The concluding sections of this review address the potential use of convalescent plasma during the present-day SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, not only insofar as its clinical benefit but also the steps required to make convalescent plasma treatments readily available for an exponentially growing patient population. By the end, the authors hope to address the extent to which convalescent plasma represents a realistic therapeutic approach, or a distraction from other potentially useful treatments.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sullivan, H.

This has led to the prevailing view that this disease is the result of weak immune responses that cannot control the fungus. However, increasingly, clinical and experimental studies have revealed that the host immune response can contribute to cryptococcal pathogenesis, including the recent study of L. M. Neal et al.

This finding has fundamental implications for our understanding of the pathogenesis of cryptococcal disease; it helps explain why immunotherapy has been largely unsuccessful in treatment and provides insight into the paradoxical observation that HIV-associated cryptococcosis may have a better prognosis than cryptococcosis in those with no known immune impairment. The demonstration that host-mediated damage can drive cryptococcal disease provides proof of concept that the parabola put forth in the damage-response framework has the flexibility to depict complex and changing outcomes of host-microbe interaction.","publish_time":"2017-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pirofski, Liise-anne; Casadevall, Arturo","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6aa72847e6c019bbc18254ec5cca30db62200120.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5727418.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29233901/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02063-17","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["L.

Tat trafficks to the nucleoplasm and the nucleolus. The nucleolus, a highly dynamic and structured membrane-less sub-nuclear compartment, is the site of rRNA and ribosome biogenesis and is involved in numerous cellular functions including transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control and viral infection. Importantly, transient nucleolar trafficking of both Tat and HIV-1 viral transcripts are critical in HIV-1 replication, however, the role(s) of the nucleolus in HIV-1 replication remains unclear. To better understand how the interaction of Tat with the nucleolar machinery contributes to HIV-1 pathogenesis, we investigated the quantitative changes in the composition of the nucleolar proteome of Jurkat T-cells stably expressing HIV-1 Tat fused to a TAP tag. Using an organellar proteomic approach based on mass spectrometry, coupled with Stable Isotope Labelling in Cell culture (SILAC), we quantified 520 proteins, including 49 proteins showing significant changes in abundance in Jurkat T-cell nucleolus upon Tat expression. Numerous proteins exhibiting a fold change were well characterised Tat interactors and/or known to be critical for HIV-1 replication. This suggests that the spatial control and subcellular compartimentaliation of these cellular cofactors by Tat provide an additional layer of control for regulating cellular machinery involved in HIV-1 pathogenesis. Pathway analysis and network reconstruction revealed that Tat expression specifically resulted in the nucleolar enrichment of proteins collectively participating in ribosomal biogenesis, protein homeostasis, metabolic pathways including glycolytic, pentose phosphate, nucleotides and amino acids biosynthetic pathways, stress response, T-cell signaling pathways and genome integrity. We present here the first differential profiling of the nucleolar proteome of T-cells expressing HIV-1 Tat. We discuss how these proteins collectively participate in interconnected networks converging to adapt the nucleolus dynamic activities, which favor host biosynthetic activities and may contribute to create a cellular environment supporting robust HIV-1 production.","publish_time":"2012-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jarboui, Mohamed Ali; Bidoia, Carlo; Woods, Elena; Roe, Barbara; Wynne, Kieran; Elia, Giuliano; Hall, William W.; Gautier, Virginie W.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/efa871aeaf22cbd0ce30e8bd1cb3d1afff2a98f9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3499507.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0048702; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23166591/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Tat"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Tat expression","Tat trafficks","interaction of Tat","robust HIV","characterised Tat interactors","replication","Jurkat T-cell nucleolus","trans-activator Tat protein","nucleolar proteome of T","nucleolar enrichment of proteins","nucleolar machinery","Numerous proteins","nucleolar proteome of Jurkat T-cells","cellular machinery","nucleolus dynamic activities","cell cycle control","Cell culture","cellular cofactors","cellular environment","numerous cellular functions","transient nucleolar trafficking","metabolic pathways","protein homeostasis","viral regulatory protein essential","viral transcripts","viral infection","spatial control","pathogenesis","amino acids biosynthetic pathways","additional layer of control","host biosynthetic activities","ribosomal biogenesis","ribosome biogenesis","significant changes","quantitative changes","pentose phosphate","transcriptional regulation","stress response","nucleotides","abundance","mass spectrometry","Stable Isotope Labelling","fold change","sub-nuclear compartment","structured membrane","subcellular compartimentaliation","site of rRNA","network reconstruction","SILAC","composition","organellar proteomic approach","Pathway analysis","differential profiling","genome integrity","interconnected networks","production","role","nucleoplasm","TAP tag"],"language":"en"},

A binding domain that mediates the attachment of the virus to its receptor has been identified in the S1 protein of prototype IBV strain M41. In this study, we identified this binding domain in a different strain, as well as the cellular proteins that interact with it. First, we expressed the S1(N) proteins (residues 19-270) of M41 and another isolate, SCZJ3, and compared the binding capacities of recombinant S1(N)-M41 and S1(N)-SCZJ3 to host tissues. Protein histochemistry showed that both S1(N)-M41 and S1(N)-SCZJ3 could bind to lung and kidney, and that recombinant S1(N)-SCZJ3 displayed a distinctive staining pattern in the proventriculus. Recombinant S1(N)-SCZJ3 was then employed to purify binding-associated proteins in lung, kidney, and proventriculus. Using an affinity chromatography assay, two common bands of about 60 kDa and 70 kDa were obtained from the total tissue proteins. These protein bands were identified by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). Finally, infection of chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells by SCZJ3 was found to be inhibited by anti-HSP70 but not anti-PDI polyclonal antibody. These data indicate that HSP70 is part of the receptor complex of IBV and might help to understand the mechanism of S-mediated cell entry of IBV.

Target structures are sequestered by double\u2010membrane vesicles called autophagosomes, which are formed through the concerted action of the autophagy (ATG)\u2010related proteins. Until recently it was assumed that ATG proteins were exclusively involved in autophagy. A growing number of studies, however, have attributed functions to some of them that are distinct from their classical role in autophagosome biogenesis. Autophagy\u2010independent roles of the ATG proteins include the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and resistance to pathogens. For example, they assist and enhance the turnover of dead cells and microbes upon their phagocytic engulfment, and inhibit murine norovirus replication. Moreover, bone resorption by osteoclasts, innate immune regulation triggered by cytoplasmic DNA and the ER\u2010associated degradation regulation all have in common the requirement of a subset of ATG proteins. Microorganisms such as coronaviruses, Chlamydia trachomatis or Brucella abortus have even evolved ways to manipulate autophagy\u2010independent functions of ATG proteins in order to ensure the completion of their intracellular life cycle. Taken together these novel mechanisms add to the repertoire of functions and extend the number of cellular processes involving the ATG proteins.

Group 2\u20138 serum antibody-positive sows and their 91 piglets. Piglets were orally inoculated with PEDV at 4 (Group 1) or 2 (Group 2) days of age. Group 3\u20132 PEDV serum antibody-negative sows and 22 piglets, provided a baseline for piglet survivability and growth rate. Piglets were monitored daily for clinical signs, body weight, and body temperature through day post-inoculation (DPI) 12 (Groups 2 and 3) or 14 (Group 1). Serum and mammary secretions were tested for PEDV IgG, IgA, and virus-neutralizing antibody. Feces were tested by PEDV real-time, reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR). Piglets on sows without (Group 1) or with (Group 2) anti-PEDV antibody showed significantly different responses to PEDV infection in virus shedding (p \u003C 0.05), thermoregulation (p \u003C 0.05), growth rate (p \u003C 0.05), and survivability (p \u003C0.0001). Specifically, Group 1 piglets shed more virus on DPIs 1 to 5, were hypothermic at all sampling points except DPIs 9, 11, and 12, gained weight more slowly, and exhibited lower survivability than Group 2 piglets.

Nevertheless, predictive biomarkers that can help identify patients more likely to develop these irAEs could enhance the management of these toxicities. METHODS: To identify candidate predictive biomarkers associated with GI irAEs, gene expression profiling was performed on whole blood samples from 162 advanced melanoma patients at baseline, 3 and 11 weeks after the start of ipilimumab treatment in two phase II clinical trials (CA184004 and CA184007). Overall, 49 patients developed Grade 2 or higher (grade 2\u002B) GI irAEs during the course of treatment. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the differences in mean expression levels between the GI irAE and No-GI irAE groups of patients at the three time points. RESULTS: In baseline samples, 27 probe sets showed differential mean expression (\u2265 1.5 fold, P \u2264 0.05) between the GI irAE and No-GI irAE groups. Most of these probe sets belonged to three functional categories: immune system, cell cycle, and intracellular trafficking. Changes in gene expression over time were also characterized. In the GI irAE group, 58 and 247 probe sets had a \u2265 1.5 fold change in expression from baseline to 3 and 11 weeks after first ipilimumab dose, respectively. In particular, on-treatment expression increases of CD177 and CEACAM1, two neutrophil-activation markers, were closely associated with GI irAEs, suggesting a possible role of neutrophils in ipilimumab-associated GI irAEs. In addition, the expression of several immunoglobulin genes increased over time, with greater increases in patients with grade 2\u002B GI irAEs. CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression profiling of peripheral blood, sampled before or early in the course of treatment with ipilimumab, resulted in the identification of a set of potential biomarkers that were associated with occurrence of GI irAEs. However, because of the low sensitivity of these biomarkers, they cannot be used alone to predict which patients will develop GI irAEs. Further investigation of these biomarkers in a larger patient cohort is warranted.","publish_time":"2013-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shahabi, Vafa; Berman, David; Chasalow, Scott D; Wang, Lisu; Tsuchihashi, Zenta; Hu, Beihong; Panting, Lisa; Jure-Kunkel, Maria; Ji, Rui-Ru","journal":"J Transl Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40c1f536d2ba1ea36ff1f17881df3f1073e76586.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3637501.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1479-5876-11-75; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23521917/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ipilimumab-associated GI irAEs","occurrence of GI irAEs","GI irAE groups of patients","treatment expression increases of CD177","course of treatment","start of ipilimumab treatment","gastrointestinal irAE","treatment guidelines","differential mean expression","mean expression levels","treatment of advanced melanoma","advanced melanoma patients","Gene expression profiling of peripheral blood","probe sets","ipilimumab dose","Grade","candidate predictive biomarkers","baseline samples","set of potential biomarkers","blood samples","weeks","time points","immune system","greater increases","fold change","immune-related adverse events","CEACAM1","cell cycle","functional categories","phase","clinical trials","possible role of neutrophils","antibody","colitis","human anti-CTLA","repeated measures analysis of variance","ANOVA","CA184004","immunoglobulin genes","identification","CONCLUSIONS","neutrophil-activation markers","intracellular trafficking","larger patient cohort","skin rash","CA184007","METHODS","differences","Changes","low sensitivity","investigation","RESULTS","addition","management","BACKGROUND","toxicities"],"language":"en"},

The viral polypeptides linked originally with disulfide bonds were separated into subunits. The complexes were trimers (P\u203250) or dimers (P60 and P10). The apparent molecular weights of P81, P53, and P49 changed significantly according to the composition of the lysis buffer used, suggesting that the differences in their molecular weights were due to conformational changes produced by reduction of their intramolecular disulfide bonds. Sulfhydryl-containing polypeptides (P\u203250-P50, P60, P100, and P33) were detected by N-[14C]ethylmaleimide, and the accessibility of these residues was analyzed after successive stripping of the CIV particle. Radioiodination of external polypeptides by [125I]iodosulfanilic acid shows only one intensively labeled spot corresponding to the P50 polypeptide, whereas P\u203250 was only slightly labeled. Six viral polypeptides P81, P60, P31, P17, P13, and P10 were revealed to possess high affinity for CIV DNA.

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in 54 patients who admitted to Tongji hospital from February 3, 2020 to February 24, 2020 and met the criteria of severe or critical conditions of COVID-19. The clinical characteristics and hospital mortality rate were analyzed and compared between the patients with or without myocardial injury, which was defined with 3 times higher serum cardiac troponin value. Results: The median age of the 54 patients was 68 (59.8, 74.3) years. Among all the patients, 24 (44.4%) patients were complicated with hypertension, 13 (24.1%) with diabetes, 8 (14.8%) with coronary heart disease, and 3 (5.6%) with previous cerebral infarction. During hospitalization, 24 (44.4%) of the patients were complicated with myocardial injury and 26 (48.1%) patients died in hospital.

However, data are limited on how SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, enters and spreads in a population. METHODS: We targeted testing to persons living in Iceland who were at high risk for infection (mainly those who were symptomatic, had recently traveled to high-risk countries, or had contact with infected persons). We also carried out population screening using two strategies: issuing an open invitation to 10,797 persons and sending random invitations to 2283 persons. We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from 643 samples. RESULTS: As of April 4, a total of 1221 of 9199 persons (13.3%) who were recruited for targeted testing had positive results for infection with SARS-CoV-2. Of those tested in the general population, 87 (0.8%) in the open-invitation screening and 13 (0.6%) in the random-population screening tested positive for the virus. In total, 6% of the population was screened. Most persons in the targeted-testing group who received positive tests early in the study had recently traveled internationally, in contrast to those who tested positive later in the study. Children under 10 years of age were less likely to receive a positive result than were persons 10 years of age or older, with percentages of 6.7% and 13.7%, respectively, for targeted testing; in the population screening, no child under 10 years of age had a positive result, as compared with 0.8% of those 10 years of age or older. Fewer females than males received positive results both in targeted testing (11.0% vs. 16.7%) and in population screening (0.6% vs. 0.9%). The haplotypes of the sequenced SARS-CoV-2 viruses were diverse and changed over time. The percentage of infected participants that was determined through population screening remained stable for the 20-day duration of screening. CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based study in Iceland, children under 10 years of age and females had a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection than adolescents or adults and males. The proportion of infected persons identified through population screening did not change substantially during the screening period, which was consistent with a beneficial effect of containment efforts.

However, the understanding of the viral population and the ecological diversity residing in bat populations is unclear, which complicates the determination of the origins of certain EIDs. Here, using bats as a typical wildlife reservoir model, virome analysis was conducted based on pharyngeal and anal swab samples of 4440 bat individuals of 40 major bat species throughout China. The purpose of this study was to survey the ecological and biological diversities of viruses residing in these bat species, to investigate the presence of potential bat-borne zoonotic viruses and to evaluate the impacts of these viruses on public health. The data obtained in this study revealed an overview of the viral community present in these bat samples. Many novel bat viruses were reported for the first time and some bat viruses closely related to known human or animal pathogens were identified. This genetic evidence provides new clues in the search for the origin or evolution pattern of certain viruses, such as coronaviruses and noroviruses.

Paramyxoviruses are believed to contain a single fusion peptide at the N terminus of the F1 protein. However, here we identified an additional internal segment in the Sendai virus F1 protein (amino acids 214\u2013226) highly homologous to the fusion peptides of HIV-1 and RSV. A synthetic peptide, which includes this region, was found to induce membrane fusion of large unilamellar vesicles, at concentrations where the known N-terminal fusion peptide is not effective. A scrambled peptide as well as several peptides from other regions of the F1 protein, which strongly bind to membranes, are not fusogenic. The functional and structural characterization of this active segment suggest that the F1 protein has an additional internal fusion peptide that could participate in the actual fusion event. The presence of homologous regions in other members of the same family suggests that the concerted action of two fusion peptides, one N-terminal and the other internal, is a general feature of paramyxoviruses.","publish_time":"2000-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peisajovich, Sergio Gerardo; Samuel, Orit; Shai, Yechiel","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df383f9c7e70f4301ec575482b2d30d0b6930f97.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127493.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283600935435; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283600935435","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":["Sendai"],"keyphrases":["single fusion peptide","additional internal fusion peptide","fusion peptides of HIV","known N-terminal fusion peptide","actual fusion event","synthetic peptide","scrambled peptide","Abstract Viral fusion proteins","additional internal segment","membrane fusion of large unilamellar vesicles","Sendai virus F1 protein","active segment","hydrophobic segment","N terminus","viral membranes","presence of homologous regions","general feature of paramyxoviruses","concentrations","amino acids","structural characterization","merging","members","concerted action","family","RSV","fusogenic"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We identified individuals of all ages with laboratory\u2010confirmed RSV from two sources, a community cohort undergoing surveillance for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and hospitalized patients from the same geographic area of New York City between 2013 and 15. The epidemiology, clinical features, and resource utilization (antibiotic/steroid/ribavirin usage, chest X\u2010rays, respiratory\u2010support (continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP], mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]), and indicators of disease severity (respiratory\u2010support, and/or ICU admission or death)) were compared among age groups using univariate and bivariate analyses. RESULTS: In the community cohort (1777 people with 1805 ARIs), 66(3.7%) tested RSV\u2010positive (3.8% of \u003C1\u2010year\u2010olds; 3.8% of adults \u226565); 40.9% were medically attended, and 23.1% reported antibiotic usage.

Here we aimed to identify arterivirus proteins involved in the mode-of-action of cyclophilin inhibitors and to investigate how these compounds inhibit arterivirus RNA synthesis in the infected cell. Repeated passaging of the arterivirus prototype equine arteritis virus (EAV) in the presence of CsA revealed that reduced drug sensitivity is associated with the emergence of adaptive mutations in nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5), one of the transmembrane subunits of the arterivirus replicase polyprotein. Introduction of singular nsp5 mutations (nsp5 Q21R, Y113H, or A134V) led to a \u223C2-fold decrease in sensitivity to CsA treatment, whereas combinations of mutations further increased EAV\u2019s CsA resistance. The detailed experimental characterization of engineered EAV mutants harboring CsA-resistance mutations implicated nsp5 in arterivirus RNA synthesis. Particularly, in an in vitro assay, EAV RNA synthesis was far less sensitive to CsA treatment when nsp5 contained the adaptive mutations mentioned above. Interestingly, for increased sensitivity to the closely-related drug ALV CsA-resistant nsp5 mutants required the incorporation of an additional adaptive mutation, which resided in nsp2 (H114R), another transmembrane subunit of the arterivirus replicase. Our study provides the first evidence for the involvement of nsp2 and nsp5 in the mechanism underlying the inhibition of arterivirus replication by cyclophilin inhibitors. Importance Currently, no approved treatments are available to combat infections with nidoviruses, a group of plus-stranded RNA viruses including important zoonotic and veterinary pathogens. Previously, the cyclophilin inhibitors cyclosporin A (CsA) and Alisporivir (ALV) were shown to inhibit the replication of diverse nidoviruses (both arteriviruses and coronaviruses), and may thus represent a class of pan-nidovirus inhibitors. Here, using the arterivirus prototype equine arteritis virus, we have established that resistance to CsA and ALV treatment is associated with adaptive mutations in two trans-membrane subunits of the viral replication complex, nonstructural proteins 2 and 5. This is the first evidence for the involvement of specific replicase subunits of nidoviruses in the mechanism underlying the inhibition of their replication by cyclophilin inhibitors. Understanding this mechanism of action is of major importance to guide future drug design, both for nidoviruses and other RNA viruses inhibited by these compounds.","publish_time":"2019-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Wilde, Adriaan H.; Boomaars-van der Zanden, A.

As the delay is small, the decision to control travel volume through restrictions on freedom of movement should be balanced between the resulting estimated epidemiological impact and predicted economic fallout.","publish_time":"2020-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anzai, Asami; Kobayashi, Tetsuro; Linton, Natalie M.; Kinoshita, Ryo; Hayashi, Katsuma; Suzuki, Ayako; Yang, Yichi; Jung, Sung-mok; Miyama, Takeshi; Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R.; Nishiura, Hiroshi","journal":"J Clin Med","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7073579.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32102279/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9020601","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["major epidemic","estimated delay","impact of travel reduction","travel volume","median time delay","resulting estimated epidemiological impact","drastic reduction","mainland China","confirmed cases","number of exported cases","reduced probability","counterfactual scenario","epidemiological outcome measures","COVID","restrictions","decision","reports of novel coronavirus","economic fallout","freedom of movement","statistical models","respect","infections","confidence interval","incidence","Data","days","Japan"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We studied were 180 VLBW preterm infants who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of CHA Gangnam Hospital from January of 2006 to December of 2009. The subjects were divided into 2 groups: an NEC group (greater than stage II on the modified Bell\u0027s criteria) and a control group (less than stage II on the modified Bell\u0027s critieria). We defined red blood cell transfusion before NEC diagnosis as the frequency of transfusion until NEC diagnosis (mean day at NEC diagnosis, day 18) in the NEC group and the frequency of transfusion until 18 days after birth in the control group. RESULTS: Of the 180 subjects, 18 (10%) belonged to the NEC group, and 14 (78%) of these 18 patients had a history of transfusion before NEC diagnosis. The NEC group received 3.1\u00B12.9 transfusions, and the control group received 1.0\u00B11.1 transfusions before the NEC diagnosis (P=0.005). In a multivariate logistic regression corrected for gestational age, Apgar score at 1 minute, the presence of respiratory distress syndrome, patent ductus arteriosus, premature rupture of membrane, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and death were confounding factors. The risk of NEC increased 1.63 times (95% confidence interval, 1.145 to 2.305; P=0.007) with transfusion before the NEC diagnosis.

However, there is a lack of empirical evidence to support this assertion. The study aims to examine the accuracy of news reports in Hong Kong (HK) and in particular whether or not such reports stereotype victims according to gender and suicide method. METHODS: Data from a case\u2013control psychological autopsy (PA) study of 150 HK suicides were utilized. The reports of the PA cases from five major HK newspapers were collected and reviewed to identify whether or not there was a match in terms of the cases\u0027 profile and risk factors. RESULTS: The age, gender, and method of the suicides were largely reported correctly (\u003E 70%) but accounts of risk factors were seldom accurate (\u003C 46%). No significant difference was found between tabloid- and non-tabloid-type newspapers\u0027 accuracy. Media stereotyping of gender-specific suicide and charcoal-burning suicide was identified. LIMITATIONS: The study was based on a HK sample so the findings are not necessarily applicable elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: The HK mass media generally demonstrated poor accuracy in reporting suicide risk factors. Their reporting was also problematic in terms of stereotyping gender- and method-specific suicides. Clinical practitioners should be alerted to these findings when working with the media. They can also adopt this novel usage of PA data to extract further information from other PA studies and thereby broaden the investigation of reporting accuracy and stereotyping of suicide to more diverse social contexts.","publish_time":"2012-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Qijin; Yip, Paul S.F.","journal":"J Affect Disord","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/709fea3df3da75c040b2fa2b8d16074851737d6e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132416.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165032712002364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22608053/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032712002364; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2012.03.036","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PA"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["suicide method","reporting suicide risk factors","HK suicides","Media stereotyping of gender","HK mass media","causes of suicide","terms of stereotyping gender","HK sample","accounts of risk factors","study","accuracy of news reports","investigation of reporting accuracy","method-specific suicides","poor accuracy","PA cases","PA studies","major HK newspapers","novel usage of PA data","findings","non-tabloid-type newspapers\u0027 accuracy","reports stereotype victims","Hong Kong","cases\u0027 profile","psychological autopsy","information","charcoal","match","diverse social contexts","CONCLUSIONS","lack of empirical evidence","assertion","significant difference","METHODS","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","Clinical practitioners","LIMITATIONS"],"language":"en"},

TCoV has been associated with poult enteritis complex, a syndrome that severely affects turkey production. No medical prophylaxis exists to control TCoV, therefore sanitary measures such as cleaning and disinfection are essential. It is thus important to evaluate temperatures that allow persistence of TCoV in the environment. Two series of aliquots of a suspension of a French isolate of TCoV (Fr TCoV) were stored at room temperature or \u002B4\u00B0C for 0 to 40 days. As TCoV does not grow in cell culture, the presence of residual infectious TCoV in the stored samples was tested by inoculating embryonated specific pathogen free turkey eggs. As TCoV does not induce lesions in the embryo, virus replication in the jejunum and ileum of the embryos was detected 4 days post inoculation, using RNA extraction and a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction based on the nucleocapsid gene. No surviving virus was detected after 10 days storage at \u002B21.6\u00B11.4\u00B0C or after 40 days storage at \u002B4.1\u00B11.6\u00B0C, these temperatures being representative of the mean summer and winter temperatures, respectively, in the major French poultry-producing region. The relatively short survival of the virus at room temperature should contribute to limited virus survival during summer months. However, infectious virus was still detected after 20 days storage at the cooler temperatures, a finding that suggests prolonged survival of Fr TCoV and easier transmission between poultry farms in a cool environment are possible.","publish_time":"2013-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guionie, Olivier; Courtillon, C\u00E9line; Allee, Chantal; Maurel, St\u00E9phan; Queguiner, Marilyne; Eterradossi, Nicolas","journal":"Avian Pathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e17d6c0a6e7cd365896c2fdb08cfcd3dff0a8a5c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7154299.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23607441/; https://doi.org/10.1080/03079457.2013.779364","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["persistence of TCoV","French isolate of TCoV","prolonged survival of Fr TCoV","days storage","presence of residual infectious TCoV","infectious virus","limited virus survival","virus replication","surviving virus","winter temperatures","cooler temperatures","days post inoculation","room temperature","short survival","Turkey coronavirus","turkey production","major French poultry","poultry farms","mean summer","summer months","cool environment","stored samples","embryonated specific pathogen free turkey eggs","RNA extraction","real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction","easier transmission","digestive disorders","Nidovirales","syndrome","jejunum","embryos","gammacoronavirus","Coronaviridae","suspension","finding","cell culture","young turkeys","ileum","lesions","poult enteritis complex","nucleocapsid gene","disinfection","region","sanitary measures","series of aliquots","medical prophylaxis"],"language":"en"},

However, the lack of clinical and epidemiological data hampers the interpretation of these diagnostic findings. From October 2009 to January 2011, we conducted a prospective study in hospitalized children from whom samples were taken for the detection of respiratory viruses. Clinical, epidemiological and microbiological data from 644 patients with 904 disease episodes were collected. When HRV tested positive, strains were further characterized by sequencing the VP4/VP2 region of the HRV genome. HRV was the single respiratory virus detected in 254 disease episodes (28%). Overall, 99 different serotypes were detected (47% HRV-A, 12% HRV-B, 39% HRV-C). Patients with HRV had more underlying pulmonary illness compared with patients with no virus (p 0.01), or patients with another respiratory virus besides HRV (p 0.007). Furthermore, cough, shortness of breath and a need for oxygen were significantly more present in patients with HRV infection. Particularly, patients with HRV-B required extra oxygen. No respiratory symptom, except for oxygen need, was predictive of the presence of HRV. In 22% of HRV-positive disease episodes, HRV infection was hospital acquired. Phylogenetic analysis revealed several clusters of HRV; in more than 25% of these clusters epidemiological information was suggestive of transmission within specific wards. In conclusion, the detection of HRV may help in explaining respiratory illness, particular in patients with pulmonary co-morbidities. Identifying HRV provides opportunities for timely implementation of infection control measures to prevent intra-hospital transmission.","publish_time":"2014-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rahamat-Langendoen, J.C.; Riezebos-Brilman, A.; Hak, E.; Sch\u00F6lvinck, E.H.; Niesters, H.G.M.","journal":"Clin Microbiol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f37bb9fc327ebae2a9b98e0efd958ef35318a9e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b24ee9a7ac15bd0bfc211b856655c5b2d353a420.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129489.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X14629906; https://doi.org/10.1111/1469-0691.12242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23663244/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14629906","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HRV infection","detection of HRV","clusters of HRV","HRV-B","HRV genome","presence of HRV","HRV-C","patients","HRV-positive disease episodes","respiratory illness","single respiratory virus","respiratory symptom","detection of respiratory viruses","epidemiological data","oxygen need","clusters epidemiological information","extra oxygen","rapid detection","strains","intra-hospital transmission","underlying pulmonary illness","suggestive of transmission","microbiological data","diagnostic findings","lack of clinical","timely implementation of infection control measures","pulmonary co-morbidities","molecular diagnostic tools","large number of rhinovirus","interpretation","opportunities","hospitalized children","Recent developments","samples","VP2 region","prospective study","specific wards","shortness of breath","VP4","Phylogenetic analysis","cough","conclusion","different serotypes"],"language":"en"},

Currently, many viruses can be identified by sequencing without knowledge of the pathogenicity of the virus. However, attributing the presence of a virus in patient material to a disease in the patient can be a challenge. One approach to meet this challenge is identification of viral sequences based on enrichment by autologous patient antibody capture. This method facilitates identification of viruses that have provoked an immune response within the patient and may increase the sensitivity of the current virus discovery techniques. To demonstrate the utility of this method, virus discovery deep sequencing (VIDISCA-454) was performed on clinical samples from 19 patients: 13 with a known respiratory viral infection and 6 with a known gastrointestinal viral infection. Patient sera was collected from one to several months after the acute infection phase. Input and antibody capture material was sequenced and enrichment was assessed. In 18 of the 19 patients, viral reads from immunogenic viruses were enriched by antibody capture (ranging between 1.5x to 343x in respiratory material, and 1.4x to 53x in stool). Enriched reads were also determined in an identity independent manner by using a novel algorithm Xcompare.

The present study examines the relationship between the probability of temporary extinction and the age-dependent next-generation matrix, focusing on the impact of assortativity. Preferred mixing captures as a good approximation the assortativity of a heterogeneously mixing population. We show that the contribution of a nonmaintenance host (i.e., a host type which cannot sustain transmission on its own) to the risk of a major epidemic is greatly diminished as mixing patterns become more assortative, and in such a scenario, a higher proportion of non-maintenance hosts among index cases elevates the probability of extinction. Despite the presence of various other epidemiological factors that undoubtedly influenced the delay between first importations and the subsequent epidemic, these results suggest that the dominance of adults among imported cases represents one of the possible factors explaining the delays in geographic spread observed during the recent pandemic.","publish_time":"2010-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nishiura, Hiroshi; Cook, Alex R.; Cowling, Benjamin J.","journal":"Interdiscip Perspect Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e9b30d08d16832b101208cf26d563cfefd8649bb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3017939.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21234337/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2011/194507","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs0NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["index cases","imported cases","probability of extinction","mixing patterns","mixing population","probability of temporary extinction","Preferred mixing captures","possible factors","epidemiological factors","subsequent epidemic","dominance of adults","nonmaintenance host","host type","recent pandemic","local transmission of pandemic influenza","major epidemic","impact of assortativity","higher proportion of non-maintenance hosts","age-dependent","geographic spread","good approximation","relationship","long-distance intranational","international travelers","generation matrix","scenario","delays","results","presence of various","importations","H1N1","present study","school children","risk","contribution"],"language":"en"},

This drug is characterized by a long half-life (more than 200 hours), a favorable safety profile, and an activity against a wide array of gram-positive organisms, including several strains of Staphylococci and Enterococci. METHODS In this study, we presented 3 cases of critically ill patients treated with dalbavancin. All patients were therapeutically monitored for plasma dalbavancin concentrations; ultrafiltrate dalbavancin concentrations were assessed in a patient undergoing continuous renal-replacement therapy. Dalbavancin concentrations were measured using a validated liquid chromatographic method coupled with mass spectrometry. RESULTS All 3 severely ill patients experiencing necrotizing fasciitis were successfully treated during the acute phase with dalbavancin. Dalbavancin clearance in patient 3 (0.334 L/h) was considerably increased compared with values measured in the other 2 patients (0.054 and 0.075 L/h) and with data reported in the literature (0.04-0.06 L/h).

We have previously demonstrated that replacement of the S glycoprotein ectodomain from the avirulent Beaudette strain of IBV with the corresponding region from the virulent M41-CK strain resulted in a recombinant virus, BeauR-M41(S), with the in vitro cell tropism of M41-CK. The IBV Beaudette strain is able to replicate in both primary chick kidney cells and Vero cells, whereas the IBV M41-CK strain replicates in primary cells only. In order to investigate the region of the IBV S responsible for growth in Vero cells, we generated a series of recombinant IBVs expressing chimeric S glycoproteins, consisting of regions from the Beaudette and M41-CK S gene sequences, within the genomic background of Beaudette. The S2, but not the S1, subunit of the Beaudette S was found to confer the ability to grow in Vero cells. Various combinations of Beaudette-specific amino acids were introduced into the S2 subunit of M41 to determine the minimum requirement to confer tropism for growth in Vero cells. The ability of IBV to grow and produce infectious progeny virus in Vero cells was subsequently narrowed down to just 3 amino acids surrounding the S2\u2032 cleavage site. Conversely, swapping of the 3 Beaudette-associated amino acids with the corresponding ones from M41 was sufficient to abolish Beaudette growth in Vero cells. IMPORTANCE Infectious bronchitis remains a major problem in the global poultry industry, despite the existence of many different vaccines. IBV vaccines, both live attenuated and inactivated, are currently grown on embryonated hen\u0027s eggs, a cumbersome and expensive process due to the fact that most IBV strains do not grow in cultured cells. The reverse genetics system for IBV creates the opportunity for generating rationally designed and more effective vaccines. The observation that IBV Beaudette has the additional tropism for growth on Vero cells also invokes the possibility of generating IBV vaccines produced from cultured cells rather than by the use of embryonated eggs. The regions of the IBV Beaudette S glycoprotein involved in the determination of extended cellular tropism were identified in this study. This information will enable the rational design of a future generation of IBV vaccines that may be grown on Vero cells.","publish_time":"2018-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bickerton, Erica; Maier, Helena J.; Stevenson-Leggett, Phoebe; Armesto, Maria; Britton, Paul","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b77ed891047029cda65117192670f81edf87f1dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6146808.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30021894/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01044-18","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs1MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV Beaudette","IBV","IBV S","Beaudette","Beaudette S","IBV Beaudette S"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Vero cells","IBV Beaudette strain","IBV Beaudette S glycoprotein","IBV S responsible","ability of IBV","avirulent Beaudette strain of IBV","Beaudette growth","IBV strains","primary cells","cultured cells","IBV M41-CK strain replicates","future generation of IBV vaccines","cell tropism of M41","S2 subunit of M41","S glycoprotein ectodomain","M41-CK S gene sequences","BeauR-M41","genomic background of Beaudette","Various combinations of Beaudette","primary chick kidney cells","virulent M41-CK strain","chimeric S glycoproteins","additional tropism","different vaccines","effective vaccines","recombinant virus","infectious progeny virus","specific amino acids","determination of extended cellular tropism","avian gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus","corresponding region","IMPORTANCE Infectious bronchitis","regions","S1","embryonated hen\u0027s eggs","use of embryonated eggs","corresponding ones","series of recombinant IBVs","major problem","global poultry industry","existence","expensive process","rational design","minimum requirement","fact","reverse genetics system","possibility","cleavage site","opportunity","replacement","subunits","observation","information","virulence","role","study","spike","order"],"language":"en"},

These approaches can also be used to distinguish recombinant vaccines from parental or wild type viruses.","publish_time":"2007-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Spencer, Kelly-Anne; Osorio, Fernando A.; Hiscox, Julian A.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9acd1c32bc6c2d54824ebcf5e3cbe4c03f2a0481.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130988.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X07002332; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X07002332","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs1ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recombinant protein","recombinant vaccines","recombinant viral proteins","future ELISAs","Abstract ELISAs","emerging viruses","wild type viruses","diagnosis of virus infection","new viral strains of existing pathogens","systems","detection","valuable tool","large scale production","case","cloning","expression","epitopes","great promise","purification","gene sequence","ability","crucial advantage","point","peptides","approaches"],"language":"en"},

Scotophilus bat CoV-512 demonstrates potential for cross-species transmission because its viral RNA and specific antibodies have been detected in three bat species of Taiwan. Understanding the cell tropism of Scotophilus bat CoV-512 is the first step for studying the mechanism of cross-species transmission. In this study, a lentivirus-based pseudovirus was produced using the spike (S) protein of Scotophilus bat CoV-512 or SARS-CoV as a surface protein to test the interaction between coronaviral S protein and its cell receptor on 11 different cells. Susceptible cells expressed red fluorescence protein (RFP) after the entry of RFP-bound green fluorescence protein (GFP)-fused S protein of Scotophilus bat CoV-512 (RFP-Sco-S-eGFP) or RFP-SARS-S pseudovirus, and firefly luciferase (FLuc) activity expressed by cells infected with FLuc-Sco-S-eGFP or FLuc-SARS-S pseudovirus was quantified. Scotophilus bat CoV-512 pseudovirus had significantly higher entry efficiencies in Madin Darby dog kidney epithelial cells (MDCK), black flying fox brain cells (Pabr), and rat small intestine epithelial cells (IEC-6). SARS-CoV pseudovirus had significantly higher entry efficiencies in human embryonic kidney epithelial cells (HEK-293T), pig kidney epithelial cells (PK15), and MDCK cells. These findings demonstrated that Scotophilus bat CoV-512 had a broad host range for cross-species transmission like SARS-CoV.","publish_time":"2019-11-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Yi-Ning; Hsu, Hsiao-Chin; Wang, Sheng-Wei; Lien, Hao-Chiang; Lu, Hsin-Ti; Peng, Sheng-Kai","journal":"Pathogens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/014d7df59dc6c5ed456bf19b76b394e920d3a9dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6963420.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31766704/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens8040259","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs1ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDCK"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV pseudovirus","MERS-CoV","fused S protein of Scotophilus bat CoV","S pseudovirus","cell tropism of Scotophilus bat CoV","MDCK cells","RFP-SARS","Susceptible cells","different cells","coronaviral S protein","FLuc-SARS","S-eGFP","pig kidney epithelial cells","bat species of Taiwan","human embryonic kidney epithelial cells","Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV","entry of RFP","surface protein","cross-species transmission","rat small intestine epithelial cells","Madin Darby dog kidney epithelial cells","green fluorescence protein","red fluorescence protein","RFP-Sco","black flying fox brain cells","FLuc-Sco","higher entry efficiencies","lentivirus-based pseudovirus","mechanism of cross","cell receptor","natural reservoirs of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Pabr","HEK","PK15","potential","broad host range","viral RNA","firefly luciferase","IEC","activity","interaction","spike","Bats","specific antibodies","study","step","findings"],"language":"en"},

Smith is an important Chinese herbal medicine because of its biological functions. However, systematic and comprehensive studies on the phytochemicals from Cyrtomium fortumei (J.) Smith and their bioactivity are limited. RESULTS: Using the bioassay-guided technique, the ethyl acetate and n-BuOH extracts of the rhizomes of Cyrtomium fortumei (J.) Smith were shown to exhibit good antitumor activities, consequently leading to the isolation of 23 compounds. All compounds were isolated from the plant for the first time. The inhibitory activities of these compounds were investigated on tumor cells MGC-803, PC3, and A375 in vitro by MTT (thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide) assay, and the results showed that pimpinellin (3) had potent cytotoxic activities against the three cell lines, with the IC(50) values of 14.4 \u00B1 0.3 \u03BCM, 20.4 \u00B1 0.5 \u03BCM, and 29.2 \u00B1 0.6 \u03BCM, respectively. The mechanism of the antitumor action indicated that pimpinellin inhibited the growth of MGC-803 cells via the induction of tumor cell apoptosis, with apoptosis ratio of 27.44% after 72 h of treatment at 20 \u03BCM. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that most of the compounds from the roots of Cyrtomium fortumei (J.) Smith could inhibit the growth of human carcinoma cells. Moreover, pimpinellin inhibited the growth of tumor cells via the induction of tumor cell apoptosis.","publish_time":"2013-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Shengjie; Liu, Mingchuan; Liang, Na; Zhao, Qi; Zhang, Yuping; Xue, Wei; Yang, Song","journal":"Chem Cent J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e05c7165987a9b706d1ab55ebb210bd571a59e5a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3574041.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23379693/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1752-153x-7-24","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs2MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Smith"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Smith","compounds","\u03BCM","growth of tumor cells","tumor cells MGC","induction of tumor cell apoptosis","rhizomes of Cyrtomium fortumei","roots of Cyrtomium fortumei","pimpinellin","growth of MGC","growth of human carcinoma cells","cell lines","apoptosis ratio","good antitumor activities","inhibitory activities","RESULTS","potent cytotoxic activities","antitumor action","ethyl acetate","n-BuOH extracts","MTT","thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide","important Chinese herbal medicine","phytochemicals","PC3","bioassay-guided technique","biological functions","comprehensive studies","A375","h of treatment","mechanism","plant","study","values","isolation","BACKGROUND","time","CONCLUSIONS","bioactivity"],"language":"en"},

Recently, RNA degradation in vivo was observed in patients with locally advanced breast cancer, where mid-treatment tumor RNA degradation was associated with complete tumor destruction and enhanced patient survival. However, it is not clear how widespread chemotherapy induced \u201CRNA disruption\u201D is, the extent to which it is associated with drug response or what the underlying mechanisms are. METHODS: Ovarian (A2780, CaOV3) and breast (MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, BT474, SKBR3) cancer cell lines were treated with several cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs and total RNA was isolated. RNA was also prepared from docetaxel resistant A2780DXL and carboplatin resistant A2780CBN cells following drug exposure. Disruption of RNA was analyzed by capillary electrophoresis. Northern blotting was performed using probes complementary to the 28S and 18S rRNA to determine the origins of degradation bands. Apoptosis activation was assessed by flow cytometric monitoring of annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI) binding to cells and by measuring caspase-3 activation. The link between apoptosis and RNA degradation (disruption) was investigated using a caspase-3 inhibitor. RESULTS: All chemotherapy drugs tested were capable of inducing similar RNA disruption patterns. Docetaxel treatment of the resistant A2780DXL cells and carboplatin treatment of the A2780CBN cells did not result in RNA disruption. Northern blotting indicated that two RNA disruption bands were derived from the 3\u2019-end of the 28S rRNA. Annexin-V and PI staining of docetaxel treated cells, along with assessment of caspase-3 activation, showed concurrent initiation of apoptosis and RNA disruption, while inhibition of caspase-3 activity significantly reduced RNA disruption. CONCLUSIONS: Supporting the in vivo evidence, our results demonstrate that RNA disruption is induced by multiple chemotherapy agents in cell lines from different tissues and is associated with drug response. Although present, the link between apoptosis and RNA disruption is not completely understood. Evaluation of RNA disruption is thus proposed as a novel and effective biomarker to assess response to chemotherapy drugs in vitro and in vivo.

Ribavirin is prescribed for chronic hepatitis C and is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in the male sexual partners of women who are pregnant. Both sexes are advised to avoid pregnancy for 6 months after exposure. The Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry was established in 2003 to monitor pregnancy exposures to ribavirin for signals of possible human teratogenicity. METHODS: This voluntary registry enrolls pregnant women with prenatal exposure to ribavirin. Exposure is classified as direct\u2014women taking ribavirin during pregnancy or the 6 months prior to conception\u2014or indirect\u2014women exposed through sexual contact, 6 months prior to or during pregnancy, with a man who is taking or has taken ribavirin in the past 6 months. Women are followed until delivery and infants for 1 year. When enrollment is complete, birth defect rates will be compared with the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program\u2019s published rate of 2.67. Using data collected since inception in 2003 through February 2016, preliminary rates were calculated. RESULTS: The registry has enrolled 272 pregnant women, with 180 live births: there were seven birth defect cases among 85 directly exposed women [7/85 (8.2%) (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.4\u201316.2)] and four birth defect cases among 95 indirectly exposed women [4/95 (4.2%) (95% CI 1.2\u201310.4)]. Of the 11 infants, nine had structural defects and two had chromosomal anomalies. Patterns suggesting a common etiology or relationship with ribavirin exposure are not seen. CONCLUSION: Based on the patterns of birth defects reported, preliminary findings do not suggest a clear signal of human teratogenicity for ribavirin. However, the current sample size is insufficient for definitive conclusions, and ribavirin exposure should be avoided during pregnancy and during the 6 months prior to pregnancy, in accordance with prescribing information.

The virus mainly targets the pulmonary epithelial cells as it\u2019s initial site of infection by letting its surface spike protein interact and bind to the host ACE2 receptor. The internalization and gradual replication of the virus results in an exaggerated immune response triggering release of many pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This immune storm is responsible for multiple health hazards in the host ultimately leading to multiple organ failure. Mesenchymal stem cell therapy offers a promising approach towards mitigating the delirious effects of the infection in the COVID-19 patients. This therapy has shown to reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as repair of damaged tissues in COVID-19 patients. This review has been organized to put forward the positive aruments and implications in support of mesenchymal stem cell therapy as a necessary approach for treating COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rajarshi, Keshav; Chatterjee, Aroni; Ray, Shashikant","journal":"Biotechnology reports","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ceca0a9731522ddd6413ff56a0bb5c8b78fe1fd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32420049/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2215017X20303635; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.btre.2020.e00467; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215017X20303635?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","patients","virus results","support of mesenchymal stem cell therapy","expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines","positive stranded RNA virus","promising approach","necessary approach","immune storm","positive aruments","initial site of infection","multiple health hazards","multiple organ failure","host ACE2 receptor","exaggerated immune response triggering release","implications","pulmonary epithelial cells","repair of damaged tissues","SARS-CoV","delirious effects","gradual replication","surface spike protein","internalization","disease","chemokines","review"],"language":"en"},

Human genetic enhancement, however, raises complex ethical questions, such as to what extent should it be allowed? It has been a great challenge for humankind to develop robust ethical guidelines for human genetic enhancement that address both public concerns and needs. We believe that research about public concerns is necessary prior to developing such guidelines, yet the issues have not been thoroughly investigated in many countries, including Malaysia. Since the novel often functions as a medium for the public to express their concerns, this paper explores ethical concerns about human genetic enhancement expressed in four Malay science fiction novels namely Klon, Leksikon Ledang, Transgenesis Bisikan Rimba and Transgenik Sifar. Religion has a strong influence on the worldview of the Malays therefore some concerns such as playing God are obviously religious.

Methods We modeled a generic disease caused by a pathogen apparently transmitted by close interpersonal contact, but about which little else is known. In our model, people may be infectious while incubating or during their prodrome or acute illness. We derived an expression for \u211C , the reproduction number, took its partial derivatives with respect to control parameters, and encoded these analytical results in a user-friendly Mathematica\u2122 notebook. With biological parameters for SARS estimated from the initial case series in Hong Kong and infection rates from hospitalizations in Singapore, we determined \u211C \u0027s sensitivity to control parameters. Results Stage-specific infection rate estimates from cases hospitalized before quarantine began exceed those from the entire outbreak, but are qualitatively similar: infectiousness was negligible until symptom onset, and increased 10-fold from prodrome to acute illness. Given such information, authorities might instead have emphasized a strategy whose efficiency more than compensates for any possible reduction in efficacy. Conclusions In future outbreaks of new human diseases transmitted via close interpersonal contact, it should be possible to identify the optimal intervention early enough to facilitate effective decision-making.","publish_time":"2009-07-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, Zhilan; Yang, Yiding; Xu, Dashun; Zhang, Pei; McCauley, Mary Mason; Glasser, John W.","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b71e4eac6dc2570625a3bd6425a059baa8c5130c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126620.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2009.03.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19289133/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519309001118; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519309001118","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["control parameters","quarantine","close interpersonal contact","biological parameters","prodrome","acute illness","emerging human diseases","future outbreaks of new human diseases","infection rates","analytical results","possible reduction","Results Stage-specific infection rate estimates","Abstract Background Health authorities","Hong Kong","initial case series","hospitalizations","partial derivatives","reproduction number","SARS","isolation","Singapore","cases","pathogen","non-pharmaceutical interventions","symptom onset","infectiousness","user-friendly Mathematica","Conclusions","respect","fold","optimal intervention","s sensitivity","generic disease","notebook","expression","effective decision-making","entire outbreak","model","people","Methods","strategy","efficiency","efficacy","information"],"language":"en"},

This study presents a systematic review of papers pertaining to the application of knowledge-driven systems in support of emergency management that have been published in the last two decades. Our review presents two major findings. First, only limited work has been done in three EMIS-knowledge management system (KMS) subdomains: (i) definition, (ii) use, and (iii) methods. Second, only limited research has been done in embedding roles in KM systems. We highlight role alignment to the 12 fundamental roles, as called for by Turoff et al.

Although for \u2018old diseases\u2019 knowledge about the right African traditional medicines to treat or cure the diseases has been passed from generation to generation, knowledge about traditional medicines to treat newly emerging diseases has to be generated in one way or another. In addition, the existing traditional medicines have to be continuously improved, which is also the case with Western scientific medicines. Whereas one school of thought supports the idea of improving medicines, be they traditional or Western, through scientific research, an opposing school of thought argues that subjecting African traditional medicines to scientific research would be tantamount to some form of colonization and imperialism. This paper argues that continuing to use African traditional medicines for old and new diseases without making concerted efforts to improve their efficacy and safety is unethical since the disease burden affecting Africa may continue to rise in spite of the availability and accessibility of the traditional medicines. Most importantly, the paper commends efforts being made in some African countries to improve African traditional medicine through a combination of different mechanisms that include the controversial approach of scientific research on traditional medicines.","publish_time":"2009-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nyika, Aceme","journal":"Acta Tropica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a9bf37ef454a08ab50f5c78d5d0990ae4149f6f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092799.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19682966/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2009.08.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001706X0900240X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001706X0900240X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa"],"keyphrases":["existing traditional medicines","subjecting African traditional medicines","right African traditional medicines","Western scientific medicines","unaffordability of Western medicines","African countries","majority of African populations","controversial approach of scientific research","new diseases","generation","emerging diseases","disease burden","paper","old diseases\u2019 knowledge","opposing school of thought","concerted efforts","developed countries","health care","food shortages","inadequate access","poverty","combination of different mechanisms","safety","various factors","efficacy","availability","accessibility","case","form of colonization","spite","idea","addition","imperialism","way"],"language":"en"},

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is a chronic and debilitating inflammatory condition of the urinary bladder characterized by the hallmark symptoms of pelvic pain and voiding dysfunction. To facilitate IC/BPS research, we used transgenic technology to develop a novel urothelial MCP-1 secretion mouse model (URO-MCP-1). A transgene consisting of the uroplakin II gene promoter and the mouse MCP-1 coding sequence with a secretory element was constructed and microinjected. URO-MCP-1 mice were found to express MCP-1 mRNA in the bladder epithelium and MCP-1 protein in the urine, and developed bladder inflammation 24 hours after intravesical administration of a single sub-noxious dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The inflamed bladders of URO-MCP-1 mice exhibited elevated mRNAs for interleukin (IL)-1\u00DF, IL-6, substance P precursor, and nerve growth factor as well as increased macrophage infiltration. In parallel with these phenotypic changes, URO-MCP-1 mice manifested significant functional changes at days 1 and 3 after cystitis induction. These functional changes included pelvic pain as measured by von Frey filament stimulation and voiding dysfunction (increased urinary frequency, reduced average volume voided per micturition, and reduced maximum volume voided per micturition) as measured by micturition cages. Micturition changes remained evident at day 7 after cystitis induction, although these changes were not statistically significant. Control wild-type C57BL/6 mice manifested no clear changes in histological, biochemical and behavioral features after similar cystitis induction with LPS. Taken together, our results indicate that URO-MCP-1 mice are hypersensitive to bladder irritants such as LPS and develop pelvic pain and voiding dysfunction upon cystitis induction, providing a novel model for IC/BPS research.","publish_time":"2016-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Suming; Wang, Xu; Wang, Yaoqin; Lutgendorf, Susan; Bradley, Catherine; Schrepf, Andrew; Kreder, Karl; O\u0027Donnell, Michael; Luo, Yi","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ebb6c8bf24d0955f26398dcc7653b0f6fb5c9f7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5042429.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0163829; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27684718/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IC/BPS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["URO-MCP","mouse MCP","express MCP","mice","Micturition changes","novel urothelial MCP","bladder pain syndrome","urinary bladder","clear changes","phenotypic changes","similar cystitis induction","significant functional changes","voiding dysfunction","bladder irritants","bladder epithelium","LPS","Interstitial cystitis","chronic pain conditions","hallmark symptoms of pelvic pain","micturition cages","developed bladder inflammation","inflamed bladders of URO","novel model","research","secretion mouse model","urinary frequency","inflammatory condition","average volume","maximum volume","Monocyte chemoattractant protein","increased macrophage infiltration","intravesical administration","behavioral features","nerve growth factor","important roles","single sub-noxious dose of lipopolysaccharide","substance P precursor","hours","days","Frey filament stimulation","interleukin","coding sequence","urine","elevated mRNAs","transgenic technology","gene promoter","secretory element","uroplakin","Control wild-type C57BL","key chemokines","transgene","results"],"language":"en"},

Protein translocation into the ER can occur co- and posttranslationally. In yeast, posttranslational translocation involves the heptameric translocase complex including its Sec62p and Sec63p subunits. The mammalian ER membrane contains orthologs of yeast Sec62p and Sec63p, but their function is poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the effects of excess and deficit Sec63 on various ER cargoes using human cell culture systems. The overexpression of Sec63 reduces the steady-state levels of viral and cellular multi-spanning membrane proteins in a cotranslational mode, while soluble and single-spanning ER reporters are not affected. Consistent with this, the knock-down of Sec63 increases the steady-state pools of polytopic ER proteins, suggesting a substrate-specific and regulatory function of Sec63 in ER import. Overexpressed Sec63 exerts its down-regulating activity on polytopic protein levels independent of its Sec62-interacting motif, indicating that it may not act in conjunction with Sec62 in human cells. The specific action of Sec63 is further sustained by our observations that the up-regulation of either Sec62 or two other ER proteins with lumenal J domains, like ERdj1 and ERdj4, does not compromise the steady-state level of a multi-spanning membrane reporter. A J domain-specific mutation of Sec63, proposed to weaken its interaction with the ER resident BiP chaperone, reduces the down-regulating capacity of excess Sec63, suggesting an involvement of BiP in this process. Together, these results suggest that Sec63 may perform a substrate-selective quantity control function during cotranslational ER import.","publish_time":"2012-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mades, Andreas; Gotthardt, Katherina; Awe, Karin; Stieler, Jens; D\u00F6ring, Tatjana; F\u00FCser, Sabine; Prange, Reinhild","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8597d9f2e677de02b0166ad69f8045b979b3a82a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3499540.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23166619/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0049243","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ER"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ER reporters","mammalian ER membrane","deficit Sec63","overexpression of Sec63","Overexpressed Sec63","cotranslational ER import","regulatory function of Sec63","specific action of Sec63","various ER cargoes","capacity of excess Sec63","steady-state pools of polytopic ER proteins","ER resident BiP chaperone","J domain-specific mutation of Sec63","cellular multi-spanning membrane proteins","multi-spanning membrane reporter","substrate-specific","steady-state levels of viral","Protein translocation","polytopic protein levels independent","orthologs of yeast Sec62p","substrate-selective quantity control function","cotranslational mode","posttranslational translocation","human cells","Sec63p subunits","involvement of BiP","effects of excess","lumenal J domains","human cell culture systems","heptameric translocase complex","endoplasmic reticulum","activity","interaction","ERdj1","ERdj4","aqueous pore","Sec61 translocon","conjunction","polypeptides","process","regulation","motif","knock","observations","results","membranes"],"language":"en"},

On the surface of the virus, Env is in a metastable, prefusion state, primed to catalyze the fusion of the viral and host membranes. An external trigger is needed to promote the drastic conformational changes necessary for the fusion subunit to fold into the low\u2010energy, 6\u2010helix bundle. These triggers typically facilitate pH\u2010independent entry at the plasma membrane or pH\u2010dependent entry in a low\u2010pH endosomal compartment. The \u03B1\u2010retrovirus avian sarcoma leukosis virus (ASLV) has a rare, 2\u2010step entry mechanism with both pH\u2010dependent and pH\u2010independent features. Here, we present the 2.0\u2010\u00C5\u2010resolution crystal structure of the ASLV transmembrane (TM) fusion protein. Our structural and biophysical studies indicated that unlike other pH\u2010dependent or pH\u2010independent viral TMs, the ASLV fusion subunit is stable irrespective of pH. Two histidine residues (His490 and His492) in the chain reversal region confer stability at low pH. A structural comparison of class I viral fusion proteins suggests that the presence of a positive charge, either a histidine or arginine amino acid, stabilizes a helical dipole moment and is a signature of fusion proteins active at low pH. The structure now reveals key residues and features that explain its 2\u2010step mechanism, and we discuss the implications of the ASLV TM structure in the context of general mechanisms required for membrane fusion.\u2014Aydin, H., Smrke, B.M., Lee, J.

A method was developed for qualitative and quantitative detection of the seminal cell-associated PRRSV RNA in relation to endogenous and exogenous reference RNAs. As endogenous control for one-step real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR UBE2D2 mRNA was selected. Particularly for the analysis of persistent infections associated with low copy numbers of PRRSV RNA, UBE2D2 mRNA is an ideal control due to its low expression in seminal cells and its detection in all samples analysed (n =36). However, the amount of UBE2D2 mRNA in porcine semen varied (up to 106-fold), thus its use is limited to qualitative detection of PRRSV RNA. For quantitation, a synthetic, non-metazoan RNA was added to the RNA isolation reaction at an exact copy number. The photosynthesis gene ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase large subunit (rbcL) from Arabidopsis thaliana was used as an exogenous spike. Unexpectedly, PRRSV RNA was detected in a herd of specific pathogen-free (SPF) boars which were tested ELISA-negative for anti-PRRSV antibodies. Therefore, RT-PCR for seminal cell-associated PRRSV is a powerful tool for managing the SPF status during quarantine programs and for routine outbreak investigations.","publish_time":"2005-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Revilla-Fern\u00E1ndez, Sandra; Wallner, Barbara; Truschner, Klaus; Benczak, Alexandra; Brem, Gottfried; Schmoll, Friedrich; Mueller, Mathias; Steinborn, Ralf","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36ea7d2074daa6cee955bb352103a6adc6cdc936.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112884.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093405000303; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093405000303","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["qualitative detection of PRRSV RNA","seminal cell-associated PRRSV RNA","low copy numbers of PRRSV RNA","anti-PRRSV antibodies","RNA isolation reaction","non-metazoan RNA","PCR UBE2D2 mRNA","endogenous control","seminal cells","RT-PCR","quantitative detection","porcine semen","low expression","SPF status","ideal control","exogenous spike","Abstract Semen","exact copy number","route of porcine reproductive","exogenous reference RNAs","relation","bisphosphate carboxylase","one-step real-time reverse transcription","respiratory syndrome virus","rbcL","oxygenase large subunit","quarantine programs","ELISA-negative","powerful tool","Arabidopsis thaliana","boars","herd of specific pathogen-free","routine outbreak investigations","analysis of persistent infections","transmission","photosynthesis gene ribulose","quantitation","samples","use","method","fold"],"language":"en"},

From the early 1990s a number of weaknesses within the structure and governance of the World Health Organization were becoming apparent, as a rapidly changing post Cold War world placed more complex demands on the international organizations generally, but significantly so in the field of global health. Towards the end of that decade and during the first half of the next, WHO revitalized and played a crucial role in setting global health priorities. However, over the past decade, the organization has to some extent been bypassed for funding, and it lost some of its authority and its ability to set a global health agenda. The reasons for this decline are complex and multifaceted. Some of the main factors include WHO\u0027s inability to reform its core structure, the growing influence of non-governmental actors, a lack of coherence in the positions, priorities and funding decisions between the health ministries and the ministries overseeing development assistance in several donor member states, and the lack of strong leadership of the organization.","publish_time":"2014-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lid\u00E9n, J.","journal":"Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b4605697c30dad3df6959af6824d1c9791cbbc6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118765.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2013.08.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350613002692; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350613002692; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24388640/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health ministries","global health priorities","World Health Organization","global health architecture","global health agenda","field of global health","past decade","complex demands","lack of coherence","core structure","changing position","funding decisions","changing post Cold War world","lack of strong leadership","development assistance","growing influence of non-governmental actors","donor member states","positions","governance","number of weaknesses","inability","historical perspective","crucial role","decline","international organizations","decades","main factors","article","reasons","extent","authority","half"],"language":"en"},

CHIKV being an emerging arthropod-borne pathogenic virus, is a public health concern worldwide. No vaccines or specific antiviral treatment is currently available for chikungunya disease. Thus, it is important to develop inhibitors against CHIKV enzymes to block key steps in viral reproduction. In view of this, CVCP was produced recombinantly and purified to homogeneity. A fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based proteolytic assay was developed for high throughput screening (HTS). A FRET peptide substrate (DABCYL-GAEEWSLAIE-EDANS) derived from the cleavage site present in the structural polyprotein of CVCP was used. The assay with a Z\u2019 factor of 0.64 and coefficient of variation (CV) is 8.68% can be adapted to high throughput format for automated screening of chemical libraries to identify CVCP specific protease inhibitors.

We infected 45 species of Drosophilidae with an RNA virus and measured how viral load changes with temperature. We found the host phylogeny explained a large proportion of the variation in viral load at each temperature, with strong phylogenetic correlations between viral loads across temperature. The variance in viral load increased with temperature, while the mean viral load did not. This suggests that as temperature increases the most susceptible species become more susceptible, and the least susceptible less so. We found no significant relationship between a species\u2019 susceptibility across temperatures, and proxies for thermal optima (critical thermal maximum and minimum or basal metabolic rate).

These time points afforded a view of the transcriptomic changes occurring both before and during viral replication. In the resulting small RNA-Seq data set, we detected a phased pattern of microRNA expression. Largely distinct sets of microRNAs were found to be suppressed at 5 and 12 h postinfection, and both sets of changes rebounded later in infection. A larger set of microRNA changes was observed at 24 h postinfection. When integrated with mRNA expression data, the small RNA-Seq data indicated a role for microRNAs in transcriptional regulation, T cell activation, and cell cycle during HIV infection. As a unique benefit of next-generation sequencing, we also detected candidate novel host microRNAs differentially expressed during infection, including one whose downregulation at 24 h postinfection may allow full replication of HIV to proceed.

At the same temperature and mass fraction of methanol (n-propanol, acetonitrile or 1,4-dioxane), the mole fraction solubility of ribavirin is greater in (methanol\u002Bwater) than in the other three solvent mixtures. The preferential solvation parameters were derived from their thermodynamic solution properties by means of the inverse Kirkwood\u2013Buff integrals. The preferential solvation parameters for methanol, n-propanol, acetonitrile or 1,4-dioxane (\u03B4x 1,3) were negative in the four solvent mixtures with a very wide compositions, which indicated that ribavirin was preferentially solvated by water. Temperature had little effect on the preferential solvation magnitudes. The higher solvation by water could be explained in terms of the higher acidic behaviour of water interacting with the Lewis basic groups of the ribavirin. Besides, the solubility of the drugs was mathematically represented by using the Jouyban-Acree model, van\u2019t Hoff-Jouyban-Acree model and Apelblat-Jouyban-Acree model obtaining average relative deviations lower than 1.57% for correlative studies.

A total of 941 new born piglets in 86 litters were evaluated for five consecutive days. NNPDS is a newly emerged syndrome, characterized by diarrhoea within the first week of life, which is un-responsive to antibiotics and not associated with known pathogens. The aetiology behind the syndrome is unknown, and specific risk factors predisposing piglets to develop NNPDS also remain to be determined. The study evaluated sow and piglet-level risk factors for developing NNPDS and described the epidemiologic characteristics within four herds previously diagnosed with the syndrome. NNPDS was defined as diarrhoea at any time-point during the second to fifth day of life. RESULTS: NNPDS was observed in a total of 60% (range: 39%-89%) of first parity piglets and 36% (range: 19-65%) of piglets born by mature sows. In total of 26% of piglets had liquid faeces on the day of birth. Approximately half of these piglets developed NNPDS. In the majority of cases (50-70% of cases within herds) symptoms started on the second or third day of life. Piglets in Herd 1 had12.8 times higher probability of developing NNPDS than piglets in Herd 4. First parity piglets had a 4.1 higher probability of developing NNPDS than piglets born by mature sows. Birth weight and faecal consistency on the day of birth were minor risk factors, each significant within one herd. CONCLUSIONS: The most important factors associated with NNPDS were herd of origin and sow-parity. The reason for one of the herds experiencing a considerably more severe outbreak than the others was not explained by factors addressed in this study. The epidemiological pattern of diarrhoea varied a lot between herds; however, in all herds first parity piglets seemed predisposed. This association may be explained by an infectious background of the syndrome, but further studies are needed to explain this association.","publish_time":"2014-07-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kongsted, Hanne; Toft, Nils; Nielsen, Jens Peter","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a35a9ab63e50b5eed8710a67b89d6c31d53cd191.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4110237.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-10-151; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25012922/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["parity piglets","new born piglets","times higher probability of developing NNPDS","day of birth","day of life","selected herds","minor risk factors","specific risk factors","important factors","emerged syndrome","sow-parity","total","piglet-level risk factors","herd of origin","epidemiology of New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea Syndrome","Birth weight","epidemiological pattern of diarrhoea","mature sows","week of life","study","range","association","infectious background","majority of cases","faecal consistency","litters","had12","antibiotics","lot","liquid faeces","epidemiologic characteristics","known pathogens","consecutive days","aetiology","CONCLUSIONS","severe outbreak","studies","symptoms","half","reason","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Study design An ecological study was conducted. Methods Three hundred and fifty primary probable SARS cases diagnosed in mainland China between 1 January and 31 May 2003, and their 6727 close contacts during the period of their clinical symptoms before admission, were included in this study. Of the 6727 close contacts, 135 (2.0%) later developed clinical symptoms and were diagnosed as probable SARS cases. The daily meteorological data and daily air pollution data during the same SARS outbreak period in mainland China were used in the data analysis. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore the association between the secondary attack rate of SARS and meteorological factors and air pollution. Results In univariate analyses, daily average temperature (DAT), daily average air pressure (DAAP), and daily average relative humidity (DARH) were inversely associated with secondary attack rate (P\u003C0.001); a significant positive association was found for daily hours of sunshine (DHS) (P\u003C0.001). In multivariate analyses, factors associated with secondary attack rate were DAAP (odds ratio (OR)=0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.42, 0.66), DARH (OR=0.73, 95% CI: 0.53, 1.00), and daily average wind velocity (DAWV; OR=0.81, 95% CI: 0.68, 0.96). Adjustment for the onset time of a primary case led to little change in the results. In addition, in Hebei Province, a major affected area in China, only DAWV (OR=0.38, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.72) was a significant predictor of secondary attack rate with adjustment for the onset time of primary case. In Inner Mongolia, another major affected area in China, DAWV (OR=0.50, 95% CI: 0.26, 0.94) and DHS (OR=0.27, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.81) were significant predictors of secondary attack rate with adjustment for the onset time of primary case. Conclusions Our results suggest that the SARS outbreak was significantly associated with DAWV, and that DAAP, DARH and DHS may also have influenced the SARS outbreak to some extent. However, because of ecological fallacy and uncontrolled confounding effects that may have biased the results, the association between the SARS outbreak and these meteorological factors and air pollution deserve further investigation.","publish_time":"2007-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cai, Quan-Cai; Lu, Jian; Xu, Qin-Feng; Guo, Qiang; Xu, De-Zhong; Sun, Qing-Wen; Yang, Hua; Zhao, Gen-Ming; Jiang, Qing-Wu","journal":"Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6cefe58e798d4664942d0cd4844648894921ddef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118752.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350606003283; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350606003283","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsxNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","DHS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["secondary attack rate of SARS","SARS outbreak period","daily air pollution data","daily meteorological data","daily average air pressure","daily average temperature","meteorological factors","primary probable SARS cases","DAWV","Results","significant predictors of secondary attack rate","significant predictor of secondary attack rate","daily average relative humidity","daily average wind velocity","onset time of primary case","daily hours of sunshine","Adjustment","DAAP","mainland China","DARH","DHS","significant positive association","ecological study","major affected area","data analysis","univariate analyses","multivariate analyses","clinical symptoms","close contacts","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","Logistic regression analyses","ecological fallacy","Hebei Province","uncontrolled confounding effects","odds ratio","Inner Mongolia","admission","little change","investigation","addition","Summary Objectives","confidence interval","Methods","Conclusions","extent"],"language":"en"},

Defective IFN-\u03B3 signaling was associated with enhanced oligodendroglial tropism and delayed virus clearance. However, the CNS inflammatory cell composition and CD8(\u002B) T-cell effector functions were similar between transgenic and wild-type mice, supporting unimpaired peripheral and CNS immune responses in transgenic mice. Surprisingly, increased viral load in oligodendroglia did not affect the extent of myelin loss, the frequency of oligodendroglial apoptosis, or CNS recruitment of macrophages. These data demonstrate that IFN-\u03B3 receptor signaling is critical for the control of JHMV replication in oligodendroglia.

CONCLUSIONS: Polyomaviruses were commonly identified in HIV-infected and -uninfected children hospitalized for LRTIs, frequently in association with other viruses and may contribute to the pathogenesis of pneumococcal pneumonia.","publish_time":"2014-10-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nunes, Marta C.; Kuschner, Zachary; Rabede, Zelda; Cutland, Clare L.; Madimabe, Richard; Kuwanda, Locadiah; Klugman, Keith P.; Adrian, Peter V.; Madhi, Shabir A.","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9cdb6e1de26241f4502b23f0f56292e619b9bdc2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173307.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653214004004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25467863/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2014.10.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653214004004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsxODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["WU"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HIV-uninfected children","WUPyV-positive LRTIs HIV-infected children","HIV-uninfected placebo-recipients","KIPyV-positive LRTIs","respiratory viruses","respiratory-viruses","prevalence of WUPyV","lower respiratory tract infections","higher respiratory rate","acute respiratory infections","respiratory-tract specimens","clinical manifestations of WUPyV","PCV9-recipients","lower oxygen saturation","lower incidence of hospitalization","Co-infections","pathogenesis of pneumococcal pneumonia","role of pneumococcal co-infection","longer duration of hospitalization","clinical pneumonia episodes","higher case fatality rate","valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine","discovered polyomaviruses","admission","limited data","Nasopharyngeal aspirates","STUDY DESIGN","cohort","PCR","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","association","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

However, during the last decade, swine producers in the United States (US) and other countries have voluntarily begun to share data for the control and elimination of specific infectious diseases, such as the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSv). Those surveillance programs have played a pivotal role in bringing producers and veterinarians together for the benefit of the industry. Examples of situations in which producers have decided to voluntarily share data for extended periods of time to support applied research and, ultimately, disease control in the absence of a regulatory framework have rarely been documented in the peer-reviewed literature. Here, we provide evidence of a national program for voluntary sharing of disease status data that has helped the implementation of surveillance activities that, ultimately, allowed the generation of critically important scientific information to better support disease control activities. Altogether, this effort has supported, and is supporting, the design and implementation of prevention and control approaches for the most economically devastating swine disease affecting the US. The program, which has been voluntarily sustained and supported over an extended period of time by the swine industry in the absence of any regulatory framework and that includes data on approximately 50% of the sow population in the US, represents a unique example of a livestock industry self-organized surveillance program to generate scientific-driven solutions for emerging swine health issues in North America.","publish_time":"2019-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perez, Andres M.; Linhares, Daniel C.

The Chinese Health Inspection Authority (HIA), a relatively independent organization functioning at each administrative level (provincial, municipal, and county), was mandated to conduct 11 health inspection functions to maintain efficient public health and medical services. These functions include issuing health permit, conducting health supervision and inspection, health testing and evaluation, case investigation, complaint handling, managing public health crisis, monitoring and safeguarding public health at major public events, enforcing supervision and inspection compliance, public health education, information management, and team training and management. Since the reform of the health inspection system by the Ministry of Health in 2000, the HIA underwent a series of changes and transitions. This study aimed to describe and assess the five factors that were considered to be important for meeting service delivery objectives of the HIA in the People\u2019s Republic of China. METHODS: A total of 604 HIAs, sampled across three geographical regions of China at three administrative levels, participated in a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2013. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the status of mandated operations, manpower, revenue and expenditures, and institutional infrastructure. Differences in these characteristics across the geographical regions and administrative levels were compared. RESULTS: On average, the HIAs had not fully implemented the 11 mandated functions at any administrative levels. Governmental financial allocations were the main sources of revenue. Three primary personnel employment models coexisted and most employed the quasi-civil service employment model. The institutional infrastructure did not meet governmental mandated standards with respect to building area or the number and types of equipment available to conduct key functions. CONCLUSIONS: In 2012, the majority of the HIAs in China at the provincial, municipal, and county levels did not meet the mandated requirements, although positive indications toward meeting these requirements were observed. It is necessary for the government to pay more attention to institutional resources (buildings, equipment, and the level of the staff\u2019s educational attainment) and ensure that the HIAs can meet their service delivery objectives.","publish_time":"2015-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Sha; Chen, Gang; Tan, B-K","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e25ab9800baa443a7f103bd9e4940cac7db05f6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4449968.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-015-1832-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25989798/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["The Chinese Health Inspection Authority","HIA"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["health supervision","health inspection functions","health testing","health permit","Ministry of Health","public health education","efficient public health","public health crisis","health inspection system","Chinese Health Inspection Authority","mandated functions","administrative levels","HIAs","mandated requirements","inspection compliance","governmental mandated standards","county levels","major public events","geographical regions of China","institutional infrastructure","key functions","status of mandated operations","meeting service delivery objectives","governmental agency","institutional resources","medical services","People\u2019s Republic of China","Governmental financial allocations","quasi-civil service employment model","information management","types of equipment available","main sources of revenue","primary personnel employment models","evaluation","complaint handling","case investigation","number","area","manpower","buildings","expenditures","respect","organizations","team training","attention","pressing need","characteristics","positive indications","independent organization","staff\u2019s educational attainment","series of changes","majority","reform","cross-sectional survey","transitions","Differences","METHODS","total","RESULTS","average","Descriptive statistics","CONCLUSIONS","factors","BACKGROUND","study"],"language":"en"},

Patients with metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) are often obese and have additional metabolic risk factors which may aggravate the severity of respiratory diseases and of COVID-19. This study aims to investigate the association between MAFLD and COVID-19 severity. METHODS: 214 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 aged between 18 and 75 years from three hospitals in Wenzhou, China were consecutively enrolled. Sixty-six patients with MAFLD were included in the final analysis. COVID-19 was diagnosed as a positive result by high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay of oropharyngeal swab specimens. COVID-19 severity was assessed during hospitalization and classified as severe and non-severe based on the current management guideline. All patients were screened for fatty liver by computed tomography and subsequently diagnosed as MAFLD according to a recent set of consensus diagnostic criteria. Obesity was defined as BMI \u003E25 kg/m(2). RESULTS: The presence of obesity in MAFLD patients was associated with a ~6-fold increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness (unadjusted-OR 5.77, 95% CI 1.19\u201327.91, p = 0.029). Notably, this association with obesity and COVID-19 severity remained significant (adjusted-OR 6.32, 95% CI 1.16\u201334.54, p = 0.033) even after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the risk of obesity to COVID-19 severity is greater in those with, than those without MAFLD.","publish_time":"2020-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Kenneth I.; Gao, Feng; Wang, Xiao-Bo; Sun, Qing-Feng; Pan, Ke-Hua; Wang, Ting-Yao; Ma, Hong-Lei; Chen, Yong-Ping; Liu, Wen-Yue; George, Jacob; Zheng, Ming-Hua","journal":"Metabolism","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/edd1b35fa72b435d3cb9cf363d9c9e841d8bc3b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166301.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026049520301086?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2020.154244; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32320741/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0026049520301086","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsyNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BACKGROUND","MAFLD"],"locations":["Wenzhou","China"],"keyphrases":["MAFLD patients","increased risk of severe COVID","risk of obesity","presence of obesity","severity of respiratory diseases","metabolic associated fatty liver disease","association","AIMS","additional metabolic risk factors","Coronavirus disease","real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay of oropharyngeal swab specimens","high-throughput sequencing","diabetes","current management guideline","recent set of consensus diagnostic criteria","Wenzhou","hypertension","sex","smoking","positive result","computed tomography","illness","hospitals","China","BACKGROUND","data","hospitalization","laboratory","years","dyslipidaemia","RESULTS","METHODS","final analysis","CONCLUSIONS","study","BMI","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: To investigate perceptions, preparedness, and knowledge among U.S. internists with regard to Ebola risk. DESIGN: Cross-sectional Web-based national survey distributed by e-mail between December 2014 and January 2015. PARTICIPANTS: Practicing U.S. internists participating in a research panel representative of American College of Physicians (ACP) membership. MAIN MEASURES: Respondents\u2019 perceptions of Ebola, reported sources of information, and reported management of possible Ebola cases. The primary predictor was the possibility of encountering Ebola (based on respondents\u2019 geographic proximity to designated airports or confirmed Ebola cases, or on their patients\u2019 travel histories). Pre-specified outcomes included reported management intensity in clinical vignettes involving patients at low risk of symptomatic Ebola as well as reported Ebola preparedness. KEY RESULTS: The survey response rate was 46.1 %. Among the 202 respondents, 9.9 % (95 % CI 6.2\u201314.9 %) reported that they had recently evaluated a patient who had traveled to West Africa. Seventy percent (95 % CI 63.0\u201376.0 %) reported a practice-level protocol. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was the most popular source for Ebola information (75.2 %, 95 % CI 68.7\u201381.0 %). Most respondents felt very (45.0 %) or somewhat prepared (52.0 %) to communicate information about or diagnose Ebola, especially those with the possibility of encountering Ebola and those who reported medical journals, professional groups, or government as information sources. One-fifth of respondents (19.8 %, 95 % CI 14.5\u201326.0 %) reported overly intensive management for low-risk patients. Those with the possibility of encountering Ebola were less likely to report overly intensive management (3.1 vs. 22.9 %, p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Internists had wide-ranging views and understanding of Ebola risk; those least likely to encounter Ebola were most likely to be overly aggressive in managing patients at low risk. Our findings underscore the need for better risk communication through various information channels to empower frontline providers in infectious disease outbreaks.

Subsequently, in what became known as the 20/80 rule, a small percentage of individuals within any population was observed to control most transmission events. This empirical rule was shown to govern inter-individual transmission dynamics for many pathogens in several species, and individuals who infect disproportionately more secondary contacts, as compared to most others, became known as super-spreaders. Studies conducted in the wake of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic revealed that, in the absence of super-spreading events, most individuals infect few, if any, secondary contacts. The analysis of SARS transmission, and reports from other outbreaks, unveil a complex scenario in which super-spreading events are shaped by multiple factors, including co-infection with another pathogen, immune suppression, changes in airflow dynamics, delayed hospital admission, misdiagnosis, and inter-hospital transfers. Predicting and identifying super-spreaders open significant medical and public health challenges, and represent important facets of infectious disease management and pandemic preparedness plans.","publish_time":"2011-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stein, Richard A.","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df8bf043a289dc6eac7f46d85d7b1d7f3ac892e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110524.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21737332/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971211000245; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2010.06.020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971211000245","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjszMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transmission events","infected individuals","absence of super-spreading events","inter-individual transmission dynamics","small percentage of individuals","population","analysis of SARS transmission","secondary contacts","super-spreaders open significant medical","inter-hospital transfers","airflow dynamics","pathogen interactions","co-infection","empirical rule","delayed hospital admission","pandemic preparedness plans","Summary Early studies","public health challenges","important facets of infectious disease management","changes","misdiagnosis","immune suppression","host","pathogens","severe acute respiratory syndrome","multiple factors","wake","complex scenario","equal chances","outbreaks","reports","species"],"language":"en"},

In Portugal, RSV cases are detected through the ISS using the European Union (EU) influenza-like illness (ILI) case definition. AIM: To investigate clinical predictors for RSV infection and how three case definitions (EU ILI, a modified EU acute respiratory infection, and one respiratory symptom) performed in detecting RSV infections in Portugal. METHODS: This observational retrospective study used epidemiological and laboratory surveillance data (October 2010\u2013May 2018). Associations between clinical characteristics and RSV detection were analysed using logistic regression. Accuracy of case definitions was assessed through sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). A 0.05 significance level was accepted. RESULTS: The study involved 6,523 persons, including 190 (2.9%) RSV cases. Among 183 cases with age information, RSV infection was significantly more frequent among individuals \u003C 5 years (n = 23; 12.6%) and \u2265 65 years (n = 45; 24.6%) compared with other age groups (p \u003C 0.0001). Cough (odds ratio (OR): 2.4; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2\u20136.5) was the best RSV-infection predictor considering all age groups, while shortness of breath was particularly associated with RSV-positivity among \u2264 14 year olds (OR: 6.7; 95% CI: 2.6\u201317.4 for 0\u20134 year olds and OR: 6.7; 95% CI: 1.5\u201328.8 for 5\u201314 year olds). Systemic symptoms were significantly associated with RSV-negative and influenza-positive cases. None of the case definitions were suitable to detect RSV infections (AUC = 0.51). CONCLUSION: To avoid underestimating the RSV disease burden, RSV surveillance within the Portuguese sentinel ISS would require a more sensitive case definition than ILI and, even a different case definition according to age.","publish_time":"2019-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"S\u00E1ez-L\u00F3pez, Emma; Pechirra, Pedro; Costa, In\u00EAs; Crist\u00F3v\u00E3o, Paula; Conde, Patr\u00EDcia; Machado, Ausenda; Rodrigues, Ana Paula; Guiomar, Raquel","journal":"Euro Surveill","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0a3fa45a3d4599c5d0ccd212e4bde23a4253717.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6852315.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.es.2019.24.45.1900140; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31718741/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjszODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ISS","EU","RSV","EU ILI"],"locations":["Portugal"],"keyphrases":["RSV surveillance","RSV cases","RSV infections","RSV detection","RSV-negative","RSV-positivity","RSV disease burden","best RSV-infection predictor","Accuracy of case definitions","sensitive case definition","different case definition","EU ILI","age groups","year olds","influenza-positive cases","age information","modified EU acute respiratory infection","Well-established influenza surveillance systems","respiratory symptom","laboratory surveillance data","AUC","years","Portugal","Portuguese sentinel ISS","respiratory syncytial virus","clinical characteristics","clinical predictors","observational retrospective study","area","receiver","illness","characteristic curve","specificity","BACKGROUND","individuals","sensitivity","Associations","European Union","shortness of breath","METHODS","logistic regression","Cough","odds ratio","RESULTS","persons","AIM","confidence interval","Systemic symptoms","significance level","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Here, we adapted an anion exchange resin-based method, initially developed to concentrate negatively charged viruses from water, to liquid impingement-based bioaerosol sampling. In this method, aerosolized viruses are collected in a 20ml liquid sample contained within widely used impingers, BioSamplers (SKC Inc., Eighty Four, PA), and further concentrated via adsorption to an anion exchange resin that is suspended within this liquid. Viral nucleic acids are then extracted from the resin to facilitate molecular analyses through a reduction in the effective sample volume. For this study, various quantities of two negatively charged viruses, type A and type B influenza viruses (FluMist Quadrivalent vaccine) and the male-specific (F\u002B) RNA coliphage MS2 (MS2), were nebulized into a custom-built bioaerosolization chamber, and sampled using BioSamplers with and without anion exchange resin. Compared to direct testing of the BioSampler liquid, detection was improved by 6.77\u00D7 and 3.33\u00D7 for type A and type B influenza viruses, respectively, by using the anion exchange resin. For MS2, the anion exchange resin method allowed for an average improvement in detection of 8.26\u00D7.","publish_time":"2017-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chandler, J. C.; Schaeffer, J.

We highlight the low sensitivity of PCR testing and the difficulties this poses for blanket screening and isolation of residents. We discuss quarantine of residents and the potential harms associated with this. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) supply for care homes during the pandemic has been suboptimal and we suggest that better integration of procurement and supply is required. Advance care planning has been challenged by the pandemic and there is a need to for healthcare staff to provide support to care homes with this. Finally, we discuss measures to implement augmented care in care homes, including treatment with oxygen and subcutaneous fluids, and the frameworks which will be required if these are to be sustainable. All of these challenges must be met by healthcare, social care and government agencies if care home residents and staff are to be physically and psychologically supported during this time of crisis for care homes.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gordon, Adam L; Goodman, Claire; Achterberg, Wilco; Barker, Robert O; Burns, Eileen; Hanratty, Barbara; Martin, Finbarr C; Meyer, Julienne; O\u0027Neill, Desmond; Schols, Jos; Spilsbury, Karen","journal":"Age and ageing","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afaa113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32402088/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["care homes","care home residents","social care","augmented care","Advance care planning","quarantine of residents","isolation of residents","COVID","pandemic","supply","healthcare staff","challenges","government agencies","PPE","treatment","difficulties","oxygen","Personal Protective Equipment","subcutaneous fluids","blanket screening","dilemmas","low sensitivity of PCR testing","response","better integration of procurement","commentary","potential harms","need","support","time of crisis","measures","deaths","frameworks","article"],"language":"en"},

Methods Data were downloaded from Seoul Data Open Plaza, and changes in the number of passengers on the Seoul Metropolitan Subway network between January 1, 2020, and March 31, 2020, were used to assess the extent to which people in Seoul practiced social distancing. Five events regarding COVID-19 that received wide public attention between January and March 2020 were identified and the changes in the number of passengers before and after each event were analyzed. Also, similar analyses were performed for 16 stations that were specific in either the age or purpose of the visit of the passengers. Results Compared to the third week of January 2020 (January 13-19), the mean daily number of passengers in all stations decreased by 2,984,857.4 or 40.6% by the first week of March (March 2-8). The percentage decrease in individual stations between this period was not significantly different between \u201Cyoung\u201D and \u201Cold\u201D stations (46.3% vs. 49.2%; p = 0.551) but was significantly smaller in \u201Cwork\u201D stations than in \u201Cleisure\u201D stations (36.2% vs. 51.6%; p = 0.021). Of the five events, the first reported death due to COVID-19 in South Korea and the identification of a mass infection cluster in Daegu on February 20 were accompanied by the greatest decrease of the mean daily number of passengers (1,352,153.3 or 20.8%), while the first mass infection in Seoul on March 10 and the announcement of aggressive social distancing campaign on March 22 were accompanied by an increase in the number of passengers. Conclusions The number of subway passengers in Seoul decreased markedly during late February but slowly increased afterward, suggesting decreasing levels of risk perception and adherence to social distancing. Understanding the differing patterns of subway use by age or purpose of the visit may guide policymakers and the general public in shaping their future response to the current pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Jewel","journal":"Cureus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a62b755185af77ae410fb43f73de0458ffdff10.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7163336.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32313784/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Seoul Data Open Plaza"],"locations":["South Korea","Daegu","Seoul"],"keyphrases":["number of subway passengers","mean daily number of passengers","individual stations","widespread social distancing efforts","COVID","announcement of aggressive social distancing campaign","Seoul Metropolitan Subway network","Seoul Data Open Plaza","South Korea","purpose","people","changes","mass infection cluster","visit","events","week","subsequent government announcements","level of response","future response","differing patterns of subway use","Methods Data","general public","greatest decrease","percentage decrease","different demographic groups","wide public attention","numerous episodes of Coronavirus disease","adherence","decreasing levels of risk perception","identification","Introduction","policymakers","period","current pandemic","reported death","Daegu","leisure","Conclusions","similar analyses","extent","increase","Results"],"language":"en"},

On 7 January 2020, the causal organism was identified as a new coronavirus, later named as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Genome sequencing found the genetic sequence of 2019-nCoV homologous to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus. As of 29 January 2020, the virus had been diagnosed in more than 7000 patients in China and 77 patients in other countries. It is reported that both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with 2019-nCoV can play a role in disease transmission via airborne and contact. This finding has caused a great concern about the prevention of illness spread. The clinical features of the infection are not specific and are often indistinguishable from those of other respiratory infections, making it difficult to diagnose. Given that the virus has a strong ability to spread between individuals, it is of top priority to identify potential or suspected patients as soon as possible\u2014or the virus may cause a serious pandemic. Therefore, a precision medicine approach to managing this disease is urgently needed for detecting and controlling the spread of the virus.

Among those health impacts, infectious diseases still represent a significant public health problem in China. However, there have been few studies on the identification of the spectrum of infectious diseases associated with floods in one area. This study aimed to quantitatively identify sensitive infectious diseases associated with floods in Guangxi, China. Methods A time-trend ecological design was conducted. A descriptive analysis was first performed to exclude infectious diseases with low incidence from 2005 to 2012 in ten study sites of Guangxi. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was applied to examine the difference in the ten-day attack rate of infectious diseases between the exposure and control periods with different lagged effects. Negative binomial, zero-inflated Poisson and zero-inflated negative binomial models were used to examine the relationship and odd ratios (ORs) of the risk of floods on infectious diseases of preliminary screening. Results A total of 417,271 infectious diseases were notified. There were 11 infectious diseases associated with floods in the preliminary screening process for flood-sensitive infectious diseases. The strongest effect was shown with a 0\u20139 ten-day lag in different infectious diseases. Multivariate analysis showed that floods were significantly associated with an increased the risk of bacillary dysentery (odds ratio (OR) = 1.268, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.072\u20131.500), acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC, OR = 3.230, 95% CI: 1.976\u20135.280), influenza A (H1N1) (OR = 1.808, 95% CI: 1.721\u20131.901), tuberculosis (OR = 1.200, 95% CI: 1.036\u20131.391), influenza (OR = 2.614, 95% CI: 1.476\u20134.629), Japanese encephalitis (OR = 2.334, 95% CI: 1.119\u20134.865), and leptospirosis (OR = 1.138, 95% CI: 1.075\u20131.205), respectively. Conclusion The spectrum of infectious diseases which are associated with floods are bacillary dysentery, AHC, influenza A (H1N1), tuberculosis, influenza, Japanese encephalitis and leptospirosis in Guangxi. Floods can result in differently increased risk of these diseases, and public health action should be taken to control a potential risk of these diseases after floods.","publish_time":"2019-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ding, Guoyong; Li, Xiaomei; Li, Xuewen; Zhang, Baofang; Jiang, Baofa; Li, Dong; Xing, Weijia; Liu, Qiyong; Liu, Xuena; Hou, Haifeng","journal":"Environmental Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec2e48e04cf44079c26155ee6d4ba37e2c404c52.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094502.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935119303743; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2019.108577; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935119303743; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306984/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsxMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AHC"],"locations":["China","Guangxi"],"keyphrases":["different infectious diseases","spectrum of infectious diseases","flood-sensitive infectious diseases","infectious diseases of preliminary screening","risk of floods","ten-day attack rate of infectious diseases","influenza","increased risk","health effects","risk of bacillary dysentery","potential risk","health impacts","public health action","AHC","significant public health problem","Japanese encephalitis","China","tuberculosis","study sites of Guangxi","H1N1","leptospirosis","preliminary screening process","different lagged effects","negative binomial models","control periods","ten-day lag","inflated Poisson","Multivariate analysis","descriptive analysis","Abstract Background Flood-related damage","exposure","ORs","Methods","time-trend ecological design","relationship","difference","odds ratio","identification","odd ratios","Wilcoxon rank-sum test","acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis","low incidence","Conclusion","studies","confidence interval","area","total","strongest effect"],"language":"en"},

We analyzed data from population-based infectious disease surveillance for severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) among children \u003C5 years of age in Kibera, a densely populated urban slum in Nairobi, Kenya. METHODS: Surveillance was conducted among a monthly mean of 5,874 (range = 5,778-6,411) children \u003C5 years old in two contiguous villages in Kibera. Participants had free access to the study clinic and their health events and utilization were noted during biweekly home visits. Patients meeting criteria for SARI (WHO-defined severe or very severe pneumonia, or oxygen saturation \u003C90%) from March 1, 2007-February 28, 2011 had blood cultures processed for bacteria, and naso- and oro- pharyngeal swabs collected for quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing for influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses (PIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Swabs collected during January 1, 2009 \u2013 February 28, 2010 were also tested for rhinoviruses, enterovirus, parechovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella species. Swabs were collected for simultaneous testing from a selected group of control-children visiting the clinic without recent respiratory or diarrheal illnesses. RESULTS: SARI overall incidence was 12.4 cases/100 person-years of observation (PYO) and 30.4 cases/100 PYO in infants. When comparing detection frequency in swabs from 815 SARI cases and 115 healthy controls, only RSV and influenza A virus were significantly more frequently detected in cases, although similar trends neared statistical significance for PIV, adenovirus and hMPV. The incidence for RSV was 2.8 cases/100 PYO and for influenza A was 1.0 cases/100 PYO. When considering all PIV, the rate was 1.1 case/100 PYO and the rate per 100 PYO for SARI-associated disease was 1.5 for adenovirus and 0.9 for hMPV. RSV and influenza A and B viruses were estimated to account for 16.2% and 6.7% of SARI cases, respectively; when taken together, PIV, adenovirus, and hMPV may account for \u003E20% additional cases. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza viruses and RSV (and possibly PIV, hMPV and adenoviruses) are important pathogens to consider when developing technologies and formulating strategies to treat and prevent SARI in children.","publish_time":"2015-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Breiman, Robert F; Cosmas, Leonard; Njenga, M Kariuki; Williamson, John; Mott, Joshua A; Katz, Mark A; Erdman, Dean D; Schneider, Eileen; Oberste, M Steven; Neatherlin, John C; Njuguna, Henry; Ondari, Daniel M; Odero, Kennedy; Okoth, George O; Olack, Beatrice; Wamola, Newton; Montgomery, Joel M; Fields, Barry S; Feikin, Daniel R","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5abaf42063d64c1f006c8595b5769f8087cae69c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4351931.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25879805/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-015-0827-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsxMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARI","RSV","PIV"],"locations":["Africa","Kibera","Kenya"],"keyphrases":["SARI cases","PYO","children","PIV","RSV","hMPV","additional cases","SARI-associated disease","SARI overall incidence","severe acute respiratory illness","parainfluenza viruses","B viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","acute respiratory infection burden","severe pneumonia","years old","person-years","Kibera","oro- pharyngeal swabs","years of age","infectious disease surveillance","simultaneous testing","study clinic","quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing","Africa","utilization","statistical significance","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","populated urban slum","parechovirus","naso","selected group of control","similar trends","healthy controls","health events","bacteria","technologies","enterovirus","Nairobi","Kenya","free access","population","important pathogens","major priority","contiguous villages","diarrheal illnesses","BACKGROUND","adenoviruses","observation","Legionella species","biweekly home visits","human metapneumovirus","detection frequency","Participants","rhinoviruses","challenge","monthly mean","data","oxygen saturation","range","formulating strategies","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","blood cultures","Patients","criteria","infants","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The envelope surface of SosV presents a receptor-binding protein (RBP), SosV-RBP, which facilitates host-cell attachment and entry. Unlike closely related hemagglutinin neuraminidase RBPs from other genera of the Paramyxoviridae, SosV-RBP and other pararubulavirus RBPs lack many of the stringently conserved residues required for sialic acid recognition and hydrolysis. We determined the crystal structure of the globular head region of SosV-RBP, revealing that while the glycoprotein presents a classical paramyxoviral six-bladed \u03B2-propeller fold and structurally classifies in close proximity to paramyxoviral RBPs with hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) functionality, it presents a receptor-binding face incongruent with sialic acid recognition. Hemadsorption and neuraminidase activity analysis confirms the limited capacity of SosV-RBP to interact with sialic acid in vitro and indicates that SosV-RBP undergoes a nonclassical route of host-cell entry. The close overall structural conservation of SosV-RBP with other classical HN RBPs supports a model by which pararubulaviruses only recently diverged from sialic acid binding functionality.","publish_time":"2019-10-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stelfox, Alice J.; Bowden, Thomas A.","journal":"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b42f394d5ea15733d96063ffabef231a98ce5429.json; document_parses/pdf_json/eddb4ccfc3420d4cdaafabbc081bec8758930e53.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6815108.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31591233/; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1906717116","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsxOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SosV-RBP","limited capacity of SosV","structural conservation of SosV","sialic acid recognition","envelope surface of SosV","sialic acid binding functionality","paramyxoviral RBPs","globular head region of SosV","classical HN RBPs","hemagglutinin-neuraminidase","related hemagglutinin neuraminidase RBPs","pararubulavirus RBPs lack","receptor-binding protein","classical paramyxoviral","cell entry","receptor-binding face incongruent","neuraminidase activity analysis","host-cell attachment","close proximity","family Paramyxoviridae","nonclassical route of host","established genus Pararubulavirus","genera","conserved residues","bladed \u03B2-propeller fold","crystal structure","Sosuga virus","model","pararubulaviruses","bat","Hemadsorption","glycoprotein","hydrolysis","paramyxoviruses"],"language":"en"},

Many such therapies abrogate the effects of the hypertensive and mitogenic peptide, angiotensin II, by antagonising its interaction with its receptor, or by inhibiting its formative enzyme, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). At the turn of the millennium, a homologous enzyme, termed ACE2, was identified which increasingly shares the limelight with its better-known homologue. In common with ACE, ACE2 is a type I transmembrane metallopeptidase; however, unlike ACE, ACE2 functions as a carboxypeptidase, cleaving a single C-terminal residue from a distinct range of substrates. One such substrate is angiotensin II, which is hydrolysed by ACE2 to the vasodilatory peptide angiotensin 1\u20137. In this commentary we discuss the latest developments in the rapidly progressing study of the physiological and patho-physiological roles of ACE2 allied with an overview of the current understanding of its molecular and cell biology. We also discuss parallel developments in the study of collectrin, a catalytically inactive homologue of ACE2 with critical functions in the pancreas and kidney.","publish_time":"2008-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lambert, Daniel W.; Hooper, Nigel M.; Turner, Anthony J.","journal":"Biochemical Pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/917f099575a78691986aa2d5fae72440c78c2225.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111199.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006295207005540; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006295207005540","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE2 functions","termed ACE2","angiotensin system","inactive homologue of ACE2","vasodilatory peptide angiotensin","patho-physiological roles of ACE2","homologous enzyme","formative enzyme","critical functions","study of collectrin","progressing study","latest developments","mitogenic peptide","parallel developments","better-known homologue","established targets","pharmacological intervention","single C-terminal residue","renin","hypertensive","carboxypeptidase","current understanding","distinct range of substrates","effects","millennium","overview","pancreas","type","transmembrane metallopeptidase","cell biology","variety of disorders","Abstract Components","kidney","receptor","therapies","turn","limelight","commentary","interaction"],"language":"en"},

Only the time from admission to the ICU was associated with the probability of testing positive, with the probability of testing positive decreasing with increasing length of stay (P \u003C 0.001). Of the 418 respiratory specimens collected from the healthcare personnel, 27 (6.5%) tested positive. Seventeen employees tested positive at least once for respiratory viruses (17/41, 41.5%). Among the employees, calendar time (P = 0.03) and having sick contacts at home (P = 0.006) were significantly associated with swab positivity. Among the study population, patients had a significantly higher probability of having a positive swab result than employees. The distribution of viruses differed between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that when hygiene precautions are adopted, the possibility of transmitting selected respiratory viruses between patients and personnel is limited. They also point to a greater importance of the community over the hospital environment for acquisition of viral respiratory infections by ICU patients and employees.

Although FCoV is prevalent among cats; the fastidious nature of type I FCoV to grow on cell culture has limited further studies on tissue tropism and pathogenesis of FCoV. While several studies reported serological evidence for FCoV in Malaysia, neither the circulating FCoV isolated nor its biotypes determined. This study for the first time, describes the isolation and biotypes determination of type I and type II FCoV from naturally infected cats in Malaysia. FINDINGS: Of the total number of cats sampled, 95% (40/42) were RT-PCR positive for FCoV. Inoculation of clinical samples into Crandell feline kidney cells (CrFK), and Feline catus whole fetus-4 cells (Fcwf-4), show cytopathic effect (CPE) characterized by syncytial cells formation and later cell detachment. Differentiation of FCoV biotypes using RT-PCR assay revealed that, 97.5% and 2.5% of local isolates were type I and type II FCoV, respectively. These isolates had high sequence homology and phylogenetic similarity with several FCoV isolates from Europe, South East Asia and USA. CONCLUSIONS: This study reported the successful isolation of local type I and type II FCoV evident with formation of cytopathic effects in two types of cell cultures namely the CrFK and Fcwf-4 , where the later cells being more permissive. However, the RT-PCR assay is more sensitive in detecting the antigen in suspected samples as compared to virus isolation in cell culture. The present study indicated that type I FCoV is more prevalent among cats in Malaysia.","publish_time":"2012-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amer, Alazawy; Siti Suri, Arshad; Abdul Rahman, Omar; Mohd, Hair Bejo; Faruku, Bande; Saeed, Sharif; Tengku Azmi, Tengku Ibrahim","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1449e7aedd623536a61d71bf1505622093774208.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3568730.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23171743/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-278","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Crandell"],"locations":["Malaysia","Europe","South East Asia"],"keyphrases":["FCoV isolates","FCoV evident","pathogenesis of FCoV","Differentiation of FCoV biotypes","circulating FCoV isolated","biotypes determination of type","successful isolation of local type","fastidious nature of type","later cells","Malaysia","RT-PCR assay","Crandell feline kidney cells","Feline catus","virus isolation","local isolates","infected cats","syncytial cells formation","later cell detachment","RT-PCR positive","Feline infectious peritonitis virus","feline enteric coronavirus","CrFK","types of cell cultures","studies","Fcwf","total number of cats","present study","formation of cytopathic effects","suspected samples","Inoculation of clinical samples","Europe","FIPV","phylogenetic similarity","South East Asia","high sequence homology","FECV","CPE","tissue tropism","USA","BACKGROUND","fetus","important coronaviruses of domestic cat","serological evidence","antigen","time","FINDINGS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

In each hospital setting, there may exist several promising strategies to enhance scheduling flexibility and reduce the mismatch between the nursing needs and the availability of nurses.

Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of our approach by evaluating the benefits of a strategy where nurses are divided into two cohorts and schedules are phase shifted for the two cohorts. Staggering schedules allows nursing unit managers to benefit from more frequent updating of needs\u2019 assessments without having to change work rules. Upon applying our approach to data from a large urban hospital, we discovered that in this example staggering did not improve the performance of nurse schedules.

In spite similar antigen exposure, only a minority of the population shown some form of atopic disease. Atopic disease with its spontaneous pattern of familial occurrence cannot be induced at will. The exact pathogenesis of atopy is yet to be elucidated. Two theories prevail: 1) atopy is a primary disorder of the immune system with sequelae in the various effector tissues; and 2) a concept of atopy as a primary autonomic imbalance, essentially beta adrenergic in character, with sequelae in effector cells, including those engaged in the production of antibodies. The autonomic imbalance is perceived as caused not by some disorder of the autonomic nervous system itself but by a defector functioning of its effector cells. These two concepts are not mutually exclusive. The IgE antibody, which mediates allergic reactions, is essentially identical with atopic reagin in various animal species. The beta adrenergic theory regards atopic disorders (i.e., perennial and seasonal allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma, and atopic dermatitis) not as immunologic diseases but as unique patterns of altered reactivities to a broad spectrum of immunologic, psychic, infectious, chemical and physical stimuli. The antigen-antibody interaction is given the same role as that of a broad category of nonspecific stimuli that function only to trigger the same defective homeostatic mechanism in the various effector cells involved in immediate hypersensitivities. Current evidence favors the possibility that there are inherited and/or acquired multiple abnormalities in the receptor\u2014adenylate cyclase\u2014cyclic AMP system of all effector cells that are critical in the organization of immune reactivities. Atopic abnormality may be 1) acquired by functional receptor regulatory shifts caused by hormonal changes, infection (viral, bacterial, etc), allergic tissue injury or other event; 2) genetically determined; or 3) caused by autoimmune disease. One, two or all three of these effector mechanisms may be operative in a particular disease. There is an important relationship between asthma and viral respiratory infection. A history of childhood viral respiratory illness is a risk factor for the development of chronic obstructive airway syndromes in later life. Asthmatic attacks occurred only when the infection produced fever, malaise, cough or coryza. The dominant role of fever in these episodes immediately suggests the profound involvement of adrenergic effector mechanisms. The presence of autoantibodies to beta-adrenoceptors in patients correlated well with a reduced beta\u2014and an increased alpha-adrenergic responsiveness. Virus infections can elicit autoantibody formation. In patients with atopic dermatitis an increased susceptibility and abnormal host response to viral infections in general. Defective cytotoxic T cells, abnormally functioning macrophages and natural killer cells, a reduced production of IFN\u03B1 in children, and of IFN\u03B3 in atopic patients with food allergy has recently been demonstrated. Lymphocytic cyclic AMP-phosphodiesterase, that destroys cyclic AMP, is increased in atopic dermatitis and in allergic respiratory disease of adults, and this increased activity correlated closely with histamine release from basophils. Peripheral blood leukocytes and lymphocytes in atopic dermatitis have frequently demonstrated impaired beta adrenergic reactivity. Allergic tissue injury may be initiated by antigen-specific IgE antibodies that combine with Fc\u03B5 receptors on various cell types and trigger mediator release upon encounter with the antigen. Various noxious agents that are capable of triggering asthma are capable of releasing inflammatory mediators from the same target cells. Accounting only for those pharmacologic mediators where the cell-type has been identified, the spectrum of mediator-storing, synthesizing, or transporting cells includes neutrophil leucocytes, basophilic leucocytes eosinophilic leucocytes; mast cells, \u201Cchromaffin-positive\u201D mast cells, enterochromaffin cells, chromaffin cells; platelets, neurosecretory cells and nerve cells that potentially produce all amine-mediators as well as prostaglandins and kinins.","publish_time":"2003-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Szentivanyi, Andor; Berczi, Istvan; Nyanteh, Harry; Goldman, Allan","journal":"NeuroImmune Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6cd6c08cc339455e391a1bf8c2a588d6217d4b14.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156774430380042X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S156774430380042X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["atopic dermatitis","atopic patients","atopic disorders","atopic reagin","Atopic abnormality","form of atopic disease","various effector cells","manifestations of atopic immediate hypersensitivity","non-atopic immediate hypersensitivity","various effector tissues","allergic respiratory disease of adults","reduced beta","allergic reactions","viral respiratory infection","beta adrenergic theory","allergic tissue injury","seasonal allergic rhinitis","viral infections","cyclic AMP system","beta-adrenoceptors","profound involvement of adrenergic effector mechanisms","particular disease","autoimmune disease","impaired beta adrenergic reactivity","natural killer cells","bronchial asthma","Defective cytotoxic T cells","increased susceptibility","immune system","increased activity","autonomic nervous system","primary autonomic imbalance","antigen-antibody interaction","antigen-specific IgE antibodies","various cell types","hay fever","various animal species","immediate hypersensitivities","sequelae","history of childhood viral respiratory illness","primary disorder","Lymphocytic cyclic AMP-phosphodiesterase","dominant role of fever","increased alpha-adrenergic responsiveness","IgE antibody","concept of atopy","production of antibodies","spite similar antigen exposure","broad spectrum of immunologic","trigger mediator release","reduced production of IFN\u03B1","organization of immune reactivities","exact pathogenesis of atopy","chronic urticaria","functioning macrophages","immunologic diseases","defector functioning","histamine release","broad category of nonspecific stimuli","Virus infections","physical stimuli","defective homeostatic mechanism","unique patterns of altered reactivities","functional receptor regulatory shifts","development of chronic obstructive airway syndromes","abnormal host response","Fc\u03B5 receptors","hormonal changes","risk factor","IFN\u03B3","character","later life","minority","episodes","encounter","children","lymphocytes","Abstract Anaphylaxis","cyclase","Peripheral blood leukocytes","important relationship","spontaneous pattern of familial occurrence","malaise","cough","food allergy","population","presence of autoantibodies","autoantibody formation","coryza","event","multiple abnormalities","Current evidence","possibility","basophils","Asthmatic attacks","concepts","theories","mast cells","enterochromaffin cells","neurosecretory cells","nerve cells","target cells","basophilic leucocytes eosinophilic leucocytes","neutrophil leucocytes","inflammatory mediators","pharmacologic mediators","amine-mediators","chromaffin-positive","capable of triggering asthma","platelets","Various noxious agents","synthesizing","cell-type","prostaglandins","spectrum of mediator","kinins"],"language":"en"},

F. septica may be a candidate antiviral drug against an enveloped virus such as DENV.","publish_time":"2017-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Nan-Chieh; Hung, Wan-Ting; Tsai, Wei-Lun; Lai, Feng-Yi; Lin, You-Sheng; Huang, Mei-Shu; Chen, Jih-Jung; Lin, Wei-Yu; Weng, Jing-Ru; Chang, Tsung-Hsien","journal":"PeerJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/83d150bdc1e4fdc24ecc74e0fd09d5fd7791cc65.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5466810.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28607841/; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.3448","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjszMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DENV infection","septica extracts","enveloped virus","Aichi virus","crude extracts","methanol extracts of fruit","Dengue virus types","Ficus septica Burm","non-envelope picornavirus","specific therapy","stem","heartwood","candidate antiviral drug","immunofluorescence assay","positive-strand RNA viruses","supportive treatments","plants","cytotoxicity","order","novel medicine","human health","Flaviviridae","effect"],"language":"en"},

All these viruses were rescued in monkey (Vero E6) cells and were also infectious for human (Huh-7, Huh7.5.1 and CaCo-2) cell lines and for transgenic (Tg) mice expressing the SARS-CoV receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (hACE-2), indicating that none of these proteins is essential for the viral cycle. Furthermore, in Vero E6 cells, all the viruses showed the formation of particles with the same morphology as the wt virus, indicating that these proteins do not have a high impact in the final morphology of the virions. Nevertheless, in the absence of E protein, release of virus particles efficacy was reduced. Viruses lacking E protein grew about 100-fold lower than the wt virus in lungs of Tg infected mice but did not grow in the brains of the same animals, in contrast to the rSARS-CoV-\u0394[6\u20139b] virus, which grew almost as well as the wt in both tissues. Viruses lacking E protein were highly attenuated in the highly sensitive hACE-2 Tg mice, in contrast to the minimal rSARS-CoV-\u0394[6\u20139b] and wt viruses.

Here we present a systematic assessment of published research on zoonotic diseases in the region and thesis research in Kenya to understand the regional research focus and trends in publications, and estimate proportion of theses research transitioning to peer-reviewed journal publications. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar and African Journals Online databases for publications on 36 zoonotic diseases identified to have occurred in the East Africa countries of Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda, for the period between 1920 and 2017. We searched libraries and queried online repositories for masters and PhD theses on these diseases produced between 1970 and 2016 in five universities and two research institutions in Kenya. RESULTS: We identified 771 journal articles on 22, and 168 theses on 21 of the 36 zoonotic diseases investigated. Research on zoonotic diseases increased exponentially with the last 10 years of our study period contributing more than half of all publications 460 (60%) and theses 102 (61%) retrieved. Endemic diseases were the most studied accounting for 656 (85%) and 150 (89%) of the publication and theses studies respectively, with publications on epidemic diseases associated with outbreaks reported in the region or elsewhere. Epidemiological studies were the most common study types but limited to cross-sectional studies while socio-economics were the least studied. Only 11% of the theses research transitioned to peer-review publications, taking an average of 2.5 years from theses production to manuscript publication. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate increased attention to zoonotic diseases in East Africa but reveal the need to expand the scope, focus and quality of studies to adequately address the public health, social and economic threats posed by zoonoses.","publish_time":"2018-11-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kemunto, Naomi; Mogoa, Eddy; Osoro, Eric; Bitek, Austin; Kariuki Njenga, M.; Thumbi, S.

Objectives To compare case fatality rate (CFR) and viral aetiologies of ARTI between HIV-positive and HIV-negative populations in Africa. Study design We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, Africa Journal Online, and Global Index Medicus to identify studies published from January 2000 to April 2018. Random-effect meta-analysis method was used to assess association (pooled weighted odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI)). Results A total of 36 studies (126,526 participants) were included. CFR was significantly higher in patients with HIV than in HIV-negative controls (OR 4.10, 95%CI: 2.63\u20136.27, I\u00B2: 93.7%). The risk was significantly higher among children \u22645 years (OR 5.51, 95%CI 2.83\u201310.74) compared to people aged \u003E5 years (OR 1.48, 95%CI 1.17\u20131.89); p = 0.0002. There was no difference between children (15 years) and adults and between regions of Africa. There was no difference for viral respiratory aetiologies (Enterovirus, Adenovirus, Bocavirus, Coronavirus, Metapneumovirus, Parainfluenza, Influenza, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus) of ARTI between HIV-positive and HIV-negative people, except for Rhinovirus where being HIV-negative was associated with Rhinovirus (OR 0.70; 95%CI 0.51\u20130.97, I\u00B2: 63.4%). Conclusions This study shows an increased risk of deaths among HIV-infected individuals with ARTI, however with no difference in viral aetiologies compared to HIV-negative individuals in Africa.

Here we report three high resolution crystal structures of highly pathogenic PRRSV nsp10. PRRSV nsp10 has multiple domains, including an N-terminal zinc-binding domain (ZBD), a \u03B2-barrel domain, a helicase core with two RecA-like domains, and a C-terminal domain (CTD). The CTD adopts a novel fold and is required for the overall structure and enzymatic activities. Although each domain except the CTD aligns well with its homologs, PRRSV nsp10 adopts an unexpected extended overall structure in crystals and solution. Moreover, structural and functional analyses of PRRSV nsp10 versus its closest homolog, equine arteritis virus nsp10, suggest that DNA binding might induce a profound conformational change of PRRSV nsp10 to exert functions, thus shedding light on the mechanisms of activity regulation of this helicase.","publish_time":"2020-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Chenjun; Deng, Zengqin; Li, Xiaorong; Yang, Meiting; Tian, Zizi; Chen, Zhenhang; Wang, Guoguo; Wu, Wei; Feng, Wen-hai; Zhang, Gongyi; Chen, Zhongzhou","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a14898fd5b8a47a9cab80d21e593ba38876b568.json; document_parses/pdf_json/fed42d29b5f366d5fd3076e37cc781e6b68450ce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7077220.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32075207/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v12020215","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs0MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogenic PRRSV nsp10","functional analyses of PRRSV nsp10","profound conformational change of PRRSV nsp10","equine arteritis virus nsp10","CTD","C-terminal domain","N-terminal zinc-binding domain","helicase core","multiple domains","\u03B2-barrel domain","multiple processes of virus replication","respiratory syndrome virus","DNA binding","unexpected extended overall structure","closest homolog","ZBD","high resolution crystal structures","great economic losses","shedding light","crystals","world","functions","mechanisms of activity regulation","swine industry","superfamily","homologs","enzymatic activities","RecA","novel fold","conserved proteins","nidoviruses","Nonstructural protein"],"language":"en"},

The extreme actions aimed to reduce virus diffusion have profoundly changed the lifestyles of the Italian population. Moreover, fear of contracting the infection has generated high levels of anxiety. This study aimed to understand the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on sleep quality, general anxiety symptomatology, and psychological distress. METHODS: An online survey collected information on socio-demographic data and additional information concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, sleep quality, sleep disorders, generalized anxiety symptoms, psychological distress, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology related to COVID-19 were assessed. RESULTS: This study included 2291 respondents. The results revealed that 57.1% of participants reported poor sleep quality, 32.1% high anxiety, 41.8% high distress, and 7.6% reported PTSD symptomatology linked to COVID-19. Youth and women, those uncertain regarding possible COVID-19 infection, and greater fear of direct contact with those infected by COVID-19 had an increased risk of developing sleep disturbances, as well as higher levels of anxiety and distress. Finally, a significant relationship between sleep quality, generalized anxiety, and psychological distress with PTSD symptoms related to COVID-19 was evidenced. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic appears to be a risk factor for sleep disorders and psychological diseases in the Italian population, as previously reported in China. These results should be used as a starting point for further studies aimed to develop psychological interventions to minimize the brief and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Casagrande, Maria; Favieri, Francesca; Tambelli, Renata; Forte, Giuseppe","journal":"Sleep Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a3d2b3001d70f94e5c3008aca01ef4a5b55a37d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7215153.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389945720302136?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1389945720302136","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs0OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["psychological distress","possible COVID","sleep disorders","high anxiety","poor sleep quality","high distress","pandemic","high levels of anxiety","psychological diseases","psychological interventions","psychological impact","generalized anxiety symptoms","general anxiety symptomatology","higher levels of anxiety","PTSD symptomatology","RESULTS","PTSD symptoms","increased risk of developing sleep disturbances","infection","Italian population","study","additional information","risk factor","greater fear of direct contact","post-traumatic stress disorder","socio-demographic data","outbreak","brief","online survey","significant relationship","virus diffusion","lifestyles","studies","women","long-term consequences","participants","Coronavirus Disease","extreme actions","METHODS","global health emergency","starting point","BACKGROUND","Youth","respondents","findings","CONCLUSIONS","China"],"language":"en"},

Two principle kinds of RNA granules are conserved from yeast to mammals: stress granules (SGs), which contain stalled translation initiation complexes, and processing bodies (P-bodies, PBs), which are enriched with factors involved in RNA turnover. Since RNA granules are associated with silenced transcripts, viruses subvert RNA granule function for replicative advantages. This review, focusing on RNA viruses, discusses mechanisms that manipulate stress granules and P-bodies to promote synthesis of viral proteins. Three main themes have emerged for how viruses manipulate RNA granules; i) cleavage of key host factors, ii) control of PKR activation and iii) redirecting RNA granule components for new or parallel roles in viral reproduction, at the same time disrupting RNA granules. Viruses utilize one or more of these routes to achieve robust and productive infection.","publish_time":"2013-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lloyd, Richard E.","journal":"Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: RNA","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eab2335a78df277e8136f61275b17a3f50d33d54.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c653f2d03ef8793928c2bc124803a0187b1b9b26.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3652661.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23554219/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3652661?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1002/wrna.1162","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA viruses","RNA turnover","stress granules","time disrupting RNA granules","principle kinds of RNA granules","RNA granule function","RNA granule components","P-bodies","processing bodies","parallel roles","major roles","viral reproduction","synthesis of viral proteins","cleavage of key host factors","silenced transcripts","cells","stalled translation initiation complexes","SGs","mammals","structures","yeast","mechanisms","gene expression","replicative advantages","control of PKR activation","homeostasis","routes","productive infection","PBs","main themes","review"],"language":"en"},

However, influenza epidemiology data are lacking in Egypt. We describe seven years of Egypt\u2019s influenza hospitalizations from a multi-site influenza surveillance system. METHODS: Syndromic case definitions identified individuals with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) admitted to eight hospitals in Egypt. Standardized demographic and clinical data were collected. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were tested for influenza using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and typed as influenza A or B, and influenza A specimens subtyped. RESULTS: From November 2007\u2013November 2014, 2,936/17,441 (17%) SARI cases were influenza-positive. Influenza-positive patients were more likely to be older, female, pregnant, and have chronic condition(s) (all p\u003C0.05). Among them, 53 (2%) died, and death was associated with older age, five or more days from symptom onset to hospitalization, chronic condition(s), and influenza A (all p\u003C0.05).

In this study, we elucidated the pathways through which H5N1 enters human lung carcinoma cell line A549. We first proved that H5N1 can enter A549 cells via endocytosis, as lysosomotropic agents, such as bafilomycin A1 and chloroquine, can rescue H5N1-induced A549 cell death. By using specific inhibitors, and siRNAs that target the clathrin pathway, we further found that H5N1 could enter A549 cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, while inhibitors targeting caveolae-mediated endocytosis could not inhibit H5N1 cell entry.

A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was fitted to quantify the province-specific associations between meteorological variables and the daily cases of COVID-19 during the study periods. In the model, the 14-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) of AT and ARH, and their interaction were included with time trend and health-seeking behavior adjusted. Their spatial distributions were visualized. AT and ARH showed significantly negative associations with COVID-19 with a significant interaction between them (0.04, 95% confidence interval: 0.004\u20130.07) in Hubei. Every 1 \u00B0C increase in the AT led to a decrease in the daily confirmed cases by 36% to 57% when ARH was in the range from 67% to 85.5%. Every 1% increase in ARH led to a decrease in the daily confirmed cases by 11% to 22% when AT was in the range from 5.04 \u00B0C to 8.2 \u00B0C.

Since the discovery of SARS-like coronaviruses in Chinese horseshoe bats, attempts to isolate a SL-CoV from bats have failed and attempts to isolate other bat-borne viruses in various mammalian cell lines have been similarly unsuccessful. New stable bat cell lines are needed to help with these investigations and as tools to assist in the study of bat immunology and virus-host interactions. METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: Black flying foxes (Pteropus alecto) were captured from the wild and transported live to the laboratory for primary cell culture preparation using a variety of different methods and culture media. Primary cells were successfully cultured from 20 different organs. Cell immortalisation can occur spontaneously, however we used a retroviral system to immortalise cells via the transfer and stable production of the Simian virus 40 Large T antigen and the human telomerase reverse transcriptase protein. Initial infection experiments with both cloned and uncloned cell lines using Hendra and Nipah viruses demonstrated varying degrees of infection efficiency between the different cell lines, although it was possible to infect cells in all tissue types. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The approaches developed and optimised in this study should be applicable to bats of other species. We are in the process of generating further cell lines from a number of different bat species using the methodology established in this study.","publish_time":"2009-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crameri, Gary; Todd, Shawn; Grimley, Samantha; McEachern, Jennifer A.; Marsh, Glenn A.; Smith, Craig; Tachedjian, Mary; De Jong, Carol; Virtue, Elena R.; Yu, Meng; Bulach, Dieter; Liu, Jun-Ping; Michalski, Wojtek P.; Middleton, Deborah; Field, Hume E.; Wang, Lin-Fa","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/08e78c0222e84457195ccefb2e371f1847670436.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2788226.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0008266; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20011515/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs3MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different cell lines","uncloned cell lines","New stable bat cell lines","Cell immortalisation","Hendra virus","various mammalian cell lines","Simian virus","Ebola virus","primary cell culture preparation","number of different bat species","study of bat immunology","Nipah viruses","different organs","Primary cells","virus-host interactions","number of new","variety of different methods","METHODOLOGY","Chinese horseshoe bats","emerging zoonotic viruses","stable production","culture media","Initial infection experiments","varying degrees of infection efficiency","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Large T antigen","laboratory","Black flying foxes","suspected natural reservoir hosts","human telomerase reverse transcriptase protein","Pteropus alecto","FINDINGS","coronaviruses","transfer","discovery of SARS","approaches","BACKGROUND","tissue types","retroviral system","SL-CoV","CONCLUSIONS","SIGNIFICANCE","tools","process","investigations"],"language":"en"},

However, vaccine development for this pathogen lags behind as immunity associated with protection is currently largely unknown. In this study, an immunoinformatics-driven genome-wide screening strategy of vaccine targets was performed to thoroughly screen the vital and effective dominant immunogens against MERS-CoV. Conservancy and population coverage analysis of the epitopes were done by the Immune Epitope Database. The results showed that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of MERS-CoV might be a better protective immunogen with high conservancy and potential eliciting both neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses compared with spike (S) protein. Further, the B-cell, helper T-cell and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes were screened and mapped to the N protein. A total of 15 linear and 10 conformal B-cell epitopes that may induce protective neutralizing antibodies were obtained. Additionally, a total of 71 peptides with 9-mer core sequence were identified as helper T-cell epitopes, and 34 peptides were identified as CTL epitopes. Based on the maximum HLA binding alleles, top 10 helper T-cell epitopes and CTL epitopes that may elicit protective cellular immune responses against MERS-CoV were selected as MERS vaccine candidates. Population coverage analysis showed that the putative helper T-cell epitopes and CTL epitopes could cover the vast majority of the population in 15 geographic regions considered where vaccine would be employed. The B- and T-cell stimulation potentials of the screened epitopes is to be further validated for their efficient use as vaccines against MERS-CoV. Collectively, this study provides novel vaccine target candidates and may prompt further development of vaccines against MERS-CoV and other emerging infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2015-12-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Jiandong; Zhang, Jing; Li, Sijin; Sun, Jing; Teng, Yumei; Wu, Meini; Li, Jianfan; Li, Yanhan; Hu, Ningzhu; Wang, Haixuan; Hu, Yunzhang","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a138ff680ae9e158019717356e8fcab523e7cad2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4671582.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0144475; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26641892/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs3NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTL","HLA"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["CTL epitopes","MERS-CoV","putative helper T-cell epitopes","screened epitopes","T-cell responses","conformal B-cell epitopes","protein of MERS","MERS vaccine candidates","T-cell stimulation potentials","vaccine development","cytotoxic T lymphocyte","N protein","protective neutralizing antibodies","population coverage analysis","novel vaccine target candidates","protective cellular immune responses","peptides","study","development of vaccines","total","better protective immunogen","potential eliciting","pandemic potential","high conservancy","immunoinformatics-driven genome-wide screening strategy of vaccine targets","Immune Epitope Database","major worldwide threat","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","effective dominant immunogens","spike","mer core sequence","vast majority","maximum HLA binding alleles","public health","nucleocapsid","emerging infectious diseases","geographic regions","efficient use","pathogen","protection","immunity","results"],"language":"en"},

However, proof for the existence of such factors has been limited and mainly anecdotal. Therefore, we sought evidence for genetic susceptibility to FIP using feline high density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Birman cats were chosen for GWAS because they are highly inbred and suffer a high incidence of FIP. DNA from 38 Birman cats that died of FIP and 161 healthy cats from breeders in Denmark and USA were selected for genotyping using 63K SNPs distributed across the feline genome. Danish and American Birman cats were closely related and the populations were therefore combined and analyzed in two manners: 1) all cases (FIP) vs. all controls (healthy) regardless of age, and 2) cases 1\u20131/2 years of age and younger (most susceptible) vs. controls 2 years of age and older (most resistant). GWAS of the second cohort was most productive in identifying significant genome-wide associations between case and control cats. Four peaks of association with FIP susceptibility were identified, with two being identified on both analyses. Five candidate genes ELMO1, RRAGA, TNFSF10, ERAP1 and ERAP2, all relevant to what is known about FIP virus pathogenesis, were identified but no single association was fully concordant with the disease phenotype.

The outbreak has been declared a pandemic by the WHO on Mar 11, 2020. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterise our model for SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.","publish_time":"2020-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Neher, Richard A; Dyrdak, Robert; Druelle, Valentin; Hodcroft, Emma B; Albert, Jan","journal":"Swiss medical weekly","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32176808/; https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2020.20224","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["consistent seasonal variation","combination of seasonal variation","substantial variation","transmission rate variation","SARS-CoV","likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation","Seasonal forcing","plausible parameters","variable parameters","global transmission","model","Data","infection control measures","infection control efforts","prolonged pandemic wave","Simulations of different scenarios","lower prevalence","incidence rate","larger peak","small peak","temperate regions","subpopulations of different size","Northern Hemisphere","endemic coronaviruses","better preparation of health care systems","HKU1","window of opportunity","migration rates","given time","routine diagnostics","OC43","transient reductions","transmissibility","NL63","winter","monitoring","novel coronavirus","confirmed infections","fatalities","uncertainty","Wuhan","China","account","outbreak","epidemic"],"language":"en"},

Some of the first actions taken by governments are the closing of schools. The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce the number of cases and, ultimately, mortality comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the effect of school closure on the health-care labour force. The potential benefits from school closures need to be weighed against costs of health-care worker absenteeism associated with additional child-care obligations. In this study, we aimed to measure child-care obligations for US health-care workers arising from school closures when these are used as a social distancing measure. We then assessed how important the contribution of health-care workers would have to be in reducing mortality for their absenteeism due to child-care obligations to undo the benefits of school closures in reducing the number of cases. Methods For this modelling analysis, we used data from the monthly releases of the US Current Population Survey to characterise the family structure and probable within-household child-care options of US health-care workers. We accounted for the occupation within the health-care sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the health-care workforce that are most exposed to child-care obligations from school closures. We used these estimates to identify the critical level at which the importance of health-care labour supply in increasing the survival probability of a patient with COVID-19 would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality. Findings Between January, 2018, and January, 2020, the US Current Population Survey included information on more than 3\u00B71 million individuals across 1\u00B73 million households. We found that the US health-care sector has some of the highest child-care obligations in the USA, with 28\u00B78% (95% CI 28\u00B75\u201329\u00B71) of the health-care workforce needing to provide care for children aged 3\u201312 years. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling aged 13 years or older can provide child care, 15\u00B70% (14\u00B78\u201315\u00B72) of the health-care workforce would still be in need of child care during a school closure. We observed substantial variation within the health-care system. We estimated that, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15\u00B70% case reduction from school closings and 2\u00B70% baseline mortality rate, a 15\u00B70% decrease in the health-care labour force would need to decrease the survival probability per percent health-care worker lost by 17\u00B76% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. Our model estimates that if the infection mortality rate of COVID-19 increases from 2\u00B700% to 2\u00B735% when the health-care workforce declines by 15\u00B70%, school closures could lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. Interpretation School closures come with many trade-offs, and can create unintended child-care obligations. Our results suggest that the potential contagion prevention from school closures needs to be carefully weighted with the potential loss of health-care workers from the standpoint of reducing cumulative mortality due to COVID-19, in the absence of mitigating measures.

METHODS: In a retrospective study of all laboratory-confirmed hMPV infections treated at our institution between April 2012 and May 2015, we determined clinical characteristics, risk factors for progression to LRI, treatment, and outcomes in patients with cancer. RESULTS: We identified 181 hMPV infections in 90 (50%) patients with hematologic malignancies (HM), 57 (31%) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients, and 34 patients (19%) with solid tumors. Most patients (92%) had a community-acquired infection, presented with URI (67%), and 43% developed LRI (59 presented with LRI and 19 progressed from URI to LRI). On multivariable analysis, an underlying HM (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.11(1.12-8.64); P=0.029), nosocomial infection (aOR, 26.9 (2.79-259.75); P=0.004), and hypoxia (SpO2 \u2264 92%) at presentation (aOR, 9.61(1.98-46.57); P = 0.005) were independent factors associated with LRI. All-cause mortality at 30 days from hMPV diagnosis was low (4%) and patients with LRI had a 10% mortality rate at day 30 from diagnosis; whereas, patients with URI had 0% mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: hMPV infections in patients with cancer may cause significant morbidity, especially for those with underlying HM who may develop an LRI. Despite high morbidity and the lack of directed antiviral therapy for hMPV infections, mortality at day 30 from this infection remained low in this studied population.","publish_time":"2017-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chaer, Firas El; Shah, Dimpy P.; Kmeid, Joumana; Ariza-Heredia, Ella; Hosing, Chitra M.; Mulanovich, Victor; Chemaly, Roy F.","journal":"Cancer","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d72a0abdbcb41af16e34e296132082188a828f6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5459658.xml.json","url":"https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/cncr.30599; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28178369/; https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.30599","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LRI","URI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LRI","hMPV infections","immunocompromised patients","hMPV diagnosis","URI","mortality rate","cancer","aOR","underlying HM","All-cause mortality","lower respiratory tract infections","nosocomial infection","risk factors","clinical burden","clinical characteristics","independent factors","significant morbidity","high morbidity","progression","days","antiviral therapy","adjusted odds ratio","HCT","recipients","lack","treatment","hematopoietic cell transplantation","Human metapneumovirus","laboratory","outcomes","retrospective study","multivariable analysis","BACKGROUND","studied population","hematologic malignancies","CONCLUSIONS","SpO2","METHODS","hypoxia","presentation","institution","RESULTS","solid tumors","community"],"language":"en"},

In this study, the pathways utilized by two such viruses, herpes simplex virus type 1 and mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM, were compared using in situ hybridization following inoculation into either the nasal cavity or the main olfactory bulb of the mouse. The results indicate that both viruses spread to infect a unique and only partially overlapping set of connections of the main olfactory bulb. Both quantitative and qualitative differences were observed in the patterns of infection of known primary and secondary main olfactory bulb connections. Using immunohistochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase combined with in situ hybridization, it was shown that only herpes simplex virus infected noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus. In contrast, both viruses infected dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, although mouse hepatitis virus produced a more widespread infection in the A10 group, as well as infecting A8 and A9. The results suggest that differential virus uptake in specific neurotransmitter systems contributes to the pattern of viral spread, although other factors, such as differences in access to particular synapses on infected cells and differences in the distribution of the cellular receptor for the two viruses, are also likely to be important. The data show that neural tracing with different viruses may define unique neural pathways from a site of inoculation. The data also demonstrate that two viruses can enter the brain via the olfactory system and localize to different structures, suggesting that neurological diseases involving disparate regions of the brain could be caused by different viruses, even if entry occurred at a common site.","publish_time":"1993-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barnett, E.

Emodin has been used as a traditional Chinese medicine for over 2000 years and is still present in various herbal preparations. Emerging evidence indicates that emodin possesses a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties, including anticancer, hepatoprotective, antiinflammatory, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. However, emodin could also lead to hepatotoxicity, kidney toxicity and reproductive toxicity, particularly in high doses and with long\u2010term use.

The capsid protein open reading frame 2 (ORF2) is known to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress in ORF2 expressing cells. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study we found that HEV ORF2 activates the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). ORF2 stimulates the CHOP promoter mainly through AARE (amino acid response elements) and to a minor extent the ERSE (endoplasmic reticulum stress response elements). Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) protein binds and activates the AARE regulatory sites of the CHOP promoter. ORF2 expression also leads to increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2\u03B1) that in turn initiates the translation of ATF4 mRNA. The pro-apoptotic gene CHOP is an important trigger to initiate endoplasmic reticulum stress induced apoptosis. However, the activation of CHOP by ORF2 in this study did not induce apoptosis, nor did BCL2-associated X protein (Bax) translocate to mitochondria. Microarray analysis revealed an ORF2 specific increased expression of chaperones Hsp72, Hsp70B\u0027, and co-chaperone Hsp40. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and in silico molecular docking analysis suggests that HEV ORF2 interacts with Hsp72. In addition, Hsp72 shows nuclear accumulation in ORF2 expressing cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data provide new insight into simultaneously occurring counter-acting effects of HEV ORF2 that may be part of a strategy to prevent host suicide before completion of the viral replication cycle.","publish_time":"2011-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"John, Lijo; Thomas, Saijo; Herchenr\u00F6der, Ottmar; P\u00FCtzer, Brigitte M.; Schaefer, Stephan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2df184bde7ca6083d8a33a2b1ce05e302685dc72.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3179511.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21966512/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0025378","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs5ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HEV","CHOP","ERSE","AARE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ORF2 expression","CHOP promoter","counter-acting effects of HEV ORF2","ORF2 specific increased expression of chaperones Hsp72","activation of CHOP","pro-apoptotic gene CHOP","endoplasmic reticulum stress response elements","protein binds","endoplasmic reticulum stress induced apoptosis","EBP homologous protein","Co-IP","Co-immunoprecipitation","cells","study","BCL2-associated X protein","Hepatitis E virus","co-chaperone Hsp40","capsid protein open reading frame","amino acid response elements","Microarray analysis","transcription factor","acute hepatitis","increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor","AARE regulatory sites","translation of ATF4 mRNA","silico molecular docking analysis","non-enveloped plus-strand RNA virus","important trigger","Hsp70B","ERSE","completion","alpha","minor extent","turn","eIF2\u03B1","Bax","nuclear accumulation","host suicide","new insight","SIGNIFICANCE","data","viral replication cycle","BACKGROUND","strategy","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","addition","METHODOLOGY","CONCLUSIONS","mitochondria"],"language":"en"},

In hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis, the analysis of gene expression profiles from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) may be useful for the rapid identification of etiological factors, as well as for developing diagnostic tests, and elucidating pathogenic mechanisms triggered by different viral agents. In this study we conducted a comparative global gene expression analysis of PBMC obtained from two groups of infants with acute viral bronchiolitis who were infected by HRSV (HRSV group) or by HRV (HRV group). We employed a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) which allows the identification of transcriptional modules and their correlations with HRSV or HRV groups. This approach permitted the identification of distinct transcription modules for the HRSV and HRV groups. According to these data, the immune response to HRSV infection\u2014comparatively to HRV infection\u2014was more associated to the activation of the interferon gamma signaling pathways and less related to neutrophil activation mechanisms. Moreover, we also identified host-response molecular markers that could be used for etiopathogenic diagnosis. These results may contribute to the development of new tests for respiratory virus identification. The finding that distinct transcriptional profiles are associated to specific host responses to HRSV or to HRV may also contribute to the elucidation of the pathogenic mechanisms triggered by different respiratory viruses, paving the way for new therapeutic strategies.","publish_time":"2019-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vieira, Sandra E.; Bando, Silvia Y.; de Paulis, Milena; Oliveira, Danielle B.

Measures to exclude pathogens, prevent cross-contamination, and actively reduce the pathogenic load of feed and ingredients are being developed. However, research thus far has focused on the role of chemicals or thermal treatment to reduce the RNA in the actual feedstuffs, and has not addressed potential residual contamination within the manufacturing facility that may lead to continuous contamination of finished feeds. The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the use of a standardized protocol to sanitize an animal feed manufacturing facility contaminated with PEDV. Environmental swabs were collected throughout the facility during the manufacturing of a swine diet inoculated with PEDV. To monitor facility contamination of the virus, swabs were collected at: 1) baseline prior to inoculation, 2) after production of the inoculated feed, 3) after application of a quaternary ammonium-glutaraldehyde blend cleaner, 4) after application of a sodium hypochlorite sanitizing solution, and 5) after facility heat-up to 60\u00B0C for 48 hours. Decontamination step, surface, type, zone and their interactions were all found to impact the quantity of detectable PEDV RNA (P \u003C 0.05). As expected, all samples collected from equipment surfaces contained PEDV RNA after production of the contaminated feed. Additionally, the majority of samples collected from non-direct feed contact surfaces were also positive for PEDV RNA after the production of the contaminated feed, emphasizing the potential role dust plays in cross-contamination of pathogen throughout a manufacturing facility. Application of the cleaner, sanitizer, and heat were effective at reducing PEDV genomic material (P \u003C 0.05), but did not completely eliminate it.","publish_time":"2017-01-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huss, Anne R.; Schumacher, Loni L.; Cochrane, Roger A.; Poulsen, Elizabeth; Bai, Jianfa; Woodworth, Jason C.; Dritz, Steve S.; Stark, Charles R.; Jones, Cassandra K.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40a57ffe8adda95a13b552b630b13d76344f666c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5242487.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28099453/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0169612","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs5OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus","PEDV","PEDV RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["facility contamination","contaminated feed","animal feed manufacturing facility","inoculated feed","livestock feed","facility heat","cross-contamination","quantity of detectable PEDV RNA","production","non-direct feed","application","PEDV genomic material","pathogenic load of feed","potential residual contamination","continuous contamination of finished feeds","ingredients","potential role dust","equipment surfaces","role of chemicals","virus of wide scale concern","Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus","majority of samples","Environmental swabs","quaternary ammonium-glutaraldehyde blend cleaner","possible transmission","type","standardized protocol","sodium hypochlorite sanitizing solution","zone","thermal treatment","sanitizer","Decontamination step","swine diet","use","pathogens","actual feedstuffs","experiment","interactions","Measures","inoculation","purpose","hours","baseline","research"],"language":"en"},

The empirical results from both approaches are consistent and indicate that the numbers of affected cases have a significant impact on SARS-affected countries but not on Avian Flu-affected countries.

We review different biomarkers to evaluate if they are able to predict clinical outcomes and correlate with the severity of COVID-19 disease. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was carried out to identify relevant articles using six different databases. Keywords to refine the search included \u2018COVID-19\u2019, \u2018SARS-CoV2\u2019, \u2018Biomarkers\u2019, among others. Only studies which reported data on pre-defined outcomes were included. KEY FINDINGS: Thirty-four relevant articles were identified which reviewed the following biomarkers: C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, interleukin-6, lactate dehydrogenase, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, D-dimer, cardiac troponin, renal biomarkers, lymphocytes and platelet count. Of these, all but two, showed significantly higher levels in patients with severe complications of COVID-19 infection compared to their non-severe counterparts. Lymphocytes and platelet count showed significantly lower levels in severe patients compared to non-severe patients. SIGNIFICANCE: Although research is still in its early stages, the discovery of how different biomarkers behave during the course of the disease could help clinicians in identifying severe disease earlier and subsequently improve prognosis. Nevertheless, we urge for more research across the globe to corroborate these findings.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kermali, Muhammed; Khalsa, Raveena Kaur; Pillai, Kiran; Ismail, Zahra; Harky, Amer","journal":"Life Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eee1f875fb06dd47be76cd3421724fbf3932434e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7219356.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.117788; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405093/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024320520305361; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320520305361?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe disease","different biomarkers","non-severe patients","severe complications of COVID","non-severe counterparts","renal biomarkers","following biomarkers","severity of COVID","lymphocytes","platelet count","relevant articles","different databases","research","lower levels","higher levels","clinical outcomes","KEY FINDINGS","systematic review","pre-defined outcomes","cardiac troponin","C-reactive protein","D-dimer","infection","interleukin","lymphocyte ratio","serum amyloid","neutrophil","discovery","course","clinicians","lactate dehydrogenase","early stages","studies","literature","SARS-CoV2","countries","Biomarkers\u2019","METHODS","pandemic","globe","prognosis","confirmed people","Keywords","SIGNIFICANCE"],"language":"en"},

In this review, we discuss the discovery, antiviral activity and mechanism of action of such peptides. While peptide entry inhibitors have been discovered by a wide variety of approaches (structure-based, accidental, intentional, rational and brute force) we show here that they share a common physical chemical property: they are at least somewhat hydrophobic and/or amphipathic and have a propensity to interact with membrane interfaces. We propose that this propensity drives a shared mechanism of action for many peptide entry inhibitors, involving direct interactions with viral and cellular membranes, as well as interactions with the complex hydrophobic protein/lipid interfaces that are exposed, at least transiently, during virus\u2013cell fusion. By interacting simultaneously with the membrane interfaces and other critical hydrophobic surfaces, we hypothesize that peptide entry inhibitors can act by changing the physical chemistry of the membranes, and the fusion protein interfaces bridging them, and by doing so interfere with the fusion of cellular and viral membranes. Based on this idea, we propose that an approach that focuses on the interfacial hydrophobicity of putative entry inhibitors could lead to the efficient discovery of novel, broad-spectrum viral entry inhibitors.

While some viruses simply cause symptoms of the common cold, many respiratory viruses induce severe bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and even death following infection. Despite the immense clinical burden, the majority of the most common pulmonary viruses lack long-lasting efficacious vaccines. Nearly all current vaccination strategies are designed to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies, which prevent severe disease following a subsequent infection. However, the mucosal antibody response to many respiratory viruses is not long-lasting and declines with age. CD8 T cells are critical for mediating clearance following many acute viral infections in the lung. In addition, memory CD8 T cells are capable of providing protection against secondary infections. Therefore, the combined induction of virus-specific CD8 T cells and antibodies may provide optimal protective immunity.

Objective We sought to determine whether maternal asthma is associated with higher odds of infant respiratory tract infection with rhinovirus versus RSV and increased infection severity. Methods Mother-infant dyads were enrolled from 2004-2008 during an infant respiratory tract infection (104 with rhinovirus and 279 with RSV). Mothers were classified into mutually exclusive groups (atopic asthma, nonatopic asthma, and no asthma). We determined viral cause using PCR and the severity of the infant\u2019s respiratory tract infection using the bronchiolitis severity score. Adjusted relative odds of maternal asthma with viral cause were calculated by using logistic regression. Proportional odds models assessed the association of maternal asthma and infant infection severity. Results Infants with a mother with atopic asthma compared with infants whose mothers did not have asthma were more likely to have rhinovirus versus RSV infection (adjusted odds ratio, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.19-4.90). Similarly, among infants with rhinovirus, having a mother with atopic asthma was associated with increased infection severity (adjusted odds ratio, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.21-7.98). This relationship was not seen among infants with RSV. Conclusions Clinically significant rhinovirus infection during infancy was more strongly associated with having a mother with atopic asthma than clinically significant RSV infection. Having a mother with atopic asthma was associated with increased severity of infant rhinovirus but not RSV infections. Infants with rhinovirus were more likely to have a familial atopic predisposition, which might partly explain the subsequent increased asthma risk.","publish_time":"2012-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carroll, Kecia N.; Gebretsadik, Tebeb; Minton, Patricia; Woodward, Kimberly; Liu, Zhouwen; Miller, E.

Highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza viruses preferentially infect alveolar type II pneumocytes in human lung. However, it is unknown whether this cellular tropism contributes to high viral virulence because the primary target cells of other influenza viruses have not been systematically studied. Methods. We provide the first comparison of the replication, tropism, and cytokine induction of human, highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus subtype H5N1 and other animal influenza A viruses in primary human lung organ cultures. Results. Subytpe H5N1 and human-adapted subtype H1N1 and H3N2 viruses replicated efficiently in the lung tissue, whereas classic swine and low-pathogenicity avian viruses propagated only poorly. Nevertheless, all viruses examined were detected almost exclusively in type II pneumocytes, with a minor involvement of alveolar macrophages. Infection with avian viruses that have a low and high pathogenicity provoked a pronounced induction of cytokines and chemokines, while human and pandemic H1N1-2009 viruses triggered only weak responses. Conclusions. These findings show that differences in the pathogenic potential of influenza A viruses in the human lung cannot be attributed to a distinct cellular tropism. Rather, high or low viral pathogenicity is associated with a strain-specific capacity to productively replicate in type II pneumocytes and to cope with the induced cytokine response.","publish_time":"2012-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weinheimer, Viola K.; Becher, Anne; T\u00F6nnies, Mario; Holland, Gudrun; Knepper, Jessica; Bauer, Torsten T.; Schneider, Paul; Neudecker, Jens; R\u00FCckert, Jens C.; Szymanski, Kolja; Temmesfeld-Wollbrueck, Bettina; Gruber, Achim D.; Bannert, Norbert; Suttorp, Norbert; Hippenstiel, Stefan; Wolff, Thorsten; Hocke, Andreas C.","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b129b5289f43cb8d5eb905d3ab57f531dbc647f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107318.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22829640/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jis455","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsxOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H3N2 viruses","pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza viruses","low-pathogenicity avian viruses","pathogenic avian influenza","cytokine induction of human","animal influenza","pathogenic potential of influenza","high pathogenicity","pneumocytes","primary human lung organ cultures","human-adapted subtype H1N1","low viral pathogenicity","lung tissue","alveolar type","virus subtype H5N1","Subytpe H5N1","high viral virulence","distinct cellular tropism","pandemic H1N1","primary target cells","pronounced induction of cytokines","induced cytokine response","minor involvement of alveolar macrophages","classic swine","chemokines","replication","differences","strain-specific capacity","weak responses","comparison","findings","Infection","Background","Methods","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic. The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The data will be used for future reference. Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques. The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China. In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels. Most respondents spent 20\u201324 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%). Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p \u003C 0.05). Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p \u003C 0.05). Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Cuiyan; Pan, Riyu; Wan, Xiaoyang; Tan, Yilin; Xu, Linkang; Ho, Cyrus S.; Ho, Roger C.","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7084952.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17051729; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32155789/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsxOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["COVID","levels of psychological impact","lower psychological impact","greater psychological impact","severe anxiety symptoms","lower level of psychological impact","psychological interventions","psychological resilience","severe stress levels","adverse psychological impacts","better mental health status","accurate health information","lower levels of stress","health information available","depression","severe depressive symptoms","respondents","Impact of Event Scale","Stress Scale","higher levels of stress","poor self-rated health status","specific physical symptoms","psychiatric symptoms","mental health of vulnerable groups","epidemic","China","local outbreak situation","student status","additional information","online survey","public health emergency of international concern","demographic data","Research data","study","particular precautionary measures","general public","initial phase","initial stage","treatment","coryza","evidence-driven strategies","myalgia","days","hand hygiene","Female gender","IES-R","dizziness","snowball sampling techniques","history","challenge","knowledge","concerns","half","coronavirus disease","mask","factors","cities","respect","DASS","home","Background","Conclusions","future reference","findings","family members","Results","aim","total","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Frequent points of mutations and recombination events in the S1 gene region, result in the emergence of new IBVs variants circulating in the form of several serotypes/genotypes that can be partially or poorly neutralized by current vaccines. IBV is well studied worldwide, nevertheless in African countries epidemiological and scientific data are poor and not updated. This review aims to give a current overview of IBV situation, to establish evolutionary relationship between the African variants and to list some of the potential measures to control IBV in Africa. Three S1 gene hypervariable regions were studied and compared to the reference genotypes/serotypes that found emerging in African regions. This comparison was based on phylogenetic trees, nucleotide and amino-acid sequence analysis. It clearly appears that IBV variants reported in Africa, display a low genetic relationship between them and with the majority of the reference strains emerging in neighboring countries, except the case of variants from Libya and Egypt that show a high relatedness. Also the Massachusetts serotypes were the most prevalent co-circulating with both serotypes, Italy02 type in Morocco and Qx-like genotype in South part of the African continent. In order to control the IBV variants in African regions, an efficient vaccination strategy program should be implemented.","publish_time":"2016-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khataby, Khadija; Souiri, Amal; Kasmi, Yassine; Loutfi, Chafiqa; Ennaji, My Mustapha","journal":"The Journal of Basic \u0026 Applied Zoology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27192a8b76ae5c56d6e0b3bebca628c45fb31c3a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104975.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2090989616300200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288944/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090989616300200; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jobaz.2016.08.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":["Libya","Massachusetts","South","Africa"],"keyphrases":["IBV variants","African variants","African regions","case of variants","African continent","African countries epidemiological","Massachusetts serotypes","current overview of IBV situation","emergence of new IBVs variants","S1 gene hypervariable regions","reference genotypes","S1 gene region","poultry industry","neighboring countries","evolutionary relationship","reference strains","current vaccines","major viral pathogen of commercial poultry","major economic losses","prevalent co-circulating","low genetic relationship","recombination events","nucleotide","Italy02 type","Qx","Morocco","Egypt","ages","chickens","scientific data","efficient vaccination strategy program","form","amino-acid sequence analysis","phylogenetic trees","Frequent points of mutations","Abstract Infectious bronchitis virus","Libya","potential measures","list","majority","high relatedness","comparison","review","order"],"language":"en"},

EVD, an emerging infectious disease, can create fear and panic among patients, contacts and relatives, which could be a risk factor for psychological distress. Psychological distress among this subgroup could have public health implication for control of EVD, because of potential effects on patient management and contact tracing. We determined the Prevalence, pattern and factors associated with psychological distress among survivors and contacts of EVD and their relatives. METHODS: In a descriptive cross sectional study, we used General Health Questionnaire to assess psychological distress and Oslo Social Support Scale to assess social support among 117 participants who survived EVD, listed as EVD contacts or their relatives at Ebola Emergency Operation Center in Lagos, Nigeria. Factors associated with psychological distress were determined using chi square/odds ratio and adjusted odds ratio. RESULTS: The mean age and standard deviation of participants was 34 \u002B/ - 9.6 years. Of 117 participants, 78 (66.7 %) were females, 77 (65.8 %) had a tertiary education and 45 (38.5 %) were health workers. Most frequently occurring psychological distress were inability to concentrate (37.6 %) and loss of sleep over worry (33.3 %). Losing a relation to EVD outbreak (OR = 6.0, 95 % CI, 1.2\u201332.9) was significantly associated with feeling unhappy or depressed while being a health worker was protective (OR = 0.4, 95 % CI, 0.2\u20130.9). Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) showed losing a relation (AOR = 5.7, 95 % CI, 1.2\u201328.0) was a predictor of \u201Cfeeling unhappy or depressed\u201D, loss of a relation (AOR = 10.1, 95 % CI, 1.7\u201360.7) was a predictor of inability to concentrate. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors and contacts of EVD and their relations develop psychological distress. Development of psychological distress could be predicted by loss of family member. It is recommended that psychiatrists and other mental health specialists be part of case management teams. The clinical teams managing EVD patients should be trained on recognition of common psychological distress among patients. A mental health specialist should review contacts being monitored for EVD for psychological distress or disorders.","publish_time":"2015-08-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mohammed, Abdulaziz; Sheikh, Taiwo Lateef; Gidado, Saheed; Poggensee, Gabriele; Nguku, Patrick; Olayinka, Adebola; Ohuabunwo, Chima; Waziri, Ndadilnasiya; Shuaib, Faisal; Adeyemi, Joseph; Uzoma, Ogbonna; Ahmed, Abubakar; Doherty, Funmi; Nyanti, Sarah Beysolow; Nzuki, Charles Kyalo; Nasidi, Abdulsalami; Oyemakinde, Akin; Oguntimehin, Olukayode; Abdus-salam, Ismail Adeshina; Obiako, Reginald O.","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d38f954f1b3937ead02257e75454dd9ad2ec0ce6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4550041.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26307047/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-015-2167-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ebola Viral Disease","EVD","General Health Questionnaire","Oslo Social Support Scale","Ebola Emergency Operation Center"],"locations":["Guinea","Liberia","Sierra Leone","Senegal","Nigeria"],"keyphrases":["contacts of EVD","EVD contacts","Development of psychological distress","EVD patients","EVD outbreak","control of EVD","recognition of common psychological distress","health workers","mental health specialists","relatives","AOR","General Health Questionnaire","adjusted odds ratio","public health implication","survivors","Nigeria","factors","loss of sleep","predictor of inability","outbreak of Ebola Viral Disease","case management teams","standard deviation of participants","loss of family member","Oslo Social Support Scale","patient management","clinical teams","emerging infectious disease","Ebola Emergency Operation Center","Liberia","potential effects","West African countries of Guinea","chi square","fear","Sierra Leone","descriptive cross sectional study","mean age","Lagos","panic","subgroup","contact tracing","Senegal","pattern","relations","risk factor","confirmed cases","deaths","METHODS","RESULTS","psychiatrists","CONCLUSIONS","disorders","Prevalence","worry","tertiary education","BACKGROUND","years","females"],"language":"en"},

It is endemic to China and Southeastern Asia. The case-fatality ratio (CFR) or the rate of permanent psychiatric sequelae is 30% among symptomatic patients. There were no reported local JEV human cases between 2006 and 2010 in Hong Kong, but it was followed by a resurgence of cases from 2011 to 2017. The mechanism behind this \u201Cskip-and-resurgence\u201D patterns is unclear. This work aims to reveal the mechanism behind the \u201Cskip-and-resurgence\u201D patterns using mathematical modelling and likelihood-based inference techniques. We found that pig-to-pig transmission increases the size of JEV epidemics but is unlikely to maintain the same level of transmission among pigs. The disappearance of JEV human cases in 2006\u20132010 could be explained by a sudden reduction of the population of farm pigs as a result of the implementation of the voluntary \u201Cpig-rearing licence surrendering\u201D policy. The resurgence could be explained by of a new strain in 2011, which increased the transmissibility of the virus or the spill-over ratio from reservoir to host or both.","publish_time":"2018-10-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Shi; Lou, Yijun; Chiu, Alice P.Y.; He, Daihai","journal":"J Theor Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d18a60b16db8129a14683368ef6be0ff66e36cd9.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9536b4578ed270b4a0d0d94f518ba6dbfc5db8eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094098.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29792875/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002251931830256X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002251931830256X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2018.05.017","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JEV"],"locations":["China","Southeastern Asia","Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["resurgence of cases","disappearance of JEV human cases","pig transmission","reported local JEV human cases","size of JEV epidemics","patterns","skip","mechanism","population of farm pigs","pig-rearing licence","Japanese encephalitis virus","level of transmission","case-fatality ratio","mathematical modelling","likelihood-based inference techniques","CFR","result","rate of permanent psychiatric sequelae","Ardeid birds","Culex mosquitoes","spill","implementation","sudden reduction","zoonotic mosquito","China","Southeastern Asia","policy","symptomatic patients","reservoir","transmissibility","Hong Kong","new strain","work"],"language":"en"},

They are the largest group of viruses causing respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. Morphologically, CoVs are enveloped viruses containing a non-segmented positive-sense, single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses. CoVs are categorized into four important genera that include Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. A novel member of human CoV that has recently emerged in Wuhan, China, is now formally named as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). This is a unique strain of RNA viruses that have not been previously observed in humans. The virus has wide host adaptability and is capable of causing severe diseases in humans, masked palm civets, mice, dogs, cats, camels, pigs, chickens, and bats. The SARS-CoV-2 typically causes respiratory and gastrointestinal sickness in both humans and animals. It can be transmitted through aerosols and direct/indirect contact, as well as during medical cases and laboratory sample handling. Specific structural proteins, which might be found on the surface of the virus, play an important role in the pathogenesis and development of the complications. The disease is characterized by distinct medical signs and symptoms that include high fever, chills, cough, and shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing. The infected people may also present with other symptoms such as diarrhea, myalgia, fatigue, expectoration, and hemoptysis. It is important from the public health and economic point of view as it affects the growth of the country, which is majorly attributed to the restriction in the movement of the people and the cost associated with the control and prevention of the disease. Since there is no specific therapeutic intervention nor a vaccine available against the virus, supportive management and treatment with non-specific therapeutic agents (repurposed drugs) may provide relief to the patients. Some preventive strategies of the disease include blocking the routes of transmission of the infections, disinfection of instruments used during medical case handling, using personal protective equipment, proper and early diagnosis of the disease, avoiding contact with the sick patients, and quarantine of the infected/exposed people.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pal, Mahendra; Berhanu, Gemechu; Desalegn, Chaltu; Kandi, Venkataramana","journal":"Cureus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/951a8b171fc57f71bda6115e3c55c177eebbee9a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7182166.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7423; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32337143/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["humans","CoVs","enveloped viruses","infected people","SARS-CoV","medical case handling","medical cases","symptoms","largest group of viruses","important role","important genera","gastrointestinal infections","unique strain of RNA viruses","exposed people","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","distinct medical signs","specific therapeutic intervention","severe diseases","gastrointestinal sickness","indirect contact","genus Coronavirus","novel member of human CoV","sick patients","non-specific therapeutic agents","laboratory sample handling","Specific structural proteins","personal protective equipment","dogs","mice","masked palm civets","treatment","supportive management","vaccine available","non-segmented positive-sense","cats","early diagnosis","repurposed drugs","high fever","pigs","cough","camels","order Nidovirales","chills","Betacoronavirus","public health","ribonucleic acid","disinfection of instruments","quarantine","economic point of view","shortness of breath","wide host adaptability","fatigue","expectoration","chickens","diarrhea","myalgia","cost","pathogenesis","development","Alphacoronavirus","family of Coronaviridae","routes of transmission","Gammacoronavirus","difficulty","breathing","aerosols","relief","movement","control","prevention","animals","growth","hemoptysis","Deltacoronavirus","complications","bats","Wuhan","restriction","preventive strategies","country","China","Coronaviruses","surface"],"language":"en"},

In these cases, characterization of immune effector mechanisms and identification of protective epitopes/immunogens has been informative for the development of successful vaccine programs. Diseases in which the immune system does not rapidly clear the acute infection and/or convalescent immunity does not provide highly effective protection against secondary challenge pose a major hurdle for clinicians and scientists. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) falls primarily into this category, though not entirely. PRRSV causes a prolonged infection, though the host eventually clears the virus. Neutralizing antibodies can provide passive protection when present prior to challenge, though infection can be controlled in the absence of detectable neutralizing antibodies. In addition, primed pigs (through natural exposure or vaccination with a modified-live vaccine) show some protection against secondary challenge. While peripheral PRRSV-specific T cell responses have been examined, their direct contribution to antibody-mediated immunity and viral clearance have not been fully elucidated. The innate immune response following PRRSV infection, particularly the antiviral type I interferon response, is meager, but when provided exogenously, IFN-\u03B1 enhances PRRSV immunity and viral control. Overall, the quality of immunity induced by natural PRRSV infection is not ideal for informing vaccine development programs. The epitopes necessary for protection may be identified through natural exposure or modified-live vaccines and subsequently applied to vaccine delivery platforms to accelerate induction of protective immunity following vaccination. Collectively, further work to identify protective B and T cell epitopes and mechanisms by which PRRSV eludes innate immunity will enhance our ability to develop more effective methods to control and eliminate PRRS disease.","publish_time":"2015-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Loving, Crystal L.; Osorio, Fernando A.; Murtaugh, Michael P.; Zuckermann, Federico A.","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b3b32c96347c31043a806a565d3790bdf5df946.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112826.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26209116/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242715001464; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242715001464; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2015.07.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjszMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV","PRRS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRSV immunity","natural PRRSV infection","innate immunity","induction of protective immunity","durable protective immunity","convalescent immunity","quality of immunity","virulent infection","acute infection","prolonged infection","effective protection","antibody-mediated immunity","identification of protective epitopes","vaccine development programs","modified-live vaccine","protective B","natural exposure","passive protection","secondary challenge","effective vaccines","T cell epitopes","peripheral PRRSV-specific T cell responses","innate immune response","development of successful vaccine programs","vaccine delivery platforms","vaccination","epitopes necessary","immune system","live vaccines","effective methods","viral control","characterization of immune effector mechanisms","viral clearance","interferon response","absence of detectable neutralizing antibodies","respiratory syndrome virus","major hurdle","antiviral type","immunogens","viruses","present","direct contribution","primed pigs","clinicians","cases","ability","IFN-\u03B1","scientists","addition","work","host","PRRS disease","Diseases","category"],"language":"en"},

Indeed, the number of antiviral mAbs developed in recent years has grown exponentially. Although their direct effects on viral blunting have been studied in detail, their potential immunomodulatory actions have been overlooked until recently. The ability of antiviral mAbs to modulate antiviral immune responses in infected organisms has recently been revealed. More specifically, upon recognition of their cognate antigens, mAbs form immune complexes (ICs) that can be recognized by the Fc receptors expressed on different immune cells of infected individuals. This binding may be followed by the modulation of the host immune responses. Harnessing this immunomodulatory property may facilitate improvements in the therapeutic potential of antiviral mAbs. This review focuses on the role of ICs formed with different viral determinants and mAbs in the induction of antiviral immune responses in the context of both passive immunotherapies and vaccination strategies. Potential deleterious effects of ICs on the host immune response are also discussed.","publish_time":"2016-08-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lambour, Jennifer; Naranjo-Gomez, Mar; Piechaczyk, Marc; Pelegrin, Mireia","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd23dc1e8db2de0724d76fdadf0fd2f675be960e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5034104.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27530750/; https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2016.97","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjszMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of antiviral mAbs","ability of antiviral mAbs","induction of antiviral immune responses","therapeutic potential of antiviral mAbs","host immune responses","mAbs form immune complexes","different immune cells of infected individuals","Potential deleterious effects of ICs","role of ICs","different viral determinants","viral blunting","potential immunomodulatory actions","severe viral infections","infected organisms","direct effects","immunomodulatory property","cognate antigens","context","improvements","passive immunotherapies","Fc receptors","modulation","vaccination strategies","recent years","recognition","main class of biotherapeutics","major medical tools","review","Monoclonal antibodies","binding"],"language":"en"},

Viruses enter cells through endocytosis, phagocytosis, macropinocytosis or membrane fusion. These processes play important roles in the mechanisms contributing to the pathogenesis of these agents and in establishing viral genome persistence and latency. Upon viral infection, monocytes respond with an elevated expression of proinflammatory signalling molecules and antiviral responses, as is shown in the case of the influenza, Chikungunya, human herpes and Zika viruses. Human immunodeficiency virus initiates acute inflammation on site during the early stages of infection but there is a shift of M1 to M2 at the later stages of infection. Cytomegalovirus creates a balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory processes by inducing a specific phenotype within the M1/M2 continuum. Despite facilitating inflammation, infected macrophages generally display abolished apoptosis and restricted cytopathic effect, which sustains the virus production. The majority of viruses discussed in this review employ monocytes/macrophages as a repository but certain viruses use these cells for productive replication. This review focuses on viral adaptations to enter monocytes/macrophages, immune escape, reprogramming of infected cells and the response of the host cells.","publish_time":"2018-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nikitina, Ekaterina; Larionova, Irina; Choinzonov, Evgeniy; Kzhyshkowska, Julia","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/007618ad76a3548195ab5d11c1e2459931c91cd1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6163364.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms19092821; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30231586/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjszNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["monocytes","infected macrophages","infected cells","certain viruses","Zika viruses","majority of viruses","viral infection","host cells","virus replication","Human immunodeficiency virus","viral genome persistence","early stages of infection","later stages of infection","virus production","viral adaptations","review","long-term persistence","acute inflammation","human herpes","anti-inflammatory processes","M2 continuum","shift of M1","productive replication","site","abolished apoptosis","elevated expression of proinflammatory signalling molecules","Chikungunya","phagocytosis","dissemination","specific phenotype","restricted cytopathic effect","macropinocytosis","tissues","endocytosis","vessels","immune escape","repository","antiviral responses","mechanisms","balance","influenza","agents","cell biology","membrane fusion"],"language":"en"},

Some may be transmitted with the allograft as donor-derived infections, while others result from exposure, either soon after the transplant or from more distant exposures when infection is latent and reactivates in the setting of immune suppression. Simultaneous infections with multiple viral or viral and nonviral pathogens are common. The risk for viral infection is a function of the intensity of exposure and virulence of the specific virus, the intensity of immune suppression used to prevent graft rejection or graft-versus-host disease, underlying immune deficits, and factors affecting host susceptibility. Studies of viral latency, reactivation, and of the cellular effects of viral infection will provide clues for future strategies in prevention and treatment of viral infections.

In this study, we aimed at analyzing the viral epidemiology and clinical characteristics of ARTI in hospitalized children admitted to The First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. METHODS: Cohort of 386 hospitalized children (31 days to 15 years) diagnosed with ARTI admitted to the Department of Pediatrics from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2018, was enrolled in this study. Nasopharyngeal swab or sputum samples on the day of hospitalization were tested for 11 viruses via a GeXP\u2010based multiplex\u2010PCR assay. The viral profiles and clinical characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: The overall positive rate of the samples was 43.26% (167/386). Among the 167 positive samples, 134 (80.24%, 134/167) had a single virus and 33 (19.76%, 33/167) had multiple viruses. There was a significant difference in the frequency of single vs mixed infections among positive samples (80.24% vs 19.76%; \u03C7 (2) = 122.168, P = .000) as well as among the total examined samples (34.72% vs 8.55%; \u03C7 (2) = 77.945, P = .000). Human rhinovirus was the most prevalent virus (17.36%, 67/386), followed by influenza A (5.96%, 23/386) and human adenovirus (5.70%, 22/386). There was no significant difference in the etiological distribution of viral pathogens between males and females (\u03C7 (2) = 0.480, P = .489).

SARS-CoV-2 with potential origin of bat is still circulating in China. In this study, a prediction model is proposed to evaluate the infection risk of non-human-origin coronavirus for early warning. METHODS: The spike protein sequences of 2666 coronaviruses were collected from 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR) Database of China National Genomics Data Center on Jan 29, 2020. A total of 507 human-origin viruses were regarded as positive samples, whereas 2159 non-human-origin viruses were regarded as negative. To capture the key information of the spike protein, three feature encoding algorithms (amino acid composition, AAC; parallel correlation-based pseudo-amino-acid composition, PC-PseAAC and G-gap dipeptide composition, GGAP) were used to train 41 random forest models. The optimal feature with the best performance was identified by the multidimensional scaling method, which was used to explore the pattern of human coronavirus. RESULTS: The 10-fold cross-validation results showed that well performance was achieved with the use of the GGAP (g = 3) feature. The predictive model achieved the maximum ACC of 98.18% coupled with the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.9638. Seven clusters for human coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) were found. The cluster for SARS-CoV-2 was very close to that for SARS-CoV, which suggests that both of viruses have the same human receptor (angiotensin converting enzyme II). The big gap in the distance curve suggests that the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is not clear and further surveillance in the field should be made continuously. The smooth distance curve for SARS-CoV suggests that its close relatives still exist in nature and public health is challenged as usual. CONCLUSIONS: The optimal feature (GGAP, g = 3) performed well in terms of predicting infection risk and could be used to explore the evolutionary dynamic in a simple, fast and large-scale manner. The study may be beneficial for the surveillance of the genome mutation of coronavirus in the field.","publish_time":"2020-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qiang, Xiao-Li; Xu, Peng; Fang, Gang; Liu, Wen-Bin; Kou, Zheng","journal":"Infect Dis Poverty","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/524f43fa0957b624bb7f94f7008dc8be322786d7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7093988.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-020-00649-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32209118/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs0MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["China National Genomics Data Center","GGAP","ACC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","origin of SARS","MERS-CoV","non-human-origin viruses","human coronaviruses","pattern of human coronavirus","infection risk of non-human-origin coronavirus","human receptor","optimal feature","GGAP","amino acid composition","potential origin of bat","genome mutation of coronavirus","Novel Coronavirus Resource","G-gap dipeptide composition","pseudo-amino-acid composition","feature encoding algorithms","surveillance","field","study","spike protein sequences","smooth distance curve","parallel correlation","best performance","big gap","terms of predicting infection risk","close relatives","predictive model","fold cross-validation results","prediction model","Matthews correlation coefficient","Database of China National Genomics Data Center","nCoVR","PC-PseAAC","NL63","HKU1","humans","OC43","positive samples","early warning","nature","species barrier","public health","severe respiratory syndrome","evolutionary dynamic","large-scale manner","multidimensional scaling method","maximum ACC","MCC","key information","METHODS","angiotensin","enzyme","clusters","CONCLUSIONS","total","random forest models","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

As clinical and diagnostic needs have evolved over the last few decades, demanding greater levels of sensitivity and accuracy, so too has PCR performance. Through optimisation, the present-day uses of real-time PCR and quantitative real-time PCR are enumerable. The technique, combined with adoption of automated processes and reduced sample volume requirements, makes it an ideal method in a broad range of clinical applications, especially in virology. Complementing serologic testing by detecting infections within the pre-seroconversion window period and infections with immunovariant viruses, real-time PCR provides a highly valuable tool for screening, diagnosing, or monitoring diseases, as well as evaluating medical and therapeutic decision points that allows for more timely predictions of therapeutic failures than traditional methods and, lastly, assessing cure rates following targeted therapies. All of these serve vital roles in the continuum of care to enhance patient management. Beyond this, quantitative real-time PCR facilitates advancements in the quality of diagnostics by driving consensus management guidelines following standardisation to improve patient outcomes, pushing for disease eradication with assays offering progressively lower limits of detection, and rapidly meeting medical needs in cases of emerging epidemic crises involving new pathogens that may result in significant health threats.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Engstrom-Melnyk, Julia; Rodriguez, Pedro L.; Peraud, Olivier; Hein, Raymond C.","journal":"Methods in Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c281b3c1cfc20ac1c5e6e6a91b887de5304d023.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0580951715000069; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0580951715000069","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs0MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["quantitative real-time PCR","PCR performance","present-day uses of real-time PCR","infections","patient management","medical needs","clinical molecular laboratories","patient outcomes","broad range of clinical applications","diagnostic needs","consensus management guidelines","polymerase chain reaction","discovery of Taq polymerase","therapeutic decision points","timely predictions of therapeutic failures","cases of emerging epidemic crises","pre-seroconversion window period","reduced sample volume requirements","immunovariant viruses","adoption of automated processes","new pathogens","disease eradication","quality of diagnostics","assays","ideal method","traditional methods","continuum of care","standardisation","accuracy","staple","advancements","lower limits of detection","greater levels of sensitivity","invention","research","valuable tool","cure rates","targeted therapies","decades","significant health threats","screening","vital roles","optimisation","serologic testing","technique","diseases","Abstract","virology"],"language":"en"},

However, little is known of the role of IL-11 during viral infections. In this study, IL-11 expression at mRNA and protein levels were found to be high in Vero cells and the jejunum of piglets during porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection, while IL-11 expression was found to be positively correlated with the level of viral infection. Pretreatment with recombinant porcine IL-11 (pIL-11) was found to suppress PEDV replication in Vero E6 cells, while IL-11 knockdown promoted viral infection. Furthermore, pIL-11 was found to inhibit viral infection by preventing PEDV-mediated apoptosis of cells by activating the IL-11/STAT3 signaling pathway. Conversely, application of a STAT3 phosphorylation inhibitor significantly antagonized the anti-apoptosis function of pIL-11 and counteracted its inhibition of PEDV. Our data suggest that IL-11 is a newfound PEDV-inducible cytokine, and its production enhances the anti-apoptosis ability of epithelial cells against PEDV infection. The potential of IL-11 to be used as a novel therapeutic against devastating viral diarrhea in piglets deserves more attention and study.","publish_time":"2019-12-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yuchen; Wu, Qingxin; Jin, Yuxin; Yang, Qian","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8d3f0c18b7b274179244f57cd8f66e185a009dd5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6925494.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-019-0729-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31864417/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs0NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","IL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV infection","role of IL","potential of IL","recombinant porcine IL","level of viral infection","PEDV-mediated apoptosis of cells","PEDV replication","inhibition of PEDV","Vero cells","knockdown promoted viral infection","viral infections","devastating viral diarrhea","Vero E6 cells","anti-apoptosis function of pIL","newfound PEDV-inducible cytokine","anti-apoptosis ability of epithelial cells","expression","study","jejunum of piglets","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","STAT3 phosphorylation inhibitor","intestinal epithelium damage","protection","production","well-known anti-inflammatory factor","protein levels","mRNA","attention","chemical factors","application","Pretreatment","pathway","data","Interleukin"],"language":"en"},

Vaccine efficacy is based on whether host immune response against an antigen can elicit a memory T-cell response over time. Although the described side effects thus far have been mostly transient and acute, vaccines are able to elicit the immune system towards an autoimmune reaction. The diagnosis of a definite autoimmune disease and the occurrence of fatal outcome post-vaccination have been less frequently reported. Since vaccines are given to previously healthy hosts, who may have never developed the disease had they not been immunized, adverse events should be carefully accessed and evaluated even if they represent a limited number of occurrences. In this review of the literature, there is evidence of vaccine-induced autoimmunity and adjuvant-induced autoimmunity in both experimental models as well as human patients. Adjuvants and infectious agents may exert their immune-enhancing effects through various functional activities, encompassed by the adjuvant effect. These mechanisms are shared by different conditions triggered by adjuvants leading to the autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA syndrome). In conclusion, there are several case reports of autoimmune diseases following vaccines, however, due to the limited number of cases, the different classifications of symptoms and the long latency period of the diseases, every attempt for an epidemiological study has so far failed to deliver a connection. Despite this, efforts to unveil the connection between the triggering of the immune system by adjuvants and the development of autoimmune conditions should be undertaken. Vaccinomics is a field that may bring to light novel customized, personalized treatment approaches in the future.","publish_time":"2015-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guimar\u00E3es, Lu\u00EDsa E\u00E7a; Baker, Britain; Perricone, Carlo; Shoenfeld, Yehuda","journal":"Pharmacological Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/82391145ab2bc6754f496b31ccab1eb457a8101a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129276.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26275795/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2015.08.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661815001711; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043661815001711","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Vaccinomics"],"locations":["ASIA"],"keyphrases":["Adjuvants","immune system","autoimmune reaction","adjuvant-induced autoimmunity","development of autoimmune conditions","definite autoimmune disease","Abstract Vaccines","host immune response","case reports of autoimmune diseases","different conditions","effects","connection","limited number of cases","limited number of occurrences","inflammatory syndrome","ASIA syndrome","evidence of vaccine","adjuvant effect","Vaccine efficacy","different classifications of symptoms","memory T-cell response","personalized treatment approaches","light novel customized","experimental models","long latency period","occurrence of fatal outcome post-vaccination","antigen","various functional activities","attempt","time","linked fields","triggering","human patients","future","literature","diagnosis","infectious agents","epidemiological study","conclusion","healthy hosts","mechanisms","adverse events","Vaccinomics","review","efforts"],"language":"en"}]}

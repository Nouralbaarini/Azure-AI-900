Both qualitative and quantitative techniques were used in collecting and analyzing the data. Research on refugees is a complex undertaking, and there is no tested method for studying both refugees and HIV/AIDS. This results in the enhanced challenge of conducting research in precarious conditions where refugees reside, owing to displacement of refugees caused by myriad of factors that we have to take into consideration. In this way, it addresses the vacuum in scholarship and prepares the ground for designing research based on geographical and political settings, and proposes new alternatives for addressing them. This will be an important contribution to the methodological underpinning in refugee research. Ethical issues pose a significant challenge as this research involves human subjects and deals with delicate and sensitive issues. This chapter also explains the process for handling confidential research material, developing intersectional analyses and answering specific questions related to multi-strategy research design that are crucial in researching refugees.","publish_time":"2014-07-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ullah, AKM Ahsan; Huque, Ahmed Shafiqul","journal":"Asian Immigrants in North America with HIV/AIDS","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120802.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120802/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsyNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["refugee research","displacement of refugees","handling confidential research material","multi-strategy research design","chapter","significant challenge","enhanced challenge","sensitive issues","Ethical issues","intersectional analyses","specific questions","deals","human subjects","political settings","methodological underpinning","stigma","process","main theories of discrimination","precarious conditions","ground","important contribution","complex undertaking","vacuum","new alternatives","HIV","tested method","methodology","myriad of factors","quantitative techniques","scholarship","results","AIDS","way","data","consideration"],"language":"en"},

Strategies for selecting appropriate immunologic targets for new vaccine development and evaluating how vaccines may alter the senescent immune response in terms of potential benefits and risks in the preclinical and clinical trial phases of vaccine development will be discussed.","publish_time":"2019-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"McElhaney, Janet E.","journal":"Handbook of Immunosenescence","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a9749aa92e401e6d673880c18e2c8871fb1e163.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121048.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121048/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjszNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new vaccines","case of vaccines","current vaccines","improved vaccines","senescent immune response","immune function","immune senescence","new vaccine development","immune-mediated disorders","immune correlates of protection","primed response","variety of diseases","vaccine approaches","vaccination","variety of infectious diseases","clinical trial phases of vaccine development","pandemic influenza","seasonal influenza","bacterial toxins","bacterial pathogens","terms of potential benefits","risks","appropriate immunologic targets","cancer","recent years","complicated illness","West Nile virus","hallmark of aging","considerable opportunity","tetanus","effects of cytomegalovirus","preventive approach","novel antigens","Clostridium difficile","pneumococcus","pertussis","herpes zoster","Strategies","older adults","decline","ability","perspective"],"language":"en"},

The epidemiology of the pathogens is constantly influenced by the availability, or non-availability, of health care services; preventative strategies; and the process of globalization, with rapid movement of people, animals and products. It is further complicated by natural disasters, wars and changes in lifestyle. The effects of the neurotropic viruses are discussed against the background of the epidemiology. The pathogenesis is a chain of events with the point of departure when the virus enters the body to spread and reach the different sites of the CNS. The blood-brain barrier and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier are then overcome by captivating mechanisms. Once the different viruses have settled at the preferred site or sites, and have sidestepped the initial immune surveillance, the phases of injury commence. The cytopathic effect of the viruses elicits a para- and post-infectious inflammatory response and a vicious circle of continued damage, viral entry and inflammation results in a process not merely of inflammation, but of intense inflammation. The different clinical syndromes are then identifiable and should be interpreted against their own specific and appropriate epidemiological backgrounds. Clinicians face the challenge of problematic management decisions while awaiting results on gravely ill patients and differential diagnostic considerations have to be taken into account. Establishing a diagnosis is a two-tier process: first it requires the integration of cerebrospinal fluid findings, imaging results, electrophysiological studies, serology and ancillary blood tests, for example full blood count, liver function tests and other appropriate microbiological investigations, and then these should be correlated with the clinical condition of the patient. Treatment should be initiated as soon as possible. General treatment principles for stabilizing and maintaining vital functions are crucial and empiric treatment should be initiated as soon as possible. This usually includes a broad-spectrum antibiotic, such as third-generation cephalosporin and acyclovir. As soon as specific etiologies have been excluded antibiotics can be stopped. The use of acyclovir is discussed. In the last section of the chapter specific characteristics of the neurotropic viral families are summarized.","publish_time":"2017-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smuts, Izelle; Lamb, Gregory V.","journal":"Viral Infections in Children, Volume II","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f336d064d2aa591e61d5a99c2916d8f75fa6fbd5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121290.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121290/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs0OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inflammation results","different viruses","different clinical syndromes","blood count","blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier","viral tropism","viral entry","neurotropic viruses","different sites","ancillary blood tests","blood-brain barrier","neurotropic viral families","imaging results","process of globalization","CNS","two-tier process","specific etiologies","clinical condition","intense inflammation","empiric treatment","epidemiology","complex spectrum of clinical syndromes","chapter specific characteristics","General treatment principles","integration of cerebrospinal fluid findings","ill patients","non-availability","use of acyclovir","liver function tests","individual immune responses","genetic susceptibility of patients","initial immune surveillance","appropriate microbiological investigations","appropriate epidemiological backgrounds","electrophysiological studies","vicious circle of continued damage","disease","serology","example","vital functions","post-infectious inflammatory response","health care services","stabilizing","para","preventative strategies","rapid movement of people","central nervous system","challenge of problematic management decisions","differential diagnostic considerations","wars","changes","point of departure","animals","chain of events","natural disasters","phases of injury","preferred site","lifestyle","Clinicians","products","body","section","generation cephalosporin","cytopathic effect","captivating mechanisms","pathogenesis","antibiotics","diagnosis","pathogens","effects","broad-spectrum antibiotic","account"],"language":"en"},

In some cases, e.g., for influenza viruses, their function during the viral propagation cycle is relatively well understood, where they cleave and activate viral surface glycoproteins. For other viruses, e.g., Ebola virus, the function of host proteases during replication is still not clear. Host proteases may also contribute to the pathogenicity of virus infection by activating proinflammatory cytokines. For some coronaviruses, human proteases can also serve in a nonproteolytical fashion simply as receptors for virus entry. However, blocking of such protein-protein contacts is challenging, because receptor surfaces are often flat and difficult to address with small molecules. In contrast, many proteases possess well-defined binding pockets. Therefore, they can be considered as well-druggable targets, especially, if they are extracellularly active. The number of their experimental crystal structures is steadily increasing, which is an important prerequisite for a rational structure-based inhibitor design using computational chemistry tools in combination with classical medicinal chemistry approaches. Moreover, host proteases can be considered as stable targets, and their inhibition should prevent rapid resistance developments, which is often observed when addressing viral proteins. Otherwise, the inhibition of host proteases can also affect normal physiological processes leading to a higher probability of side effects and a narrow therapeutic window. Therefore, they should be preferably used in combination therapies with additional antiviral drugs. This strategy should provide a stronger antiviral efficacy, allow to use lower drug doses, and minimize side effects. Despite numerous experimental findings on their antiviral activity, no small-molecule inhibitors of host proteases have been approved for the treatment of virus infections, so far.","publish_time":"2018-02-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Steinmetzer, Torsten; Hardes, Kornelia","journal":"Activation of Viruses by Host Proteases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e56506b6511751fa83516e1117dfbd287451d65e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122247.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122247/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs5OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["function of host proteases","inhibition of host proteases","human proteases","small-molecule inhibitors of host proteases","antiviral activity","Ebola virus","virus entry","potential antiviral drug targets","stronger antiviral efficacy","additional antiviral drugs","replication of numerous pathogenic viruses","pathogenicity of virus infection","effects","influenza viruses","treatment of virus infections","stable targets","viral proteins","numerous experimental findings","protein-protein contacts","viral propagation cycle","well-druggable targets","viral surface glycoproteins","combination therapies","small molecules","computational chemistry tools","lower drug doses","experimental crystal structures","classical medicinal chemistry approaches","rational structure-based inhibitor design","normal physiological processes","higher probability","receptor surfaces","receptors","nonproteolytical fashion","well-defined binding pockets","important prerequisite","proinflammatory cytokines","narrow therapeutic window","number","rapid resistance developments","strategy","contrast","cases","coronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

The final section and conclusion consider how the G20 could provide a further venue for GHG.","publish_time":"2012-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cooper, Andrew F.","journal":"Global Health Diplomacy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8edf8dd8fae92b4f10ea95e5410f0ff53db5af03.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122370.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122370/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Global Health Governance"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GHG","global governance","aspects of global health","central focus","discussion","G20","possible future of Global Health Governance","role of G8 summitry","central agency","international diplomacy","main focus","growing role of foundations","overall architecture of international organizations","apparent reference","venues","current position","disconnections","new actors","relationship","terms","leadership summits","overview","conclusion","process","final section","chapter","notes"],"language":"en"},

The key to success lies in the availability and accessibility of essential medicines. Pushed by developing countries and international nongovernmental organizations, the conflicts regarding public access to essential medicines and protection of patented drugs have gained global attention. This chapter briefly introduces the history of the global response to the above challenges, beginning with the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement through the adoption of the Doha declaration and the protocol amending the World Trade Organization\u2019s (WTO) agreement on TRIPS. Then, it discusses the practice of compulsory licenses in both developing and developed countries and describes the huge market demand for generic drugs against infectious disease in developing countries. Finally, the chapter describes the capacity of generic drug production in major developing countries, such as India and China, as well as the roles of these countries in providing generic drugs to patients at home and to other developing countries. History has repeated itself many times due to a continued lack of essential medicines; the initial epidemic of infectious disease in developing countries has become pandemic, spreading throughout the globe. Therefore, any efforts taken by developing countries to increase access to essential medicines against infectious disease are beneficial to people in both developing and developed countries. The developing countries with the capacity and experience to develop generic drugs for public use should learn from each other and collaborate in the research, production, and distribution of generic drugs under the rights granted by the WTO agreement. Developed countries and big pharmaceutical companies should be allies rather than opponents for the ultimate goal of health promotion for all of mankind.","publish_time":"2012-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shao, Yiming","journal":"HIV/AIDS Treatment in Resource Poor Countries","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/406a5f9abeca2c50c3da8ce988fadc4a3ab5a619.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122610.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122610/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsxOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WTO"],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["major developing countries","developed countries","distribution of generic drugs","accessibility of essential medicines","capacity of generic drug production","continued lack of essential medicines","public access","WTO agreement","protection of patented drugs","public health crises","initial epidemic of infectious disease","TRIPS","public use","history","chapter","frequent outbreak of major infectious diseases","ultimate goal of health promotion","global response","global attention","Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights","World Trade Organization\u2019s","conflicts","huge market demand","experience","protocol","AIDS","HIV","availability","international nongovernmental organizations","people","patients","home","Doha declaration","opponents","adoption","citizens","India","big pharmaceutical companies","H1N1","success","SARS","times","practice of compulsory licenses","challenges","China","capability","roles","key","research","mankind","globe","efforts"],"language":"en"},

Connections between the domains of resilience and risk assessment include vulnerability. Infrastructure, social, economic, and ecological systems (and combined social-ecological systems) are vulnerable to exogenous global change, and other disturbances, both natural and anthropologically derived. Resilience analysis fundamentally seeks to provide the groundwork for a \u2018soft landing\u2019, or an efficient and robust restoration following disturbance as well as the ability to reduce harms while helping the targeted system rebound to full functionality as quickly and efficiently where possible. Such applications are consistent with The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) definition of resilience, which more broadly denotes the field as \u201Cthe ability to plan and prepare for, absorb, recover from, and adapt to adverse events\u201D (Larkin S, Fox-Lent C, Eisenberg DA, Trump BD, Wallace S, Chadderton C, Linkov I (2015) Benchmarking agency and organizational practices in resilience decision making.

Indeed, the camel flow in relationship with this market is based on live animals\u2019 export. Because the camel trade can be formal and informal with interconnections between both sectors and despite veterinary controls in the main exporting ports, some diseases such as Rift Valley fever (RVF), PPR-like disease, and MERS-coronavirus can spread from exporting countries to importing ones. However, the epidemiological status of these different diseases is quite variable and the transmission to humans in case of zoonosis (RVF and MERS-Cov) is not necessarily due to transboundary camel trade despite the impact of outbreak on the regional camel market. Globally, dromedary camel is less affected than other ruminants by infectious diseases under transboundary surveillance. But, because camel breeding is concentrated in countries where the disease surveillance systems often lack means, where the frontiers in desert areas are often \u201Cporous,\u201D and where the herd mobility is difficult to assess, the risk of transboundary diseases\u2019 transmission through borders is not negligible. Nowadays, the challenge of TADs control is limited to Rift Valley fever, but special attention must be paid to emerging diseases, including the recent discovery of prion disease in Algeria.","publish_time":"2019-07-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Faye, Bernard","journal":"Transboundary Animal Diseases in Sahelian Africa and Connected Regions","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/977a617754867aa7ab53b2e3d8b177d3dca2a34d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122668.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122668/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsyMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rift Valley"],"locations":["Mauritania","Somalia","North Africa","Algeria"],"keyphrases":["transboundary camel trade","camel flow","dromedary camel","camel breeding","regional camel market","regional camel meat market","emerging diseases","infectious diseases","different diseases","transboundary surveillance","exporting countries","Sahelian countries","Rift Valley fever","RVF","risk of transboundary diseases\u2019 transmission","disease surveillance systems","recent discovery of prion disease","MERS-coronavirus","MERS-Cov","main exporting ports","ruminants","impact of outbreak","veterinary controls","case of zoonosis","special attention","Somalia","humans","borders","Mauritania","PPR","Arabian peninsula","interconnections","sectors","Algeria","challenge of TADs control","desert areas","North Africa","live animals\u2019 export","epidemiological status","relationship","herd mobility","frontiers","ones"],"language":"en"},

These prevention and measurement approaches are only successful when approached collaboratively with engagement across the entire healthcare team.

Consequently, consensus and guidance are used to a great extent. Surgery opens into sterile tissues for hours, where there is massive tissue damage by knife, diathermy, clogging of vessels, pressure against and drying of tissues, decreased blood supply, impaired phagocytosis and impaired infection defence. Microbes deposited in this devitalized tissues may find a good basis for growth and proliferation if there is lack of infection control and sterility.

Moreover, with the pressure of zoos to become biological conservation mentors, zoos assume five roles as the executor of the relationship between society and nature. First, zoos take on the role of the \u201Cmodel citizen\u201D by conveying a conservation message. They advocate for a sensible, sustainable use of natural resources and promote less wasteful, green-building alternatives. Many zoological institutions are developing organizational plans that include the use of solar, wind, and thermal power in their daily operations. Additionally, they are growing food for the animals, composting, and using recycled materials in their exhibit design. Second, zoos are maintaining a viable and genetically diverse collection. Zoos are managed under the premise that wildlife conservation is of foremost importance. As zoological institutions have become more active in field studies, their research findings are being applied to larger conservation efforts. Moreover, the conservation research that takes place in situ and ex situ is important in saving small fragmented wild populations. Third, zoos directly influence the attitudes and behaviors of the community in relation to the conservation of plants, animals, and habitats. Due to their urban locations within heavily populated cities, zoos have a unique geographic placement within the community. The urban location of zoos provides them with a unique opportunity to influence government policy. Fourth, the zoo is a conservation mentor. Through mentoring efforts, future generations of scientists and citizens will be more aware of the benefits of long-term conservation. As conservation mentors, zoos must lead the public to become citizen conservationist. Fifth, zoos are a place for people to learn basic facts about organisms and their behavior.","publish_time":"2012-07-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patrick, Patricia G.; Tunnicliffe, Sue Dale","journal":"Zoo Talk","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/351b4043ce380c3ca6e62ae4d831d2f5a88eea91.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122730.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122730/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsyNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pressure of zoos","conservation research","wildlife conservation","conservation of plants","conservation message","urban location of zoos","biological conservation mentors","larger conservation efforts","benefits of long-term conservation","community","animals","zoological institutions","ex situ","unique opportunity","use of solar","research findings","mentoring efforts","model citizen","urban locations","citizen conservationist","unique geographic placement","sustainable use of natural resources","stated goals of zoo mission statements","future generations of scientists","populated cities","thermal power","basic facts","people","small fragmented wild populations","roles","recycled materials","field studies","organizational plans","relationship","organisms","citizens","composting","wind","executor","behaviors","examples","public","premise","foremost importance","society","exhibit design","daily operations","government policy","attitudes","diverse collection","nature","alternatives","chapter","food","habitats","missions"],"language":"en"},

On the other hand, platelets may turn into effectors of the inflammatory reaction of the lungs to allergens, to infectious agents, to chemical agents and may contribute strongly to the perpetuation of chronic inflammatory reactions, largely by their ability to interact with other inflammatory cells and the endothelium.

Although our knowledge regarding the health effects of RF radiation has increased considerably, the scientific evidence on biological effects of RF radiation associated with these wireless devices is still tentative. The uncertainties persist, in part, because of the limited number and scope of studies that have been conducted. Aside from the lack of a scientific consensus on experimental studies that provide clear evidence either refuting or supporting the cancer induction or promotion potential of RF radiation from cell phones, there is a concern that an established effect from wireless radiation, however small, could have a considerable impact in terms of public health. This chapter provides an updated review on recent research results on cancer induction and promotion in normal and transgenic mice and rats subjected to prolonged or life-long exposure to modulation schemes such as GSM, TDMA, CDMA, UMTS, and others. A majority of the laboratory mouse and rat studies did not exhibit a significant difference in carcinogenic incidences between exposed and sham-exposed animals. Although this observation may be comforting from the perspective of safety evaluation, most of the studies are one-of-a-kind investigations \u2013 only three mouse and perhaps four rat studies were designed as replication or confirmation studies. It is noteworthy that the findings of these studies have not been consistent, making it difficult to arrive at a definitive conclusion. It could be a major flaw that in a majority of the investigations, cage-control animals were not part of the investigation or were not included in the data analyses. Moreover, restraining the experimental animals during exposure could have introduced a stress factor, which further complicates interpretation of the results since stress has often been associated with cancer induction in these animals.","publish_time":"2009-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, James C.","journal":"Advances in Electromagnetic Fields in Living Systems","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0cad1139d90700836ee27ca966b8f6e2bc0afde6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123033.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123033/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjszOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["experimental studies","rat studies","wireless radiation","scope of studies","confirmation studies","health effects of RF radiation","promotion potential of RF radiation","biological effects of RF radiation","cancer induction","experimental animals","sham-exposed animals","related wireless devices","potential health effects of radio frequency","scientific evidence","majority","cage-control animals","terms of public health","scientific consensus","clear evidence","focus of concern","laboratory mouse","one-of-a-kind investigations","stress factor","recent research results","life-long exposure","cellular mobile telephones","GSM","modulation schemes","carcinogenic incidences","updated review","transgenic mice","significant difference","cell phones","TDMA","rats","considerable impact","established effect","interpretation","replication","CDMA","UMTS","chapter","perspective of safety evaluation","lack","limited number","knowledge","definitive conclusion","major flaw","findings","data analyses","observation","uncertainties"],"language":"en"},

Carnivores are among the most successful mammalian invaders. As such, a number of middle-sized representatives (\u201Cmesocarnivores\u201D) such as the domestic cat and mongooses have been pinpointed for their deleterious impact on the native fauna. In the MB, three species of mongooses (Herpestidae) and one genet (Viverridae) are or have recently been recorded and none of them has been considered native: the Indian grey mongoose Herpestes edwardsii, the small Indian mongoose H. auropunctatus, the Egyptian mongoose H. ichneumon, and the common genet Genetta genetta. In order to clarify the history of introduction and status of the mongooses and genet in Europe, I review various bodies of evidence including (1) their natural history and relationships with humans in their native ranges, (2) their history of introduction in Europe, (3) the enlightenments\u2014and sometimes contradictions\u2014brought by recent genetic analyses on their dispersal histories, and (4) their range dynamics and ecological interactions with the European fauna. The species of herpestids and viverrids present in Europe fall into three categories: (1) introduced and spreading (G. genetta, H. auropunctatus), (2) introduced and extinct (H. edwardsii), and (3) natural disperser and spreading (H. ichneumon). In view of the reviewed evidence, there is weak support for a deleterious impact of the mongooses and genet on the European fauna (except possibly on the herpetofauna of small Adriatic islands in the case of H. auropunctatus), notably in comparison with genuine invasive species such as the black rat and the domestic cat. Rather than inefficient control programs such as those targeting H. ichneumon in Portugal and H. auropunctatus in Croatia, we suggest that a greater attention is focused on the restoration of large Carnivores (the natural regulators of mesocarnivore populations), mesocarnivore communities and natural habitats, to contribute to a more sustainable way of \u201Cmanaging\u201D the mongooses and genet in Europe.","publish_time":"2015-09-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gaubert, Philippe","journal":"Problematic Wildlife","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/994c4818b62a54526d903a146a0755b72efad323.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123068.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123068/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs0MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Mediterranean Basin","Europe","Portugal"],"keyphrases":["species of mongooses","auropunctatus","natural history","ichneumon","native fauna","common genet Genetta genetta","species of herpestids","natural habitats","Europe fall","natural disperser","European fauna","history of introduction","small Indian mongoose","Egyptian mongoose","natural regulators of mesocarnivore populations","study species introductions","genuine invasive species","deleterious impact","native ranges","domestic cat","Indian grey mongoose Herpestes edwardsii","mesocarnivore communities","reviewed evidence","restoration of large Carnivores","various bodies of evidence","herpetofauna of small Adriatic islands","outstanding framework","viverrids present","black rat","recent genetic analyses","prehistoric times","ecological interactions","weak support","relationships","humans","contradictions","dispersal histories","mesocarnivores","cultural exchanges","case of","comparison","Herpestidae","status","range dynamics","number of middle-sized representatives","Croatia","mammals","categories","Portugal","successful mammalian invaders","greater attention","inefficient control programs","Mediterranean Basin","enlightenments","Viverridae","order","sustainable way"],"language":"en"},

Finally the maintenance of the rich and diverse archaeological and historical sites in the face of tourist impacts is discussed.","publish_time":"2019-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huddart, David; Stott, Tim","journal":"Adventure Tourism","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/084fc175eb60f343027d84de84b5b88763589fbf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123082.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123082/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs0Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Canadian Arctic"],"keyphrases":["impact of tourism","management approaches","cruise tourism","impact of adventure tourism","Examples of aboriginal tourism","polar bear viewing","polar bear hunting","face of tourist impacts","numbers of tourists","historical sites","development","world-class Carcross mountain bike trails","iconic species","possible spread of Giardia","Pleasure craft","wildlife","marine mammals","terrestrial vegetation","maintenance","various regions","beluga","narwhal","birds","tundra","seals","Canadian Arctic"],"language":"en"},

A good percentage of the orchids are commonly cultivated as ornamental plants and many hybrids have been produced with Calanthe and Cymbidium. TCM makes use of 14 species of Calanthe and Rumphius who authored Hut Amboinesche Kruidboek [the Amboinese Herbal, Volumes 1\u20136 (1741\u20131750), published posthumously] described Calanthe triplicata. Calanthe species contain compounds with antitumour and hair-restoring properties. Fourteen species of Coelogyne are medicinal and several have been studied phytochemically by Majumder\u2019s group in Calcutta. Another large group, Cymbidium, with 17 medicinal species, is also much studied. Lectins present in some species suppress replication of coronaviruses, toroviruses and viruses. An interesting compound that suppresses angiogenesis has been discovered in Cremastra appendiculata and it may find a role in preventing blindness and spread of cancers. Cyrtosia is a homomycotrophic genus and should be an interesting subject for phytochemical studies.","publish_time":"2015-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Teoh, Eng Soon","journal":"Medicinal Orchids of Asia","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5893ccaf0c595dc97f6615cecfdf6551aa3e547.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123092.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123092/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs0MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TCM"],"locations":["Calcutta"],"keyphrases":["species of Calanthe","Calanthe species","species of Coelogyne","medicinal species","Cymbidium","Calanthe triplicata","Cyrtosia","large group","Amboinese Herbal","herbal usage","interesting subject","Cremastra appendiculata","interesting compound","large chapter","Majumder\u2019s group","Conchidium","Hut Amboinesche Kruidboek","Cephalanthera","Cleisostoma","Crepidium","Corymborkhis","replication of coronaviruses","Callostylis","pharmacology","antitumour","genera","Rumphius","orchids","angiogenesis","hair","toroviruses","Cypripedium","compounds","homomycotrophic genus","ornamental plants","phytochemical studies","Volumes","hybrids","Lectins present","blindness"],"language":"en"},

Only Legionella pneumophila and influenza virus, following the recent H1N1 influenza pandemic, are routinely suggested as responsible agents. However, CAP due to atypical bacteria may represent up to 44% of all CAP. Viral CAP is considered less severe than the usual bacterial ones, although 25% of them warrant hospitalization and 15% result in severe sepsis. Even though L. pneumophila is the most frequently atypical pathogen involved in severe cases, Mycoplasma pneumoniae may be responsible for multiorgan failure. To date, tools including detection of Legionella antigen in urine and Mycoplasma using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) allow rapid and accurate diagnosis. The treatment is based on macrolides and fluoroquinolones that can be associated in severe Legionnaire diseases. The presence of virus in CAP, either alone or in association with bacteria, has been demonstrated using molecular biology tests. These techniques also allowed the identification of several new viruses in CAP. However, the exact role of these detected viruses in CAP as well as the efficiency of antiviral therapy still represent major unsolved concerns.","publish_time":"2013-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Planquette, B.; Ferr\u00E9, A.; B\u00E9dos, J. -P.","journal":"Reanimation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1fdba4cb9bfb47751f7fa65c0371bc78f18ade5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117816/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs3MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Legionella"],"organizations":["CAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe cases","severe community","severe sepsis","atypical bacteria","Viral CAP","severe Legionnaire diseases","influenza virus","detected viruses","atypical pathogen","new viruses","Legionella pneumophila","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","presence of virus","responsible agents","detection of Legionella antigen","recent H1N1 influenza pandemic","PCR","urine","polymerase chain reaction","efficiency of antiviral therapy","major unsolved concerns","tools","exact role","multiorgan failure","accurate diagnosis","date","identification","fluoroquinolones","result","usual bacterial ones","molecular biology tests","treatment","macrolides","hospitalization","intensivists","association","techniques"],"language":"en"},

The microorganisms may reach the lower respiratory tract from inhaled air or from infected oropharyngeal secretions. The same organism may produce several different patterns that depend on the balance between the microorganism charge and the body immunity defenses.CAP is classified into three main groups: lobar pneumonia, bronchopneumonia and interstitial pneumonia.Lobar pneumonia is characterized by the filling of alveolar spaces by edema full of white and inflammatory cells. Necrotizing pneumonia consists of a fulminant process associated with focal areas of necrosis that results in abscesses. Bronchopneumonia or lobular pneumonia, is characterized by a peribronchiolar inflammation with thickening of peripheral bronchial wall, the diffusion of inflammation to the centrilobular alveolar spaces and development of nodules.The interstitial pneumonia represents with the destruction and esfoliation of the respiratory ciliated and mucous cells. The interstitial septa, the bronchial and bronchiolar walls become thickened for the inflammation process and lymphocytes interstitial infiltrates.Chest radiography represents an important initial examination in all patients suspected of having pulmonary infection and for monitoring response to therapy.Its role is to identify the pulmonary opacities, their internal characteristics and distribution, pleural effusion and presence of other complications as abscesses and pneumothorax.High spatial CT resolution allows accurate assessment of air space inflammation.The CT findings include nodules, interlobular septal thickening, intralobular reticular opacities, ground-glass opacities, tree-in-bud pattern, lobar-segmental consolidation, lobular consolidation, abscesses, pneumatocele, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, mediastinal and hilar lymphoadenopaties, airway dilatation and emphysema.","publish_time":"2016-08-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Agarwal, P.; Romano, L.; Prosch, H.; Schueller, G.","journal":"Emergency Radiology of the Chest and Cardiovascular System","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/47b0041ea638648989511217093caf1128a0a702.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120007.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120007/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs4Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["interstitial pneumonia","lobar pneumonia","lobular pneumonia","severity of pneumonia","Necrotizing pneumonia","pulmonary opacities","inflammation process","abscesses","pulmonary infection","pleural effusion","diffusion of inflammation","peribronchiolar inflammation","interstitial septa","pericardial effusion","lobar-segmental consolidation","lymphocytes interstitial infiltrates","lobular consolidation","bronchopneumonia","microorganism charge","infectious pulmonary disease","balance","underlying pulmonary tissue","accurate assessment of air space inflammation","intralobular reticular opacities","ground-glass opacities","centrilobular alveolar spaces","filling of alveolar spaces","body immunity defenses","CT findings","inhaled air","development of nodules","thickening of peripheral bronchial wall","fulminant process","mucous cells","inflammatory cells","interlobular septal thickening","lower respiratory tract","leading cause of death","High spatial CT resolution","Chest radiography","hilar lymphoadenopaties","pneumatocele","viruses","pneumothorax","edema","quality","complications","distribution","bronchiolar walls","internal characteristics","bud pattern","important initial examination","funguses","airway dilatation","tree","monitoring response","patients","role","esfoliation","presence","destruction","gram-negative bacteria","infected oropharyngeal secretions","focal areas of necrosis","main groups","emphysema","therapy"],"language":"en"},

It is vitally important to identify these disorders and treat them with specific chemotherapeutic or immunomodulating therapies. This chapter will focus on hemophagocytic lympho-histiocytosis (HLH), a rare disorder of pathologic immune system activation that presents as a sepsis-like illness in the critically ill. While treatment of HLH with chemotherapy and immunosuppression should be guided by an expert hematologist, the diagnosis is often made by the critical care medicine practitioner. We present a case illustrating the challenges of defining this syndrome in a patient with recurrent critical illness, and review the evidence underlying diagnostic and prognostic criteria for this protean syndrome.

NiV causes yearly disease outbreaks in humans in Bangladesh, and HeV causes sporadic disease outbreaks in horses in north eastern Australia. Due to their zoonotic nature, they have been ideal candidates for collaborative projects in the One Health space, bringing public health and animal health professionals together. This has lead to insightful epidemiological studies, which has resulted in practical disease prevention solutions including a horse vaccine for HeV and NiV spill-over prevention interventions in the field. As more surveillance is undertaken, their known distributions have expanded, as has the range of reservoir host species.

The findings have pointed out the national vector surveillance and control system implemented by 1970s, followed by improved countermeasures like vector and virus surveillance which have incorporated science and technology especially in the last two decades. The analysis produces an influential role of a government in promoting and supporting public health measures, which have been typically demonstrated through inter-ministry collaboration, public-private cooperation, and community involvement. In light of increasing transnational nature of emerging infectious diseases, Singapore\u2019s contribution in the region like sharing its knowledge of and experiences in dengue and chikungunya virus infection is illustrated. The resilient model of Singapore\u2019s vector control and governmental action warrants a further study to investigate transferability in other parts of the region.","publish_time":"2010-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yoshikawa, Minako Jen","journal":"Current Topics of Infectious Diseases in Japan and Asia","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e2cf9cd55e76d2b4beb0f006b32bbb35279e4562.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120152/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs5MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Singapore"],"keyphrases":["national vector surveillance","effective vector control","virus surveillance","region","emergence of infectious diseases","resilient model of Singapore\u2019s vector control","control system","on-site vector mosquito surveillance operations","chikungunya virus infection","transnational nature of emerging infectious diseases","dengue","Ministry of Health","quick control of domestic outbreaks","inter-ministry collaboration","National Environment Agency","public health measures","Singapore\u2019s contribution","field studies","improved countermeasures","countermeasures of Republic","inter-disciplinary review of previous studies","public-private cooperation","essential factor","governmental action","experiences","hospitals","study","laboratory","upsurge","community involvement","moderate prevalence","tropical urban country","influential role","light","research","technology","transferability","parts","knowledge","paper","science","spite of expanding areas","analysis","findings","decades"],"language":"en"},

This chapter addresses five key questions on whether public health is on track to helping communities adapt to changing risks. The questions address adaptation to disease risk of climate change by exploring the following: assessments of disease risks, methods for adaptation, responsibility, resources, and public action and societal will. Overall, with these increasing risks to the health of Canadians, all sectors of society will need to participate in the adaptive response, while federal, provincial, and community public health bodies will need to work together to identify and communicate risk and promote and coordinate adaptation responses.","publish_time":"2011-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ogden, Nicholas Hume; Sockett, Paul; Fleury, Manon","journal":"Climate Change Adaptation in Developed Nations","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44fb9ffaa11a86a7e9e264a0d38f55505a92bf5d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120284.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120284/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs5OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["health risks","health of Canadians","increasing risks","Public health systems","assessments of disease risks","community public health bodies","public action","Adaptation efforts","adaptation responses","disease risk of climate change","endemic diseases","infectious diseases","key questions","resources","methods","responsibility","population","place","following","Canada","modifications","emerging pathogens","environment","existing approaches","knowledge gaps","adaptive response","vector","track","communities","sectors of society","water","chapter","food","impact"],"language":"en"},

Both respiratory and enteric viruses can be shed at high titers from infected individuals even when the infection is asymptomatic.

To develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be defined. Therefore, we herein established a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion assay and found that SARS-CoV-2 showed a superior plasma membrane fusion capacity compared to that of SARS-CoV. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-HB) core of the HR1 and HR2 domains in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that several mutated amino acid residues in the HR1 domain may be associated with enhanced interactions with the HR2 domain. We previously developed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, which targeted the HR1 domain and could inhibit infection by divergent human coronaviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Here we generated a series of lipopeptides derived from EK1 and found that EK1C4 was the most potent fusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with IC50s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241- and 149-fold more potent than the original EK1 peptide, respectively. EK1C4 was also highly effective against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as SARSr-CoVs, and potently inhibited the replication of 5 live human coronaviruses examined, including SARS-CoV-2. Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protected mice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging SARSr-CoVs.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xia, Shuai; Liu, Meiqin; Wang, Chao; Xu, Wei; Lan, Qiaoshuai; Feng, Siliang; Qi, Feifei; Bao, Linlin; Du, Lanying; Liu, Shuwen; Qin, Chuan; Sun, Fei; Shi, Zhengli; Zhu, Yun; Jiang, Shibo; Lu, Lu","journal":"Cell Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e3112583171740ffa5b9af84fe91e2c648b940f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104723.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104723/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjszNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","pseudovirus infection","viral infection","treatment of infection","S protein-mediated membrane fusion","potent fusion inhibitor","pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor","cell fusion assay","HR1 domain","human coronavirus pseudoviruses","superior plasma membrane fusion capacity","protein-mediated cell","S protein S2 subunit","divergent human coronaviruses","live human coronaviruses","Intranasal application of EK1C4","specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics","recent outbreak of coronavirus disease","original EK1 peptide","emerging SARSr-CoVs","HR2 domains","prophylactics","serious threat","mutated amino acid residues","molecular mechanism","helical bundle","challenge","core","mice","COVID","IC50s","spike","HCoV-OC43","enhanced interactions","global public health","HB","China","replication","Wuhan","X-ray crystal structure","fold","prevention","series of lipopeptides","nM"],"language":"en"},

This analysis aimed to understand the impact of timing of diagnosis on hospital LOS. METHODS: A retrospective review of patient charts was conducted. Data for adults \u226518 years with confirmed RSV (Oct 2014\u2013Oct 2016; USA) were collected. Each physician (n = 132) submitted up to 3 randomly selected patient cases via an online survey. RESULTS: This study comprised 379 patients, collected in 4 groups (Table). \u003E80% of patients received an RT-PCR test; rapid antigen tests were uncommon (\u226410%) with an RT-PCR test also performed in 45% of these. Early RSV diagnosis and less severe disease were associated with a shorter mean LOS (Figure 1and2). Patients diagnosed \u003E24h post-admission had a longer mean [SD] LOS (9.8 [8.6] days; n = 29) than patients diagnosed \u003C12h post-admission (6.2 [3.9] days; n = 67; P = 0.006), and patients diagnosed 12\u201324h post-admission (7.4 [4.2] days; n = 56; P = 0.038). LOS was higher (P = 0.005) in patients diagnosed in the intensive care unit (9.4 days) than the emergency room or hospital ward (both 6.8 days). CONCLUSION: RSV disease in adults was typically diagnosed by PCR. Delayed diagnosis and greater RSV disease severity are associated with longer LOS, but results need to be confirmed by prospective trials. Introduction of diagnostic testing protocols may lead to earlier identification of patients in need of supportive care and reduce mean LOS. DISCLOSURES: E.

METHODS: We performed a review of a subset of patients entered into a randomized, controlled, AS trial that began 7.1.2015. Patients with UTI and 3 other ID syndromes were evaluated by ID MDs within 12\u201324 hours of receiving empirical antimicrobials. The ID MD designated patients as having NI when a patient lacked compatible symptoms, signs, and laboratory evidence to support a diagnosis of UTI. Patients with NI were tracked but not included in the study intervention to identify AS opportunities. RESULTS: Over 21 months 6,402 antimicrobial starts were entered into the AS study; 2,196 (34.3%) were UTI. Of these 564 (25.7%) were designated NI. The initial admission of 104 patients designated NI are the subject of this report. Four had possibly clinically significant UTI and were excluded. Of the remaining 100 the average age was 83.6 years, 80% were female and 50% were admitted with acute or chronic altered mental status (dementia, seizure, or stroke); Sixty-five % of urine cultures were positive. The mean Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) score was 0.6; the mean quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score (qSOFA) score was 0.9. A mean 3.7 days of antimicrobials were prescribed during the admission; 3.2 additional days at discharge. Of the 100 NI patients followed (up to 21 months following study entry) 34% have died (all-cause), 49% had a subsequent episode of bacteriuria; the mean number of re-admissions per patient was 2.4(range 0\u201314) and 9% developed C. difficile infection (CDI). CONCLUSION: AS identified a subset of patients treated for UTI but determined by ID MDs as NI, as an elderly, predominantly female cohort, with a high incidence of new or pre-existing neurological conditions, subsequent bacteriuria, re-admission, and short -term mortality. Low SIRS and qSOFA scores in these patients supported a lack of clinically significant infection. AS programs should focus on early efforts to identify ASBU. Preservation of antimicrobial resources, antibiotic cost savings (estimated over 3 years to be $ 450,000), and avoidance of CDI are among the likely benefits.

Before this implementation, varicella vaccine had been available in the private sector since 2000. However, varicella outbreaks continued to occur in preschools and elementary schools. We investigated a varicella outbreak to estimate the effectiveness of 1-dose varicella vaccine and to evaluate potential risk factors for breakthrough disease. METHODS: This study was carried out during a varicella outbreak in 3 preschools in \u0130zmir, Turkey, in April 2016. Using questionnaires, data including children\u2019s medical and vaccination history were collected from their parents. Vaccination status of children was also verified with immunization records. Attack rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated children were calculated and the analysis of vaccine effectiveness and of risk factors for breakthrough disease were conducted. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated using the equation: (attack rates in unvaccinated children-attack rates in vaccinated children/ attack rates in unvaccinated children) \u00D7 100%. RESULTS: A total of 124 children were enrolled in the study. Of the 124 children, 77 (62%) had received 1-dose varicella vaccine before the outbreak. Varicella developed in 34 of 124 children during the outbreak, and 18 of them (53%) had breakthrough varicella. The attack rate was 23.4% among vaccinated children and 34% among unvaccinated children. The effectiveness of single-dose varicella vaccine was 33.6% against varicella disease of any severity and 82.5% against moderate or severe varicella. Children vaccinated 5 or more years before the outbreak had 3.5 times the risk of disease than those who had been vaccinated more recently (OR 3.5 [95% CI, 1.08\u201311.5]); P = 0.046). Age at vaccination (\u003C15 months vs.\u226515 months) and the brands of varicella vaccine were not associated with the increased risk of breakthrough varicella. CONCLUSION: One-dose of varicella vaccine is not sufficient to prevent school outbreaks. For this reason, varicella outbreaks continued to occur in schools and kindergartens among healthy vaccinated children in Turkey. A 2-dose varicella vaccination program may help to prevent varicella outbreaks and achieve effective control of the disease.

The Indian Council of Medical Research has identified carbapenems, polymyxins (PE and PB) as key antimicrobials which require restriction in hospitals. We describe epidemiology of PB and PE use following implementation of an Antibiotic Stewardship Program (ASP) in a 1300-bed, private, tertiary-care center in Southern India. METHODS: An ASP was established at Amrita Hospital in Feb 2016 consisting of an administrative champion, hospitalist, microbiologist, intensivist and 5 pharmacists. Institutional guidelines for polymyxins were established and disseminated. The ASP team performed daily post-prescriptive reviews, evaluated and tracked appropriateness of PB and PE use, including administration of a loading dose (LD), maintenance dose (MD), frequency, route and duration of therapy. ASP recommendations and compliance were recorded. RESULTS: During the 12-month study period (Feb \u201816-Jan \u201817), 348 patients received 295 PE and 94 PB courses. Mean age was 50 yrs and 73% were male. Patients on Medicine and Hematology/Oncology teams accounted for 42% of all prescriptions. The most common infections were bacteremia (34%), pneumonia (29%) and UTI (23%). Pathogens were recovered in 69% (269/389) of cases, Klebsiella pneumoniae 23% (90/389) and Acinetobacter baumanii11 % (45/389) were most common. 290 (75%) of polymyxin course were judged to be inappropriate (78% of PE and 22% of PB). The most frequent reasons for inappropriate therapy included incorrect frequency of administration (64% for PB and 58% for PE), inappropriate MD (60% for PB and 48% for PE) and wrong duration of therapy (54% for PE and 48% for PB). 95% of incorrect MD for both PE and PB were too low. The reasons for inappropriateness were similar for both polymyxins.While all inappropriate LD episodes for PB (n = 22 %) were due to lack of a LD, errors for PE (n = 34%) involved either omission of LD or administration of LD that was too low.ASP recommendations were made in 190 instances with 58% provider compliance. CONCLUSION: Review of PB and PE use in our hospital indicates a high percentage of inappropriate use and highlights stewardship opportunities for improving care of patients with resistant infections.

However, a first positive CMV PCR may not be reproducible, but constitute a CMV blip (single positive CMV PCR measurements). Such blips are known from monitoring of other viral infections using PCR technology, and may either constitute a false positive read due to assay variability or reflect transient low-level viral replication. We investigated the impact of CMV blips in a cohort of SOT and HSCT recipients. METHODS: SOT and HSCT recipients transplanted between 2010 and 2015, who had a known donor (D)/recipient (R) CMV IgG serostatus (D\u002B/R\u002B, D\u002B/R- or D-/R\u002B), and with \u22653 CMV PCRs fulfilling the CMV PCR triplicate criteria (Figure 1) were included (N = 851). Odds ratio (OR) for factors associated with a triplicate being a blip was estimated by binomial regression adjusted for repeated measurements. Whether blips affected the hazard ratio (HR) for subsequent CMV infection was determined with a Cox model. RESULTS: 851 transplant recipients generated 3883 CMV PCR triplicates (104 blips, 307 infections, 3472 negatives, Figure 1). In the 411 positive triplicates, the OR of a triplicate being a blip decreased with increasing CMV viral load of the second measurement ([vs. = 273 IU/mL]; \u003E273\u2013910 IU/mL: OR 0.2 [95% CI 0.1\u20130.4], \u003E910 IU/mL: OR 0.07 [95% CI 0.03\u20130.2], P \u003C 0.0001) and was elevated in recipients with intermediary/low-risk CMV IgG serostatus ([vs. those with high] OR 2.2 [95% CI 1.3\u20133.6] P = 0.003). If the cumulative exposure to viremia in the CMV blips was \u003E910 IU/mL, there was a higher risk of subsequent CMV infection (HR 4.6 [95% CI 1.2\u201317.2] P = 0.02) (Figure 2). CONCLUSION: CMV blips are frequent while screening transplant recipients with CMV PCR. CMV blips \u003E910 IU/mL is a risk factor for subsequent infection, indicating that CMV blips at least partly reflect transient low-level CMV infection in transplant recipients. These observations suggest that first positive CMV PCR results should be confirmed before initiation of anti-CMV treatment, especially if the viral load of the first positive PCR is \u003C910 IU/mL, or if the patient has intermediary/low-risk serostatus.

RESULTS: Of 5125 hospitalized older adults, 15% were non-frail, 39% pre-frail, 40% frail, and 6% most frail. 11% died, and poor recovery was experienced by 520/4544=11% of survivors. Poor recovery was inversely associated with baseline frailty (11% non-frail, 17% pre-frail, 28% frail, 38% most frail; P \u003C .001). Frailty was associated with lower odds of recovery in all three seasons [2011/12 (OR=0.71; 95% CI 0.60\u20130.85), 2012/13 (OR=0.72; 0.66\u20130.78), 2013/14 (OR=0.76; 0.70\u20130.82)] though results varied by season, influenza status, and vaccination status. In 2011/12, frailty was associated with poor recovery in unvaccinated (OR=0.46. 95% CI=0.32\u20130.67) but not vaccinated older patients (OR=0.83, 95% CI=0.68\u20131.02). CONCLUSION: Increasing frailty was consistently associated with lower odds of recovery in older adults admitted with influenza and other acute respiratory illnesses; depending on seasonal factors, vaccination may offer some buffering of this impact. Understanding frailty and functional status is important, both because frailty is predictive of poor recovery and because persistence of new health/functional deficits is an adverse outcome with important implications for patients, families and health systems.

The disease is diffused in tropical areas, where it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. P. falciparum is the most dangerous species, mainly affecting young children. The parasite cycle occurs both in humans (asexual stages) and in mosquitoes (sexual stages). In humans, Plasmodium grows and multiplies within red blood cells using hemoglobin as essential source of nutrients and energy. However, this process generates toxic heme that the parasite aggregates into an insoluble inert biocrystal called hemozoin. This molecule sequesters in various organs (liver, spleen, and brain), potentially contributing to the development of malaria immunopathogenesis. Uncomplicated falciparum malaria clinical frame ranges from asymptomatic infection to classic symptoms such as fever, chills, sweating, headache, and muscle aches. However, malaria can also evolve into severe life-threatening complications, including cerebral malaria, severe anemia, respiratory distress, and acute renal failure.","publish_time":"2014-09-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Giribaldi, Giuliana; D\u2019Alessandro, Sarah; Prato, Mauro; Basilico, Nicoletta","journal":"Human and Mosquito Lysozymes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73df8d0312d8ba7d94b32deb2b794d507c917d61.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123976.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123976/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs5OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cerebral malaria","development of malaria immunopathogenesis","humans","Uncomplicated falciparum malaria clinical frame ranges","severe anemia","parasite aggregates","parasite cycle","parasitic disease","Anopheles mosquitoes","asexual stages","severe life-threatening complications","Plasmodium protozoan parasites","asymptomatic infection","respiratory distress","classic symptoms","hemoglobin","fever","essential source of nutrients","red blood cells","liver","sweating","headache","chills","insoluble inert biocrystal","acute renal failure","spleen","various organs","dangerous species","toxic heme","young children","molecule","muscle aches","hemozoin","energy","process","high morbidity"],"language":"en"},

Its incidence rate appears to have increased substantially in Western societies during the mid-20th century and continues to increase at \u223C1%/year. Worldwide cALL appears to track with affluence of societies. The \u2018delayed infection\u2019 hypothesis, first formulated in 1988, parallels the hygiene hypothesis and has an evolutionary foundation in the concept of a mismatch between prior genetic selection and programming (of the immune system) and contemporary social circumstances. In essence, the hypothesis predicts that ALL is triggered by an abnormal immune response to one or more common microbial infections and that the abnormality arises for two reasons: (i) infectious exposures being delayed beyond the immunologically anticipated period of infancy; (ii) some degree of inherited genetic susceptibility via, for example, allelic variation in genes involved in the MHC and/or immune response network. The hypothesis also has a framework in the underlying cell and molecular biology of ALL and its natural history. Epidemiological studies of social contacts in infancy (as a proxy for common infections) and risk of ALL provide indirect but strong support for the hypothesis. The idea still requires mechanistic and genetic endorsement and the appropriate studies are in progress.","publish_time":"2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Greaves, Mel","journal":"The Hygiene Hypothesis and Darwinian Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/654dd6f15e55c3bee4ed564fad2f282a75ec468b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123988/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjsx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hygiene hypothesis","common infections","genetic endorsement","immune system","common microbial infections","immune response network","abnormal immune response","prior genetic selection","degree of inherited genetic susceptibility","appropriate studies","Epidemiological studies of social contacts","Western societies","affluence of societies","delayed infection","common variant of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia","contemporary social circumstances","anticipated period of infancy","example","mismatch","programming","molecular biology","concept","MHC","risk","proxy","evolutionary foundation","underlying cell","allelic variation","genes","framework","abnormality","strong support","frequent paediatric cancer subtype","reasons","century","idea","infectious exposures","natural history","progress","incidence rate","essence","year"],"language":"en"},

Patients with hematologic malignancies and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) are at risk. Most of the cases of HSV pneumonia are caused by HSV-1; however, cases caused by HSV-2 have also been reported. Mucocutaneous disease often precedes the development of pneumonia, with nonspecific symptoms that include fever, cough, and dyspnea. Worsening oxygenation and failure to wean off mechanical ventilation despite broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage is also a common presentation. Diagnosis requires a high degree of suspicion and is based on isolation of the virus from respiratory secretions and demonstration of cytopathic effects on histopathology. Acyclovir is the most widely used drug for treatment and prophylaxis. With increasing evidence of resistance to acyclovir and its analogs, newer agents such as foscarnet and cidofovir are being recommended as treatment options. Prophylaxis in patients with seropositive HSV undergoing chemotherapy or in the immediate post-HSCT period has been shown to reduce HSV disease rates and mortality rates. This chapter will focus on incidence and transmission, pathogenesis, risk factors, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of HSV pneumonia in patients with hematologic malignancies and HSCT, as well as outcome and prognosis.","publish_time":"2010-08-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shah, Jharna N.; Chemaly, Roy F.","journal":"Pulmonary Involvement in Patients with Hematological Malignancies","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/29afa2563eab9b481e1b86ab9066c25abfc44ca8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124034.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124034/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjsyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cases of HSV pneumonia","management of HSV pneumonia","seropositive HSV","HSV disease rates","development of pneumonia","immunocompromised patients","hematologic malignancies","Diagnosis","Acyclovir","prophylaxis","risk factors","immediate post-HSCT period","mortality rates","Mucocutaneous disease","treatment options","Herpes simplex virus","hematopoietic stem cell transplant","respiratory secretions","pathogenesis","clinical features","chemotherapy","broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage","mechanical ventilation","demonstration of cytopathic effects","cidofovir","analogs","newer agents","transmission","nonspecific symptoms","failure","fever","cough","foscarnet","incidence","isolation","common presentation","increasing evidence of resistance","high degree of suspicion","histopathology","drug","Worsening oxygenation","dyspnea","chapter","outcome","prognosis"],"language":"en"},

Based on data collected from 141 experienced taxpayers in Taiwan, the acceptance and the impact of quality antecedents on taxpayers\u0027 perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) of the system were assessed and evaluated. The results indicated that the model of Internet tax-filing system was accepted with a reasonable goodness-of-fit. Three important findings include the following items. First, TAM proves to be a valid model to explain the taxpayers\u0027 acceptance of the Internet tax-filers\u0027 system. Meanwhile, PU has created more impact than PEOU on taxpayers\u0027 intention to use the system. Second, PU is positively influenced by such factors as information system quality (ISQ), information quality (IQ), as well as perceived credibility (PC). Third, IQ has a positive impact on PEOU. Based on the research findings, implications and limitations are then discussed for future possible research.","publish_time":"2005-07-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, I-Chiu; Li, Yi-Chang; Hung, Won-Fu; Hwang, Hisn-Ginn","journal":"Gov Inf Q","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f01bfc2e816da942468447bd6fd1c7a38409dd8f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125980.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7125980/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjsxMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["PU"],"organizations":["PEOU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["taxpayers\u0027 acceptance","information system quality","Internet tax-filers\u0027 system","model of Internet tax","PEOU","PU","taxpayers\u0027 perceived usefulness","Technology Acceptance Model","information quality","taxpayers\u0027 intention","impact of quality antecedents","perceived credibility","perceived ease of use","valid model","positive impact","IQ","TAM","research findings","important findings","future possible research","ISQ","limitations","factors","experienced taxpayers","Taiwan","following items","implications","reasonable goodness","study","fit","data","PC","results"],"language":"en"},

Specific primers for each of the 3 RNA viruses, North American genotype porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and swine influenza virus, were used in the testing procedure. The assay was shown to be highly sensitive because it could detect as little as 10(\u22125) ng of each of the respective amplicons in a single sample containing a composite of all 3 viruses. The assay was also effective in detecting one or more of the same viruses in various combinations in specimens, including lymph nodes, lungs, spleens, and tonsils, collected from clinically ill pigs and in spleen specimens collected from aborted pig fetuses. The results from the multiplex RT-PCR were confirmed by virus isolation. The relative efficiency (compared to the efficiency of separate assays for each virus) and apparent sensitivity of the multiplex RT-PCR method show that this method has potential for application in routine molecular diagnostic procedures.","publish_time":"2010-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"CHEN, Hong-ying; WEI, Zhan-yong; ZHANG, Hong-ying; L\u00DC, Xiao-li; ZHENG, Lan-lan; CUI, Bao-an; LIU, Jinpeng; ZHU, Qian-lei; WANG, Zi-xin","journal":"Agric","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b291c52103b777a67e540fe71f797e0ba58e844.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129351/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjszODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus isolation","multiplex RT-PCR method","swine influenza virus","respiratory syndrome virus","Japanese encephalitis virus","RNA viruses","spleen specimens","multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction","relative efficiency","efficiency of separate assays","North American genotype porcine reproductive","application","potential","lymph nodes","routine molecular diagnostic procedures","lungs","apparent sensitivity","detection of multiple viral infections","various combinations","respective amplicons","single sample","tonsils","spleens","ill pigs","aborted pig fetuses","efficacy","composite","results","Specific primers","testing procedure"],"language":"en"},

Patient to patient spread has been reported, however mechanisms of acquisition of Bcc are not well understood. Method: Data from the Belgian CF Registry (year 2000\u20132010) were collected. Inclusions: Bcc infected patients with entries on lung function in at least 1 y before and 3 y after Bcc acquisition. For each case, we included 2 controls, matched for age at the index year (year of first Bcc infection), pancreatic status, sex. Cumulative data up to 2 years before index year were compared to values obtained after infection using Rank sum test. Rate of decline in lung function was adjusted for baseline lung function, age, sex. RESULTS: Bcc prevalence in CF is low in Belgium (\u003C3%). 183 patients were included: 61 cases, 122 controls. 59% were F508del homozygous. Mean age in cases was 20.9 y (SD 10.5) vs 20.3 y (SD 10.3) in controls. Among the Bcc, 54% were unspecified, 31% were B. multivorans. Mean FEV(1) at index year was 65.2% (SD 24.9) in cases vs 73.1 (SD 26.9) in controls (p = 0.07). FEV(1) decline before index year was significantly higher in cases (\u20131.7%, SD 0.5) compared to controls (\u20131.0%, SD 0.3) (p = 0.002). FEV(1) slopes were comparable in the period after index year (\u20131.1%, SD 0.5, in cases vs \u20130.99%, SD 0.4, p = 0.24). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that a declining FEV(1) precedes acquisition of Bcc and may be a risk factor. After acquisition, lung function decline was comparable in Bcc infected and uninfected patients. These results should be interpreted with caution, since registry data are collected retrospectively and bear a risk of incompleteness or inaccuracy.","publish_time":"2015-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Willekens, J.; Wanyama, S.; Thomas, M.; De Wachter, E.; De Schutter, I.; Malfroot, A.","journal":"J Cyst Fibros","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129951/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjs1MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Bcc","FEV"],"locations":["Belgium"],"keyphrases":["SD","Bcc acquisition","acquisition of Bcc","index year","Bcc infection","Bcc infected","Bcc prevalence","controls","lung function decline","cases vs","baseline lung function","Mean FEV","RESULTS","worsening of CF lung disease","Mean age","registry data","mechanisms of acquisition","declining FEV","Belgian CF Registry","Rate of decline","sex","uninfected patients","Cumulative data","patient spread","risk of incompleteness","risk factor","Burkholderia cepacia complex","values","entries","INTRODUCTION","pancreatic status","period","years","Rank sum test","Belgium","Inclusions","slopes","Method","caution","inaccuracy","F508del homozygous","multivorans","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

To initiate infection, viruses bind to sites, or receptors, on the cell surface and transfer their genome across the limiting membrane of the cell. The mechanisms underlying these events, and viral tropism for particular host cells, are becoming increasingly well understood. Several cell surface proteins have now been identified as viral receptors, and analyses of intact virus particles and sub-viral components are revealing the structures of the binding determinants on the viruses themselves. For many viruses, the events leading to penetration and delivery involve constitutive endocytic properties of the host cell, and the low pH environment in endocytic compartments is a crucial trigger in the penetration process.

In vivo immuno-histochemical studies of the liver from infected mice have demonstrated that mechanisms other than direct viral injury are in operation. To examine potential mechanisms, the interaction of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Kupffer cells with MHV 3 was studied. We first observed a dramatic inhibition in viral replication in LPS-treated Kupffer cells explanted from A/J resistant mice. Second, we demonstrated that MHV 3 induced a dose-dependent interleukin 1 (IL-1) activity in the supernatants of infected Kupffer cells of both strains. These results led us finally to examine the antigen-proceesing function of the Kupffer cellsof both strains of mice. No striking differences were observed in the ability of Kupffer cells from resistant or sensitive mice to collaborate with immunocompetent lymphocytes. Our data suggest that Kupffer cells play a double role which is crucial in the pathogenesis of MHV 3-induced hepatitis. First, they act directly as the genetically determined sensitivity of mice to MHV 3 infection is correlated with the efficiency of the antiviral activity induced in Kupffer cells by LPS. Second, they act indirectly through the synthesis of different amounts of IL-1 induced by MHV 3. This hypothesis is further borne out by the effects of indomethacin treatment on the course of MHV 3 infection in A/J resistant mice in vivo.","publish_time":"2002-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Keller, F.; Schmitt, C.; Kirn, A.","journal":"FEMS Microbiol Lett","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130685/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjs2ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ability of Kupffer cells","stimulated Kupffer cells","LPS-treated Kupffer cells","strains of mice","supernatants of infected Kupffer cells","Kupffer cellsof","infected mice","course of MHV","pathogenesis of MHV","J resistant mice","sensitive mice","liver sinusoidal cells","determined sensitivity of mice","induced hepatitis","viral replication","infection","hepatitis virus","genetic sensitivity of mouse strains","delay of virus replication","antiviral activity","potential mechanisms","direct viral injury","synthesis of different amounts of IL","interaction of lipopolysaccharide","double role","antigen-proceesing function","dramatic inhibition","effects of indomethacin treatment","dose-dependent interleukin","histochemical studies","operation","efficiency","immunocompetent lymphocytes","striking differences","data","results","hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

A format for collation of information on birthdate and date of death was assembled into a matrix which improved conceptualization of the data and which simplified procedures for estimation of mortality rates. Contemporary and birth cohort life table methods, mortality density estimations and relative risk assessment were used to ascertain if there were high-risk groups of calves that could be identified by age, day-of-the-week born, day-of-the-week died and sex. During the outbreak of neonatal diarrhea on this dairy, female calves were found to have experienced an atypically higher rate of mortality (10.7%) than did males (5.3%). Calves of both sexes died between the ages of 9 and 19 days. In addition, the risk of dying was 11 times greater for calves born on Wednesdays than for those born on Saturdays. These findings formed the basis for recommended changes in management of neonatal calves on the dairy.","publish_time":"2002-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thurmond, Mark C.","journal":"Prev Vet Med","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133881/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjszOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["management of neonatal calves","female calves","causes of neonatal mortality","high-risk groups of calves","mortality density estimations","cow dairy","estimation of mortality rates","higher rate of mortality","week","outbreak of neonatal diarrhea","risk of dying","Epidemiologic methods","relative risk assessment","birth cohort life table methods","recommended changes","southern San Joaquin Valley of California","birthdate","times greater","investigation","collation of information","data","date of death","basis","procedures","Wednesdays","matrix","findings","ages","conceptualization","addition","sexes","Saturdays","males"],"language":"en"},

Health care funding that could be spent on medicine, care for the elderly or emergency room visits are instead lost to fraudulent activities by materialistic practitioners or patients. With rising healthcare costs, healthcare fraud is a major contributor to these increasing healthcare costs. This study evaluates previous anomaly detection machine learning models and proposes an unsupervised framework to identify anomalies using a Generative Adversarial Network (GANs) model. The GANs anomaly detection (GAN-AD) model was applied on two different healthcare provider data sets. The anomalous healthcare providers were further analysed through the application of classification models with the logistic regression and extreme gradient boosting models showing good performance. Results from the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) also signifies that the predictors used explain the anomalous healthcare providers.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Naidoo, Krishnan; Marivate, Vukosi","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd8bc5c9cae7ebf86f3c42542d59af11fcf308b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134221.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134221/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsxNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare","Generative Adversarial Network"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Healthcare fraud","anomalous healthcare providers","increasing healthcare costs","rising healthcare costs","different healthcare provider data sets","GANs anomaly detection","previous anomaly detection machine learning models","application of classification models","extreme gradient boosting models","Health care funding","logistic regression","major contributor","fraudulent activities","Generative Adversarial Network","anomalies","unsupervised framework","good performance","study","GAN-AD","emergency room visits","SHapley Additive exPlanation","materialistic practitioners","patients","predictors","Results","medicine","challenge","societies"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this study was to design a model to support the alignment of value in Smart City initiatives. To address this purpose, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to find what Smart City initiatives have been addressed in empirical studies, and what dimensions and factors are linked to these initiatives. The SLR also identified the stakeholders in a Smart City, and what their roles should be linked to these initiatives. Six theories were identified and used to undergird the researcher\u2019s understanding of the domains of Smart Cities, value and alignment. The concepts from these theories were then used with the SLR findings to design a conceptual model for Smart City initiatives. The proposed Value Alignment Smart City Model (VASC) can be used to plan or assess Smart City initiatives. The main contribution is the alignment of value amongst stakeholders to support the success of such initiatives. Further research is required to investigate adopting the model and empirically evaluate it.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"van der Hoogen, Anthea; Scholtz, Brenda; Calitz, Andre P.","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f4f929cf3468d601a2d0d72865a17a3da0b11b2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134298.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134298/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsyMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SLR","Value Alignment Smart City"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Smart city initiatives","new initiatives","proposed Value Alignment Smart City Model","alignment of value","domains of Smart Cities","conceptual model","stakeholders","SLR findings","purpose","theories","resources","VASC","better living conditions","systematic literature review","crises","countries","empirical studies","researcher\u2019s understanding","citizens","dimensions","factors","main contribution","success","roles","world agenda","study","concepts"],"language":"en"},

What do their inventions imply for our future? And why are they important? Sharing economy and memberships (as opposed to ownerships) are other examples of profound changes. Increasing use of shared goods, services like Uber and Airbnb, and the unstoppable trend of membership services like e-newspapers, e-libraries, and music streaming points to one conclusion: the end of the idea of ownership. On the governmental side, we have been observing an increasing inclination toward authoritarian states. Liberalism seems to have failed. People have been losing their trust in economic regimes. My argument in this chapter is that without the 2008 crisis, there would have never been these developments and innovations.","publish_time":"2020-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Erdem, Orhan","journal":"After the Crash","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1d7019093dfe505ed985ee07c783d91cac3f158.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134311.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134311/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsyMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Uber"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chapter","crisis","e-libraries","e-newspapers","groundbreaking innovations","increasing inclination","unstoppable trend of membership services","cryptocurrencies","conclusion","music streaming points","Uber","Airbnb","digital currencies","use of shared goods","technological improvements","trust","ownerships","corresponding platform blockchain","recent attempts","authoritarian states","examples of profound changes","idea of ownership","memberships","economic regimes","inventions","future","economy","People","argument","developments","Liberalism"],"language":"en"},

Mosquito-borne flaviviruses can persistently infect the mosquito central nervous system without causing dramatic pathology or influencing the mosquito behavior and lifespan. The mechanism by which the mosquito nervous system resists flaviviral infection is still largely unknown. Here we report that an Aedes aegypti homologue of the neural factor Hikaru genki (AaHig) efficiently restricts flavivirus infection of the central nervous system. AaHig was predominantly expressed in the mosquito nervous system and localized to the plasma membrane of neural cells. Functional blockade of AaHig enhanced Dengue virus (DENV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), but not Sindbis virus (SINV), replication in mosquito heads and consequently caused neural apoptosis and a dramatic reduction in the mosquito lifespan. Consistently, delivery of recombinant AaHig to mosquitoes reduced viral infection. Furthermore, the membrane-localized AaHig directly interfaced with a highly conserved motif in the surface envelope proteins of DENV and JEV, and consequently interrupted endocytic viral entry into mosquito cells. Loss of either plasma membrane targeting or virion-binding ability rendered AaHig nonfunctional. Interestingly, Culex pipien pallens Hig also demonstrated a prominent anti-flavivirus activity, suggesting a functionally conserved function for Hig. Our results demonstrate that an evolutionarily conserved antiviral mechanism prevents lethal flaviviral infection of the central nervous system in mosquitoes, and thus may facilitate flaviviral transmission in nature.","publish_time":"2015-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Xiaoping; Zhang, Rudian; Pang, Xiaojing; Liang, Guodong; Wang, Penghua; Cheng, Gong","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d17d178051c8b4585dd66e5bd7133508b3bc2402.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4411065.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4411065/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQ5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hikaru","AaHig"],"organizations":["DENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mosquito nervous system","mosquito central nervous system","mosquito cells","mosquito lifespan","mosquito heads","mosquito behavior","membrane-localized AaHig","AaHig nonfunctional","flavivirus infection","Mosquitoes","lethal flaviviral infection","delivery of recombinant AaHig","plasma membrane of neural cells","Functional blockade of AaHig enhanced Dengue virus","JEV","Sindbis virus","neural apoptosis","flaviviral transmission","conserved motif","conserved function","Japanese encephalitis virus","endocytic viral entry","dramatic pathology","neural factor Hikaru genki","dramatic reduction","antiviral mechanism","etiologic agents of human viral diseases","surface envelope proteins of DENV","prominent anti-flavivirus activity","virion-binding ability","Aedes aegypti homologue","SINV","replication","natural vectors","flaviviruses","Culex pipien","nature","Loss","results"],"language":"en"},

These antibodies predominantly confer homosubtypic/strain specific protection and only rarely confer heterosubtypic protection. However, recent academia or pharma-led R\u0026D toward the production of a \u201Cuniversal vaccine\u201D has centered on the elicitation of antibodies directed against the stalk of the influenza HA that has been shown to confer broad protection across a range of different subtypes (H1\u2013H16). The accurate and sensitive measurement of antibody responses elicited by these \u201Cnext-generation\u201D influenza vaccines is, however, hampered by the lack of sensitivity of the traditional influenza serological assays HI, single radial hemolysis, and microneutralization. Assays utilizing pseudotypes, chimeric viruses bearing influenza glycoproteins, have been shown to be highly efficient for the measurement of homosubtypic and heterosubtypic broadly neutralizing antibodies, making them ideal serological tools for the study of cross-protective responses against multiple influenza subtypes with pandemic potential. In this review, we will analyze and compare literature involving the production of influenza pseudotypes with particular emphasis on their use in serum antibody neutralization assays. This will enable us to establish the parameters required for optimization and propose a consensus protocol to be employed for the further deployment of these assays in influenza vaccine immunogenicity studies.","publish_time":"2015-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carnell, George William; Ferrara, Francesca; Grehan, Keith; Thompson, Craig Peter; Temperton, Nigel James","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6bd542932368c6d6a32847714e3327136f3c4bd8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4413832.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4413832/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQ5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza HA","influenza glycoproteins","production of influenza pseudotypes","influenza virus entry","multiple influenza subtypes","licensed influenza vaccines","traditional influenza serological assays HI","influenza vaccine immunogenicity studies","neutralizing antibodies","competent antibodies","elicitation of antibodies","heterosubtypic protection","serum antibody neutralization assays","measurement of homosubtypic","specific protection","broad protection","sensitive measurement of antibody responses","protective responses","use of vaccination","universal vaccine","target cells","ideal serological tools","range of different subtypes","single radial hemolysis","study of cross","particular emphasis","hemagglutination-inhibition","effective method","chimeric viruses","globular head of hemagglutinin","significant morbidity","pandemic potential","pharma","lack of sensitivity","stalk","optimization","recent academia","microneutralization","H16","mortality","literature","deployment","consensus protocol","generation","parameters","review"],"language":"en"},

Highly pathogenic influenza virus infections generally coincide with early, high levels of inflammatory cytokines that some studies have suggested may be regulated in a strain-dependent manner. However, a comprehensive characterization of the complex dynamics of the inflammatory response induced by virulent influenza strains is lacking. Here, we applied gene co-expression and nonlinear regression analysis to time-course, microarray data developed from influenza-infected mouse lung to create mathematical models of the host inflammatory response. We found that the dynamics of inflammation-associated gene expression are regulated by an ultrasensitive-like mechanism in which low levels of virus induce minimal gene expression but expression is strongly induced once a threshold virus titer is exceeded. Cytokine assays confirmed that the production of several key inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 6 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1, exhibit ultrasensitive behavior. A systematic exploration of the pathways regulating the inflammatory-associated gene response suggests that the molecular origins of this ultrasensitive response mechanism lie within the branch of the Toll-like receptor pathway that regulates STAT1 phosphorylation. This study provides the first evidence of an ultrasensitive mechanism regulating influenza virus-induced inflammation in whole lungs and provides insight into how different virus strains can induce distinct temporal inflammation response profiles. The approach developed here should facilitate the construction of gene regulatory models of other infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2015-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shoemaker, Jason E.; Fukuyama, Satoshi; Eisfeld, Amie J.; Zhao, Dongming; Kawakami, Eiryo; Sakabe, Saori; Maemura, Tadashi; Gorai, Takeo; Katsura, Hiroaki; Muramoto, Yukiko; Watanabe, Shinji; Watanabe, Tokiko; Fuji, Ken; Matsuoka, Yukiko; Kitano, Hiroaki; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97dcaec2b47254a6f739907b6145edb6345844a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4457877.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4457877/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzU0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Cytokine"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inflammatory-associated gene response","influenza virus-induced inflammation","ultrasensitive response mechanism","associated gene expression","host inflammatory response","ultrasensitive mechanism","influenza pandemic","minimal gene expression","gene co-expression","pathogenic influenza virus infections","virulent influenza strains","different virus strains","low levels of virus","key inflammatory cytokines","high levels of inflammatory cytokines","dynamics of inflammation","ultrasensitive behavior","threshold virus titer","construction of gene regulatory models","influenza-infected mouse lung","distinct temporal inflammation response profiles","Influenza viruses present major challenges","mathematical models","complex dynamics","nonlinear regression analysis","time-course","public health","molecular origins","microarray data","interleukin","production","insight","pathways","lungs","branch","monocyte chemotactic protein","receptor pathway","infectious diseases","evidence","STAT1 phosphorylation","Toll","comprehensive characterization","studies","systematic exploration","strain-dependent manner","Cytokine assays","approach","study"],"language":"en"},

However, the biochemistry of hematophagy has been studied in a few species of direct medical interest and is still underdeveloped in most invertebrates, as in general is the study of venom toxins. In cone snails, leeches, arthropods and snakes, the strong target specificity of venom toxins uniquely aligns them to industrial and academic pursuits (pharmacological applications, pest control etc.) and provides a biochemical tool for studying biological activities including cell signalling and immunological response. Neogastropod snails (cones, oyster drills etc.) are carnivorous and include active predators, scavengers, grazers on sessile invertebrates and hematophagous parasites; most of them use venoms to efficiently feed. It has been hypothesized that trophic innovations were the main drivers of rapid radiation of Neogastropoda in the late Cretaceous. We present here the first molecular characterization of the alimentary secretion of a non-conoidean neogastropod, Colubraria reticulata. Colubrariids successfully feed on the blood of fishes, throughout the secretion into the host of a complex mixture of anaesthetics and anticoagulants. We used a NGS RNA-Seq approach, integrated with differential expression analyses and custom searches for putative secreted feeding-related proteins, to describe in detail the salivary and mid-oesophageal transcriptomes of this Mediterranean vampire snail, with functional and evolutionary insights on major families of bioactive molecules. RESULTS: A remarkably low level of overlap was observed between the gene expression in the two target tissues, which also contained a high percentage of putatively secreted proteins when compared to the whole body. At least 12 families of feeding-related proteins were identified, including: 1) anaesthetics, such as ShK Toxin-containing proteins and turripeptides (ion-channel blockers), Cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs), Adenosine Deaminase (ADA); 2) inhibitors of primary haemostasis, such as novel vWFA domain-containing proteins, the Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 5 (ENPP5) and the wasp Antigen-5; 3) anticoagulants, such as TFPI-like multiple Kunitz-type protease inhibitors, Peptidases S1 (PS1), CAP/ShKT domain-containing proteins, Astacin metalloproteases and Astacin/ShKT domain-containing proteins; 4) additional proteins, such the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE: vasopressive) and the cytolytic Porins. CONCLUSIONS: Colubraria feeding physiology seems to involve inhibitors of both primary and secondary haemostasis, anaesthetics, a vasoconstrictive enzyme to reduce feeding time and tissue-degrading proteins such as Porins and Astacins. The complexity of Colubraria venomous cocktail and the divergence from the arsenal of the few neogastropods studied to date (mostly conoideans) suggest that biochemical diversification of neogastropods might be largely underestimated and worth of extensive investigation.

It is an emerging orthopoxvirus zoonosis in the tropical rain forest of Africa and is endemic in the Congo-basin and sporadic in West Africa; it remains a tropical neglected disease of persons in impoverished rural areas. Interaction of the human population with wildlife increases human infection with MPX virus (MPXV), and infection from human to human is possible. Smallpox vaccination provides good cross-protection against MPX; however, the vaccination campaign ended in Africa in 1980, meaning that a large proportion of the population is currently unprotected against MPXV infection. Disease control hinges on deterring zoonotic exposure to the virus and, barring that, interrupting person-to-person spread. However, there are no FDA-approved therapies against MPX, and current vaccines are limited due to safety concerns. For this reason, new studies on pathogenesis, prophylaxis and therapeutics are still of great interest, not only for the scientific community but also for the governments concerned that MPXV could be used as a bioterror agent. In the present study, a new vaccination strategy approach based on three recombinant bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) vectors, each expressing different MPXV glycoproteins, A29L, M1R and B6R were investigated in terms of protection from a lethal MPXV challenge in STAT1 knockout mice. BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD(106)\u0394TK, BoHV-4-A-EF1\u03B1-M1RgD(106)\u0394TK and BoHV-4-A-EF1\u03B1-B6RgD(106)\u0394TK were successfully constructed by recombineering, and their capacity to express their transgene was demonstrated. A small challenge study was performed, and all three recombinant BoHV-4 appeared safe (no weight-loss or obvious adverse events) following intraperitoneal administration. Further, BoHV-4-A-EF1\u03B1-M1RgD(106)\u0394TK alone or in combination with BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD(106)\u0394TK and BoHV-4-A-EF1\u03B1-B6RgD(106)\u0394TK, was shown to be able to protect, 100% alone and 80% in combination, STAT1((-/-)) mice against mortality and morbidity.

Each population of RNA virus is composed of a collection of different, yet related genomes often referred to as mutant spectra or quasispecies. Virologists using deep sequencing technologies face major obstacles when studying virus population dynamics, both experimentally and in natural settings due to the relatively high error rates of these technologies and the lack of high performance pipelines. In order to overcome these hurdles we developed a computational pipeline, termed ViVan (Viral Variance Analysis). ViVan is a complete pipeline facilitating the identification, characterization and comparison of sequence variance in deep sequenced virus populations. Results: Applying ViVan on deep sequenced data obtained from samples that were previously characterized by more classical approaches, we uncovered novel and potentially crucial aspects of virus populations. With our experimental work, we illustrate how ViVan can be used for studies ranging from the more practical, detection of resistant mutations and effects of antiviral treatments, to the more theoretical temporal characterization of the population in evolutionary studies.

NFE2L2 is involved in the response to oxidative stress, and it has been shown to be associated with the development of ARDS in trauma patients. METHODS: We performed a case\u2013control study of 321 patients fulfilling international criteria for severe sepsis and ARDS who were admitted to a Spanish network of post-surgical and critical care units, as well as 871 population-based controls. Six tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of NFE2L2 were genotyped, and, after further imputation of additional 34 SNPs, association testing with ARDS susceptibility was conducted using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: After multiple testing adjustments, our analysis revealed 10 non-coding SNPs in tight linkage disequilibrium (0.75 \u2264 r(2) \u2264 1) that were associated with ARDS susceptibility as a single association signal. One of those SNPs (rs672961) was previously associated with trauma-induced ARDS and modified the promoter activity of the NFE2L2 gene, showing an odds ratio of 1.93 per T allele (95 % confidence interval, 1.17\u20133.18; p = 0.0089). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the involvement of NFE2L2 gene variants in ARDS susceptibility and reinforce further exploration of the role of oxidant stress response as a risk factor for ARDS in critically ill patients.","publish_time":"2015-06-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Acosta-Herrera, Marialbert; Pino-Yanes, Maria; Blanco, Jes\u00FAs; Ballesteros, Juan Carlos; Ambr\u00F3s, Alfonso; Corrales, Almudena; Gand\u00EDa, Francisco; Subir\u00E1, Carl\u00E9s; Dom\u00EDnguez, David; Baluja, Aurora; A\u00F1\u00F3n, Jos\u00E9 Manuel; Adalia, Ram\u00F3n; P\u00E9rez-M\u00E9ndez, Lina; Flores, Carlos; Villar, Jesus","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/59101f0b10ada2accaff0d77e528a9388b234c73.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4484894.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4484894/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzU3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ARDS susceptibility","development of ARDS","trauma-induced ARDS","trauma patients","involvement of NFE2L2 gene variants","ill patients","non-coding SNPs","association testing","severe sepsis","single association signal","risk factor","common variants","role of oxidant stress response","control study","oxidative stress","nuclear factor erythroid","multiple testing adjustments","logistic regression analysis","tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms","international criteria","tight linkage disequilibrium","Spanish network of post-surgical","critical care units","acute respiratory distress syndrome","T allele","odds ratio","exploration","promoter activity","case","findings","confidence interval","imputation of additional","RESULTS","population-based controls","CONCLUSIONS","INTRODUCTION","purpose","rs672961","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Understanding how activation alters the transcriptome of these cells may offer valuable insight regarding how activation of these cells mediate neurological damage. Furthermore, identifying common and unique pathways of gene expression during activation may provide new insight into the distinct roles these cells have in the CNS during infection and inflammation. Since recent studies indicate that TLR7 recognizes not only viral RNA but also microRNAs that are released by damaged neurons and elevated during neurological diseases, we first examined the response of glial cells to TLR7 stimulation using microarray analysis. Microglia were found to generate a much stronger response to TLR7 activation than astrocytes, both in the number of genes induced as well as fold induction. Although the primary pathways induced by both cell types were directly linked to immune responses, microglia also induced pathways associated with cellular proliferation, while astrocytes did not. Targeted analysis of a subset of the upregulated genes identified unique mRNA, including Ifi202b which was only upregulated by microglia and was found to be induced during both retroviral and bunyavirus infections in the CNS. In addition, other genes including Birc3 and Gpr84 as well as two expressed sequences AW112010 and BC023105 were found to be induced in both microglia and astrocytes and were upregulated in the CNS following virus infection.

A multitude of genetic and exogenous causes are responsible for few other cases. Goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of GATA2 deficiency in children and adults with PAP and hematologic disorders. METHODS: Of 21 patients with GM-CSF-autoantibody negative PAP, 13 had no other organ involvement and 8 had some form of hematologic disorder. The latter were sequenced for GATA2. RESULTS: Age at start of PAP ranged from 0.3 to 64 years, 4 patients were children. In half of the subjects GATA2-sequence variations were found, two of which were considered disease causing. Those two patients had the typical phenotype of GATA2 deficiency, one of whom additionally showed a previously undescribed feature \u2013 a cholesterol pneumonia. Hematologic disorders included chronic myeloic leukemia, juvenile myelo-monocytic leukemia, lymphoblastic leukemia, sideroblastic anemia and two cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). A 4 year old child with MDS and DiGeorge Syndrome Type 2 was rescued with repetitive whole lung lavages and her PAP was cured with heterologous stem cell transplant. CONCLUSIONS: In children and adults with severe GM-CSF negative PAP a close cooperation between pneumologists and hemato-oncologists is needed to diagnose the underlying diseases, some of which are caused by mutations of transcription factor GATA2.

The pore-forming toxin pneumolysin is a key virulence factor of S. pneumoniae, which can be sensed by the NLRP3 inflammasome. Among the over 90 serotypes, serotype 1 pneumococci (particularly MLST306) have emerged across the globe as a major cause of invasive disease. The cause for its particularity is, however, incompletely understood. We therefore examined pneumococcal infection in human cells and a human lung organ culture system mimicking infection of the lower respiratory tract. We demonstrate that different pneumococcal serotypes differentially activate inflammasome-dependent IL-1\u03B2 production in human lung tissue and cells. Whereas serotype 2, 3, 6B, 9N pneumococci expressing fully haemolytic pneumolysins activate NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent responses, serotype 1 and 8 strains expressing non-haemolytic toxins are poor activators of IL-1\u03B2 production. Accordingly, purified haemolytic pneumolysin but not serotype 1-associated non-haemolytic toxin activates strong IL-1\u03B2 production in human lungs. Our data suggest that the evasion of inflammasome-dependent innate immune responses by serotype 1 pneumococci might contribute to their ability to cause invasive diseases in humans.","publish_time":"2015-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fatykhova, Diana; Rabes, Anne; Machnik, Christoph; Guruprasad, Kunchur; Pache, Florence; Berg, Johanna; Toennies, Mario; Bauer, Torsten T.; Schneider, Paul; Schimek, Maria; Eggeling, Stephan; Mitchell, Timothy J.; Mitchell, Andrea M.; Hilker, Rolf; Hain, Torsten; Suttorp, Norbert; Hippenstiel, Stefan; Hocke, Andreas C.; Opitz, Bastian","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92f4de5e3cd8e63cd679d4af3db2d4d44e929ecd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4552725.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4552725/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzYyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inflammasome-dependent IL","human cells","\u03B2 production","NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent responses","human lungs","evasion of inflammasome","haemolytic pneumolysins","human lung tissue","non-haemolytic toxins","major cause of pneumonia","major cause of invasive disease","strong IL","pneumococcal infection","N pneumococci","toxin pneumolysin","human lung organ culture system","dependent innate immune responses","poor activators of IL","different pneumococcal serotypes","invasive diseases","Streptococcus pneumoniae","strains","key virulence factor","lower respiratory tract","ability","sepsis","globe","humans","meningitis","MLST306","data","pore","particularity"],"language":"en"},

Data on severe forms of measles in adults are lacking. We sought to describe the epidemiologic, clinical, treatment, and prognostic aspects of the disease in adult patients who required admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). We performed a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 36 adults admitted to a total of 64 ICUs throughout France for complications of measles from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2011. All cases of measles were confirmed by serologic testing and/or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The cohort consisted of 21 male and 15 female patients, with a median age of 29.2 years (25th\u201375th interquartile range [IQR], 27.2\u201334.2 yr) and a median Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) of 13 (IQR, 9\u201318). Among the 26 patients whose measles vaccination status was documented, none had received 2 injections. One patient had developed measles during childhood. Underlying comorbid conditions included chronic respiratory disease in 9 patients, immunosuppression in 7 patients, and obesity in 3 patients, while measles affected 5 pregnant women. Respiratory complications induced by measles infection led to ICU admission in 32 cases, and measles-related neurologic complications led to ICU admission in 2 cases. Two patients were admitted due to concurrent respiratory and neurologic complications. Bacterial superinfection of measles-related airway infection was suspected in 28 patients and was documented in 8. Four cases of community-acquired pneumonia, 6 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia, 1 case of tracheobronchitis, and 2 cases of sinusitis were microbiologically substantiated. Of 11 patients who required mechanical ventilation, 9 developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Among the patients with ARDS, extraalveolar air leak complications occurred in 4 cases. Five patients died, all of whom were severely immunocompromised. On follow-up, 1 patient had severe chronic respiratory failure related to lung fibrosis, and 2 patients had mild lower limb paraparesis along with bladder dysfunction, both of which were ascribable to measles-induced encephalitis and myelitis. Among the 5 pregnant patients, the course of measles infection was uneventful, albeit 1 patient underwent emergent cesarean delivery because of fetal growth restriction. Measles is a disease with protean and potentially deceptive clinical manifestations, especially in the immunocompromised patient. Measles-associated pneumonitis and its complications, and less commonly postinfectious encephalomyelitis, are the main source of morbidity and mortality. In contrast with the usually benign course of the disease in immunocompetent patients, measles occurring in immunocompromised patients gives rise to lethal complications including ARDS, with or without bacterial superinfection. Other patients potentially at high risk for severe measles are young adults and pregnant women. Measles pneumonitis may predispose to air leak disease in patients using mechanical ventilation. To date, vaccination remains the most potent tool to control measles infection.","publish_time":"2013-09-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rafat, C\u00E9dric; Klouche, Kada; Ricard, Jean-Damien; Messika, Jonathan; Roch, Antoine; Machado, Sonia; Sonneville, Romain; Guisset, Olivier; Pujol, Wilfried; Gu\u00E9rin, Claude; Teboul, Jean-Louis; Mrozek, Natacha; Darmon, Micha\u00EBl; Chemouni, Frank; Schmidt, Matthieu; Mercier, Emmanuelle; Dreyfuss, Didier; Gaudry, St\u00E9phane","journal":"Medicine (Baltimore)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6da81d5a45c958bbd505b7775741c9e7a94ca04b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4553975.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4553975/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzYyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","ARDS"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["complications of measles","cases of measles","severe measles","Measles pneumonitis","pregnant patients","immunocompromised patients","immunocompetent patients","adult patients","female patients","course of measles infection","measles-related neurologic complications","severe forms of measles","Measles-associated pneumonitis","Bacterial superinfection of measles","measles vaccination status","measles-induced encephalitis","nationwide outbreak of measles","Respiratory complications","chronic respiratory disease","lethal complications","cases of ventilator","cases of community","cases of sinusitis","air leak disease","extraalveolar air leak complications","ARDS","ICU admission","severe chronic respiratory failure","related airway infection","pregnant women","acute respiratory distress syndrome","young adults","mechanical ventilation","associated pneumonia","France","IQR","cohort","median age","benign course","median Simplified Acute Physiology Score","deceptive clinical manifestations","emergent cesarean delivery","SAPS","mild lower limb paraparesis","lung fibrosis","rise","fetal growth restriction","prognostic aspects","high risk","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","bladder dysfunction","serologic testing","case of tracheobronchitis","immunosuppression","main source of morbidity","potent tool","intensive care unit","years","treatment","postinfectious encephalomyelitis","yr","comorbid conditions","ICUs","obesity","mortality","interquartile range","total","follow-up","Data","retrospective analysis","date","contrast","childhood","injections"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: The current study aims to establish the use of rolling circle amplification (RCA) based on internal transcribed spacer ribosomal DNA (ITS rDNA) as a powerful, simple, and rapid procedure for distinguishing closely related organisms, and specifically to identify Trichophyton species, which cause human and animal disorders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of sixty-one isolates belonging to three species of Trichophyton were identified to the species level based on microscopic and macroscopic examinations and their ITS rDNA regions were sequenced. Three specific circular oligonucleotide probes targeting the ITS1 and ITS2 regions were designed to differentiate Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, and T. tonsurans. RESULTS: Of the 61 putative Trichophyton clinical isolates, 52 were identified to the species level. The most common species was T. mentagrophytes var. interdigitale (31 isolates), followed by T. rubrum (11 isolates), T. tonsurans (9 isolates), and T. violaceum (1 isolates); moreover, 9 isolates were identified as non-Trichophyton species. The RCA method correctly identified four Trichophyton species and was 100% specific for each species. Neither cross-reaction between the examined species of Trichophyton nor false positive or false negative results were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Species identification of Trichophyton is crucially important for epidemiological and phylogenetic purposes and for genotype delineation. RCA based on ITS polymorphisms can be used to generate identification barcodes and as an alternative to DNA sequencing; it is a very fast, specific, and economical tool for species identification.","publish_time":"2015-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zakeri, Hamideh; Shokohi, Tahereh; Badali, Hamid; Mayahi, Saba; Didehdar, Mojtaba","journal":"Jundishapur J Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/680adbe0c280f4774383793afb8b70fd9ab3d5d0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4584133.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4584133/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzY1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["T. rubrum"],"organizations":["RCA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Species identification of Trichophyton","examined species of Trichophyton","non-Trichophyton species","species level","common species","Trichophyton rubrum","putative Trichophyton clinical isolates","identification barcodes","identification difficult","rDNA regions","RCA method","mentagrophytes","tonsurans","false negative results","specific circular oligonucleotide probes","ITS2 regions","DNA sequencing","internal transcribed spacer ribosomal DNA","ITS1","high degree of phenotypic similarity","macroscopic examinations","rapid procedure","phylogenetic purposes","economical tool","use of rolling circle amplification","alternative","interdigitale","genotype delineation","related organisms","current study","BACKGROUND","METHODS","total","cross-reaction","CONCLUSIONS","animal disorders","OBJECTIVES","MATERIALS","polymorphisms","violaceum"],"language":"en"},

For this purpose, we conducted a literature search on the main medical databases. SNCD poses a diagnostic dilemma. Villous blunting, intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) count and gluten \u201Cchallenge\u201D are the most reliable markers. Immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence tissue transglutaminase (tTG)-targeted mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) immune complexes in the intestinal mucosa of SNCD patients may be useful. In our experience, tTG-mRNA was similarly increased in seropositive celiac disease (CD) and suspected SNCD, and strongly correlated with the IELs count. This increase is found even in the IELs\u2019 range of 15\u201325/100 enterocytes, suggesting that there may be a \u201Cgrey zone\u201D of gluten-related disorders. An immune deregulation (severely lacking B-cell differentiation) underlies the association of SNCD with immunoglobulin deficiencies. Therefore, CD may be linked to autoimmune disorders and immune deficits (common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)/IgA selective deficiency). CVID is a heterogeneous group of antibodies dysfunction, whose association with CD is demonstrated only by the response to a gluten-free diet (GFD). We hypothesized a familial inheritance between CD and CVID. Selective IgA deficiency, commonly associated with CD, accounts for IgA-tTG seronegativity. Selective IgM deficiency (sIgMD) is rare (\u003C300 cases) and associated to CD in 5% of cases. We diagnosed SNCD in a patient affected by sIgMD using the tTG-mRNA assay. One-year GFD induced IgM restoration. This evidence, supporting a link between SNCD and immunoglobulin deficiencies, suggests that we should take a closer look at this association.","publish_time":"2015-09-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Giorgio, Floriana; Principi, Mariabeatrice; Losurdo, Giuseppe; Piscitelli, Domenico; Iannone, Andrea; Barone, Michele; Amoruso, Annacinzia; Ierardi, Enzo; Di Leo, Alfredo","journal":"Nutrients","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd1d9c526a0194d356d7a65ebcebc322dd872a36.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4586545.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4586545/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzY1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SNCD","CVID"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["association of SNCD","suspected SNCD","immunoglobulin deficiencies","IgA selective deficiency","Selective IgA deficiency","CVID","IgA-tTG seronegativity","Selective IgM deficiency","intestinal mucosa of SNCD patients","IELs count","tTG-mRNA assay","immune deficits","immune complexes","immune deregulation","targeted mucosal immunoglobulin","sIgMD","gluten-related disorders","cases","seronegative celiac disease","seropositive celiac disease","gluten-free diet","autoimmune disorders","year GFD induced IgM restoration","common variable immunodeficiency","relationship","intraepithelial lymphocytes","literature search","immunofluorescence tissue transglutaminase","lacking B-cell differentiation","heterogeneous group of antibodies dysfunction","challenge","main medical databases","Villous blunting","Immunohistochemistry","response","link","accounts","grey zone","familial inheritance","present narrative review","reliable markers","purpose","range","closer look","diagnostic dilemma","evidence","experience","enterocytes","increase"],"language":"en"},

We have previously shown that the T362I substitution leads to a lower fidelity RdRp, and viruses encoding this variant are attenuated in a mouse model of poliovirus. Given these results, it was surprising that the nucleotide incorporation rate and nucleobase fidelity of the Sabin I RdRp is similar to that of wild-type enzyme, although the Sabin I RdRp is less selective against nucleotides with modified sugar groups. We suggest that the other Sabin amino acid changes (i.e., D53N, Y73H, K250E) help to re-establish nucleotide incorporation rates and nucleotide discrimination near wild-type levels, which may be a requirement for the propagation of the virus and its efficacy as a vaccine strain.

Epidemiological studies suggest that, following infection with influenza virus, there is a short period during which a host experiences a lower susceptibility to infection with other influenza viruses. This viral interference appears to be independent of any antigenic similarities between the viruses. We used the ferret model of human influenza to systematically investigate viral interference. Methods. Ferrets were first infected then challenged 1\u201314 days later with pairs of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B viruses circulating in 2009 and 2010. Results. Viral interference was observed when the interval between initiation of primary infection and subsequent challenge was \u003C1 week. This effect was virus specific and occurred between antigenically related and unrelated viruses. Coinfections occurred when 1 or 3 days separated infections. Ongoing shedding from the primary virus infection was associated with viral interference after the secondary challenge. Conclusions. The interval between infections and the sequential combination of viruses were important determinants of viral interference.

Correct handwashing can prevent 50 to 70% of water-infections and foodborne-infections. We report the results of a fact-finding study on general handwashing attitude and practice in the Republic of Korea by analyzing habits and awareness among adults and students (grades 4 to 12) based on the 2006 to 2014 National Handwashing Surveys and observational surveys. METHODS: The awareness survey was performed by telephone interviews with adults and students in 16 municipalities and provinces sampled by quota for region, sex and age. The observational survey was performed in subway, railway, and other public restrooms in seven municipalities selected through systematic sampling. RESULTS: Adults and students washed their hands with soap/sanitizer an average of 6.6 and 5.2 times daily, respectively, in 2014, an increase and decrease compared to 2006 (4.8) and 2013 (6.8). Their average daily handwashing frequency in 2014, 9.8 and 8.3, was higher than in 2006 (7.6), but lower than in 2013 (10.3).The percentage of participants handwashing with soap after using the restroom (29.5%) has been increasing since 2009, but remain slower than in other countries (42% to 49%). The percentages of participants handwashing with water in 2014, 2013, and 2011 were 57.5%, 72.6%, and 71.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Handwashing with soap is an important national public health issue, and national projects promoting it should be given high priority. Research support is necessary to provide scientific evidence of the importance of handwashing with soap and to develop and implement evidence-based policies.","publish_time":"2015-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Moo-Sik; Hong, Su Jin; Kim, Young-Taek","journal":"Epidemiol Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1edab5890fbff22ad353739d3d1e80a86d482820.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4652062.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4652062/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzczNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Handwashing Surveys"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["importance of handwashing","Correct handwashing","National Handwashing Surveys","soap","percentages of participants handwashing","percentage of participants handwashing","general handwashing attitude","average daily handwashing frequency","students","adults","national projects","awareness survey","municipalities","observational surveys","water-infections","results","important national public health issue","evidence-based policies","public restrooms","scientific evidence","foodborne-infections","practice","fact-finding study","quota","habits","telephone interviews","hands","Republic of Korea","region","railway","fundamental way","provinces","subway","Research support","spread of infectious diseases","sex","sanitizer","grades","systematic sampling","METHODS","OBJECTIVES","CONCLUSIONS","high priority","countries","times","increase"],"language":"en"},

To guide treatment and prevent spread of the viral infection, a rapid and sensitive detection method is required for clinical samples. Here, we described and evaluated a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method to detect Zaire ebolavirus using the nucleoprotein gene (NP) as a target sequence. Two different techniques were used, a calcein/Mn(2\u002B) complex chromogenic method and real-time turbidity monitoring. The RT-LAMP assay detected the NP target sequence with a limit of 4.56 copies/\u03BCL within 45 min under 61\u00B0C, a similar even or increase in sensitivity than that of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Additionally, all pseudoviral particles or non- Zaire EBOV genomes were negative for LAMP detection, indicating that the assay was highly specific for EBOV. To appraise the availability of the RT-LAMP method for use in clinical diagnosis of EBOV, of 417 blood or swab samples collected from patients with clinically suspected infections in Sierra Leone, 307 were identified for RT-LAMP-based surveillance of EBOV. Therefore, the highly specific and sensitive RT-LAMP method allows the rapid detection of EBOV, and is a suitable tool for clinical screening, diagnosis, and primary quarantine purposes.","publish_time":"2015-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Huan; Wang, Xuesong; Liu, Wei; Wei, Xiao; Lin, Weishi; Li, Erna; Li, Puyuan; Dong, Derong; Cui, Lifei; Hu, Xuan; Li, Boxing; Ma, Yanyan; Zhao, Xiangna; Liu, Chao; Yuan, Jing","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ecd138ab31f520b06c5cf095657fab2685a8209.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4664619.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4664619/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozc0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NP","EBOV"],"locations":["Zaire"],"keyphrases":["sensitive RT-LAMP method","RT-LAMP assay","LAMP detection","clinical diagnosis of EBOV","rapid detection of EBOV","RT-PCR","sensitive detection method","based surveillance of EBOV","non- Zaire EBOV genomes","clinical samples","complex chromogenic method","clinical screening","NP target sequence","reverse transcription loop","real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","Zaire ebolavirus","swab samples","real-time turbidity monitoring","isothermal amplification","patients","high risk of death","use","severe hemorrhagic fever","viral infection","limit","pseudoviral particles","blood","suitable tool","suspected infections","nucleoprotein gene","humans","Sierra Leone","primary quarantine purposes","sensitivity","calcein","spread","Mn","copies","availability","different techniques","treatment","primates","\u03BCL","Ebola virus"],"language":"en"},

Here we will provide a description of the main approaches and examples of innovative applications.","publish_time":"2015-12-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Romero-Brey, In\u00E9s; Bartenschlager, Ralf","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86effe356ffd602c096c4252ef1775dab6f62e1f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4690864.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4690864/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozc2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["conventional EM","D-EM methods","development of three-dimensional EM","viruses","virus-host cell interactions","main approaches","intracellular architecture","obligate intracellular parasites","entry","viral life cycle","important information","different steps","attachment","assembly","replication","egress","electron microscopy","unprecedented insights","examples of innovative applications","genomes","machineries","cellular hosts","order","direct visualization","description","years"],"language":"en"},

Acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction are major complications in patients with severe influenza infection. This may be explained by the recent studies which highlighted the role of the pulmonary endothelium as the center of innate immune cells recruitment and excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines production. In this report, we examined the potential immunomodulatory effects of two indirubin derivatives, indirubin-3\u2032-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-oximether (E804) and indirubin-3\u2032-oxime (E231), on IAV (H9N2) infected-human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs). Infection of H9N2 on HPMECs induced a high level of chemokines and cytokines production including IP-10, RANTES, IL-6, IFN-\u03B2 and IFN-\u03B31. Post-treatment of E804 or E231 could significantly suppress the production of these cytokines. H9N2 infection rapidly triggered the activation of innate immunity through phosphorylation of signaling molecules including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. Using specific inhibitors or small-interfering RNA, we confirmed that indirubin derivatives can suppress H9N2-induced cytokines production through MAPKs and STAT3 signaling pathways. These results underscore the immunomodulatory effects of indirubin derivatives on pulmonary endothelium and its therapeutic potential on IAV-infection.","publish_time":"2016-01-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kwok, Hoi-Hin; Poon, Po-Ying; Fok, Siu-Ping; Ying-Kit Yue, Patrick; Mak, Nai-Ki; Chan, Michael Chi-Wai; Peiris, Joseph Sriyal Malik; Wong, Ricky Ngok-Shun","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc24e1b58aa068d810743e726f98ef82af89f349.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4702174.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4702174/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozc4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Infection of H9N2","H9N2 infection","H9N2-induced cytokines production","IAV-infection","immunomodulatory effects of indirubin derivatives","pulmonary endothelium","severe influenza infection","excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines production","MAPKs","potential immunomodulatory effects","HPMECs","E231","human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells","therapeutic potential","human health","IFN-\u03B2","IFN-\u03B31","center of innate immune cells recruitment","activation of innate immunity","Post-treatment of E804","multi-organ dysfunction","major complications","molecules","patients","Acute respiratory distress syndrome","signal transducer","mitogen-activated protein kinases","high level of chemokines","activator of transcription","phosphorylation","small-interfering RNA","global threats","STAT3","specific inhibitors","IL","role","virus","RANTES","proteins","pathways","oximether","results","recent studies","dihydroxypropyl","report"],"language":"en"},

A better understanding of the ferroptotic death mechanism could lead to the development of new therapeutics for degenerative diseases, and a better understanding of how to induce ferroptosis in specific tumor contexts. We performed an unbiased genome-wide siRNA screen to find genetic suppressors of ferroptosis. We determined that loss of CARS, the cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase, suppresses ferroptosis induced by erastin, which inhibits the cystine\u2013glutamate antiporter known as system x(c)(\u2212). Knockdown of CARS inhibited erastin-induced death by preventing the induction of lipid reactive oxygen species, without altering iron homeostasis. Knockdown of CARS led to the accumulation of cystathionine, a metabolite on the transsulfuration pathway, and upregulated genes associated with serine biosynthesis and transsulfuration. In addition, inhibition of the transsulfuration pathway resensitized cells to erastin, even after CARS knockdown. These studies demonstrate a new mechanism of resistance to ferroptosis and may lead to strategies for inducing and suppressing ferroptosis in diverse contexts.","publish_time":"2015-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hayano, M; Yang, W S; Corn, C K; Pagano, N C; Stockwell, B R","journal":"Cell Death Differ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cf1c268c0ec1781ca1fab722163e396d199508a3.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5eb63f34d526fdc3ec2947e9ce3db5a2a1abb11f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4716307.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4716307/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozc5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Knockdown of CARS","CARS knockdown","erastin-induced death","genetic suppressors of ferroptosis","loss of CARS","ferroptotic death mechanism","better understanding","diverse contexts","disease contexts","transsulfuration pathway resensitized cells","new mechanism of resistance","specific tumor contexts","form of regulated non-apoptotic cell death","development of new therapeutics","degenerative diseases","induction of lipid reactive oxygen species","unbiased genome-wide siRNA screen","upregulated genes","inhibition","system x","glutamate antiporter","cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase","cystine","serine biosynthesis","metabolite","accumulation of cystathionine","iron homeostasis","studies","addition","strategies"],"language":"en"},

An outbreak in a college campus during the 2009 pandemic involved two subtypes of influenza A: persons infected with pandemic A/H1N1; persons infected with seasonal A/H3N2 viruses; and persons infected with both at the same time (co-infection). This provides data to analyse the possible interaction between influenza A viruses within co-infection. METHODS: We extend a statistical inference method designed for outbreaks caused by one virus to that caused by two viruses. The method uses knowledge of which subtype each case is infected with (and whether they were co-infected), contact information and symptom onset date of each case in the influenza outbreak. We then apply it to construct the most likely transmission tree during the outbreak in the college campus. RESULTS: Analysis of the constructed transmission tree shows that the simultaneous presence of the two influenza viruses increases the infectivity and the transmissibility of A/H1N1 virus but whether it changes the infectivity of A/H3N2 is unclear. The estimation also shows that co-transmission of both subtypes from co-infection is low and therefore co-infection cannot be sustained on its own. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that influenza A viruses within co-infected patients can interact in some ways rather than transmit independently, and this can enhance the spread of influenza A virus infection.

HCV replicates in the cytoplasm, and the synthesis of viral proteins induces extensive rearrangements of host cell membranes producing structures, collectively termed the membranous web (MW). The MW contains the sites of viral replication and assembly, and we have identified distinct membrane fractions derived from HCV-infected cells that contain replication and assembly complexes enriched for viral RNA and infectious virus, respectively. The complex membrane structure of the MW is thought to protect the viral genome limiting its interactions with cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and thereby preventing activation of cellular innate immune responses. Here we show that PRRs, including RIG-I and MDA5, and ribosomes are excluded from viral replication and assembly centers within the MW. Furthermore, we present evidence that components of the nuclear transport machinery regulate access of proteins to MW compartments. We show that the restricted assess of RIG-I to the MW can be overcome by the addition of a nuclear localization signal sequence, and that expression of a NLS-RIG-I construct leads to increased immune activation and the inhibition of viral replication.","publish_time":"2016-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Neufeldt, Christopher J.; Joyce, Michael A.; Van Buuren, Nicholas; Levin, Aviad; Kirkegaard, Karla; Gale Jr., Michael; Tyrrell, D.

Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned into three groups (n = 6): sham, intestinal I/R \u002B vehicle, and intestinal I/R \u002B fenofibrate. Intestinal I/R was achieved by clamping the superior mesenteric artery. Fenofibrate (100 mg/kg) or equal volume of vehicle was injected intraperitoneally 60 minutes before the ischemia. At the end of experiment, measurement of pathohistological score, inflammatory mediators and other markers were performed. In addition, a 24-hour survival experiment was conducted in intestinal I/R mice treated with fenofibrate or vehicle. The chief results were as anticipated. Pathohistological evaluation indicated that fenofibrate ameliorated the local intestine damage and distant lung injury. Pretreatment with fenofibrate significantly decreased inflammatory factors in both the intestine and the lung.

Renal ENaC takes up salt, thereby controlling salt content in serum. Loss-of-function ENaC mutations lead to low blood pressure due to salt-wasting, while gain-of-function mutations cause impaired sodium excretion and subsequent hypertension as well as hypokalemia. ENaC activity is regulated by intracellular and extracellular signals, including hormones, neurotransmitters, protein kinases, and small compounds. Cyclic nucleotides are broadly involved in stimulating protein kinase A and protein kinase G signaling pathways, and, surprisingly, also appear to have a role in regulating ENaC. Increasing evidence suggests that the cGMP analog, CPT-cGMP, activates \u03B1\u03B2\u03B3-ENaC activity reversibly through an extracellular pathway in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the parachlorophenylthio moiety and ribose 2\u0027-hydroxy group of CPT-cGMP are essential for facilitating the opening of ENaC channels by this compound. Serving as an extracellular ligand, CPT-cGMP eliminates sodium self-inhibition, which is a novel mechanism for stimulating salt reabsorption in parallel to the traditional NO/cGMP/PKG signal pathway. In conclusion, ENaC may be a druggable target for CPT-cGMP, leading to treatments for kidney malfunctions in salt reabsorption.","publish_time":"2016-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ji, Hong-Long; Nie, Hong-Guang; Chang, Yongchang; Lian, Qizhou; Liu, Shan-Lu","journal":"Int J Biol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1a03657b225afb8628f4806530db7f57645ad54.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4807156.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4807156/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozg3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CPT-cGMP","salt reabsorption","Renal ENaC","function ENaC mutations","\u03B1\u03B2\u03B3-ENaC activity","opening of ENaC channels","cGMP analog","salt content","extracellular pathway","stimulating protein kinase","protein kinases","protein kinase G","function mutations","hydroxy group of CPT","extracellular signals","extracellular ligand","Epithelial sodium channels","fluid reabsorption","impaired sodium excretion","sodium self-inhibition","PKG signal pathway","neurotransmitters","hormones","treatments","subsequent hypertension","low blood pressure","novel mechanism","kidney malfunctions","druggable target","ribose","epithelium","dose-dependent manner","small compounds","pathways","Loss","parachlorophenylthio moiety","apical membrane","Cyclic nucleotides","hypokalemia","serum","evidence","conclusion","role"],"language":"en"},

To examine coxsackievirus pathogenesis, we orally inoculated mice with the coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) Nancy strain. Using HeLa cell plaque assays with agar overlays, we noticed that some fecal viruses generated plaques \u003E100 times as large as inoculum viruses. These large-plaque variants emerged following viral replication in several different tissues. We identified a single amino acid change, N63Y, in the VP3 capsid protein that was sufficient to confer the large-plaque phenotype. Wild-type CVB3 and N63Y mutant CVB3 had similar plaque sizes when agarose was used in the overlay instead of agar. We determined that sulfated glycans in agar inhibited plaque formation by wild-type CVB3 but not by N63Y mutant CVB3. Furthermore, N63Y mutant CVB3 bound heparin, a sulfated glycan, less efficiently than wild-type CVB3 did. While N63Y mutant CVB3 had a growth defect in cultured cells and reduced attachment, it had enhanced replication and pathogenesis in mice. Infection with N63Y mutant CVB3 induced more severe hepatic damage than infection with wild-type CVB3, likely because N63Y mutant CVB3 disseminates more efficiently to the liver. Our data reinforce the idea that culture-adapted laboratory virus strains can have reduced fitness in vivo. N63Y mutant CVB3 may be useful as a platform to understand viral adaptation and pathogenesis in animal studies.","publish_time":"2016-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yao; Pfeiffer, Julie K.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/15753984412d073dd4c6daed84e3d294f728b636.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4817249.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4817249/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozg4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Wild-type CVB3","N63Y mutant CVB3 bound heparin","plaque formation","large-plaque variants","large-plaque phenotype","coxsackievirus pathogenesis","similar plaque sizes","HeLa cell plaque assays","Infection","agar overlays","fecal viruses","enteric viruses","inoculum viruses","following viral replication","viral adaptation","reduced attachment","reduced fitness","coxsackievirus B3","sulfated glycans","inoculated mice","growth defect","severe hepatic damage","culture-adapted laboratory virus strains","times","cultured cells","idea","agarose","platform","VP3 capsid protein","single amino acid change","different tissues","animal studies","plaques","Nancy strain","data","Coxsackieviruses","humans","liver"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: This review assessed the impact of different interventions implemented in LPMs to control the emergence of zoonotic influenza. METHODS: Publications were identified through a systematic literature search in the PubMed, MEDLINE and Web of Science databases. Eligible studies assessed the impact of different interventions, such as temporary market closure or a ban on holding poultry overnight, in reducing i) AIV-detection rates in birds and the market environment or ii) influenza incidence in humans. Unpublished literature, reviews, editorials, cross-sectional studies, theoretical models and publications in languages other than English were excluded. Relevant findings were extracted and critically evaluated. For the comparative analysis of findings across studies, standardized outcome measures were computed as i) the relative risk reduction (RRR) of AIV-detection in LPMs and ii) incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of H7N9-incidence in humans. RESULTS: A total of 16 publications were identified and reviewed. Collectively, the data suggest that AIV-circulation can be significantly reduced in the LPM-environment and among market-birds through (i) temporary LPM closure, (ii) periodic rest days (iii) market depopulation overnight and (iv) improved hygiene and disinfection. Overall, the findings indicate that the length of stay of poultry in the market is a critical control point to interrupt the AIV-replication cycle within LPMs. In addition, temporary LPM closure was associated with a significant reduction of the incidence of zoonotic influenza. The interpretation of these findings is limited by variations in the implementation of interventions. In addition, some of the included studies were of ecologic nature or lacked an inferential framework, which might have lead to cosiderable confounding and bias. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence collected in this review endorses permanent LPM-closure as a long-term objective to reduce the zoonotic risk of avian influenza, although its economic and socio-political implications favour less drastic interventions, e.g. weekly rest days, for implementation in the short-term.","publish_time":"2016-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Offeddu, Vittoria; Cowling, Benjamin J.; Peiris, J.S.

DC-SIGN is a C-type lectin, and interactions with mycobacterial cells are believed to occur via mannosylated structures on the mycobacterial surface. Recent studies suggest more varied modes of binding to multiple mycobacterial ligands. Here we identify, by affinity chromatography and mass-spectrometry, four novel ligands of M. bovis BCG that bind to DC-SIGN. The novel ligands are chaperone protein DnaK, 60 kDa chaperonin-1 (Cpn60.1), glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and lipoprotein lprG. Other published work strongly suggests that these are on the cell surface. Of these ligands, lprG appears to bind DC-SIGN via typical proteinglycan interactions, but DnaK and Cpn60.1 binding do not show evidence of carbohydrate-dependent interactions.

Using NIV is discussed in mild-to-moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients (PaO(2)/FiO(2) \u003E 150). These patients often have comorbidities that increase the risk for bronchoscopy related complications. The primary outcome of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety and contribution in diagnosis and/or modification of the ongoing treatment of fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) in patients with ARDS treated with NIV. METHODS: ARDS patients treated with NIV and who require FOB as the diagnostic or therapeutic procedure were included the study. Intensive care ventilators or other dedicated NIV ventilators were used. NIV was applied via simple oro-nasal mask or full-face mask. Pressure support or inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP), external positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) or expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) levels were titrated to achieve an expiratory tidal volume of 8 to 10 ml/kg according to ideal body weight, SpO(2) \u003E 90 % and respiratory rate below 25/min. RESULTS: Twenty eight subjects (mean age 63.3 \u00B1 15.9 years, 15 men, 13 women, PaO(2)/FiO(2) rate 145 \u00B1 50.1 at admission) were included the study. Overall the procedure was well tolerated with only 5 (17.9 %) patients showing minor complications. There was no impairment in arterial blood gas and cardiopulmonary parameters after FOB. PaO(2)/FiO(2) rate increased from 132.2 \u00B1 49.8 to 172.9 \u00B1 63.2 (p = 0.001). No patient was intubated within 2 h after the bronchoscopy. 10.7, 32.1 and 39.3 % of the patients required invasive mechanical ventilation after 8 h, 24 h and 48 h, respectively. Bronchoscopy provided diagnosis in 27 (96.4 %) patients. Appropriate treatment was decided according to the results of the bronchoscopic sampling in 20 (71.4 %) patients. CONCLUSION: FOB under NIV could be considered as a feasible tool for diagnosis and guide for treatment of patients with ARDS treated via NIV in intensive care units. However, FOB-correlated life-treathening complications in severe hypoxemia should not be forgotten. Furthermore, further controlled studies involving a larger series of homogeneous ARDS patients undergoing FOB under NIV are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.","publish_time":"2016-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Korkmaz Ekren, Pervin; Basarik Aydogan, Burcu; Gurgun, Alev; Tasbakan, Mehmet Sezai; Bacakoglu, Feza; Nava, Stefano","journal":"BMC Pulm Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d388c65777a90758f5310f543ca6d3fcd76577d4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4886426.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4886426/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozk2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NIV","ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of patients","dedicated NIV ventilators","larger series of homogeneous ARDS patients","expiratory positive airway pressure","diagnosis","respiratory rate","PaO","FiO","bronchoscopy related complications","inspiratory positive airway pressure","Pressure support","ongoing treatment of fiberoptic bronchoscopy","Appropriate treatment","external positive end expiratory pressure","FOB-correlated life-treathening complications","treatment of acute respiratory failure of various etiologies","Intensive care ventilators","RESULTS","minor complications","expiratory tidal volume","intensive care units","prospective observational study","moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome","full-face mask","Noninvasive ventilation","therapeutic procedure","invasive mechanical ventilation","simple oro-nasal mask","PEEP","IPAP","guide","arterial blood gas","cardiopulmonary parameters","feasibility","modification","EPAP","levels","cornerstone","severe hypoxemia","years","impairment","primary outcome","contribution","risk","feasible tool","controlled studies","mean age","ideal body weight","SpO","subjects","women","safety","diagnostic","BACKGROUND","comorbidities","METHODS","bronchoscopic sampling","admission","CONCLUSION","preliminary findings"],"language":"en"},

The specific aim of this study was to understand the epidemiological characteristics of mild and severe enterovirus cases through integrated surveillance data. METHODS: All enterovirus cases in Taiwan over almost ten years from three main databases, including national notifiable diseases surveillance, sentinel physician surveillance and laboratory surveillance programs from July 1, 1999 to December 31, 2008 were analyzed. The Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient was applied for measuring the consistency of the trends in the cases between different surveillance systems. Cross correlation analysis in a time series model was applied for examining the capability to predict severe enterovirus infections. Poisson temporal, spatial and space-time scan statistics were used for identifying the most likely clusters of severe enterovirus outbreaks. The directional distribution method with two standard deviations of ellipse was applied to measure the size and the movement of the epidemic. RESULTS: The secular trend showed that the number of severe EV cases peaked in 2008, and the number of mild EV cases was significantly correlated with that of severe ones occurring in the same week [r = 0.553, p \u003C 0.01]. These severe EV cases showed significantly higher association with the weekly positive isolation rates of EV-71 than the mild cases [severe: 0.498, p \u003C 0.01 vs. mild: 0.278, p \u003C 0.01]. In a time series model, the increase of mild EV cases was the significant predictor for the occurrence of severe EV cases. The directional distribution showed that both the mild and severe EV cases spread extensively during the peak. Before the detected spatio-temporal clusters in June 2008, the mild cases had begun to rise since May 2008, and the outbreak spread from south to north. CONCLUSIONS: Local public health professionals can monitor the temporal and spatial trends plus spatio-temporal clusters and isolation rate of EV-71 in mild and severe EV cases in a community when virus transmission is high, to provide early warning signals and to prevent subsequent severe epidemics.","publish_time":"2014-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, Ta-Chien; Hwang, Jing-Shiang; Chen, Rung-Hung; King, Chwan-Chuen; Chiang, Po-Huang","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2df3338b3237408866c67f074398862f8180caef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3890494.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3890494/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzEy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Cambodia"],"keyphrases":["mild cases","severe enterovirus cases","number of severe EV cases","occurrence of severe EV cases","number of mild EV cases","increase of mild EV cases","severe ones","Severe epidemics of enterovirus","severe enterovirus infections","cases of pulmonary edema","subsequent severe epidemics","likely clusters of severe enterovirus outbreaks","isolation rate of EV","epidemiological characteristics of mild","weekly positive isolation rates of EV","Poisson temporal","detected spatio-temporal clusters","sentinel physician surveillance","laboratory surveillance programs","integrated surveillance data","different surveillance systems","national notifiable diseases surveillance","spatial trends","time series model","Taiwan","directional distribution method","Cross correlation analysis","Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient","higher association","significant predictor","community","main databases","early warning signals","encephalitis","Local public health professionals","hemorrhage","Cambodia","China","virus transmission","standard deviations of ellipse","space-time scan statistics","study","CONCLUSIONS","Malaysia","years","capability","effective vaccine","secular trend","size","Singapore","consistency","BACKGROUND","METHODS","south","north","movement","specific aim","RESULTS","peak"],"language":"en"},

Here, we present a methodology for recovering such antibodies from antigen-encountered human B cell repertoires. As the source for variable antibody genes, we cloned immunoglobulin G (IgG)-derived B cell repertoires from lymph nodes of 20 individuals undergoing surgery for head and neck cancer. Sequence analysis of unselected \u201CLYmph Node Derived Antibody Libraries\u201D (LYNDAL) revealed a naturally occurring distribution pattern of rearranged antibody sequences, representing all known variable gene families and most functional germline sequences. To demonstrate the feasibility for selecting antibodies with therapeutic potential from these repertoires, seven LYNDAL from donors with high serum titers against herpes simplex virus (HSV) were panned on recombinant glycoprotein B of HSV-1. Screening for specific binders delivered 34 single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) with unique sequences. Sequence analysis revealed extensive somatic hypermutation of enriched clones as a result of affinity maturation. Binding of scFvs to common glycoprotein B variants from HSV-1 and HSV-2 strains was highly specific, and the majority of analyzed antibody fragments bound to the target antigen with nanomolar affinity. From eight scFvs with HSV-neutralizing capacity in vitro, the most potent antibody neutralized 50% HSV-2 at 4.5 nM as a dimeric (scFv)(2). We anticipate our approach to be useful for recovering fully human antibodies with therapeutic potential.","publish_time":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Diebolder, Philipp; Keller, Armin; Haase, Stephanie; Schlegelmilch, Anne; Kiefer, Jonathan D; Karimi, Tamana; Weber, Tobias; Moldenhauer, Gerhard; Kehm, Roland; Eis-H\u00FCbinger, Anna M; J\u00E4ger, Dirk; Federspil, Philippe A; Herold-Mende, Christel; Dyckhoff, Gerhard; Kontermann, Roland E; Arndt, Michaela AE; Krauss, J\u00FCrgen","journal":"MAbs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4a17794fa919d411ae351c9d671d4d1a6d64cc99.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3929437.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3929437/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzUy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antibody fragments","human antibodies","potent antibody","variable antibody genes","recombinant glycoprotein B of HSV","human B cell repertoires","derived B cell repertoires","human monoclonal antibodies","antibody technology field","unique sequences","therapeutic potential","LYmph Node Derived Antibody Libraries","distribution pattern of rearranged antibody sequences","LYNDAL","functional germline sequences","common glycoprotein B variants","Binding of scFvs","single-chain variable fragments","unique functional properties","tailored therapeutic interventions","Sequence analysis of unselected","lymph nodes","known variable gene families","target antigen","specific binders","nanomolar affinity","result of affinity maturation","high serum titers","major challenge","extensive somatic hypermutation of enriched clones","herpes simplex virus","surgery","individuals","donors","immunoglobulin G","IgG","head","capacity","development of efficient strategies","neck cancer","Screening","nM","source","majority","feasibility","methodology","strains","approach"],"language":"en"},

Pip6a-PMO, a recently developed conjugate, is particularly efficient in a murine DMD model, although mechanisms responsible for its increased biological activity have not been studied. Here, we evaluate the cellular trafficking and the biological activity of Pip6a-PMO in skeletal muscle cells and primary cardiomyocytes. Our results indicate that Pip6a-PMO is taken up in the skeletal muscle cells by an energy- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Interestingly, its cellular distribution is different in undifferentiated and differentiated skeletal muscle cells (vesicular versus nuclear). Likewise, Pip6a-PMO mainly accumulates in cytoplasmic vesicles in primary cardiomyocytes, in which clathrin-mediated endocytosis seems to be the pre-dominant uptake pathway. These differences in cellular trafficking correspond well with the exon-skipping data, with higher activity in myotubes than in myoblasts or cardiomyocytes. These differences in cellular trafficking thus provide a possible mechanistic explanation for the variations in exon-skipping activity and restoration of dystrophin protein in heart muscle compared with skeletal muscle tissues in DMD models. Overall, Pip6a-PMO appears as the most efficient conjugate to date (low nanomolar EC(50)), even if limitations remain from endosomal escape.","publish_time":"2013-12-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lehto, Taavi; Castillo Alvarez, Alejandra; Gauck, Sarah; Gait, Michael J.; Coursindel, Thibault; Wood, Matthew J.

Both cases demonstrate the critical role played by human migration in the transmission and subsequent dissemination of these diseases to rural areas. In both cases, migration acts to assemble in one high-risk environment thousands of young men highly susceptible to new diseases. With poor living and working conditions, these migration destinations act as hot-spots for disease transmission. Migration of workers back to rural areas then serves as a highly efficient means of disseminating these diseases to rural populations.

While viruses must evade autophagocytic destruction, some viruses can also subvert autophagy for their own benefit. The ability of influenza A virus (IAV) to evade autophagy depends on the Matrix 2 (M2) ion-channel protein. We show that the cytoplasmic tail of IAV M2 interacts directly with the essential autophagy protein LC3 and promotes LC3 relocalization to the unexpected destination of the plasma membrane. LC3 binding is mediated by a highly conserved LC3-interacting region (LIR) in M2. The M2 LIR is required for LC3 redistribution to the plasma membrane in virus-infected cells. Mutations in M2 that abolish LC3 binding interfere with filamentous budding and reduce virion stability. IAV therefore subverts autophagy by mimicking a host short linear protein-protein interaction motif. This strategy may facilitate transmission of infection between organisms by enhancing the stability of viral progeny.","publish_time":"2014-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beale, Rupert; Wise, Helen; Stuart, Amanda; Ravenhill, Benjamin J.; Digard, Paul; Randow, Felix","journal":"Cell Host Microbe","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0af7ad44d9fe38134408a1374103ac32ccad1491.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3991421.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3991421/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzExMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAV","LIR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["essential autophagy protein LC3","LC3 binding","LC3 redistribution","LC3 relocalization","conserved LC3","M2 LIR","cytoplasmic tail of IAV M2","ion-channel protein","plasma membrane","viruses","host short linear protein-protein interaction motif","virus-infected cells","virion stability","stability of viral progeny","filamentous budding","unexpected destination","cellular components","organisms","region","transmission of infection","intracellular pathogens","autophagocytic destruction","ability of influenza","Matrix","Mutations","strategy","benefit"],"language":"en"},

More importantly, its close relation to humans will allow the study of chronic infection and further identify important CHIKV targets. In this study, serum samples from CHIKV-infected macaques collected at different time-points post infection were used to characterize the antibody production pattern and kinetics. Results revealed that anti-CHIKV antibodies were neutralizing and the E2 glycoprotein, Capsid, nsP1, nsP3 and nsP4 proteins were targets of the anti-CHIKV antibody response in macaques. Furthermore, linear B-cell epitopes recognized by these anti-CHIKV antibodies were identified, and mapped to their structural localization.

This phenomenon is known as the porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (App) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) are pathogens that are frequently involved in PRDC. The main objective of this project was to study the in vitro interactions between these two pathogens and the host cells in the context of mixed infections. To fulfill this objective, PRRSV permissive cell lines such as MARC-145, SJPL, and porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) were used. A pre-infection with PRRSV was performed at 0.5 multiplicity of infection (MOI) followed by an infection with App at 10 MOI. Bacterial adherence and cell death were compared. Results showed that PRRSV pre-infection did not affect bacterial adherence to the cells. PRRSV and App co-infection produced an additive cytotoxicity effect. Interestingly, a pre-infection of SJPL and PAM cells with App blocked completely PRRSV infection. Incubation of SJPL and PAM cells with an App cell-free culture supernatant is also sufficient to significantly block PRRSV infection. This antiviral activity is not due to LPS but rather by small molecular weight, heat-resistant App metabolites (\u003C1 kDa). The antiviral activity was also observed in SJPL cells infected with swine influenza virus but to a much lower extent compared to PRRSV. More importantly, the PRRSV antiviral activity of App was also seen with PAM, the cells targeted by the virus in vivo during infection in pigs. The antiviral activity might be due, at least in part, to the production of interferon \u03B3. The use of in vitro experimental models to study viral and bacterial co-infections will lead to a better understanding of the interactions between pathogens and their host cells, and could allow the development of novel prophylactic and therapeutic tools.","publish_time":"2014-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"L\u00E9vesque, Cynthia; Provost, Chantale; Labrie, Jos\u00E9e; Hernandez Reyes, Yenney; Burciaga Nava, Jorge A.; Gagnon, Carl A.; Jacques, Mario","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6bba4b00882498efa69f66a1a92b1c240acfd2a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4039538.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4039538/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzE1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Actinobacillus","PAM"],"organizations":["PRRSV","SJPL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRSV infection","PRRSV pre-infection","App co-infection","PRRSV antiviral activity of App","SJPL cells","PAM cells","pre-infection of SJPL","multiplicity of infection","host cells","PRRSV permissive cell lines","bacterial co-infections","pathogens","Bacterial adherence","App cell-free culture supernatant","heat-resistant App metabolites","Incubation of SJPL","respiratory syndrome virus","respiratory tract infections","porcine respiratory disease complex","cell death","interactions","PRDC","MOI","Pigs","porcine alveolar macrophages","swine influenza virus","context of mixed infections","viral species","main objective","small molecular weight","LPS","MARC","additive cytotoxicity effect","experimental models","development of novel prophylactic","better understanding","therapeutic tools","Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae","lower extent","project","kDa","Results","production of interferon \u03B3","use of","phenomenon"],"language":"en"},

In BHI and LAPT culture media, different ionic silver concentrations and different pHs were tested. IASOS exerted a strong antimicrobial activity towards all the pathogens tested in both culture media. The results demonstrated that salts and organic compounds present in the culture media influenced IASOS efficacy only to a moderate extent. Whereas comparable MBCs (Minimal Bactericidal Concentrations) were observed for G. vaginalis (10 mg/L Ag(\u002B)), E. coli and E. aerogenes (25 mg/L Ag(\u002B)) in both media, higher MBCs were found for S. aureus and S. agalactiae in LAPT cultures (50 mg/L Ag(\u002B) versus 25 mg/L Ag(\u002B)). No minimal concentration totally inhibiting the growth of C. albicans was found. Nevertheless, in both media at the highest ionic silver concentrations (50\u2013200 mg/L Ag(\u002B)), a significant 34\u201352% drop in Candida growth was observed. pH differently affected the antimicrobial properties of IASOS against bacteria or yeasts; however, a stronger antimicrobial activity at pH higher than the physiological pH was generally observed. It can be therefore concluded that IASOS exerts a bactericidal action against all the tested bacteria and a clear fungistatic action against C. albicans. The antimicrobial activity of the whole vaginal gel SilSOS Femme further confirmed the antimicrobial activity of IASOS. Overall, our findings support IASOS as a valid active ingredient into a vaginal gel.","publish_time":"2014-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marianelli, Cinzia; Petrucci, Paola; Comelli, Maria Cristina; Calderini, Gabriella","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5eb1e53fb44c8a997713bd4fc55d65b904df3ce8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4045761.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4045761/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzE2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["BHI","IASOS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antimicrobial activity of IASOS","antimicrobial properties of IASOS","IASOS efficacy","stronger antimicrobial activity","strong antimicrobial activity","LAPT culture media","vaginal gel SilSOS Femme","innovative vaginal gel","pH higher","tested bacteria","Minimal Bactericidal Concentrations","different ionic silver concentrations","highest ionic silver concentrations","bactericidal action","higher MBCs","physiological pH","growth of","albicans","different pHs","human clinical cases of symptomatic vaginal infections","yeast pathogens","LAPT cultures","comparable MBCs","minimal concentration","Candida growth","clear fungistatic action","novel octasilver salt of Sucrose Octasulfate","valid active ingredient","aureus","organic compounds","yeasts","BHI","results","salts","agalactiae","moderate extent","findings","aerogenes","study","vaginalis","coli"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: This study examines the effect of dispositional optimism on life satisfaction and primarily verified the mediator role of CSEs. METHODS: Six hundred thirty college students from two general universities completed a questionnaire packet containing life orientation test\u2013revised (LOT\u2013R), core self-evaluations, and satisfaction with life scale. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to assess the dimension of LOT\u2013R. Bootstrap was used in structural equation modeling to analyze mediation effect. RESULTS: Results revealed that dispositional optimism and core self-evaluations were significantly correlated with life satisfaction. CFA identified the bidimensional structure of dispositional optimism. SEM indicated that core self-evaluations partially mediated the effect of dispositional optimism on life satisfaction. The final model also revealed significant paths from optimism and pessimism to life satisfaction through core-self evaluations. CONCLUSION: The findings extended prior studies and shed light on how dispositional optimism influences life satisfaction. This study provides valuable evidence on how to promote the life satisfaction of human beings in positive psychology.

Inflammation in response to comorbid conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, may play a proportionally larger role in HFPEF as compared to HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF). METHODS AND RESULTS: This study investigated inflammation mediated by the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03B1) axis in community-based cohorts of HFPEF patients (n = 100), HFREF patients (n = 100) and healthy controls (n = 50). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to investigate levels of TNF\u03B1, its two receptors (TNFR1 and TNFR2), and a non-TNF\u03B1 cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), in plasma derived from peripheral blood samples. Plasma levels of TNF\u03B1 and TNFR1 were significantly elevated in HFPEF relative to controls, while levels of TNFR2 were significantly higher in HFPEF than both controls and HFREF. TNF\u03B1, TNFR1 and TNFR2 were each significantly associated with at least two of the following: age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, peripheral vascular disease or history of atrial fibrillation. TNFR2 levels were also significantly associated with increasing grade of diastolic dysfunction and severity of symptoms in HFPEF.

The present study aimed to give an accurate picture of the 2012\u20132013 ILI outbreak in Corsica by combining data from several surveillance systems: general practice, emergency general practice, hospital emergency units, intensive care units, and nursing homes. Twenty-eight respiratory viruses were retrospectively investigated from patients in general practice with ILI. Sequence analysis of the genetic changes in the hemagglutinin gene of influenza viruses (A(H1N1)pdm2009, A(H3N2) and B) was performed. The trends in ILI/influenza consultation rates and the relative illness ratios (RIRs) of having an ILI consultation were estimated by age group for the different surveillance systems analyzed. Of the 182 ILI patients enrolled by general practitioners, 57.7% tested positive for influenza viruses. Phylogenetic analyses suggested a genetic drift for influenza B and A(H3N2) viruses. The ILI/influenza surveillance systems showed similar trends and were well correlated. In accordance with virological data, the RIRs of having an ILI consultation were highest among the young (\u003C15 years old) and decreased with age. No clusters of acute respiratory illness were declared by the sentinel nursing homes. This study is noteworthy in that it is the first extensive description of the 2012\u20132013 ILI outbreak in Corsica as monitored through several surveillance systems.

Recently, we showed that the structurally similar flavonoids baicalein and biochanin A inhibit highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza A virus replication by different mechanisms in A549 lung cells. Here, we investigated the effects of both compounds on H5N1-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and the role of ROS formation during H5N1 replication. FINDINGS: Baicalein and biochanin A enhanced H5N1-induced ROS formation in A549 cells and primary human monocyte-derived macrophages. Suppression of ROS formation induced by baicalein and biochanin A using the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine strongly increased the anti-H5N1 activity of both compounds in A549 cells but not in macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: These findings emphasise that flavonoids induce complex pharmacological actions some of which may interfere with H5N1 replication while others may support H5N1 replication. A more detailed understanding of these actions and the underlying structure-activity relationships is needed to design agents with optimised anti-H5N1 activity.","publish_time":"2014-06-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Michaelis, Martin; Sithisarn, Patchima; Cinatl Jr, Jindrich","journal":"BMC Res Notes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/656b4fb9ec7fb2fef794052432f59ed6f5a4a21a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4080993.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4080993/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzIwNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ROS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H5N1 replication","enhanced H5N1-induced ROS formation","optimised anti-H5N1 activity","virus replication","A549 cells","role of ROS formation","biochanin","Suppression of ROS formation","pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza","Different flavonoids","A549 lung cells","similar flavonoids baicalein","compounds","FINDINGS","different mechanisms","underlying structure-activity relationships","complex pharmacological actions","primary human monocyte-derived macrophages","agents","reactive oxygen species","cysteine","antioxidant N-acetyl","detailed understanding","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","effects"],"language":"en"},

In particular, these viruses may be associated with poor outcome in patients of intensive care units. The exact mechanism of their pathogenicity, however, still remains unclear. The discrepancies between the results obtained by serological and genomic methods could be explained by the high polymorphism of nucleotide sequences of Mimiviridae family representatives.

Inflammation within the CNS, often referred to as neuroinflammation involves activation of the microglia, the innate immune cells that are found specifically in the brain and spinal cord. Microglial activation results in the release of several cytokines and chemokines that trigger neuroinflammation, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several disease conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and metabolic disorders.

Where multiple risk drivers interact, the potential impact of a disease outbreak is amplified. The varying temporal and geographic frequency with which infectious disease events occur adds yet another layer of complexity to the issue.

Conversely, during an international public health emergency, significant disruption occurs not only to healthcare systems but also to a potentially wide range of sectors, including trade, tourism, energy, civil protection, transport, agriculture, and so on. At the same time, dealing with a disease outbreak may require a range of critical sectors for support.

It quickly became an issue of great public concern and a widely discussed topic on the Internet. A considerable volume of relevant information was made publicly available on the Internet through various sources. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the outbreak of H7N9 in China based on data openly available on the Internet and to validate our investigation by comparing our findings with a well-conducted conventional field epidemiologic study. METHODS: We searched publicly accessible Internet data on the H7N9 outbreak primarily from government and major mass media websites in China up to February 10, 2014. Two researchers independently extracted, compared, and confirmed the information of each confirmed H7N9 case using a self-designed data extraction form. We summarized the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of confirmed H7N9 cases and compared them with those from the field study. RESULTS: According to our data updated until February 10, 2014, 334 confirmed H7N9 cases were identified. The median age was 58 years and 67.0% (219/327) were males. Cases were reported in 15 regions in China. Five family clusters were found. Of the 16.8% (56/334) of the cases with relevant data, 69.6% (39/56) reported a history of exposure to animals. Of the 1751 persons with a close contact with a confirmed case, 0.6% (11/1751) of them developed respiratory symptoms during the 7-day surveillance period. In the 97.9% (327/334) of the cases with relevant data, 21.7% (71/327) died, 20.8% (68/327) were discharged from a hospital, and 57.5% (188/327) were of uncertain status. We compared our findings before February 10, 2014 and those before December 1, 2013 with those from the conventional field study, which had the latter cutoff date of ours in data collection. Our study showed most epidemiological and clinical characteristics were similar to those in the field study, except for case fatality (71/327, 21.7% for our data before February 10; 45/138, 32.6% for our data before December 1; 47/139, 33.8% for the field study), time from illness onset to first medical care (4 days, 3 days, and 1 day), and time from illness onset to death (16.5 days, 17 days, and 21 days). CONCLUSIONS: Findings from our Internet-based investigation were similar to those from the conventional field study in most epidemiological and clinical aspects of the outbreak. Importantly, publicly available Internet data are open to any interested researchers and can thus greatly facilitate the investigation and control of such outbreaks. With improved efforts for Internet data provision, Internet-based investigation has a great potential to become a quick, economical, novel approach to investigating sudden issues of great public concern that involve a relatively small number of cases like this H7N9 outbreak.","publish_time":"2014-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mao, Chen; Wu, Xin-Yin; Fu, Xiao-Hong; Di, Meng-Yang; Yu, Yuan-Yuan; Yuan, Jin-Qiu; Yang, Zu-Yao; Tang, Jin-Ling","journal":"J Med Internet Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4211021.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4211021/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzMwNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["available Internet data","relevant data","Internet data provision","accessible Internet data","data collection","conventional field study","outbreak of H7N9","H7N9 outbreak","Internet-based investigation","days","clinical characteristics of confirmed H7N9 cases","confirmed case","China","well-conducted conventional field epidemiologic study","self-designed data extraction form","findings","small number of cases","illness onset","issue of great public concern","great potential","time","clinical aspects","case fatality","sudden issues of great public concern","considerable volume of relevant information","interested researchers","day surveillance period","government","major mass media websites","novel approach","medical care","death","discussed topic","improved efforts","new type of avian influenza","close contact","cutoff date","various sources","respiratory symptoms","history of exposure","animals","median age","years","persons","control","outbreaks","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","regions","family clusters","uncertain status","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","males","hospital"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A search for relevant publications was conducted in Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, African Index Medicus and Lilacs databases. Retrieved studies were evaluated in terms of objectives, diseases studied, data sources, methodologies and performance for real-time surveillance. Most studies compared drug sales data to reference surveillance data using correlation measurements or indicators of outbreak detection performance (sensitivity, specificity, timeliness of the detection). RESULTS: We screened 3266 articles and included 27 in the review. Most studies focused on acute respiratory and gastroenteritis infections. Nineteen studies retrospectively compared drug sales data to reference clinical data, and significant correlations were observed in 17 of them. Four studies found that over-the-counter drug sales preceded clinical data in terms of incidence increase. Five studies developed and evaluated statistical algorithms for selecting drug groups to monitor specific diseases. Another three studies developed models to predict incidence increase from drug sales. CONCLUSIONS: Drug sales data analyses appear to be a useful tool for surveillance of gastrointestinal and respiratory disease, and OTC drugs have the potential for early outbreak detection. Their utility remains to be investigated for other diseases, in particular those poorly surveyed.

Normal numbers of viral particles appeared to be produced in NFV-treated cells by electron microscopy but remain within the cytoplasm more often than controls. NFV did not inhibit the activity of the HSV-1 serine protease nor could its antiviral activity be attributed to inhibition of Akt phosphorylation. NFV was found to decrease glycosylation of viral glycoproteins B and C and resulted in aberrant subcellular localization, consistent with induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response by NFV.

Human infection with avian influenza A (H7N9) was first identified on March 31, 2013 in China. Out of the total number of 134 cases confirmed from March to September 2013 in China, Zhejiang Province saw the greatest number (46 cases). OBJECTIVE: This study employed a mobile Internet survey to assess KAP regarding H7N9 among mobile phone users in Zhejiang Province. This study intended to examine KAP by region and the association between sociodemographic variables and KAP. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was designed by Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A cross-sectional survey was executed through a mobile Internet application platform of China Unicom in 5 regions in Zhejiang Province. Stratified and clustered sampling methods were applied and mobile phone users were invited to participate in the study voluntarily. RESULTS: A total of 9582 eligible mobile phone users participated in the survey with a response rate of 1.92% (9582/5,000,000). A total of 9105 valid responses (95.02%) were included for statistical analysis. Generally, more than three-quarters of the participants had some basic knowledge of H7N9 and held the attitude recommended by the Zhejiang CDC toward eating cooked poultry (77.55%, 7061/9105) and visiting a hospital at the occurrence of symptoms (78.51%, 7148/9105). Approximately half of the participants worried about contracting H7N9, and took preventive practices recommended by the Zhejiang CDC. But only 14.29% (1301/9105) of participants kept eating cooked poultry as usual. Although worry about H7N9 infection did not differ by region, Hangzhou saw the largest proportion of participants with knowledge of H7N9, which was probably because Hangzhou had the greatest number of H7N9 cases. KAP varied by some sociodemographic variables. Female participants were more likely to know about symptoms of H7N9 (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.08-1.61), to worry about contracting it (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.04-1.27), and to report their lives being influenced by it (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.15-1.41). They were also more likely to take the recommended precautions. Male participants and younger participants were less likely to comply with advocated protective practices. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that health education should be customized depending on sociodemographic variables to achieve more effective behavioral outcomes.","publish_time":"2015-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gu, Hua; Jiang, Zhenggang; Chen, Bin; Zhang, Jueman (Mandy); Wang, Zhengting; Wang, Xinyi; Cai, Jian; Chen, Yongdi; Zheng, Dawei; Jiang, Jianmin","journal":"JMIR Mhealth Uhealth","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4342637.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4342637/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["KAP","Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention","China Unicom"],"locations":["China","Zhejiang","Hangzhou"],"keyphrases":["KAP","H7N9 infection","symptoms of H7N9","Zhejiang Province","Zhejiang CDC","basic knowledge of H7N9","younger participants","greatest number of H7N9 cases","Female participants","mobile Internet survey","eligible mobile phone users","largest proportion of participants","sociodemographic variables","total number","study","Zhejiang Provincial Center","mobile Internet application platform of China Unicom","Disease Control","prevention","people\u2019s knowledge","preventive practices","Hangzhou","cross-sectional survey","cooked poultry","RESULTS","recommended precautions","advocated protective practices","Human infection","occurrence of symptoms","new infectious disease","clustered sampling methods","attitudes","regions","association","anonymous questionnaire","avian influenza","effective behavioral outcomes","BACKGROUND","health education","hospital","CONCLUSIONS","valid responses","response rate","quarters","OBJECTIVE","statistical analysis","half","lives"],"language":"en"},

HLA-A(*)24:06(156Trp) and HLA-A(*)24:13(156Leu) showed high levels of cell surface expression while HLA-A(*)24:02(156Gln) was expressed at low levels in tapasin deficient cells.

Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated all the HLA-A(*)24/156 variants to associate at similar levels with tapasin when present. Structurally, HLA-A(*)24:02 contains the residue triad Met97/His114/Gln156 and a Trp156 or Leu156 polymorphism provides tapasin independence by stabilizing these triad residues, thus generating an energetically stable and a more peptide receptive environment. Micropolymorphisms at position 156 can influence the generic peptide loading pathway for HLA-A(*)24 by altering their tapasin dependence for peptide selection. The trade-off for this tapasin independence could be the presentation of unusual ligands by these alleles, imposing significant risk following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).","publish_time":"2014-12-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Badrinath, Soumya; Kunze-Schumacher, Heike; Blasczyk, Rainer; Huyton, Trevor; Bade-Doeding, Christina","journal":"J Immunol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c08e4437d35ae6cdbeae2993e4a2264258f3431e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4353853.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4353853/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQzMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HLA class","tapasin independence","tapasin dependence","generic peptide","peptide selection","PLC dependence","tapasin deficient cells","peptide binding specificities","peptide receptive environment","low levels","similar levels","molecules","conventional loading of peptides certain class","PLC components","position","micropolymorphisms","high levels of cell surface expression","allelic variants","triad residues","residue triad Met97","hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","Gln156","significant risk","alleles","Trp156","assembly","distinct differences","features","His114","Leu156 polymorphism","presentation of unusual ligands","HSCT","effects","complex","repertoire","allotypes","pathway","Immunoprecipitation experiments","trade-off"],"language":"en"},

The present study was undertaken to determine the panel of suitable reference genes in heat-stressed buffalo mammary epithelial cells (MECs). Briefly, MEC culture from buffalo mammary gland was exposed to 42 \u00B0C for one hour and subsequently allowed to recover at 37 \u00B0C for different time intervals (from 30 m to 48 h). Three different algorithms, geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper softwares, were used to evaluate the stability of 16 potential reference genes from different functional classes. Our data identified RPL4, EEF1A1, and RPS23 genes to be the most appropriate reference genes that could be utilized for normalization of qPCR data in heat-stressed buffalo MECs.","publish_time":"2013-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kapila, Neha; Kishore, Amit; Sodhi, Monika; Sharma, Ankita; Kumar, Pawan; Mohanty, A.

{"cord_uid":"zdb0xjic","sha":"79ffac5ab7acd3c43a3e0866ed150fea9a0ec1c8","source_x":"PMC","title":"BAP31, a promising target for the immunotherapy of malignant melanomas","doi":"10.1186/s13046-015-0153-6","pmcid":"PMC4405826","pubmed_id":"25903101","license":"cc-by","abstract":"PURPOSE: Malignant melanoma\u2019s (MM) incidence is rising faster than that of any other cancer in the US and the overall survival at 5 years is less than 10%. B cell associated protein 31 (BAP31) is overexpressed in most MMs and might be a promising target for immunotherapy of this disease. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Firstly, we investigated the expression profiles of human BAP31 (hBAP31) and mouse BAP31 (mBAP31) in human and mouse normal tissues, respectively. The expression level of hBAP31 in human MMs and mBAP31 in B16 melanoma cells was also analyzed. Then we constructed novel mBAP31 DNA vaccines and tested there ability to stimulate mBAP31-specific immune responses and antitumor immunity in B16 melanoma-bearing mice. RESULTS: For the first time, we found that protein expression of hBAP31 were dramatically upregulated in human MMs when compared with human normal tissues. Predominant protein expression of mBAP31 was found in mouse B16 melanoma cells but not in mouse important organs. When mice were immunized with mBAP31 DNA vaccines, strong cellular response to mBAP31 was observed in the vaccinated mice. CTLs isolated from immunized mice could effectively kill mBAP31-positive target mouse B16 melanoma tumor cells in vitro and vaccination with mBAP31 DNA vaccines had potent anti-tumor activity in therapeutic model using B16 melanoma cells. CONCLUSIONS: These are the first data supporting a vaccine targeting BAP31 that is capable of inducing effective immunity against BAP31-expressing MMs and will be applicable to human MMs and hBAP31 DNA vaccine warrants investigation in human clinical trials.

Some viruses are restricted in the kinds of cells in which they replicate, and a few have not yet been cultivated at all under laboratory conditions. However, most viruses are grown in cultured cells, embryonated hen\u0027s eggs, or laboratory animals. In veterinary virology, the natural host animal is used for the cultivation of viruses; indeed the earliest viral assay has been carried out with foot-and-mouth disease virus in cattle. The natural host is still useful for the studies of pathogenesis and immunology, experiments in chemotherapy, and occasionally for diaglostic purposes. However, the in vitro cultivation of viruses in cell cultures is essential for the study of their mode of replication and for diagnostic virology. Cells may be grown in vitro as explants of tissue, such as respiratory or intestinal epithelium, or as cell cultures. Explant cultures are occasionally used for research purposes or for the cultivation of certain viruses, but almost all diagnostic and research work involving viral cultivation is carried out in cell cultures\u2014usually in monolayers, occasionally as suspension cultures. To produce cell monolayers, tissue is cut into small pieces and placed in a medium containing a proteolytic enzyme such as trypsin. After the cells have dispersed into a single-cell suspension, they are washed, counted, and diluted in a growth medium and permitted to settle on the flat surface of a glass or plastic container. Most types of cells adhere quickly and under optimal conditions, they divide about once a day until the surface is covered with a confluent monolayer.","publish_time":"2014-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"FENNER, FRANK; BACHMANN, PETER A.; GIBBS, E.

Cell culture allows looking at cells in their entirety from the outside before examining the intricacy of their component parts. Cells are counted in order to seed stock cultures with a known number of viable cells, to determine cell propagation rates, and to determine viability in a cell culture. Most vertebrate cell lines die after a finite number of divisions in cell culture, although rare immortal variant cells arise spontaneously in culture and can be maintained indefinitely as cell lines. DNA cloning and genetic engineering have given techniques that enable isolating specific genes, redesigning them, and inserting them back into cells. This technology has revolutionized the study of living cells. Eukaryotic cell lines are being developed with indefinite replication ability to express at least some of the differentiated properties of their cell of origin and to not necessarily cause tumors if injected into animals.","publish_time":"2007-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"George, V.G.; Hierholzer, J.C.; Ades, E.W.","journal":"Virology Methods Manual","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173500/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs2Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell culture","cell biology","cell of origin","vertebrate cell lines","Eukaryotic cell lines","cell propagation rates","study of living cells","known number of viable cells","rare immortal variant cells","disciplines of biology","molecular biology methods","finite number of divisions","techniques","adjunct","genetic engineering","stock cultures","traditional borders","viability","DNA cloning","isolating specific genes","intricacy","indefinite replication ability","outside","differentiated properties","tools","component parts","tumors","technology","virology","entirety","chapter","animals"],"language":"en"},

The virions are helically constructed filaments with a pitch of the primary helix in the range of 3.4\u20133.8 nm, containing about 10 protein subunits per turn of the helix and showing a central hole of 3\u20134 nm. The very flexuous and open structure of the particles is the most conspicuous trait of members of the family. The virions have a diameter of about 12 nm and their length ranges from 650 nm in case of species with fragmented genome, to over 2000 nm in case of species with monopartite genome. The fragility of virions and a tendency to end-to-end aggregation contribute to the fact that a range of lengths is often given for single viruses. The virions of several species are degraded by CsCl and are unstable in high salt concentration, resist moderately high temperatures and organic solvents, but are sensitive to RNase and chelation. Regardless of the genome type, monopartite or fragmented, virions contain a single molecule of linear, positive sense, single stranded RNA, constituting 5\u20136% of the particle weight. The structural proteins of most members of the family consist of a major CP and of a diverged copy of it denoted minor CP (CPm), with a size ranging from 22 to 46 kDa (CP) and 23 to 80 kDa (CPm). The members of the family have one of the largest genomes among plant viruses because of sequence duplication and acquisition of nonviral coding sequences such as protease, and HSP70 protein via RNA recombination.","publish_time":"2011-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Virus Taxonomy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173617.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173617/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs2OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nm","fragility of virions","single viruses","fragmented genome","Closteroviridae family","case of species","monopartite genome","single stranded RNA","minor CP","major CP","genome type","CPm","kDa","single molecule of linear","conspicuous trait of members","high temperatures","plant viruses","HSP70 protein","primary helix","protein subunits","RNA recombination","range of lengths","high salt concentration","sequence duplication","positive sense","acquisition of nonviral coding sequences","Closterovirus","protease","member genuses","largest genomes","particles","diverged copy","organic solvents","Ampelovirus","pitch","fact","tendency","end-to-end aggregation","CsCl","length ranges","constructed filaments","open structure","RNase","chapter","size ranging","turn","central hole","structural proteins","chelation","Crinivirus","diameter","particle weight"],"language":"en"},

The spike is a type 1 viral fusion protein, a class of trimeric surface glycoprotein proteins from diverse viral families that share many common structural and functional characteristics. Fusion proteins are mainly responsible for host cell receptor recognition and subsequent membrane fusion, and may perform other roles such as virus assembly and release via budding. The conformational changes that occur in the spike of intact SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) when it binds to the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) are described. Clues to the structural/functional relationships of membrane fusion have been made possible by the development of viral purification and inactivation methods, along with cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and three-dimensional (3D) image processing of many different images containing multiple views of the spikes. These methods have allowed study of the spikes while still attached to virions that are noninfectious, but fusionally competent. The receptor-binding and fusion core domains within the SARS-CoV spike have been precisely localized within the spike. Receptor binding results in structural changes that have been observed in the spike molecule, and these appear to be the initial step in viral membrane fusion. A working model for the stepwise process of receptor binding, and subsequent membrane fusion in SARS-CoV is presented. Uniquely, the large size of the SARS-CoV spike allows structural changes to be observed by cryo-EM in the native state. This provides a useful model for studying the basic process of membrane fusion in general, which forms an essential part of the function of many cellular processes.","publish_time":"2009-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beniac, Daniel R.; Booth, Timothy F.","journal":"Molecular Biology of the SARS-Coronavirus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e3c2038cb24a74a867fbc8e1c753f97901d0dd5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7176236.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176236/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs3NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral membrane fusion","viral receptor","SARS-CoV spike","subsequent membrane fusion","viral fusion protein","Fusion proteins","basic process of membrane fusion","receptor-binding","functional relationships of membrane fusion","known viral spike molecule","spike of intact SARS coronavirus","structural changes","fusion core domains","Receptor binding results","stepwise process of receptor binding","diverse viral families","development of viral purification","cryo-EM","Coronavirus spikes","host cell receptor recognition","conformational changes","cryo-electron microscopy","inactivation methods","functional characteristics","working model","useful model","class of trimeric surface glycoprotein proteins","largest mass","different images","image processing","multiple views","virus assembly","release","roles","angiotensin","enzyme","initial step","type","large size","budding","virions","native state","Clues","cellular processes","ACE2","study"],"language":"en"},

This response might be influenced by sex differences and other factors including age, nutrition status, and overall level of psychological stress. Exercise immunology is the field that studies this area. In the 1990s, Dr. Nieman formulated the controversial \u201CJ-shaped hypothesis\u201D to describe the relationship between exercise intensity and the risk of acquiring upper respiratory tract infections (URTI). This hypothesis suggests that moderate exercise has the ability to improve immune function above sedentary levels while high intensity exercise depresses the immune system. However, some methodological problems exist in studies of the J-curve which makes evidence more anecdotal than evidence-based regarding the role of moderate and intense exercise in the incidence of URTI. These limitations are presented in the chapter.","publish_time":"2013-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chamorro-Vi\u00F1a, Carolina; Fernandez-del-Valle, Maria; Tac\u00F3n, Anna M.","journal":"The Active Female","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1cf88c0fca9c5b75eb55631afd556723fca7103e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7176256.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176256/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs3Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Nieman"],"organizations":["URTI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["exercise intensity","moderate exercise","intense exercise","Exercise immunology","high intensity exercise","immune system","immune function","evidence","studies","marked intensity-dependent response","J-shaped hypothesis","J-curve","incidence of URTI","role of moderate","risk","sedentary levels","age","nutrition status","upper respiratory tract infections","factors","relationship","specific arms","ability","overall level of psychological stress","sex differences","Nieman","field","methodological problems","limitations","chapter","area"],"language":"en"},

Multiple studies have been performed with the intent to determine the optimal strategy to combat, and ultimately prevent, trauma induced coagulopathy. This chapter discusses the risks and benefits of resuscitation protocols utilizing plasma. Plasma is the aqueous portion of blood that contains coagulation factors, fibrinolytic proteins, albumin, immunoglobulins, and up to 6000 other proteins. Multiple methods of collection and storage have been developed, each one affecting the plasma and its proteins differently. Once collected, plasma can be frozen for storage. If frozen within 8 h, the product is labelled as fresh frozen plasma (FFP). If frozen more than 6 h, but less than 24 h, it is labelled as plasma frozen within 24 h (FP24). When FFP and FP24 are mobilized from the blood bank, they are thawed in a water bath to create thawed plasma (TP) which can be stored in liquid form for up to 4 days prior to transfusion. Liquid plasma (LQP) is derived from whole blood and is never frozen. It can be stored for up to 30 days by some reports prior to transfusion. Each of these forms of plasma has been extensively studied for efficacy of coagulation and are all useful in the resuscitation of a traumatically injured patient. There is much more than coagulation factors in plasma that are useful to patients. Studies looking at the endotheliopathy associated with hemorrhagic shock have shown a decrease in the inflammatory response, promotion of endothelial repair, and decreased edema. Transfusion protocols utilizing plasma at the time of presentation have shown a decrease in the amount of blood products transfused, as well as an improvement in mortality. Transfusion ratios of platelets\u2013red blood cells\u2013plasma units in a 1:1:1 ratio have shown a significant improvement in mortality at 3 h post-admission over 1:1:2. There has not been an increase in the incidence of adverse events with the increase usage of plasma. The early administration of plasma to the massively hemorrhaging traumatically injured patient improves mortality, decreases total blood product usage, and promotes the resolution of trauma induced endotheliopathy without increasing adverse events.","publish_time":"2015-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lawless, Ryan A.; Holcomb, John B.","journal":"Trauma Induced Coagulopathy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c4b79314f9ec0debe13938b13c514704143ea74.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7178894.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7178894/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs4Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FFP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["thawed plasma","Liquid plasma","plasma units","forms of plasma","fresh frozen plasma","increase usage of plasma","early administration of plasma","blood bank","blood products","mortality","Transfusion protocols","injured patient","total blood product usage","red blood cells","aqueous portion of blood","coagulation factors","h post-admission","efficacy of coagulation","Transfusion ratios of platelets","benefits of resuscitation protocols","fibrinolytic proteins","days","FP24","storage","FFP","Multiple studies","resolution of trauma induced endotheliopathy","incidence of adverse events","trauma induced coagulopathy","significant improvement","liquid form","Multiple methods of collection","promotion of endothelial repair","inflammatory response","albumin","risks","time of presentation","decreased edema","water bath","intent","immunoglobulins","hemorrhagic shock","TP","LQP","optimal strategy","chapter","reports","patients","debated topic"],"language":"en"},

Strengthening public health preparedness requires establishing an integrated global alert and response system for epidemics and other public health emergencies along the lines of the World Health Organization\u2019s International Health Regulations. The revised International Health Regulations provide a global framework to address these needs through a collective approach to the prevention, detection, and timely response to any public health emergency of international concern. A standardized approach for readiness and response to major epidemic-prone diseases should be developed. An early-warning and rapid-alert system is one of the possibilities to improve readiness at the local, regional, national, and international level to limit the spread of disease and to reduce health, economic, and social damage. The Republic of Macedonia, with World Health Organization support, has implemented an earlywarning system (ALERT) for priority communicable diseases to complement the routine surveillance system that reports individual confirmed cases. ALERT relies on reporting of eight syndromes by primary care facilities. Data are analyzed weekly at the regional level and transmitted to national epidemiologists. It is perceived to be a simple and flexible tool for detecting and triggering timely investigation and control of outbreaks. ALERT was identified as a useful instrument for forecasting and detecting the start of the influenza season.","publish_time":"2010-07-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stikova, Elisaveta; Gjorgjev, Dragan; Karadzovski, Zarko","journal":"Emerging and Endemic Pathogens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11aa21e1b58b823e71d0081af361e8a9386a5e4d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7187948/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs5ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Republic","Macedonia"],"keyphrases":["health systems","public health emergencies","World Health Organization\u2019s International Health Regulations","public health preparedness","revised International Health Regulations","response system","global system","public health emergency of international concern","World Health Organization support","rapid-alert system","earlywarning system","integrated global alert","international level","timely response","routine surveillance system","global framework","Epidemics","regional level","readiness","timely investigation","collective approach","standardized approach","national epidemiologists","priority communicable diseases","major epidemic-prone diseases","lines","panic","travel","syndromes","intense demands","prevention","detection","individual confirmed cases","start","disruption of trade","pandemics","reporting","needs","Republic of Macedonia","spread of disease","possibilities","primary care facilities","flexible tool","useful instrument","early-warning","society","forecasting","control of outbreaks","social damage","influenza season","Data"],"language":"en"},

Policy implications of the model are discussed in light of the experience of developed countries in regulating livestock pollution and other externalities. We argue that environmental problems from agricultural industrialization in developing countries may pose major challenges. In the case of livestock production, these are compounded by production intensity, high population densities in periurban and urban areas, and the generally lower public health standards. As the recent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza epidemics in Asia suggest, the new era of globalization and the onset of a free world trade regime points to the urgent need for developing countries to install inspection and enforcement mechanisms that ensure product safety and quality, as well as minimize the adverse effects on the environment.","publish_time":"2014-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chakravorty, Ujjayant; Fisher, Donna K.; Umetsu, Chieko","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/554ede0c4a169e6e57242ba603ef79c95d8a2fb3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149018/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["developing countries","experience of developed countries","case of livestock production","production intensity","livestock pollution","agricultural industrialization","industrialization of agriculture","economic growth","simple economic framework","onset","SARS","high population densities","free world trade regime points","recent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome","urban areas","periurban","urgent need","effect of location","enforcement mechanisms","avian influenza epidemics","Asia","inspection","context of urbanization","intensification of industrial activity","product safety","new era of globalization","environmental problems","farming","light","lower public health standards","major challenges","model","quality","issue","relationship","Policy implications","adverse effects","article","externalities","regulation"],"language":"en"},

In the current context of controversies over the public problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), the veterinary profession is tending to promote a model of preventive medicine that is supposed to reduce the use of antibiotics in livestock farming. However, veterinarians specializing in pig and poultry production (\u201Cindustrial vets\u201D) have in fact been adopting such approaches to animal health for several decades. Based on 28 interviews with pig and poultry veterinarians practicing or having practiced in western France between the 1970s and the 2010s, the article aims to understand how such a form of professional expertise has developed, and the business model that underpins it. Contrary to public discourses which promote preventive approaches as a way to diversify professional expertise and to disconnect veterinary incomes from drug sales, it is indeed this economic model that has allowed the development of such approaches within industrial livestock farming. Modern strategies for reducing antibiotic use should therefore seek less to renew the professional expertise of veterinarians than to find new ways to valorize it economically.","publish_time":"2020-01-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fortan\u00E9, Nicolas","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e5d09c9bd59c599daabbc7ca49638a2635656510.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149086/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjsxMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["industrial pig","poultry veterinarians","professional expertise of veterinarians","preventive approaches","industrial livestock farming","development of veterinary medicine","form of professional expertise","model of preventive medicine","industrial vets","veterinary incomes","poultry production sector","veterinary profession","economic model","business model","article","public discourses","antibiotic use","use of antibiotics","public problem of antimicrobial resistance","AMR","current context of controversies","fact","animal health","drug sales","Modern strategies","decades","interviews","western France","new ways"],"language":"en"},

China and the US have adopted converging approaches to address these challenges: inserting e-commerce chapters into their FTAs. However, the substance of these chapters is diverging. Firstly, US FTAs categorise digital products separately from goods and services and provide national treatment and most favoured nation treatment to products and their suppliers. China\u2019s FTAs still offer no solutions to the classification of digital products and their treatment. Secondly, although China\u2019s FTAs still provide weak protection for consumers and privacy, Chinese domestic law has converged towards US FTAs to provide better protection. Thirdly, US and China FTAs are significantly divergent in their regulation of the free flow of information. In the post-TPP era, a polycentric direction will emerge in the regulation of the free flow of information between China and the US.","publish_time":"2017-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Jie","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/699d9b30ca1d4e2518bc5e5a3bf091bd8c3a7611.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149125/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjsxMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WTO","US"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["US FTAs","China FTAs","China\u2019s FTAs","privacy protection","weak protection of cross","border flow of information","free flow of information","ambiguous classification of digital products","better protection","national treatment","border e-commerce","e-commerce chapters","Insufficient WTO regulation of cross","favoured nation treatment","legal challenges","consumers","inadequate consumer","Chinese domestic law","goods","polycentric direction","services","solutions","post-TPP era","converging approaches","suppliers","substance"],"language":"en"},

The lack of reliable data and the short operating history of China as a semicapitalist country make firm conclusions difficult. However, overall the evidence points to further problems in the Chinese banking and real estate sectors. If this is true, then it is not too late to short Chinese banks and property stocks. Some investors predict that China\u0027s real estate bubble will soon burst as the property prices in China are relatively high with respect to GDP per capita and as the Chinese government took actions in April 2010 to regulate real estate prices. However, economic activities in China are controlled by central and municipal governments, sizable state-owned banks, and enterprises to a great extent. In 2010, the magnitude of bank lending has been reduced greatly following the change in monetary policy. This is expected to cool down the transaction volume of the real estate market. Even with the drop of property prices, the Chinese central government is taking measures to curb current real estate prices. A decline of 30% or more in real estate prices is widely accepted by the central government, but it is not certain that commercial banks can assume such big declines. Possibly a decline of over 50% in real estate prices is expected to induce a new wave of financial crisis in China. Therefore, a rapid drop in real estate prices is hazardous to the banking system and the government expects a slow decline. The Chinese government has recognized that a bubble currently exists and has opted to contain real estate prices to maintain a \u201Charmonious society.\u201D","publish_time":"2011-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Treadway, Peter T.; Michael C.S., Wong","journal":"Handbook of Short Selling","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149592.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149592/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjszNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["current real estate prices","China real estate bubble","real estate market","real estate sectors","China\u0027s real estate bubble","Chinese government","drop of property prices","Chinese central government","short Chinese banks","Chinese banking","short operating history of China","commercial banks","short selling","property stocks","slow decline","sizable state-owned banks","banking system","rapid drop","semicapitalist country","measures","accompanying opportunity","emergence","municipal governments","enterprises","firm conclusions difficult","lack of reliable data","new wave of financial crisis","GDP","transaction volume","problems","investors","big declines","arguments","respect","actions","great extent","economic activities","harmonious society","change","monetary policy","magnitude of bank lending","chapter","evidence"],"language":"en"},

The chapter describes the diversity of virus genomes, and explains the major genetic mechanisms that affect viruses. The chemistry and structures of virus genomes are more varied than any of those seen in the entire bacterial, plant, or animal kingdoms. Virus genome structures and nucleotide sequences have been intensively studied in the recent decades because the power of recombinant DNA technology has focused a lot of attention in this area. The techniques of molecular biology have been a major influence on the virus genome. It is possible to separate the molecular analysis of virus genomes into two types of approaches: the physical analysis of structure and nucleotide sequence, and a more biological approach to examine the structure\u2013function relationships of intact virus genomes and individual genetic elements. The chapter discusses virus genetics and its mutants, genetic and nongenetic interactions among viruses, small and large DNA genomes, positive and negative-strand RNA viruses, and segmented and multipartite virus genomes. Sequences and structures at the ends of virus genomes are in some ways functionally more significant than the unique coding regions within them. Common patterns of genetic organization seen in virus super-families suggest that many viruses have evolved from common ancestors and that exchange of genetic information among viruses has resulted in solutions to common problems.","publish_time":"2012-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cann, Alan J.","journal":"Principles of Molecular Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149632.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149632/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjszNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["structures of virus genomes","multipartite virus genomes","ends of virus genomes","complexity of virus genomes","diversity of virus genomes","virus genetics","molecular analysis of virus genomes","Virus genome structures","function relationships of intact virus genomes","virus super-families","large DNA genomes","chapter","major genetic mechanisms","Common patterns of genetic organization","individual genetic elements","exchange of genetic information","negative-strand RNA viruses","physical analysis of structure","common ancestors","nucleotide sequences","common problems","major influence","techniques of molecular biology","power of recombinant DNA technology","mutants","types of approaches","nongenetic interactions","plant","lot of attention","biological approach","solutions","ways","animal kingdoms","recent decades","unique coding regions","chemistry","area"],"language":"en"},

Popular targets for this therapy have been sequences encoding viral proteins and cellular host factors on which viruses depend for their replication. Therefore, availability of technologies that inactivate genes specifically, safely and effectively is crucial. Hence, discovery of RNA interference and advances in gene editing methods have been particularly important to the field. Gene transfer to induce prophylactic and therapeutic immunostimulation is also being developed to manage viral infections. Although promising, progress and ultimate success of antiviral gene therapy is dependent on several factors. These include overcoming problems that are generic to the field and influences of elements that are particular to specific viral infections. Viral and nonviral vectors (NVVs) have been used to deliver antiviral sequences, and both have advantages and drawbacks. Viral vectors are suited to delivering DNA-based expression cassettes, including immunostimulatory and virus-targeting sequences, whereas NVVs may be better applied to carrying therapeutic RNAs such as synthetic short interfering RNAs or mRNAs. Nonviral formulations are appealing because they cause limited immunostimulation, obviate mutagenic effects of DNA, and are amenable to easier dose control and large-scale synthesis. To date, encouraging results have been obtained in preclinical and clinical assessments of gene therapy against HIV-1, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and Ebola viruses, among others. In the long term, widespread application of antiviral gene therapy will be dependent on the technology demonstrating good efficacy and advantages over other antiviral strategies. Access to appropriate material and human resources that are required for implementation of the technologies in various settings will also be important.","publish_time":"2015-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arbuthnot, Patrick","journal":"Gene Therapy for Viral Infections","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149688.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149688/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjszNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral sequences","ultimate success of antiviral gene therapy","widespread application of antiviral gene therapy","Gene transfer","clinical assessments of gene therapy","antiviral strategies","viral proteins","gene editing methods","specific viral infections","therapeutic RNAs","advantages","therapeutic immunostimulation","field","NVVs","nonviral vectors","replication","hepatitis B","hepatitis C","limited immunostimulation","Ebola viruses","availability of technologies","Nonviral formulations","cellular host factors","mutagenic effects of DNA","synthetic short interfering RNAs","DNA-based expression cassettes","advances","HIV","easier dose control","good efficacy","human resources","implementation","immunostimulatory","technology","progress","discovery of RNA interference","large-scale synthesis","influences of elements","long term","Access","appropriate material","mRNAs","various settings","nucleic acids","overcoming problems","Popular targets","results","genes","pathogens","date","drawbacks"],"language":"en"},

Further, advanced pathogen discovery techniques (e.g., metagenomics) allow the identification of potential pathogens before their recognition as clinically relevant to transfusion medicine. In the aftermath of our experiences with HIV and posttransfusion hepatitis, our windows for response to such agents and infections have contracted rapidly. These characteristics pose difficult challenges for our development of surveillance and control regimes capable of timely, but appropriately nuanced, responses.

Although enveloped viruses of different major groups vary in size and shape, as well as in the molecular weight of their structural polypeptides, there are general similarities in the types of polypeptide components present in virions. The types of structural components found in viral membranes are summarized briefly in the chapter. All the enveloped viruses studied to date possess one or more glycoprotein species and lipid as a major structural component. The presence of carbohydrate covalently linked to proteins is demonstrated by the incorporation of a radioactive precursor, such as glucosamine or fucose, into viral polypeptides, which is resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Enveloped viruses share many common features in the organization of their structural components, as indicated by several approaches, including electron microscopy, surface-labeling, and proteolytic digestion experiments, and the isolation of subviral components. The chapter summarizes the detailed structure of the glycoproteins of four virus groups: (1) influenza virus glycoproteins, (2) rhabdovirus G protein, (3) togavirus glycoprotein, and (4) paramyxovirus glycoproteins The information obtained includes the size and shape of viral glycoproteins, the number of polypeptide chains in the complete glycoprotein structure, and compositional data on the polypeptide and oligosaccharide portions of the molecules.","publish_time":"2008-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Compans, Richard W.; Kemp, Maurice C.","journal":"Curr Top Membr Transp","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7146817/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs3MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["glycoprotein components of enveloped viruses","types of structural components","types of polypeptide components","shape of viral glycoproteins","structural polypeptides","viral polypeptides","chapter","enveloped viruses of different major groups","glycoprotein species","togavirus glycoprotein","paramyxovirus glycoproteins","viral membranes","viral envelopes","complete glycoprotein structure","major structural component","influenza virus glycoproteins","isolation of subviral components","virus groups","size","number of polypeptide chains","detailed structure","recent information","compositional data","SDS","sodium dodecyl sulfate","general similarities","surface","polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis","glucosamine","lipid","specific findings","oligosaccharide portions","common features","proteolytic digestion experiments","approaches","rhabdovirus G protein","fucose","organization","date","radioactive precursor","incorporation","electron microscopy","molecules","molecular weight","virions","presence of carbohydrate"],"language":"en"},

The lexicon-based method is often preferred because it leads to more explainable answers in comparison with many machine learning-based methods. But, semantic orientation of a word depends on its domain. Hence, a general-purpose sentiment lexicon may gives sub-optimal performance compare with a domain-specific lexicon. However, it is challenging to manually generate a domain-specific sentiment lexicon for each domain. Still, it is impractical to generate complete sentiment lexicon for a domain from a single corpus. To this end, we propose an approach to automatically generate a domain-specific sentiment lexicon using a vector model enriched by weights. Importantly, we propose an incremental approach for updating an existing lexicon to either the same domain or different domain (domain-adaptation). Finally, we discuss how to incorporate sentiment lexicons information in neural models (word embedding) for better performance.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muhammad, Shamsuddeen Hassan; Brazdil, Pavel; Jorge, Al\u00EDpio","journal":"Advances in Information Retrieval","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e551eb62b3ea4479494dee8e1b12d0acbfccd34.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148022.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148022/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs3OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["domain-specific sentiment lexicon","domain-specific lexicon","general-purpose sentiment lexicon","complete sentiment lexicon","lexicon-based sentiment analysis","existing lexicon","different domain","domain-adaptation","lexicon-based method","sentiment lexicons information","word","machine learning-based methods","better performance","incremental approach","sub-optimal performance","vital role","neural models","comparison","vector model","explainable answers","single corpus","weights","semantic orientation","end"],"language":"en"},

The primary idea is to estimate a language model for the aspect as well as the query using a domain-specific knowledge base and use a mixture of the two to determine the relevance of the article.

For an average Web user, it is very difficult to identify which information is relevant or irrelevant. Hence, in the era of continuously enhancing Web, organization and interpretation of Web contents are very important in order to easily access the relevant information. Many recent advancements in the area of Web content management such as classification of Web contents, information diffusion, credibility of information, etc. have been explored based on text and semantic of the document. In this paper, we propose a purely semantic contextualization of Web contents. We hypothesize that named entities and their types present in a Web document convey substantial semantic information. By extraction of this information, we aim to study the reasoning and explanation behind the Web contents or patterns. Furthermore, we also plan to exploit LOD (Linked Open Data) to get a deeper insight of Web contents.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Amit","journal":"Advances in Information Retrieval","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d908792846a558e785b0ecbeafbaca02ed5ffa38.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148069.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148069/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs4NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LOD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Web document","classification of Web contents","interpretation of Web contents","semantic contextualization of Web contents","relevant information","deeper insight of Web contents","average Web user","information diffusion","credibility of information","substantial semantic information","area of Web content management","Open Data","abundance of data","wide access","organization","order","types present","internet","explanation","recent advancements","reasoning","patterns","entities","LOD","paper","extraction"],"language":"en"},

Nowadays, many people are increasingly utilising online social media platforms to share their feelings and moods. Despite the collective efforts in the community to develop models for identifying potential cases of mental disorders, not much work has been done to provide insights that could be used by a predictive system or a health practitioner in the elaboration of a diagnosis. In this paper, we present our research towards better visualising and understanding the factors that characterise and differentiate social media users who are affected by mental disorders from those who are not. Furthermore, we study to which extent various mental disorders, such as depression and anorexia, differ in terms of language use. We conduct different experiments considering various dimensions of language such as vocabulary, psychometric attributes and emotional indicators. Our findings reveal that positive instances of mental disorders show significant differences from control individuals in the way they write and express emotions in social media. However, there are not quantifiable differences that could be used to distinguish one mental disorder from each other.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"R\u00EDssola, Esteban Andr\u00E9s; Aliannejadi, Mohammad; Crestani, Fabio","journal":"Advances in Information Retrieval","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0054b9ca26742250dc9bf92e7f9092f2cf0d0904.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148209.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148209/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs4NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["potential cases of mental disorders","extent various mental disorders","positive instances of mental disorders","social media platforms","social media users","various dimensions of language","significant differences","quantifiable differences","improved diagnosis rates","terms of language use","vocabulary","control individuals","psychometric attributes","way","models","recent years","depression","health practitioner","major concern","community","emotional indicators","spite","different experiments","societies","factors","feelings","express emotions","anorexia","research","better visualising","predictive system","world","elaboration","findings","work","collective efforts","moods","people","paper","insights"],"language":"en"},

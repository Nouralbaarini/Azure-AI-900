Physicians should be familiar with the proper evaluation and management of this common condition. OBJECTIVE: To provide an update on the current understanding, evaluation, and management of febrile seizures. METHODS: A PubMed search was completed in Clinical Queries using the key terms \u2018febrile convulsions\u2019 and \u2018febrile seizures\u2019. The search strategy included meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, observational studies, and reviews. RESULTS: Febrile seizures, with a peak incidence between 12 and 18 months of age, likely result from a vulnerability of the developing central nervous system to the effects of fever, in combination with an underlying genetic predisposition and environmental factors. The majority of febrile seizures occur within 24 hours of the onset of the fever. Febrile seizures can be simple or complex. Clinical judgment based on variable presentations must direct the diagnostic studies which are usually not necessary in the majority of cases. A lumbar puncture should be considered in children younger than 12 months of age or with suspected meningitis. Children with complex febrile seizures are at risk of subsequent epilepsy. Approximately 30\u201340% of children with a febrile seizure will have a recurrence during early childhood. The prognosis is favorable as the condition is usually benign and self-limiting. Intervention to stop the seizure often is unnecessary. CONCLUSION: Continuous preventative antiepileptic therapy for the prevention of recurrent febrile seizures is not recommended. The use of intermittent anticonvulsant therapy is not routinely indicated. Antipyretics have no role in the prevention of febrile seizures.","publish_time":"2018-07-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leung, Alexander KC; Hon, Kam Lun; Leung, Theresa NH","journal":"Drugs Context","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e93d3778e75fa7201f27b9c93b541a16b8f4393a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6052913.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30038660/; https://doi.org/10.7573/dic.212536","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prevention of febrile seizures","management of febrile seizures","complex febrile seizures","majority of febrile seizures","febrile convulsions\u2019","febrile seizures\u2019","prevention of recurrent febrile seizures","clinical trials","Clinical Queries","Clinical judgment","common condition","months of age","children younger","proper evaluation","observational studies","effects of fever","search strategy","diagnostic studies","PubMed search","early childhood","majority of cases","randomized controlled trials","common neurologic disorder","Continuous preventative antiepileptic therapy","use of intermittent anticonvulsant therapy","meta-analyses","developing central nervous system","underlying genetic predisposition","key terms","combination","vulnerability","variable presentations","environmental factors","update","CONCLUSION","current understanding","recurrence","risk of subsequent epilepsy","hours","role","peak incidence","suspected meningitis","reviews","lumbar puncture","Physicians","prognosis","METHODS","onset","Antipyretics","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","OBJECTIVE","Intervention"],"language":"en"},

Even the \u2018well-known\u2019 reservoir animals for influenza virus, migratory birds, became victims of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus. Not only the viruses, but bacteria can also expand their host range: a new disease, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, caused by human Streptococcus suis serotype 2 infection, has been observed in China with 52 human fatalities in two separate outbreaks (1998 and 2005, respectively). Additionally, enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection has increased worldwide with severe disease. Several outbreaks and sporadic isolations of this pathogen in China have made it an important target for disease control. A new highly pathogenic variant of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been isolated in both China and Vietnam recently; although PRRSV is not a zoonotic human pathogen, its severe outbreaks have implications for food safety.

More than 80% of URTIs are viral. Etiological diagnosis of URTIs is important to make correct clinical decisions on treatment methods. However, data for viral spectrum of URTIs are very limited in Shanghai children. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from a group of 164 children aged below 3 years who were hospitalized due to acute respiratory infection from May 2009 to July 2010 in Shanghai. A VRDAL multiplex PCR for 10 common respiratory viruses was performed on collected specimens compared with the Seeplex\u00AE RV15 ACE Detection kit for 15 respiratory viruses. RESULTS: Viruses were detected in 84 (51.2%) patients by VRDAL multiplex PCR, and 8 (4.9%) of cases were mixed infections. Using the Seeplex\u00AE RV15 ACE Detection kit, viruses were detected in 129 (78.7%) patients, 49 (29.9%) were co-infected cases. Identified viruses included 37 of human rhinovirus (22.6% of cases), 32 of influenza A virus (19.5%), 30 of parainfluenzavirus-2 (18.3%), 23 of parainfluenzavirus-3 (14.0%), 15 of human enterovirus (9.1%), 14 each of parainfluenzavirus-1, respiratory syncytial virus B and adenovirus (8.5%), 8 of coronavirus 229E/NL63 (4.9%), 6 of human bocavirus (3.7%), 5 each of influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial virus A (3.0%), 3 of parainfluenzavirus-4 (1.8%), 2 of coronavirus OC43/HKU1 (1.2%), and 1 human metapneumovirus (0.6%).

Hydrothermal processing (HTP), a set of several chemical digestion processes, could be used to convert sewage sludge into valuable products and minimize potential environmental pollution risks. Specifically, hydrothermal carbonization and hydrothermal liquefaction have been extensively studied to sustainably manage sludge. Two of the main reasons for this are the high upscalability of HTP for public waste management and that it is estimated that HTP can recover eleven times more energy from waste products than landfilling. An integration of HTP with anaerobic digestion or recycling the soluble organics (in the HTP aqueous products) into the HTP process could lead to a higher overall rate of energy recovery for municipal sewage sludge.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Wan-Ting; Haque, Md.

Salmonella enterica was detected from 29 samples [26 raccoons, 5.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.8\u20133.5%; three masked palm civets, 2.0%, 95% CI 4.2\u20130%].

Here, we evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of REGN3048 and REGN3051 in the common marmoset model of MERS-CoV infection. Intravenous administration of mAb resulted in high levels of MERS-CoV-neutralizing activity in circulating blood. When animals were treated with mAbs one day before challenge, respiratory disease was less severe and, in animals treated with both REGN3048 and REGN3051, viral loads in the lungs were reduced. However, therapeutic treatment on day one after challenge was less efficacious as it did not prevent the development of severe respiratory disease and all treated animals developed bronchointerstitial pneumonia of similar severity as the control animals.

DC-SIGN promoter variants play important role in the susceptibility to various infectious diseases. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignancy that is common in southern China and whether DC-SIGN promoter variants have effects on susceptibility to NPC is still unknown. The aim of this study is to ascertain the potential involvement of DC-SIGN promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NPC susceptibility. METHODS: We conducted a case control study based on Cantonese population including 444 NPC patients and 464 controls matched on age and sex. The 1041 bp of DC-SIGN promoter region was directly sequenced for all samples. Sequence alignment and SNP search were inspected using DNAStar analysis programs and haplotype frequencies were estimated in Haploview V 4.0. The associations between the SNPs and the risk of NPC were analyzed using chi-square test and non-conditional logistic regression analysis with SPSS 13.0 software. RESULTS: A total of six variants were observed in the DC-SIGN promoter region and DC-SIGN -139 GG and -939 AA were significantly associated with NPC risk with adjusted Odds Ratios (ORs) of 2.10 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23-3.59; P = 0.006) and 2.52 (1.29-4.93; P = 0.007) respectively and subjects carrying the risk allele DC-SIGN -871 G had 1.47-fold (95% CI = 1.14-1.90) increased risks of developing NPC (P = 0.003). Haplotype analysis revealed that h1 \u0027AAAG\u0027 was significantly associated with protection against NPC (OR = 0.69; P = 0.0002) and the association was still significant when using 1000 permutation test runs (P = 0.001).

In total, 8 587 samples were analysed during this period, of which 1 974 (23%) were positive for the novel influenza variant. The analysis of results obtained using rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) revealed a global sensitivity of 49.4% (vs. molecular qRT-PCR detection), strongly correlated with age groups (varying from 30% to 58% for patients \u003E40 age and \u003C10, respectively), indicating that RIDTs can be helpful in accelerating the management of suspected cases. Epidemiological analysis showed that the winter influenza wave began in October in Marseille (i.e. 2 to 3 months earlier than usual seasonal influenza outbreaks) and that the majority of autochthonous cases were observed in patients younger than 20 years old, with a low number of cases in patients over 60 years old. In November 2009, 22.2% (167/754) of patients with a laboratory diagnosis of influenza A/H1N1 infection were hospitalized, of which 9% (15/167) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). Patients in the extreme age groups (\u003E40 years old and \u003C1) were significantly more often hospitalized than others, and 2.4% of hospitalized patients died.

Data were collected from 10 January 2020 to 26 January 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical data, collected using a standardised case report form, such as temperature, history of exposure, incubation period. If information was not clear, the working group in Hangzhou contacted the doctor responsible for treating the patient for clarification. RESULTS: Of the 62 patients studied (median age 41 years), only one was admitted to an intensive care unit, and no patients died during the study. According to research, none of the infected patients in Zhejiang province were ever exposed to the Huanan seafood market, the original source of the virus; all studied cases were infected by human to human transmission. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever in 48 (77%) patients, cough in 50 (81%), expectoration in 35 (56%), headache in 21 (34%), myalgia or fatigue in 32 (52%), diarrhoea in 3 (8%), and haemoptysis in 2 (3%). Only two patients (3%) developed shortness of breath on admission. The median time from exposure to onset of illness was 4 days (interquartile range 3-5 days), and from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 2 (1-4) days.

DESIGN: Prospective outbreak investigation with active case finding and molecular typing. SETTING: A large academic geriatric hospital in Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS: Elderly hospitalized adults. MEASUREMENTS: Based on syndromic surveillance, a nosocomial influenza outbreak was suspected in February 2012. All suspected cases were screened for respiratory viruses using real\u2010time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal swabs. Infection control procedures (droplet precautions with single room isolation whenever possible) were implemented for all suspected or confirmed cases. Specimens positive for influenza viruses were processed and sequenced whenever possible to track transmission dynamics. RESULTS: Respiratory samples from 155 suspected cases were analyzed during the outbreak period, of which 69 (44%) were positive for influenza virus, 26 (17%) were positive for other respiratory viruses, and 60 (39%) were negative. Three other cases fulfilled clinical criteria for influenza infection but were not sampled, and one individual was admitted with an already positive test, resulting in a total of 73 influenza cases, of which 62 (85%) were classified as nosocomial. Five distinct clusters of nosocomial transmission were identified using viral sequencing, with epidemiologically unexpected in\u2010hospital transmission dynamics. Seven of 23 patients who experienced influenza complications died. Sixteen healthcare workers experienced an influenza\u2010like illness (overall vaccination rate, 36%). CONCLUSION: Nosocomial influenza transmission caused more secondary cases than repeated community importation during this polyclonal outbreak. Molecular tools revealed complex transmission dynamics. Low healthcare worker vaccination rates and gaps in recommended infection control procedures are likely to have contributed to nosocomial spread of influenza, which remains a potentially life\u2010threatening disease in elderly adults.","publish_time":"2015-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pagani, Leonardo; Thomas, Yves; Huttner, Benedikt; Sauvan, Val\u00E9rie; Notaridis, Grigorios; Kaiser, Laurent; Iten, Anne; Pittet, Didier; Harbarth, Stephan","journal":"J Am Geriatr Soc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aecbd098f93e07ad95a1aad10c3359a1474e91d0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166655.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25900487/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.13339","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjszMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Switzerland"],"keyphrases":["influenza cases","Nosocomial influenza transmission","nosocomial outbreak of influenza","nosocomial influenza outbreak","influenza infection","influenza viruses","nosocomial spread of influenza","influenza complications","suspected cases","secondary cases","confirmed cases","hospital transmission dynamics","distinct clusters of nosocomial transmission","respiratory viruses","complex transmission dynamics","polyclonal outbreak","outbreak period","Specimens positive","positive test","Prospective outbreak investigation","recommended infection control procedures","Respiratory samples","elderly adults","Elderly hospitalized adults","Molecular tools","molecular typing","healthcare workers","Low healthcare worker vaccination rates","overall vaccination rate","large academic geriatric hospital","gaps","droplet precautions","real\u2010time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal swabs","active case","repeated community importation","single room isolation","illness","syndromic surveillance","SETTING","Switzerland","DESIGN","viral sequencing","clinical criteria","total","life\u2010threatening disease","PARTICIPANTS","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","MEASUREMENTS","patients","OBJECTIVES","individual"],"language":"en"},

The objective of the current paper is to summarize available literature on pathogens causing human disease that have been associated with wild bird species. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to identify specific pathogens known to be associated with wild and migratory birds. The evidence for direct transmission of an avian borne pathogen to a human was assessed. Transmission to humans was classified as direct if there is published evidence for such transmission from the avian species to a person or indirect if the transmission requires a vector other than the avian species. RESULTS: Several wild and migratory birds serve as reservoirs and/or mechanical vectors (simply carrying a pathogen or dispersing infected arthropod vectors) for numerous infectious agents. An association with transmission from birds to humans was identified for 10 pathogens. Wild birds including migratory species may play a significant role in the epidemiology of influenza A virus, arboviruses such as West Nile virus and enteric bacterial pathogens. Nevertheless only one case of direct transmission from wild birds to humans was found. CONCLUSION: The available evidence suggests wild birds play a limited role in human infectious diseases. Direct transmission of an infectious agent from wild birds to humans is rarely identified. Potential factors and mechanisms involved in the transmission of infectious agents from birds to humans need further elucidation.","publish_time":"2007-12-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsiodras, Sotirios; Kelesidis, Theodoros; Kelesidis, Iosif; Bauchinger, Ulf; Falagas, Matthew E.","journal":"J Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39da4ed41c66777a247827fba1149598546e57ef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172416.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445307008122; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445307008122","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjszNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Wild birds","migratory birds","humans","transmission of infectious agents","wild bird species","migratory species","case of direct transmission","avian species","human infectious diseases","available evidence","specific pathogens","numerous infectious agents","long-distance vectors","available literature","mechanical vectors","human disease","enteric bacterial pathogens","infected arthropod vectors","limited role","significant role","West Nile virus","systematic literature search","arboviruses","epidemiology of influenza","reservoirs","current paper","mechanisms","person","wide range of microorganisms","METHODS","CONCLUSION","INTRODUCTION","RESULTS","association","Potential factors","objective","elucidation"],"language":"en"},

ADPr-binding by the alphavirus nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3) MD is necessary for the initiation of virus replication in neural cells, whereas hydrolase activity facilitates replication complex amplification. To determine the importance of these activities for pathogenesis of alphavirus encephalomyelitis, mutations were introduced into the nsP3 MD of Sindbis virus (SINV), and the effects on ADPr binding and hydrolase activities, virus replication, immune responses, and disease were assessed. Elimination of ADPr-binding and hydrolase activities (G32E) severely impaired in vitro replication of SINV in neural cells and in vivo replication in the central nervous systems of 2-week-old mice with reversion to wild type (WT) (G) or selection of a less compromising change (S) during replication. SINVs with decreased binding and hydrolase activities (G32S and G32A) or with hydrolase deficiency combined with better ADPr-binding (Y114A) were less virulent than WT virus. Compared to the WT, the G32S virus replicated less well in both the brain and spinal cord, induced similar innate responses, and caused less severe disease with full recovery of survivors, whereas the Y114A virus replicated well, induced higher expression of interferon-stimulated and NF-\u03BAB-induced genes, and was cleared more slowly from the spinal cord with persistent paralysis in survivors. Therefore, MD function was important for neural cell replication both in vitro and in vivo and determined the outcome from alphavirus encephalomyelitis in mice.","publish_time":"2020-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abraham, Rachy; McPherson, Robert L.; Dasovich, Morgan; Badiee, Mohsen; Leung, Anthony K.

METHODS: Nasopharynx samples of children \u003C 18 years of age with respiratory symptoms referred to a general pediatric clinic were tested for the presence of 19 viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, using real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Of 177 patients included in this retrospective study, 73% were positive for at least one virus. Respiratory syncytial virus (36.6%) and human rhinovirus (24%) were most frequently detected. Patients in whom a respiratory virus or Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected, were younger (6 versus 24 months; p \u003C 0.001) and more often hospitalized (116 versus 34; p = 0.001) than patients in whom no respiratory pathogen was detected. Also they were more likely to present with feeding problems, dyspnea, rhinorrhea and wheezing (all p \u003C 0.05) than patients without a respiratory pathogen. In the majority of cases, clinicians did not change their antibiotic management after detecting a viral respiratory pathogen. No difference in mean Ct value was found between patients with one respiratory pathogen and those with \u003E1 respiratory pathogen (30.5 versus 31.2; p = 0.573).

Current therapeutic treatments for Lassa fever are limited, making the development of novel countermeasures an urgent priority. In this study, we identified losmapimod, a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor, from 102 screened compounds as an inhibitor of LASV infection. Losmapimod exerted its inhibitory effect against LASV after p38 MAPK down-regulation, and, interestingly, had no effect on other arenaviruses capable of causing viral hemorrhagic fever. Mechanistic studies showed that losmapimod inhibited LASV entry by affecting the stable signal peptide (SSP)-GP2 subunit interface of the LASV glycoprotein, thereby blocking pH-dependent viral fusion. As an aryl heteroaryl bis-carboxyamide derivative, losmapimod represents a novel chemical scaffold with anti-LASV activity, and it provides a new lead structure for the future development of LASV fusion inhibitors.","publish_time":"2019-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Xiaoyu; Yan, Feihu; Tang, Ke; Chen, Qing; Guo, Jiamei; Zhu, Wenjun; He, Shihua; Banadyga, Logan; Qiu, Xiangguo; Guo, Ying","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8873e6837d1882c21c87b9940b3df35d238d92a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111477.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354218307800; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354218307800; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2019.03.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30953674/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjszODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LASV"],"locations":["West Africa"],"keyphrases":["LASV glycoprotein","inhibitor of LASV infection","losmapimod inhibited LASV entry","anti-LASV activity","Lassa fever","Lassa hemorrhagic fever","future development of LASV fusion inhibitors","viral hemorrhagic fever","p38 MAPK","development of novel countermeasures","Abstract Lassa virus","inhibitory effect","pH-dependent viral fusion","novel chemical scaffold","p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase","SSP","significant threat","stable signal peptide","GP2 subunit interface","aryl heteroaryl bis-carboxyamide derivative","public health","humans","arenaviruses capable","screened compounds","new lead structure","West Africa","Mechanistic studies","urgent priority","Current therapeutic treatments","regulation","study"],"language":"en"},

Recently, in the Arabian Peninsula, including in Saudi Arabia, epidemiological data indicated an actual increase in the number of emerging and/or reemerging cases of several viral zoonotic diseases. Data presented in this review are very relevant because Saudi Arabia is considered the largest country in the Peninsula. We believe that zoonotic pathogens in Saudi Arabia remain an important public health problem; however, more than 10 million Muslim pilgrims from around 184 Islamic countries arrive yearly at Makkah for the Hajj season and/or for the Umrah. Therefore, for health reasons, several countries recommend vaccinations for various zoonotic diseases among preventive protocols that should be complied with before traveling to Saudi Arabia. However, there is a shortage of epidemiological data focusing on the emerging and reemerging of zoonotic pathogens transmitted from animal to humans in different densely populated cities and/or localities in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, further efforts might be needed to control the increasing impacts of zoonotic viral disease. Also, there is a need for a high collaboration to enhance the detection and determination of the prevalence, diagnosis, control, and prevention as well as intervention and reduction in outbreaks of these diseases in Saudi Arabia, particularly those from other countries. Persons in the health field including physicians and veterinarians, pet owners, pet store owners, exporters, border guards, and people involved in businesses related to animal products have adopted various preventive strategies. Some of these measures might pave the way to highly successful prevention and control results on the different transmission routes of these viral zoonotic diseases from or to Saudi Arabia. Moreover, the prevention of these viral pathogens depends on socioeconomic impacts, available data, improved diagnosis, and highly effective therapeutics or prophylaxis.","publish_time":"2019-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Tayib, Omar A.","journal":"Pathogens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9599f421f59c01ea41789ba70c79330cdea8e1d2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6471281.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813309/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens8010025","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Saudi Arabia","Makkah"],"keyphrases":["Saudi Arabia","viral zoonotic diseases","various zoonotic diseases","viral pathogens","increasing socioeconomic impact of zoonotic pathogens","increasing impacts of zoonotic viral disease","available data","shortage of epidemiological data","pet owners","socioeconomic impacts","humans","health field","control results","health reasons","Islamic countries","successful prevention","pet store owners","various preventive strategies","improved diagnosis","animal products","important public health problem","number of emerging","preventive protocols","reemerging cases","Arabian Peninsula","different transmission routes","exporters","veterinarians","vaccinations","border guards","physicians","actual increase","people","populated cities","outbreaks","detection","determination","effective therapeutics","businesses","Makkah","prevalence","way","reduction","localities","animals","largest country","review","high collaboration","Muslim pilgrims","intervention","Persons","Hajj season","need","prophylaxis","Umrah","measures","efforts"],"language":"en"},

Although such vectors are usually \u201Cgutted\u201D and are replication defective, they are subjected to clearance by the host cells by immune recognition and destruction. Unfolded protein response (UPR) is a naturally evolved cyto-protective signaling pathway which is triggered due to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress caused by accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins in its lumen. The UPR signaling consists of three signaling pathways, namely PKR-like ER kinase, activating transcription factor 6, and inositol-requiring protein-1. Once activated, UPR triggers the production of ER molecular chaperones and stress response proteins to help reduce the protein load within the ER. This occurs by degradation of the misfolded proteins and ensues in the arrest of protein translation machinery. If the burden of protein load in ER is beyond its processing capacity, UPR can activate pro-apoptotic pathways or autophagy leading to cell death. Viruses are naturally evolved in hijacking the host cellular translation machinery to generate a large amount of proteins. This phenomenon disrupts ER homeostasis and leads to ER stress. Alternatively, in the case of gutted vectors used in gene therapy, the excess load of recombinant vectors administered and encountered by the cell can trigger UPR.

A compensatory mutation at amino acid 31 in the macro domain of nsP3, as well as reversion of mutated amino acid 10, occurred during replication of double mutant SINV in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract Molecular biology is omnipresent in medical biology especially in microbiology. Many papers report studies on its importance in diagnosis, prognosis, therapeutic field, epidemiology, natural (or not) biological risks alike. The important sum of reports on this subject does not always bring an obvious answer to the part that molecular biology could play in a microbiology laboratory either public or private. This article summarizes the contributions of this specialized field in microbiology and brings some questions on its contribution. Is molecular biology a real progress in microbiology? What are the main indications of molecular biology today in this field? According to the infectious particle, the answers are not always simple. They can be obvious in some cases (for instance, hepatitis C) or less obvious in other cases (tuberculosis for instance). In this article divided in two parts, the first one report an introduction to molecular biology in microbiology and the following second part will deal with the main applications in microbiology.","publish_time":"2007-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lamoril, J.; Bogard, M.; Ameziane, N.; Deybach, J.-C.; Bouizegar\u00E8ne, P.","journal":"Immuno-analyse \u0026 Biologie Sp\u00E9cialis\u00E9e","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b8aef4800194b72b41c9db6f466dd746e800c734.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0923253206001608; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0923253206001608","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["this specialized field in microbiology","molecular biology today in this field","In this article divided in two parts","real progress in microbiology","the first","the answers","Abstract Molecular biology is omnipresent in medical biology especially in microbiology","report an introduction to molecular biology in microbiology","its importance in diagnosis","Is molecular biology","the main indications","the following second part will deal with the main applications in microbiology","less obvious in other cases","r\u00F4le de la biologie mol\u00E9culaire","g\u00E9n\u00E9ralit\u00E9s de biologie mol\u00E9culaire","examen de biologie mol\u00E9culaire","This article summarizes the contributions","The important sum","always bring an obvious answer to the part that molecular biology could play in","biologie m\u00E9dicale","domaine de la microbiologie","They can be obvious in some cases","According to the infectious particle","laboratoire de microbiologie","this subject does","microbiology laboratory either public","therapeutic field","article compos\u00E9","brings some questions","tuberculosis for instance","its contribution","always simple","premi\u00E8re partie","domaine du diagnostic","nombreux articles","Many papers report studies","reports","prognosis","hepatitis","natural","\u00E9pid\u00E9miologie","epidemiology","principales techniques utilis\u00E9es","pronostic","private","parties","What","biological risks alike","synth\u00E8se des apports","risques biologiques naturels","\u00E9valuation th\u00E9rapeutique","quantit\u00E9 consid\u00E9rable","sujet","discipline","exemple","r\u00E9ponse \u00E9vidente","revue","\u00E9tat des lieux","r\u00E9el apport","r\u00E9ponses"],"language":"fr"},

Combinations of HA1918\u002BNA2009 and HA2009\u002BNA1918 also formed infectious H1N1pps, among which the HA2009\u002BNA1918 combination resulted in the most highly infectious pp. Our study demonstrated that some reassortments of H1N1 viruses may hold the potential to produce higher infectivity than do their ancestors.","publish_time":"2009-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Yonghui; Lin, Xiaojing; Zhang, Fengwei; Wu, Jia; Tan, Wenjie; Bi, Shengli; Zhou, Jianfang; Shu, Yuelong; Wang, Yue","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc8b2d73f71e65384dbd4056071f618a9cae7097.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092934.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X09013916; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X09013916; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19615337/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.07.040","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prevention of H1N1 viruses","reassortments of H1N1 viruses","HA2009","high infectivity","NA1918 combination","infectious H1N1pps","higher infectivity","biological study","current pandemic influenza","complicated reassortment of various influenza","viral envelope proteins hemagglutinin","pseudotyped particles","neuraminidase","NA2009","potential","Combinations of HA1918","control","ancestors"],"language":"en"},

Some strains of LCMV exploit high affinity interactions with \u03B1-dystroglycan (\u03B1-DG) to bind to cell surfaces and subsequently fuse in low pH endosomes. LCMV strains with low \u03B1-DG affinity utilize an unknown receptor and display unique tissue tropisms. We pseudotyped non-primate feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) vectors using LCMV derived glycoproteins with high or low affinity to \u03B1-DG and evaluated their properties in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: We pseudotyped FIV with the LCMV WE54 strain envelope glycoprotein and also engineered a point mutation in the WE54 envelope glycoprotein (L260F) to diminish \u03B1-DG affinity and direct binding to alternate receptors. We hypothesized that this change would alter in vivo tissue tropism and enhance gene transfer to neonatal animals. RESULTS: In mice, hepatic \u03B1- and \u03B2-DG expression was greatest at the late gestational and neonatal time points. When displayed on the surface of the FIV lentivirus the WE54 L260F mutant glycoprotein bound weakly to immobilized \u03B1-DG. Additionally, LCMV WE54 pseudotyped FIV vector transduction was neutralized by pre-incubation with soluble \u03B1-DG, while the mutant glycoprotein pseudotyped vector was not. In vivo gene transfer in adult mice with either envelope yielded low transduction efficiencies in hepatocytes following intravenous delivery. In marked contrast, neonatal gene transfer with the LCMV envelopes, and notably with the FIV-L260F vector, conferred abundant liver and lower level cardiomyocyte transduction as detected by luciferase assays, bioluminescent imaging, and \u03B2-galactosidase staining. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a developmentally regulated receptor for LCMV is expressed abundantly in neonatal mice. LCMV pseudotyped vectors may have applications for neonatal gene transfer.

Objective: We surveyed government officials designated as Competent Bodies for Scientific Advice concerning infectious diseases to examine the degree to which they are concerned about potential effects of climate change on infectious diseases, as well as their perceptions of institutional capacities in their respective countries. Methods: In 2007 and 2009/2010, national infectious disease experts from 30 European Economic Area countries were surveyed about recent and projected infectious disease patterns in relation to climate change in their countries and the national capacity to cope with them. Results: A large majority of respondents agreed that climate change would affect vector-borne (86% of country representatives), food-borne (70%), water-borne (68%), and rodent-borne (68%) diseases in their countries. In addition, most indicated that institutional improvements are needed for ongoing surveillance programs (83%), collaboration with the veterinary sector (69%), management of animal disease outbreaks (66%), national monitoring and control of climate-sensitive infectious diseases (64%), health services during an infectious disease outbreak (61%), and diagnostic support during an epidemic (54%). Conclusions: Expert responses were generally consistent with the peer-reviewed literature regarding the relationship between climate change and vector- and water-borne diseases, but were less so for food-borne diseases. Shortcomings in institutional capacity to manage climate change vulnerability, identified in this assessment, should be addressed in impact, vulnerability, and adaptation assessments.","publish_time":"2011-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Semenza, Jan C.; Suk, Jonathan E.; Estevez, Virginia; Ebi, Kristie L.; Lindgren, Elisabet","journal":"Environ Health Perspect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f093aa0cf1ddef303ec4c049ab0be105587dd92c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3295348.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1103805; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22113877/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["European Economic Area"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["climate change vulnerability","consequence of climate change","sensitive infectious diseases","infectious disease outbreak","control of climate","potential effects of climate change","national infectious disease experts","projected infectious disease patterns","institutional capacity","respective countries","national capacity","institutional improvements","national monitoring","vector","water","food","European Economic Area countries","management of animal disease outbreaks","perceptions of institutional capacities","outbreak frequency","Competent Bodies","relationship","Scientific Advice","peer-reviewed literature","distribution","government officials","large majority of respondents","regional information available","health services","decision making","impact","incidence","ongoing surveillance programs","Expert responses","collaboration","Conclusions","Results","adaptation assessments","Background","Shortcomings","veterinary sector","diagnostic support","epidemic","Objective","country representatives","addition","degree","rodent","Methods"],"language":"en"},

When transmission-based PPE ensembles are not appropriate, HCP must recognize the transmission pathway of the disease and anticipate the exposures to select PPE. Because guidance for this process is extremely limited, we proposed a systematic, risk-based approach to the selection and evaluation of PPE ensembles to protect HCP against infectious diseases. Methods The approach used in this study included the following 4 steps: (1) job hazard analysis, (2) infectious disease hazard analysis, (3) selection of PPE, and (4) evaluation of selected PPE. Selected PPE should protect HCP from exposure, be usable by HCP, and fit for purpose. Results The approach was demonstrated for the activity of intubation of a patient with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus. As expected, the approach led to the selection of different ensembles of PPE for these 2 pathogens. Discussion A systematic risk-based approach to the selection of PPE will help health care facilities and HCP select PPE when transmission-based precautions are not appropriate. Owing to the complexity of PPE ensemble selection and evaluation, a team with expertise in infectious diseases, occupational health, the health care activity, and related disciplines, such as human factors, should be engaged. Conclusions Participation, documentation, and transparency are necessary to ensure the decisions can be communicated, critiqued, and understood by HCP.","publish_time":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jones, Rachael M.; Bleasdale, Susan C.; Maita, Dayana; Brosseau, Lisa M.","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd51530ed73c17ccd16690c0bfa046be2f360f7f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132808.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2019.06.023; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655319306546; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655319306546; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31358421/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE","HCP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["selection of PPE","HCP","evaluation of PPE ensembles","evaluation of selected PPE","transmission-based PPE ensembles","selection of different ensembles of PPE","complexity of PPE ensemble selection","infectious diseases","systematic risk-based approach","health care activity","health care personnel","health care facilities","transmission-based precautions","occupational health","infectious disease hazard analysis","transmission pathway","job hazard analysis","activity of intubation","methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","patient","related disciplines","expertise","team","primary strategy","transparency","Background Personal protective equipment","documentation","steps","study","Discussion","Conclusions Participation","human factors","guidance","process","decisions","Methods","exposures","pathogens","purpose"],"language":"en"},

We found a longer incubation period for the 173 fatal cases with a mean of 3.7 days (95% credibility interval, CrI: 3.4\u20134.1), compared to a mean of 3.3 days (95% CrI: 2.9\u20133.6) for the 222 non-fatal cases, and the difference in means was marginally significant at 0.47 days (95% CrI: -0.04, 0.99). There was a statistically significant correlation between a longer incubation period and an increased risk of death after adjustment for age, sex, geographical location and underlying medical conditions (adjusted odds ratio 1.70 per day increase in incubation period; 95% credibility interval 1.47\u20131.97). CONCLUSIONS: We found a significant association between a longer incubation period and a greater risk of death among human H7N9 cases. The underlying biological mechanisms leading to this association deserve further exploration.","publish_time":"2016-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Virlogeux, Victor; Yang, Juan; Fang, Vicky J.; Feng, Luzhao; Tsang, Tim K.; Jiang, Hui; Wu, Peng; Zheng, Jiandong; Lau, Eric H.

METHODS: A sample of patients of all ages presenting with ILI was included by physicians of the French Sentinelles network during two seasons (2015/16 and 2016/17). Nasopharyngeal samples were tested for the presence of influenza virus (IV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). Patients\u0027 characteristics associated with each of the four virus classes were studied using multivariate logistic regressions. RESULTS: A total of 5859 individuals were included in the study: 48.0% tested positive for IV, 7.9% for HRV, 7.5% for RSV and 4.1% for HMPV. Cough was associated with IV (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.81\u20132.52) RSV (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.75\u20133.74) and HMPV detection (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.40\u20133.45).

Studies suggest beneficial effects of azithromycin in reducing viral load of hospitalized patients, possibly interfering with ligand/CD147 receptor interactions; however, its possible effects on SARS-CoV-2 invasion has not yet been evaluated. In addition to the possible effect in invasion, azithromycin decreases the expression of some metalloproteinases (downstream to CD147), induces anti-viral responses in primary human bronchial epithelial infected with rhinovirus, decreasing viral replication and release. Moreover, resident lung progenitor/stem are extensively differentiated into myofibroblasts during pulmonary fibrosis, a complication observed in COVID-19 patients. This process, and the possible direct viral invasion of progenitor/stem cells via CD147 or ACE2, could result in the decline of these cellular stocks and failing lung repair.

We describe the clinical features and treatment outcomes of patients with laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV at a regional referral center in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: In 2014, a retrospective chart review was performed on patients with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of MERS-CoV to determine clinical and treatment characteristics associated with death. Confounding was evaluated and a multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess the independent effect of treatments administered. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients had an overall mortality of 37 %. Most patients were male (78 %) with a mean age of 54 years. Almost a quarter of the patients were healthcare workers (23.5 %) and 41 % had a known exposure to another person with MERS-CoV. Survival was associated with male gender, working as a healthcare worker, history of hypertension, vomiting on admission, elevated respiratory rate, abnormal lung exam, elevated alanine transaminase (ALT), clearance of MERS-CoV on repeat PCR polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, and mycophenolate mofetil treatment. Survival was reduced in the presence of coronary artery disease, hypotension, hypoxemia, CXR (chest X-ray) abnormalities, leukocytosis, creatinine \u003E1 \u00B7 5 mg/dL, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and renal failure. In a multivariate analysis of treatments administered, severity of illness was the greatest predictor of reduced survival. CONCLUSIONS: Care for patients with MERS-CoV remains a challenge. In this retrospective cohort, interferon beta and mycophenolate mofetil treatment were predictors of increased survival in the univariate analysis. Severity of illness was the greatest predictor of reduced survival in the multivariate analysis. Larger randomized trials are needed to better evaluate the efficacy of these treatment regimens for MERS-CoV.","publish_time":"2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al Ghamdi, Mohammed; Alghamdi, Khalid M.; Ghandoora, Yasmeen; Alzahrani, Ameera; Salah, Fatmah; Alsulami, Abdulmoatani; Bawayan, Mayada F.; Vaidya, Dhananjay; Perl, Trish M.; Sood, Geeta","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a7c1c991ee3905b06ca628a523f693a402cc7f1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4839124.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-016-1492-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27097824/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV","clearance of MERS","diagnosis of MERS","treatment outcomes of patients","mycophenolate mofetil treatment","treatment characteristics","treatment regimens","greatest predictor of reduced survival","multivariate analysis of treatments","known treatments","predictors of increased survival","severity of illness","laboratory","univariate analysis","elevated respiratory rate","multivariate logistic regression","independent effect of treatments","understood disease","retrospective cohort","clinical features","healthcare workers","known exposure","male gender","elevated alanine transaminase","retrospective chart review","presence of coronary artery disease","repeat PCR polymerase chain reaction","Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","abnormal lung exam","hypotension","hypoxemia","testing","interferon beta","chest X-ray","CXR","admission","regional referral center","abnormalities","BACKGROUND","history of hypertension","leukocytosis","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","person","thrombocytopenia","anemia","renal failure","creatinine","death","quarter","efficacy","CONCLUSIONS","overall mortality","mean age","years","Larger randomized trials","Confounding","RESULTS","challenge","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

These viruses can also target other stromal cell types as well as in certain instances, CD45(\u002B) hematopoietic cells either resident in the lungs or part of the inflammatory response to infection. The mechanisms by which the virus produces injury to these cell types include direct infection with cytopathic effects as a consequence of replication. Host mediated damage is also a culprit in pulmonary injury as both innate and adaptive immune cells produce soluble and cell-associated pro-inflammatory mediators. Recently, it has become increasingly clear that in addition to control of excess inflammation and virus elimination, the resolution of infection requires an active repair process, which is necessary to regain normal respiratory function and restore the lungs to homeostasis. The repair response must re-establish the epithelial barrier and regenerate the microarchitecture of the lung. Emerging areas of research have highlighted the importance of innate immune cells, particularly the newly described innate lymphoid cells, as well as alternatively activated macrophages and pulmonary stem cells in the repair process. The mechanisms by which respiratory viruses may impede or alter the repair response will be important areas of research for identifying therapeutic targets aimed at limiting virus and host mediated injury and expediting recovery.","publish_time":"2012-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gorski, Stacey A.; Hufford, Matthew M.; Braciale, Thomas J.","journal":"Current Opinion in Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1fe8270b7bc9ef95aecbaa60120c2e1058e0eb29.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1b689b8dc7c666acd5cdd6675ed54cc6612a5607.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3378727.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3378727?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1879625712000739; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625712000739; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2012.04.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22608464/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["repair response","resolution of infection","direct infection","productive infection","hallmark of infection","hematopoietic cells","innate lymphoid cells","respiratory viruses","importance of innate immune cells","pulmonary stem cells","adaptive immune cells","pulmonary injury","inflammatory response","host mediated injury","active repair process","virus elimination","stromal cell types","lungs","mechanisms","important areas of research","Host mediated damage","Emerging areas of research","normal respiratory function","pro-inflammatory mediators","cytopathic effects","culprit","control of excess inflammation","subsequent destruction","therapeutic targets","activated macrophages","expediting recovery","addition","certain instances","CD45","epithelial barrier","consequence of replication","microarchitecture","airway epithelium","resident","homeostasis"],"language":"en"},

Subsequent experimental infection of Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) caused a disease similar to that of naturally infected bats. Although substantial attention has focused on bats as reservoir hosts of viruses that cause human disease, little is known about the interactions between bats and their pathogens. We performed a transcriptome-wide study to illuminate the response of Jamaican fruit bats experimentally infected with TCRV. Differential gene expression analysis of multiple tissues revealed global and organ-specific responses associated with innate antiviral responses, including interferon alpha/beta and Toll-like receptor signaling, activation of complement cascades, and cytokine signaling, among others. Genes encoding proteins involved in adaptive immune responses, such as gamma interferon signaling and costimulation of T cells by the CD28 family, were also altered in response to TCRV infection. Immunoglobulin gene expression was also elevated in the spleens of infected bats, including IgG, IgA, and IgE isotypes. These results indicate an active innate and adaptive immune response to TCRV infection occurred but did not prevent fatal disease. This de novo assembly provides a high-throughput data set of the Jamaican fruit bat and its host response to TCRV infection, which remains a valuable tool to understand the molecular signatures involved in antiviral responses in bats. IMPORTANCE As reservoir hosts of viruses associated with human disease, little is known about the interactions between bats and viruses. Using Jamaican fruit bats infected with Tacaribe virus (TCRV) as a model, we characterized the gene expression responses to infection in different tissues and identified pathways involved with the response to infection. This report is the most detailed gene discovery work in the species to date and the first to describe immune gene expression responses in bats during a pathogenic viral infection.","publish_time":"2017-09-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gerrard, Diana L.; Hawkinson, Ann; Sherman, Tyler; Modahl, Cassandra M.; Hume, Gretchen; Campbell, Corey L.; Schountz, Tony; Frietze, Seth","journal":"mSphere","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c383b8dedcefbf78e370b0152058176d9219330e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5615131.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28959737/; https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00245-17","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsxNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["IgE"],"organizations":["TCRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["artibeus bats","TCRV infection","response of Jamaican fruit bats","spleens of infected bats","Subsequent experimental infection of Jamaican fruit bats","immune gene expression responses","adaptive immune responses","innate antiviral responses","Immunoglobulin gene expression","host response","pathogenic viral infection","human disease","organ-specific responses","disease similar","fatal disease","Differential gene expression analysis of multiple tissues","reservoir hosts of viruses","detailed gene discovery work","Tacaribe virus","interactions","different tissues","interferon alpha","gamma interferon","Artibeus jamaicensis","high-throughput data set","IgG","costimulation of T cells","molecular signatures","receptor","Toll","species","beta","IgA","pathways","activation of complement cascades","valuable tool","CD28 family","date","mammalian arenavirus","proteins","model","novo assembly","cytokine","IgE isotypes","transcriptome-wide study","results","report","Genes","IMPORTANCE","substantial attention","pathogens"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Kawasaki disease features and classification were documented by the attending physician using a standardized documentation tool on the day of treatment for KD, including confidence in the KD diagnosis on a 4-point scale. Incomplete KD was further classified using American Heart Association (AHA) criteria (sufficient or insufficient) and baseline echocardiogram data. We prospectively recorded intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) resistance, coronary artery abnormalities (CAAs), periungual peeling, and retrospectively identified subsequent diagnoses of autoimmune/inflammatory disease. RESULTS: From November 2012 to October, 2015, 162 patients were treated for KD: 105 with complete KD (Group 1), 7 with incomplete KD based on CAAs on day of KD diagnosis (Group 2), 23 with incomplete KD meeting AHA criteria (Group 3), and 27 with incomplete KD and insufficient AHA criteria (Group 4). Group 4 patients had lower baseline median C-reactive protein levels (Group 4 median 4.65 mg/dL [interquartile range {IQR}, 2.3\u201313.6] vs Group 1 median 8.0 mg/dL [IQR, 4.5\u201317], Group 2 median 13.9 mg/dL [IQR, 1.4\u201318.2], Group 3 median 13.3 mg/dL [IQR, 4.9\u201320.2]), and no coronary abnormalities developed, although 11% had IVIG resistance.

Meanwhile, TGEV also induces DJ-1 and some antioxidant genes upregulation to suppress oxidative stress induced by viral infection. Furthermore, silencing DJ-1 inhibit mitophagy and increase apoptosis after TGEV infection. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time that viral nucleocapsid protein (N) is located in mitochondria and mitophagosome during virus infection or be expressed alone. Those results provide a novel perspective for further improvement of prevention and treatment in TGEV infection. These results suggest that TGEV infection induce mitophagy to promote cell survival and possibly viral infection.","publish_time":"2016-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Liqi; Mou, Chunxiao; Yang, Xing; Lin, Jian; Yang, Qian","journal":"Oncotarget","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4562513d3f2f9c259d9ce5a0eae9233dbf8b8f87.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5053637.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.8345; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27027356/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TGEV infection","viral infection","virus infection","role of mitophagy","complete mitophagy","large number of mitochondria","oxidative stress","porcine epithelial cells","quality control of mitochondria","Selective autophagy of mitochondria","obvious apoptosis","viral nucleocapsid protein","results","intestinal epithelial cells","cell survival","important role","silencing DJ","porcine enteropathogenic coronavirus","maintenance of cell homeostasis","Transmissible gastroenteritis virus","malabsorption","abnormal morphology","mitochondrial injury","lethal watery diarrhea","persisting absorption","improvement of prevention","pathological changes","antioxidant genes upregulation","suckling piglets","IPEC-J2","novel perspective","time","barrier function","treatment","mitophagosome","addition"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We analysed the epidemiological characteristics of 311 Chinese citizens evacuated from Iran. All confirmed COVID-19 cases amongst the returnees were displayed by the spatial distribution pattern of the extent of COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Characteristics that differed significantly amongst these returnees compared to the original infected cohorts in Gansu were mean age, occupation and sex. Differences observed between infected patients and non-patients amongst returnees were age, sex, race, occupation, the use of facemasks, and residential situation in Iran. The clinical features that were significantly related to infection were chill, shortness of breath, chest pain and nausea. Spatial distribution pattern analysis indicated that infected returnees had resided within Iranian provinces that had experienced high levels of COVID-19. The spatial distribution of the original homes of these returnees before departure for Iran demonstrated that returnees will largely return to northwest China, to regions that have only experienced low levels of infection within China.

The patients were classified according to whether they exhibited complete compliance (100% of visits), excellent compliance (\u226570% of visits), incomplete compliance (\u003C70% of visits), or non-compliance (only 2 visits). Patient characteristics that could affect PC-SPT, such as age, sex, distance of the clinic from their residence, implantation, and periodontal treatment, were investigated. The number of newly decayed and extracted teeth, alveolar bone level changes around the teeth and implants, and implant removal were examined to evaluate the prognosis of PC-SPT.

Two DI-specific RNA species, DIssA of genomic size and DIssE of subgenomic size, were detected in DI-infected cells. Purified DI particles, however, were found to contain predominantly DIssA and only a trace amount of DIssE RNA. Despite its negligible amount, the DIssE RNA in virions appears to serve as the template for the synthesis of DIssE RNA in infected cells. This conclusion was supported by two studies. First, the uv target size for DIssE RNA synthesis is significantly smaller than that for DIssA. Second, when purified DIssE RNA was transfected into cells which had been infected with a helper virus, DIssE RNA could replicate itself and became a predominant RNA species in the infected cells. Thus, DIssE RNA was not synthesized from the genomic RNA of DI particles. By studying the relationship between virus dilution and the amount of intracellular viral RNA synthesis, we have further shown that DIssE RNA synthesis requires a helper function, but it does not utilize the leader sequence of the helper virus. In contrast, DIssA synthesis appears to be helper-independent and can replicate itself. Thus DIssA codes for a functional RNA polymerase.","publish_time":"1988-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Makino, Shinji; Shieh, Chien-Kou; Keck, James G.; Lai, Michael M.C.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7890cdb9c6a2dc34cccc3bf93c87033d2a81e88b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682288902371; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682288902371","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["synthesis of DIssE RNA","DIssE RNA synthesis","genomic RNA of DI particles","intracellular viral RNA synthesis","DIssA synthesis","predominant RNA species","DI-specific RNA species","functional RNA polymerase","DI-infected cells","DIssE of subgenomic size","helper virus","mechanism of synthesis","DIssA of genomic size","DIssA codes","virus dilution","helper function","helper-independent","particles of mouse hepatitis virus","uv target size","defective viral RNAs","defective-interfering","template","leader sequence","virions","relationship","contrast","conclusion","studies"],"language":"en"},

In mouse vagina model, administration of geldanamycin suspension to vagina after virus infection protected the infected mice from death and increased the average survival days in a dose-dependent manner. Geldanamycin also significantly reduced virus shedding from mouse vagina. All geldanamycin-treated groups were statistically significant when compared with the infected control group. The high-dose group of geldanamycin (5.72 mg kg(\u22121)) was better than acyclovir group (2.86 mg kg(\u22121)). All geldanamycin vaginal administration mock-infected groups did not show significant body weight loss. Although geldanamycin has strong antiviral activities against various DNA and RNA viruses, geldanamycin is not suitable for systemic administration because of its high toxicity. We consider that geldanamycin is a candidate of topical usage for the treatment of herpes simplex virus type infections.

Usually, large numbers of camels and other domestic animals from many different herds/flocks congregate at watering sites, and this may create a perfect condition for disease transmission and spread among animals. The same water sources are also shared by multitudes of wild animals. Camel herd sizes per household range from few heads (five to ten) to several hundreds. Female camels account for more than 75% of the herd. Male camels are usually sold early as pack animals or for slaughter. Female camels may remain fertile up to 25 years, during which time they produce eight to ten calves. Camels are herded during daytime on communal rangelands. During night, they are kept in traditional kraals around homesteads. Breeding time is short and seasonal and is affected by rainfall patterns and feed availability. Usually, only men milk camels. Milking frequency ranges from two to five times per day. Washing of hands, milking vessels, the udder and teats is not practised by many prior to milking the camels. Besides, the milking area is generally full of dust and dung and without shade. This affects the quality and safety of the produced milk. Pathogens and diseases of camelids are less well known; however, they are suspected as zoonotic sources for the human infection with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. There is an increasing need to determine whether camels are clinically susceptible, act as potential reservoirs and maintenance or bridge hosts, to viral pathogens.","publish_time":"2018-12-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mirkena, Tadele; Walelign, Elias; Tewolde, Nega; Gari, Getachew; Abebe, Getachew; Newman, Scott","journal":"Pastoralism","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce0895d0d3f42d1bd939570bd8a3b99f8a348974.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7099212.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226597/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13570-018-0135-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Ethiopia","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["men milk camels","Female camels account","large numbers of camels","domestic animals","pack animals","milking vessels","milking area","multitudes of wild animals","water sources","Milking frequency ranges","semi-arid rangelands of Ethiopia","communal rangelands","viral pathogens","Breeding time","water resources","zoonotic sources","produced milk","harsh conditions of arid","Camel herd sizes","pastoralism","human infection","maintenance","potential reservoirs","bridge hosts","different herds","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","dominant mode of life","mobility","household range","flocks","act","adapted species","rainfall patterns","dust","disease transmission","udder","watering sites","times","feed availability","perfect condition","inherent strategy","heads","distributed pasture","quality","safety","hands","teats","daytime","traditional kraals","homesteads","dung","shade","diseases of camelids","years","slaughter","increasing need","night","calves","hundreds"],"language":"en"},

While investigating a human psittacosis outbreak that was associated with avian chlamydiosis in Hong Kong, we identified a novel adenovirus in epidemiologically linked Mealy Parrots, which was not present in healthy birds unrelated to the outbreak or in other animals. The novel adenovirus (tentatively named Psittacine adenovirus HKU1) was most closely related to Duck adenovirus A in the Atadenovirus genus. Sequencing showed that the Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 genome consists of 31,735 nucleotides. Comparative genome analysis showed that the Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 genome contains 23 open reading frames (ORFs) with sequence similarity to known adenoviral genes, and six additional ORFs at the 3\u2032 end of the genome. Similar to Duck adenovirus A, the novel adenovirus lacks LH1, LH2 and LH3, which distinguishes it from other viruses in the Atadenovirus genus. Notably, fiber-2 protein, which is present in Aviadenovirus but not Atadenovirus, is also present in Psittacine adenovirus HKU1. Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 had pairwise amino acid sequence identities of 50.3\u201354.0% for the DNA polymerase, 64.6\u201370.7% for the penton protein, and 66.1\u201374.0% for the hexon protein with other Atadenovirus. The C. psittaci bacterial load was positively correlated with adenovirus viral load in the lung. Immunostaining for fiber protein expression was positive in lung and liver tissue cells of affected parrots, confirming active viral replication. No other viruses were found. This is the first documentation of an adenovirus-C. psittaci co-infection in an avian species that was associated with a human outbreak of psittacosis. Viral-bacterial co-infection often increases disease severity in both humans and animals. The role of viral-bacterial co-infection in animal-to-human transmission of infectious agents has not received sufficient attention and should be emphasized in the investigation of disease outbreaks in human and animals.","publish_time":"2014-12-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"To, Kelvin K.

Occupational and sports medicine research has attempted to determine a non-invasive proxy for core temperature particularly when access to participants is limited and thermal safety is of a concern due to protective encapsulating clothing, hot ambient environments and/or high endogenous heat production during athletic competition. This investigation aimed to determine the validity of inner canthus of the eye temperature (T EC) as an alternate non-invasive measure of intestinal core temperature (T C) during rest, exercise and post-exercise conditions. Twelve physically active males rested for 30min prior to exercise, performed 60min of aerobic exercise at 60% V\u0307O2max and passively recovered a further 60min post-exercise. T EC and T C were measured at 5min intervals during each condition. Mean differences between T EC and T C were 0.61\u00B0C during pre-exercise, \u22121.78\u00B0C during exercise and \u22121.00\u00B0C during post-exercise.

However, it is unclear whether other countries can implement the stringent measures China eventually adopted. Singapore and Hong Kong, both of which had severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics in 2002\u201303, provide hope and many lessons to other countries. In both places, COVID-19 has been managed well to date, despite early cases, by early government action and through social distancing measures taken by individuals. The course of an epidemic is defined by a series of key factors, some of which are poorly understood at present for COVID-19. The basic reproduction number (R0), which defines the mean number of secondary cases generated by one primary case when the population is largely susceptible to infection, determines the overall number of people who are likely to be infected, or more precisely the area under the epidemic curve. For an epidemic to take hold, the value of R0 must be greater than unity in value. A simple calculation gives the fraction likely to be infected without mitigation. This fraction is roughly 1\u20131/R0. With R0 values for COVID-19 in China around 2\u00B75 in the early stages of the epidemic,2 we calculate that approximately 60% of the population would become infected. This is a very worst-case scenario for a number of reasons. We are uncertain about transmission in children, some communities are remote and unlikely to be exposed, voluntary social distancing by individuals and communities will have an impact, and mitigation efforts, such as the measures put in place in China, greatly reduce transmission. As an epidemic progresses, the effective reproduction number (R) declines until it falls below unity in value when the epidemic peaks and then decays, either due to the exhaustion of people susceptible to infection or the impact of control measures.","publish_time":"2020-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anderson, Roy M; Heesterbeek, Hans; Klinkenberg, Don; Hollingsworth, T D\u00E9irdre","journal":"Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f7a4b8bbccbd085b8f7f45509f049523db6feb5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7158572.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30567-5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673620305675; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32164834/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620305675","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs0MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["COVID","epidemic progresses","epidemic peaks","epidemic curve","value of R0","social distancing measures","stringent measures China","number of reasons","countries","effective reproduction number","overall number of people","basic reproduction number","impact of control measures","early cases","R0 values","voluntary social distancing","mean number of secondary cases","infection","communities","early stages","individuals","unity","fraction likely","isolation of infected populations","transmission","early government action","exhaustion of people susceptible","mitigation efforts","severe acute respiratory syndrome","SARS","declines","primary case","epidemics","children","quarantine","simple calculation","worst-case scenario","area","response","hold","Hong Kong","series of key factors","Singapore","hope","lessons","date","present","places","course"],"language":"en"},

The main outcome measure was symptomatic colds producing asthma exacerbations (infections confirmed by laboratory assays and exacerbation of asthma confirmed by objective changes in peak expiratory flow rate). The results showed that about 20% of the sample did not report an episode. This sub-group had a high proportion of males, low negative affectivity scores and consumed more alcohol. When volunteers with at least one episode were considered it was found that those who reported more negative life events and had low levels of social support had more episodes. Smokers were more likely to have to visit their doctor when they developed a cold-induced exacerbation of asthma.

As of 31 January 2020, this epidemic had spread to 19 countries with 11 791 confirmed cases, including 213 deaths. The World Health Organization has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O\u2019Malley. In this scoping review, 65 research articles published before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and discussed to better understand the epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus. The research domains, dates of publication, journal language, authors\u2019 affiliations, and methodological characteristics were included in the analysis. All the findings and statements in this review regarding the outbreak are based on published information as listed in the references. RESULTS: Most of the publications were written using the English language (89.2%). The largest proportion of published articles were related to causes (38.5%) and a majority (67.7%) were published by Chinese scholars. Research articles initially focused on causes, but over time there was an increase of the articles related to prevention and control. Studies thus far have shown that the virus\u2019 origination is in connection to a seafood market in Wuhan, but specific animal associations have not been confirmed. Reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Preventive measures such as masks, hand hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case detection, contact tracing, and quarantines have been discussed as ways to reduce transmission. To date, no specific antiviral treatment has proven effective; hence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive care. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a rapid surge in research in response to the outbreak of COVID-19. During this early period, published research primarily explored the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus. Although these studies are relevant to control the current public emergency, more high-quality research is needed to provide valid and reliable ways to manage this kind of public health emergency in both the short- and long-term.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adhikari, Sasmita Poudel; Meng, Sha; Wu, Yu-Ju; Mao, Yu-Ping; Ye, Rui-Xue; Wang, Qing-Zhi; Sun, Chang; Sylvia, Sean; Rozelle, Scott; Raat, Hein; Zhou, Huan","journal":"Infect Dis Poverty","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/421838e663f2a0247293270c60d87c535c961068.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7079521.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-020-00646-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32183901/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs0Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["research articles","causes","control","high-quality research","research domains","prevention","published information","kind of public health emergency","largest proportion of published articles","current public emergency","outbreak of COVID","scoping review","Public Health Emergency of International Concern","avoidance of public contact","Wuhan","clinical diagnosis","epidemiology","Studies","outbreak of respiratory illness","specific antiviral treatment","World Health Organization","symptomatic treatment","journal language","methodological characteristics","methodological framework","clinical manifestation","English language","reliable ways","coronavirus disease","novel coronavirus","confirmed cases","specific animal associations","hand hygiene practices","fatigue","pneumonia","masks","authors\u2019 affiliations","dates of publication","case detection","diarrhea","cough","headache","Hubei Province","connection","seafood market","response","hemoptysis","fever","infected people","tracing","Preventive measures","rapid surge","symptoms","countries","publications","supportive care","Arksey","O\u2019Malley","origination","quarantines","China","BACKGROUND","statements","increase","dyspnea","deaths","analysis","findings","time","references","early period","METHODS","Chinese scholars","epidemic","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","transmission","majority"],"language":"en"},

Some social and behavioral research activities (e.g. data analysis, manuscript preparation) can be continued from other environments with appropriate security protocols in place. For studies involving in-person interactions, continuity may be more difficult. Phone-based interactions provide a low-tech solution that may suffice in some cases. Yet, videoconferencing platforms can nearly replicate in-person interactions, activating both auditory and visual senses and potentially resulting in more substantial engagement. Staff can meet with participants individually or in groups, each seeing and hearing one another in real time. This paper provides guidance for researchers transitioning in-person assessments and interventions to a synchronous videoconferencing platform. Best practices, key considerations, examples from the field, and sample protocols are presented to ease transition for ongoing studies and maximize the potential of videoconferencing\u2014and social distancing.

Previous studies used resistance to broad-spectrum RNA mutagens, such as ribavirin, to identify polymerases with increased fidelity that avoid misincorporation of such base analogues. We identified a novel variant in the alphavirus viral helicase/protease, nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2) that operates in concert with the viral polymerase nsP4 to further alter replication complex fidelity, a functional linkage that was conserved among the alphavirus genus. Purified chikungunya virus nsP2 presented delayed helicase activity of the high-fidelity enzyme, and yet purified replication complexes manifested stronger RNA polymerization kinetics. Because mutagenic nucleoside analogs such as ribavirin also affect intracellular nucleotide pools, we addressed the link between nucleotide depletion and replication fidelity by using purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors. High-fidelity viruses were more resistant to these conditions, and viral growth could be rescued by the addition of exogenous nucleosides, suggesting that mutagenesis by base analogues requires nucleotide pool depletion. This study describes a novel function for nsP2, highlighting the role of other components of the replication complex in regulating viral replication fidelity, and suggests that viruses can alter their replication complex fidelity to overcome intracellular nucleotide-depleting conditions. IMPORTANCE Previous studies using the RNA mutagen ribavirin to select for drug-resistant variants have highlighted the essential role of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in regulating replication fidelity. However, the role of other viral replicase components in replication fidelity has not been studied in detail. We identified here an RNA mutagen-resistant variant of the nsP2 helicase/protease that conferred increased fidelity and yet could not operate in the same manner as high-fidelity polymerases. We show that the alphavirus helicase is a key component of the fidelity-regulating machinery. Our data show that the RNA mutagenic activity of compounds such as ribavirin is coupled to and potentiated by nucleotide depletion and that RNA viruses can fine-tune their replication fidelity when faced with an intracellular environment depleted of nucleotides.","publish_time":"2015-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stapleford, Kenneth A.; Rozen-Gagnon, Kathryn; Das, Pratyush Kumar; Saul, Sirle; Poirier, Enzo Z.; Blanc, Herv\u00E9; Vidalain, Pierre-Olivier; Merits, Andres; Vignuzzi, Marco","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3bb1bf62e09f90f586662be381ca7660090400a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4645662.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01553-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26311883/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral replication fidelity","RNA virus replication fidelity","replication complex fidelity","viral RNA polymerase","RNA viruses","increased fidelity","viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","RNA mutagen ribavirin","alphavirus viral helicase","viral growth","purified replication complexes","RNA mutagen-resistant variant","nsP2 helicase","broad-spectrum RNA mutagens","viral polymerase nsP4","viral replicase components","nucleotide depletion","RNA mutagenic activity of compounds","viral replicase proteins","alphavirus helicase","stronger RNA polymerization kinetics","intracellular nucleotide pools","nucleotide pool depletion","High-fidelity viruses","intracellular nucleotide-depleting conditions","potential role","essential role","high-fidelity polymerases","delayed helicase activity","chikungunya virus nsP2","protease","high-fidelity enzyme","intracellular environment","novel variant","base analogues","alphavirus genus","IMPORTANCE Previous studies","drug-resistant variants","novel function","mutagenic nucleoside analogs","mutagenesis","purine","majority of work","nonstructural protein","resistance","misincorporation","key component","functional linkage","pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors","concert","addition of exogenous nucleosides","study","process","data","date","nucleotides","manner","machinery"],"language":"en"},

Methods The current retrospective study is aimed at assessing the range of CMV DNA loads quantified in BAL fluid specimens from allo-HSCT patients with pneumonia in which different microorganisms were causally involved. Results A total of 144 BAL specimens from 123 patients were included. CMV DNA was detected in 56 out of 144 BAL fluid specimens and the median CMV DNA load from patients in whom CMV pneumonia was unlikely or could be tentatively ruled out was 1210 (31\u201368, 920) IU/ml. The frequency of CMV DNA detection and median CMV DNA loads were comparable, irrespective of the attributable cause of pneumonia. Detection of CMV DNA loads in BAL fluid specimens \u003E500 IU/ml was independently associated with pneumonia-attributable mortality. Conclusions The current study highlights the difficulty in establishing universal CMV DNA load thresholds in BAL fluid specimens for distinguishing between CMV pneumonia and pulmonary CMV DNA shedding, and suggests that the presence of CMV DNA in BAL fluid specimens beyond a certain level may have a deleterious impact on patient outcome.","publish_time":"2019-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pi\u00F1ana, Jos\u00E9 Luis; Gim\u00E9nez, Estela; G\u00F3mez, Mar\u00EDa Dolores; P\u00E9rez, Ariadna; Gonz\u00E1lez, Eva Mar\u00EDa; Vinuesa, V\u00EDctor; Hern\u00E1ndez-Boluda, Juan Carlos; Montoro, Juan; Salavert, Miguel; Tormo, Mar; Amat, Paula; Moles, Paula; Carretero, Carlos; Balaguer-Rosell\u00F3, Aitana; Sanz, Jaime; Sanz, Guillermo; Solano, Carlos; Navarro, David","journal":"Journal of Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e280d408d6d8301a7f280d72f84cf9e9d2db8240.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126576.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2019.02.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445319300581; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797790/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445319300581","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CMV","BAL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CMV pneumonia","presence of CMV DNA","median CMV DNA loads","Detection of CMV DNA loads","pulmonary CMV DNA shedding","range of CMV DNA loads","frequency of CMV DNA detection","BAL specimens","BAL fluid specimens","universal CMV DNA load thresholds","attributable cause of pneumonia","pneumonia-attributable mortality","allo-HSCT patients","current study","IU","current retrospective study","allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant","difficulty","bronchoalveolar lavage","definitive cut-off value","certain level","cytomegalovirus","deleterious impact","Summary Objectives","different microorganisms","patient outcome","Methods","Conclusions","recipients","total"],"language":"en"},

Fortunately, with the recent development and widespread deployment of small-scale manufacturing technologies like RepRap-class 3-D printers and open source microcontrollers, mass distributed manufacturing of ventilators has the potential to overcome medical supply shortages. In this study, after providing a background on ventilators, the academic literature is reviewed to find the existing and already openly-published, vetted designs for ventilators systems. These articles are analyzed to determine if the designs are open source both in spirit (license) as well as practical details (e.g. possessing accessible design source files, bill of materials, assembly instructions, wiring diagrams, firmware and software as well as operation and calibration instructions). Next, the existing Internet and gray literature are reviewed for open source ventilator projects and designs. The results of this review found that the tested and peer-reviewed systems lacked complete documentation and the open systems that were documented were either at the very early stages of design (sometimes without even a prototype) and were essentially only basically tested (if at all). With the considerably larger motivation of an ongoing pandemic, it is assumed these projects will garner greater attention and resources to make significant progress to reach a functional and easily-replicated system. There is a large amount of future work needed to move open source ventilators up to the level considered scientific-grade equipment, and even further work needed to reach medical-grade hardware. Future work is needed to achieve the potential of this approach by developing policies, updating regulations, and securing funding mechanisms for the development and testing of open source ventilators for both the current COVID19 pandemic as well as for future pandemics and for everyday use in low-resource settings.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pearce, Joshua M.","journal":"F1000Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4799c0512ecbf9fce0eb0371a8ba628082178a33.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7195895.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32411358/; https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.22942.2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["testing of open source ventilators","open systems","ventilators systems","open source microcontrollers","open source ventilator projects","future work","accessible design source files","mass distributed manufacturing of ventilators","peer-reviewed systems","potential","future pandemics","medical supply shortages","medical infrastructure","medical-grade hardware","vetted designs","shortages of critical equipment","scientific-grade equipment","regional level","recent development","gray literature","assembly instructions","academic literature","ongoing pandemic","calibration instructions","existing Internet","current COVID19 pandemic","early stages of design","widespread deployment of small-scale manufacturing technologies","RepRap-class","mortality rates","bill of materials","D printers","everyday use","spikes","complete documentation","regulations","firmware","resources","diagrams","securing funding mechanisms","license","significant progress","greater attention","practical details","low-resource settings","software","operation","policies","background","spirit","larger motivation","approach","Coronavirus Disease","replicated system","results","study","prototype","articles"],"language":"en"},

Shortly after that, it was reported that mortality rates in New York City (NYC), the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, were found to be significantly higher in African American and Hispanics. The aim of this manuscript is to evaluate the mortality rates in NYC among the different ethnic groups and the different boroughs as it relates to the obesity rates to see whether this issue merits further evaluation. METHODS: COVID-19 data was obtained from the official New York (NY) authorities in relation to total number of cases in the different boroughs of NYC. Age adjusted COVID-19 related mortality rates of the different ethnic groups were also obtained. This data was cross compared to historic community health data on obesity rates previously published and also obesity rates among the different ethnic groups in NYC. RESULTS: The two NYC boroughs that have the highest mortality rates are The Bronx (6%) and Brooklyn (5.4%). Both The Bronx and Brooklyn were also found to have the highest obesity rates 32% and 27% respectively. The two ethnic groups with the highest obesity rates (Hispanics and African Americans) were also found to have the highest age adjusted mortality rates per 100,000 compared to the other ethnic groups (22.8% and 19.8% respectively). CONCLUSION: Hispanics and African Americans in NYC seem to be disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic because of the higher incidence of mortality rates. Obesity may have played a role in the high incidence of mortality in those ethnic groups.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"El Chaar, Maher; King, Keith; Galvez, Alvaro","journal":"Surg Obes Relat Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c9dedb90535c798d10e65bc383f44a5631700b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211681.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1550728920302434; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550728920302434?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NYC"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["highest mortality rates","highest obesity rates","related mortality rates","different ethnic groups","higher incidence of mortality rates","different boroughs of NYC","NYC boroughs","COVID","high incidence of mortality","Hispanics","highest age","pandemic","African Americans","Bronx","Brooklyn","New York City","official New York","historic community health data","authorities","relation","total number of cases","epicenter","role","issue merits","CONCLUSION","manuscript","United States","evaluation","METHODS","RESULTS","aim","INTRODUCTION"],"language":"en"},

As a feline endogenous retrovirus, RD114 virus, exists in the genome of all cats, it can be assumed that contamination with the virus in feline and canine live vaccines manufactured by culturing cells of feline origin occurs. To detect an infectious RD114 virus in vitro, a LacZ marker rescue assay has recently been established. In feline and canine live vaccines approved in Japan, feline cell lines are widely used to produce vaccines, especially those containing canine parvovirus components. The LacZ marker rescue assay detects infectious viral particles, but the real-time reverse-transcription-PCR detects both infectious and defective viruses. The canine live vaccines manufactured in cells of feline origin showed positive results for the env gene by the real-time reverse-transcription-PCR, including all of the 8 vaccines produced in feline cell lines that were negative in the LacZ marker rescue assay. In conclusion, the present investigation suggests that the newly developed method has the advantages of shorter time requirements and can be applied as a valuable screening method to detect RD114 viral RNA in vaccines.","publish_time":"2011-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Narushima, Rie; Shimazaki, Tomoaki; Takahashi, Toshio","journal":"Biologicals","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27f951fa0a4f404978a50dcb7e8ca046963bacd5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129332.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1045105611000200; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1045105611000200; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biologicals.2011.01.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21345697/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["canine live vaccines","certain feline cell lines","feline endogenous retrovirus","culturing cells of feline origin","infectious RD114 virus","Crandell-Rees feline kidney cell","LacZ marker rescue assay","infectious viral particles","RD114 viral RNA","real-time reverse-transcription","PCR","canine parvovirus components","developed method","valuable screening method","env gene","positive results","Japan","advantages of shorter time requirements","present investigation","defective viruses","genome","conclusion","contamination","cats"],"language":"en"},

Objectives To explore the associations between bacterial, viral, and bacterial plus viral isolations and bronchiectasis exacerbations. Methods In this prospective study, we enrolled 108 patients who were followed up every 3\u20136 months and at onset of exacerbations between March 2017 and November 2018. Spontaneous sputum was split for detection of bacteria (routine culture) and viruses (quantitative polymerase chain reaction). Symptoms and lung function were assessed during exacerbations. Results The median exacerbation rate was 2.0 (interquartile range: 1.0\u20132.5) per patient-year. At any visit, viral isolations (V\u002B) occurred more frequently during onset of exacerbations [odds ratio (OR): 3.28, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 1.76\u20136.12], as did isolation of new bacteria (NB\u002B) (OR: 2.52, 95%CI: 1.35\u20134.71) and bacterial plus viral isolations (OR: 2.24, 95%CI: 1.11\u20134.55). Whilst coryza appeared more common in exacerbations with V\u002B than in exacerbations with no pathogen isolations and those with NB\u002B, lower airway symptoms were more severe in exacerbations with NB\u002B (P \u003C.05). Sputum interleukin-1\u03B2 levels were higher in exacerbations with NB\u002B than in exacerbations with no pathogen isolations and those with V\u002B (both P \u003C.05). Significantly more coryza symptoms correlated with bacterial plus viral isolations at exacerbations (P =.019). Compared with V\u002B alone, bacterial with and without viral isolations tended to yield more severe lower airway symptoms, but not sputum cytokine levels at exacerbations. Conclusions Viral isolations, isolation of new bacteria and bacterial plus viral isolation are associated with bronchiectasis exacerbations. Symptoms at exacerbations might inform clinicians the possible culprit pathogens.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Chun-Lan; Huang, Yan; Yuan, Jing-Jing; Li, Hui-Min; Han, Xiao-Rong; Martinez-Garcia, Miguel Angel; de la Rosa-Carrillo, David; Chen, Rong-chang; Guan, Wei-Jie; Zhong, Nan-Shan","journal":"Arch Bronconeumol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a3a74d9d62f4fc938a0908ad64748c345379ee1f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7141478.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300289619306167; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300289619306167","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bronchiectasis exacerbations","onset of exacerbations","Conclusions Viral isolations","Abstract Background Exacerbations","pathogen isolations","NB","coryza symptoms","severe lower airway symptoms","isolation of new bacteria","detection of bacteria","sputum cytokine levels","Sputum interleukin","bronchiectasis progression","Spontaneous sputum","\u03B2 levels","viruses","crucial events","routine culture","clinicians","quantitative polymerase chain reaction","median exacerbation rate","possible culprit pathogens","interquartile range","prospective study","odds ratio","associations","lung function","visit","Methods","patients","confidence interval","Objectives","months","patient-year"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, in vitro Caco-2 cell, in situ single-pass intestinal perfusion and in vivo pharmacokinetics study were performed to investigate the effects of COS on the intestinal absorption of phenolic acids. The pharmacological effects such as antiviral activity improvement by COS were verified by MDCK cell damage inhibition rate after influenza virus propagation. The observations from in vitro Caco-2 cell showed that the absorption of phenolic acids in Flos Lonicerae extract could be improved by COS. Meanwhile, COS at the same low, medium and high concentrations caused a significant, concentration-dependent increase in the P app-value for phenolic acids compared to the control group (p \u003C0.05), and was all safe for the Caco-2 cells. The observations from single-pass intestinal perfusion in situ model showed that the intestinal absorption of phenolic acids can be enhanced by COS. Meanwhile, the absorption enhancing effect of phenolic acids might be saturable in different intestine sites. In pharmacokinetics study, COS at dosage of 25mg/kg improved the bioavailability of phenolic acids in Flos Lonicerae extract to the greatest extent, and was safe for gastrointestine from morphological observation. Besides, treatment with Flos Lonicerae extract with COS at dosage of 25mg/kg prevented MDCK cell damage upon influenza virus propagation better than that of control.

In general, probiotic supplements could enhance recovery and protect piglets against enteric pathogens. Seven local lactic acid bacteria (LAB), (Ent. faecium 79N and 40N, Lact. plantarum 22F, 25F and 31F, Ped. acidilactici 72N and Ped. pentosaceus 77F) from pig feces were well-characterized as high potential probiotics. Cell-free supernatants (CFS) and live LAB were evaluated for antiviral activities by co-incubation on Vero cells and challenged with a pandemic strain of PEDV isolated from pigs in Thailand. Cell survival and viral inhibition were determined by cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction assay and confirmed by immunofluorescence. At 1:16, CFS dilution (pH 6.3\u20136.8) showed no cytotoxicity in Vero cells and was therefore used as the dilution for antiviral assays. The diluted CFS of all Lact. plantarum showed the antiviral effect against PEDV; however, the same antiviral effect could not be observed in Ent. faecium and Pediococcus strains. In competitive experiment, only live Lact. plantarum 25F and Ped. pentosaceus 77F showed CPE reduction in the viral infected cells to \u003C50% observed field area. This study concluded that the CFS of all tested lactobacilli, and live Lact. plantarum (22F and 25F) and Pediococcus strains 72N and 77F could reduce infectivity of the pandemic strain of PEDV from pigs in Thailand on the target Vero cells.

Method Patients\u226518years old who either had not received corticosteroid or had taken corticosteroids within 14days from symptom onset were included. Patients receiving corticosteroids beyond 15days or other investigational treatment within 21days from symptom onset were excluded. Of 1313 eligible patients, 1287 with major corticosteroid dosage-type combinations were analysed. Results Crude death rate was lower among 1188 steroid-treated patients compared to 99 patients in Group No Steroid (17.0% vs. 28.3%). Among four corticosteroid groups studied, mortality was lowest in the low-dose oral prednisolone (Group P) and high-dose methylprednisolone (Group MP) groups. On multivariate analysis of the corticosteroid groups, independent factors related to death were: corticosteroid group, older age, co-morbidity, worse chest X-ray score, worse respiratory status at Days 8\u201310 and higher admission white cell count. Again Groups P and MP had significantly lower adjusted odds ratios for death and lower bacterial and fungal culture rates. Despite worse chest X-ray scores and higher cumulative corticosteroid dosages in Group MP compared to Group P, fewer patients required rescue pulsed corticosteroid. Patients on hydrocortisone (Group HC) had the highest positive culture rates. Conclusion We speculate that corticosteroid with higher in-vitro inflammatory potency administered at timing and dosages commensurate with disease severity may be conducive to better outcome from SARS as a consequence of more effective control of immunopathological lung damage.","publish_time":"2007-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yin-Chun Yam, Loretta; Chun-Wing Lau, Arthur; Yuk-Lin Lai, Florence; Shung, Edwina; Chan, Jane; Wong, Vivian","journal":"Journal of Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6246955304288202c7b3c1d42ec914984b104258.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112522.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445306000090; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445306000090","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Group No Steroid","Group P","Groups P","SARS"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["corticosteroid groups","Group MP","Group P","Group HC","days","fewer patients","Method Patients","eligible patients","higher cumulative corticosteroid dosages","Groups P","rescue pulsed corticosteroid","steroid-treated patients","major corticosteroid dosage-type combinations","worse chest X-ray scores","worse respiratory status","SARS","symptom onset","patterns of corticosteroids usage","Crude death rate","fungal culture rates","lower adjusted odds ratios","dosages commensurate","investigational treatment","highest positive culture rates","higher admission white cell count","high-dose methylprednisolone","associated treatment outcomes","severe acute respiratory syndrome","low-dose oral prednisolone","co-morbidity","timing","older age","disease severity","consequence","vitro inflammatory potency","better outcome","effective control of immunopathological lung damage","independent factors","Hong Kong","Summary Background","mortality","years old","multivariate analysis","hydrocortisone","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Scope: In this article, we review the literature reporting results of in vitro experiments investigating immunomodulatory actions of vitamin D metabolites in human respiratory epithelial cells infected with respiratory viruses. Key findings: Vitamin D metabolites do not consistently influence replication or clearance of rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or influenza A virus in human respiratory epithelial cell culture, although they do modulate expression and secretion of type 1 interferon, chemokines including CXCL8 and CXCL10 and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF and IL-6.

The increase in disease severity in dogs and the emergence of novel CCoVs can be attributed to the high level of recombination within the spike gene that can occur during infection by more than one CCoV type in the same host.","publish_time":"2014-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Licitra, Beth N.; Duhamel, Gerald E.; Whittaker, Gary R.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b95e82e0343a470f5b39c97eae9f8541e218b76d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4147700.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25153347/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v6083363","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs4MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CCoV type","known serotypes of CCoV","novel recombinant variants of CCoV","reports of lethal CCoV infections","alphacoronavirus infecting dogs","emerging infectious disease of dogs","spike gene","disease severity","emergence of novel CCoVs","Canine enteric coronavirus","enteric coronaviruses of cats","spike protein N-terminal domains","evidence","mild gastro-intestinal clinical signs","NTDs","high level of recombination","systemic viral dissemination","pigs","increase","porcine strains","addition","host"],"language":"en"},

Because of the harm that parasites can inflict on man and domesticated animals, which can be expressed as economic loss, many parasites become pests. In natural ecosystems, parasites contribute to the prevention of continuous exponential growth of populations and, therefore, they also need to be conserved. The exotic pet trade may result in translocation of exotic species together with their microparasites and macroparasites, potentiating a risk of transmission of exotic diseases to native fauna and to humans. Within this context we need to increase our knowledge of parasites and parasitic diseases of wildlife. Prevention seems to be the choice for managing parasite exposure. This may be achieved through educational programs that refocused on discouraging people to import exotic pets, together with stronger legislative measures to control wildlife trade.","publish_time":"2009-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"P\u00E9rez, Jes\u00FAs M.","journal":"Journal of Exotic Pet Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3deb0dcfd2c064026ca88bf9b87b51975ee9182b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106063.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1053/j.jepm.2009.09.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1557506309001128; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1557506309001128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288671/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs4MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["exotic diseases","knowledge of parasites","exotic pets","exotic pet trade","translocation of exotic species","wildlife trade","parasitic diseases of wildlife","functioning of ecosystems","natural ecosystems","prevention of continuous exponential growth of populations","stronger legislative measures","risk of transmission","discouraging people","native fauna","macroparasites","parasitism","microparasites","known living organisms","strong influence","account","successful strategy","educational programs","choice","humans","economic loss","pests","domesticated animals","parasite exposure","harm","Abstract","context"],"language":"en"},

Knowledge about current cause of respiratory infections is lacking, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The aim of this study was to identity the various respiratory pathogens causing acute respiratory tract infections in children below 5 years of age visiting a sub-urban primary care clinic in Senegal. METHODS: A case-control study was performed in September and October 2018. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected from cases; infants with fever and respiratory symptoms, and controls; children involved in the vaccination programme. Viral identification was conducted by polymerase chain reaction for 21 different viruses; bacteria were identified by culture studies. Associations between microorganisms, acute respiratory infection and severity of disease were calculated by multivariate regression adjusting for confounders such as age, sex, and living area. RESULTS: Overall, 102 cases and 96 controls were included. Microorganisms were detected in 90.1% of cases and 53.7% of controls (P \u003C .001). Influenza virus A (including H1N1), influenza virus B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and Streptococcus pneumoniae were independently associated with acute respiratory tract infections. Co-detection of two or more pathogens was present in 49.5% of cases; 31.7% of cases had a pneumonia and 90.2% was treated with antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: This case-control study in a primary care setting in sub-Saharan Africa found influenza virus A and B, RSV, and S pneumoniae to be the main causes of acute respiratory tract infections in children below 5 years of age. We recommend evaluation of antibiotics prescription behaviour in this setting.","publish_time":"2019-12-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Knobbe, Rebecca B; Diallo, Abdallah; Fall, Amary; Gueye, Aida D; Dieng, Assane; van Immerzeel, Tabitha D; Ba, Abou; Diop, Amadou; Diop, Abdoulaye; Niang, Mbayame; Boye, Cheikh SB","journal":"Microbiol Insights","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e5e41c6bee286394aab9998f7c4b2401a80333b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6937528.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1178636119890885; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31908474/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs4NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Senegal","sub-Saharan Africa"],"keyphrases":["acute respiratory infection","respiratory symptoms","cases","respiratory syncytial virus","main causes of acute respiratory tract infections","current cause of respiratory infections","various respiratory pathogens","children","influenza virus B","controls","years of age","case-control study","primary care setting","RSV","microorganisms","main cause of paediatric mortality","Streptococcus pneumoniae","sub-urban primary care clinic","evaluation of antibiotics prescription behaviour","sub-Saharan Africa","polymerase chain reaction","morbidity","severity of disease","identity","different viruses","bacteria","Senegal","infants","fever","H1N1","pathogen patterns","hygiene","vaccinations","factors","multivariate regression","confounders","Associations","Knowledge","INTRODUCTION","Viral identification","antibiotic resistance","sex","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","culture studies","Oropharyngeal swabs","vaccination programme","middle-income countries","Co-detection","area","aim","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Immediately after COVID-19 was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, WHO\u0027s risk communication team launched a new information platform called WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN), with the aim of using a series of amplifiers to share tailored information with specific target groups. Sylvie Briand, director of Infectious Hazards Management at WHO\u0027s Health Emergencies Programme and architect of WHO\u0027s strategy to counter the infodemic risk, told The Lancet, \u201CWe know that every outbreak will be accompanied by a kind of tsunami of information, but also within this information you always have misinformation, rumours, etc. We know that even in the Middle Ages there was this phenomenon\u201D. \u201CBut the difference now with social media is that this phenomenon is amplified, it goes faster and further, like the viruses that travel with people and go faster and further.

Contactors with SARS patients and those with symptom development following the contacts were investigated via questionnaire. Serum samples were collected from super transmitters and tested for SARS-CoV antibody by neutralization test and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results A total of 1 112 contactors were investigated in three surveys. Of them, 669 had a history of close contact with symptomatic SARS patients, 101 developed symptoms with a rate of 15.1%, 363 had a history of close contact with patients in their incubation period, none of whom developed symptoms (0%). Serum samples were collected from 32 highly-exposed individuals, of whom 13 developing SARS symptoms after contact had serum samples positive for SARS-CoV antibody. Samples collected from the asymptomatic contactors were all negative for SARS-CoV antibody. Conclusion SARS cases are infectious only during their symptomatic period and are non-infectious during the incubation period.

It can help to craft appropriate public health responses, develop solutions to the epidemic impacts and improve understanding of why the epidemic occurred. Yet, there are practical constraints in undertaking this international research in a way that produces quality, ethical and appropriate data, and that values all voices and experiences, especially those of local researchers and research participants. In this paper, we reflected on the experience of undertaking social science research during the 2015/2016 Zika epidemic in Brazil. This experience was considered from the perspective of this paper\u2019s authors: three Brazilian academics, two UK academics and two mothers of children affected by congenital Zika syndrome. This group came together through the conduct of the Social and Economic Impact of Zika study, a mixed-methods social science study. The key findings highlight practical issues in the achievement of three goals: the conduct of high-quality social science in emergencies and efforts towards the decolonisation of global health in terms of levelling the power between Brazilian and UK researchers and optimising the role of patients within research. From our perspective, the information collected through social science was valuable, providing detailed insight into the programmatic needs of mothers and their affected children (eg, economic and social support and mental health services). Social science was considered a low priority within the Zika epidemic despite its potential importance. There were logistical challenges in conducting social science research, foremost of which are the difficulties in developing a trusting and balanced power relationship between the UK and Brazilian researchers in a short time frame. When these issues were overcome, each partner brought unique qualities, making the research stronger. The mothers of affected children expressed dissatisfaction with research, as they were involved in many studies which were not coordinated, and from which they did not see a benefit. In conclusion, the importance of social science in epidemics must continue to be promoted by funders. Funders can also set in place mechanisms to help equalise the power dynamics between foreign and local researchers, researchers and participants, both to promote justice and to create best quality data.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Passos, Maria Joana; Matta, Gustavo; Lyra, Tereza Maciel; Moreira, Maria Elisabeth Lopes; Kuper, Hannah; Penn-Kekana, Loveday; Mendon\u00E7a, Mila","journal":"BMJ Glob Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39bb5c33105fbb8d93cf6086aaa31d1c4fa60dcd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7213811.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002307; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32345582/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs5MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Social","UK"],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["social science research","importance of social science","social support","conduct of high-quality social science","research participants","mixed-methods social science study","Brazilian researchers","UK researchers","Zika epidemic","international research","research stronger","local researchers","mothers of children","mothers of affected children","Brazilian academics","UK academics","epidemic impacts","Economic Impact of Zika study","power dynamics","congenital Zika syndrome","appropriate data","practical issues","epidemics","perspective","funders","appropriate public health responses","balanced power relationship","programmatic needs of mothers","decolonisation of global health","mental health services","best quality data","practical constraints","potential importance","efforts","solutions","detailed insight","emergencies","achievement","terms","goals","low priority","short time frame","trusting","unique qualities","justice","way","paper\u2019s authors","information","evidence necessary","dissatisfaction","logistical challenges","key findings","place mechanisms","role of patients","partner","experiences","understanding","conclusion","difficulties","voices","group","studies","benefit"],"language":"en"},

A solution would be significant as protein structure information could be utilized in the medical field, e.g. in the development of vaccines for new viruses. This paper focuses on predicting the protein structure based on 3D images of the proteins captured through cryogenic electron microscopes (cryo-EM). A fully automated computationally efficient protein structure prediction method would be particularly beneficial in the field of cryo-EM as the technology allows researchers to photograph multiple large protein complexes in a single study, which means that a fast prediction method could allow for a high throughput of derived protein structures. We present a deep learning approach, DeepTracer, for predicting locations of the backbone atoms, secondary structure elements, and the amino acid types. In order to connect the predicted amino acids into chains, we applied a modified traveling salesman algorithm. Results We trained our deep learning model on experimental cryo-EM density maps and tested it on a set of 50 density maps. We found that our new approach predicted protein structures with an average RMSD value of 1.18 and a coverage of 87.5%. Furthermore, we detected secondary structure information for 87.2% of amino acids correctly. We also showed preliminarily that 25.2% of amino acid types could be predicted directly from the 3D cryo-EM density map, considering 20 different types in total. Finally, we noted that the prediction runtime of DeepTracer is significantly improved compared to other methods. It predicts a large protein complex structure of more than 30,000 amino acids in only 2 hours. Availability The repository of this project will be published.

Perhaps the most well\u2010established strategies are flock and herd management practices to mitigate disease introduction and spread, and, subsequently, reduce the need for antibiotic use. While vaccines in food animal production have been used to prevent both bacterial and viral diseases, but historically, most vaccines have targeted viral diseases. Though vaccines against viral diseases can help reduce the need for antibiotic use by controlling the spread of secondary bacterial infections, more recent vaccines under development specifically target bacteria. New developments in selecting and potentially tailoring bacteriophages provide a promising avenue for controlling pathogenic bacteria without the need for traditional small\u2010molecule antibiotics. In this article we discuss these established and emerging strategies, which are anticipated to reduce the reliance on antibiotics in food animal production and should reduce the prevalence and transmission to humans of antimicrobial resistant bacteria from these systems.","publish_time":"2019-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kahn, Laura H.; Bergeron, Gilles; Bourassa, Megan W.; De Vegt, Bert; Gill, Jason; Gomes, Filomena; Malouin, Fran\u00E7ois; Opengart, Ken; Ritter, G.

In total, 90\u201397% of animals that were seropositive in Sample 1 remained positive in Sample 2. A significant association was found between BVDV and BCoV (P =0.01). Moreover, a significantly higher proportion of herds in which no calves had a recorded history of respiratory disease (n =15) were classified as negative to all four infections monitored when compared to herds in which disease was observed (P =0.0002). This study showed a high infection burden in young animals and effective spread of BRSV, PIV-3 and BCoV in one area of Sweden. BVDV infections were restricted to a few herds, reflecting the effect of a voluntary control program against BVDV in Sweden.","publish_time":"2006-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"H\u00E4gglund, S.; Svensson, C.; Emanuelson, U.; Valarcher, J.

A rapid and sensitive molecular detection in clinical isolates is quite needed for the appropriate therapy and outbreak control of A. baumannii. Group 2 carbapenems have been considered the agents of choice for the treatment of multiple drug-resistant A. baumannii. But the prevalence of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) has been steadily increasing in recent years. Here, we developed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for the rapid detection of A. baumannii in clinical samples by using high-specificity primers of the bla(OXA-51) gene. Then we investigated the OXA-carbapenemases molecular epidemiology of A. baumannii isolates in two comprehensive hospitals in Beijing. The results showed that the LAMP assay could detect target DNA within 60 min at 65\u00B0C. The detection limit was 50 pg/\u03BCl, which was about 10-fold greater than that of PCR. Furthermore, this method could distinguish A. baumannii from the homologous A. nosocomialis and A. pittii. A total of 228 positive isolates were identified by this LAMP-based method for A. baumannii from 335 intensive care unit patients with clinically suspected multi-resistant infections in two hospitals in Beijing. The rates of CRAB are on the rise and are slowly becoming a routine phenotype for A. baumannii. Among the CRABs, 92.3% harbored both the bla(OXA-23) and bla(OXA-51) genes. Thirty-three pulsotypes were identified by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and the majority belonged to clone C. In conclusion, the LAMP method developed for detecting A. baumannii was faster and simpler than conventional PCR and has great potential for both point-of-care testing and basic research. We further demonstrated a high distribution of class D carbapenemase-encoding genes, mainly OXA-23, which presents an emerging threat in hospitals in China.","publish_time":"2015-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Puyuan; Niu, Wenkai; Li, Huan; Lei, Hong; Liu, Wei; Zhao, Xiangna; Guo, Leijing; Zou, Dayang; Yuan, Xin; Liu, Huiying; Yuan, Jing; Bai, Changqing","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/595582a254c921f28d7c5cb9cb42e1dcabff7108.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4585070.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2015.00997; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26441924/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs5Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Group","LAMP","PCR","CRAB"],"locations":["Beijing","China"],"keyphrases":["baumannii isolates","Acinetobacter baumannii","LAMP method","LAMP assay","bla","LAMP-based method","clinical isolates","rapid detection of","OXA-carbapenemases molecular epidemiology of","sensitive molecular detection","positive isolates","detection limit","comprehensive hospitals","genes","Beijing","suspected multi-resistant infections","clinical samples","treatment of multiple drug-resistant","care testing","conventional PCR","rates of CRAB","high-specificity primers","variety of nosocomial infections","intensive care unit patients","high distribution of class D carbapenemase","important opportunistic pathogen","majority","great potential","point","appropriate therapy","outbreak control of","isothermal amplification","conclusion","agents of choice","field gel electrophoresis","prevalence of carbapenem","rise","basic research","emerging threat","China","pg","\u03BCl","loop","clone","nosocomialis","target DNA","routine phenotype","carbapenems","pittii","total","results","recent years","Group","pulsotypes","CRABs"],"language":"en"},

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is primarily spread person to person through respiratory droplets. Nationwide, the meat and poultry processing industry, an essential component of the U.S. food infrastructure, employs approximately 500,000 persons, many of whom work in proximity to other workers (1). Because of reports of initial cases of COVID-19, in some meat processing facilities, states were asked to provide aggregated data concerning the number of meat and poultry processing facilities affected by COVID-19 and the number of workers with COVID-19 in these facilities, including COVID-19-related deaths. Qualitative data gathered by CDC during on-site and remote assessments were analyzed and summarized. During April 9-27, aggregate data on COVID-19 cases among 115 meat or poultry processing facilities in 19 states were reported to CDC. Among these facilities, COVID-19 was diagnosed in 4,913 (approximately 3%) workers, and 20 COVID-19-related deaths were reported. Facility barriers to effective prevention and control of COVID-19 included difficulty distancing workers at least 6 feet (2 meters) from one another (2) and in implementing COVID-19-specific disinfection guidelines.* Among workers, socioeconomic challenges might contribute to working while feeling ill, particularly if there are management practices such as bonuses that incentivize attendance. Methods to decrease transmission within the facility include worker symptom screening programs, policies to discourage working while experiencing symptoms compatible with COVID-19, and social distancing by workers. Source control measures (e.g., the use of cloth face covers) as well as increased disinfection of high-touch surfaces are also important means of preventing SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Mitigation efforts to reduce transmission in the community should also be considered. Many of these measures might also reduce asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission (3). Implementation of these public health strategies will help protect workers from COVID-19 in this industry and assist in preserving the critical meat and poultry production infrastructure (4).","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dyal, Jonathan W; Grant, Michael P; Broadwater, Kendra; Bjork, Adam; Waltenburg, Michelle A; Gibbins, John D; Hale, Christa; Silver, Maggie; Fischer, Marc; Steinberg, Jonathan; Basler, Colin A; Jacobs, Jesica R; Kennedy, Erin D; Tomasi, Suzanne; Trout, Douglas; Hornsby-Myers, Jennifer; Oussayef, Nadia L; Delaney, Lisa J; Patel, Ketki; Shetty, Varun; Kline, Kelly E; Schroeder, Betsy; Herlihy, Rachel K; House, Jennifer; Jervis, Rachel; Clayton, Joshua L; Ortbahn, Dustin; Austin, Connie; Berl, Erica; Moore, Zack; Buss, Bryan F; Stover, Derry; Westergaard, Ryan; Pray, Ian; DeBolt, Meghan; Person, Amy; Gabel, Julie; Kittle, Theresa S; Hendren, Pamela; Rhea, Charles; Holsinger, Caroline; Dunn, John; Turabelidze, George; Ahmed, Farah S; deFijter, Siestke; Pedati, Caitlin S; Rattay, Karyl; Smith, Erica E; Luna-Pinto, Carolina; Cooley, Laura A; Saydah, Sharon; Preacely, Nykiconia D; Maddox, Ryan A; Lundeen, Elizabeth; Goodwin, Bradley; Karpathy, Sandor E; Griffing, Sean; Jenkins, Mary M; Lowry, Garry; Schwarz, Rachel D; Yoder, Jonathan; Peacock, Georgina; Walke, Henry T; Rose, Dale A; Honein, Margaret A","journal":"MMWR.

So far, however, limited data are available for children. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the clinical and chest CT imaging characteristics of COVID-19 in preschool children. METHODS From January 26, 2020 to February 20, 2020, the clinical and initial chest CT imaging data of eight preschool children with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from two hospitals were retrospectively collected. The chest CT imaging characteristics, including the distribution, shape, and density of lesions, and the pleural effusion, pleural changes, and enlarged lymph nodes were evaluated. RESULTS Two cases (25%) were classified as mild type, and they showed no obvious abnormal CT findings or minimal pleural thickening on the right side. Five cases (62.5%) were classified as moderate type. Among these patients, one case showed consolidation located in the subpleural region of the right upper lobe, with thickening in the adjacent pleura; one case showed multiple consolidation and ground-glass opacities with blurry margins; one case displayed bronchial pneumonia-like changes in the left upper lobe; and two cases displayed asthmatic bronchitis-like changes. One case (12.5%) was classified as critical type and showed bronchial pneumonia-like changes in the bilateral lungs, presenting blurred and messy bilateral lung markings and multiple patchy shadows scattered along the lung markings with blurry margins. CONCLUSIONS The chest CT findings of COVID-19 in preschool children are atypical and various.

Comparison of the protein profiles of Golgi\u2010enriched fractions of cells that were either mock infected or infected with mouse hepatitis virus revealed the significant depletion or enrichment of 116 proteins. Although ribosomal/nucleic acid binding proteins were enriched in the Golgi\u2010fractions of mouse hepatitis virus\u2010infected cells, proteins annotated to localize to several organelles of the secretory pathway were overrepresented among the proteins that were depleted from these fractions upon infection. We hypothesized that proteins, of which the abundance or distribution is affected by infection, are likely to be involved in the virus life cycle. Indeed, depletion of a small subset of the affected proteins by using small interfering RNAs identified several host factors involved in coronavirus infection. Transfection of small interfering RNAs targeting either C11orf59 or Golgi apparatus glycoprotein 1 resulted in increased virus replication, whereas depletion of vesicle\u2010trafficking protein vesicle\u2010trafficking protein sec22b enhanced the release of infectious progeny virus. Overexpression of these proteins, on the other hand, had a negative effect on virus replication.

As of February 29, 2020, 79 389 cases of COVID-19 have been reported, and the outbreak is linked to 2838 deaths. The population is generally susceptible to the disease, and differences in incubation periods after infection exist among individuals. These two aspects of COVID-19 pose significant challenges to pediatric orthopedic diagnosis and treatment. As a dedicated center for managing pediatric cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Shanghai, our hospital has mobilized all branches and departments to undertake joint actions for scientific prevention and control, precise countermeasure and comprehensive anti-epidemic efforts. Combined with our experience, we have consulted the relevant national regulations and the latest research advances and have formulated the prevention and control measures of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including outpatient, emergency, inpatient and surgical cares, for clinical practices of pediatric orthopedics according to the physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2. It may serve as practical references and recommendations for managing SARS-CoV-2 infection in other pediatric specialties and in other hospitals.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Chunxing; Zhang, Zhiqiang; Mo, Yueqiang; Wang, Dahui; Ning, Bo; Xu, Ping; Song, Jun; Pei, Xinhong; Ni, Xiaoyan; Zheng, Yiming; Xia, Tian; Jing, Yanhui; Sun, Wanlin; Meng, Junrong; Qian, Chuang","journal":"World Journal of Pediatric Surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d52bfc71164bc551b8c34852ec957c8810de67c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211102.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/wjps-2020-000124","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs2MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","pediatric cases of SARS","infection","control measures of SARS","pediatric specialties","cases of COVID","physicochemical properties of SARS","pediatric orthopedic diagnosis","outbreak of Coronavirus Disease","aspects of COVID","clinical practices of pediatric orthopedics","scientific prevention","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","precise countermeasure","surgical cares","joint actions","significant challenges","comprehensive anti-epidemic efforts","latest research advances","relevant national regulations","departments","emergency","differences","incubation periods","outpatient","branches","treatment","recommendations","dedicated center","individuals","practical references","Shanghai","population","hospitals","experience","deaths","world"],"language":"en"},

Measurements Clinical records of each patients admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of COVID19 infection were retrospectively analyzed. Diagnosis of dementia, modalities of onset of the COVID-19 infection, symptoms of presentation at the hospital and outcomes were recorded. Results Dementia was diagnosed in 82 patients (13.1%). The mortality rate was 62.2% (51/82) among patients affected by dementia compared to 26.2% (143/545) in subjects without dementia (p\u003C0.001, Chi-Squared test). In a logistic regression model age, and the diagnosis of dementia resulted independently associated with a higher mortality, and patients diagnosed with dementia presented an OR of 1.84 (95% CI: 1.09-3.13, p\u003C0.05).

The highest smallpox infection rates were in persons 0\u201319 years of age, but the highest death rates were in those \u003E45 years of age. Because of the low level of residual vaccine immunity, immunosuppression was more influential than vaccination on death and infection rates in our model.

A number of FDA-approved drugs used to treat several human diseases are cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs) that have the ability to accumulate inside cells affecting several structures/functions hijacked by viruses during infection. In this review we summarized the CADs\u2019 chemical properties and effects on the cells and reported the main FDA-approved CADs that have been identified so far as potential antivirals in drug repurposing studies. Expert commentary: Although there have been concerns regarding the efficacy and the possible side effects of the off-label use of CADs as antivirals, they seem to represent a promising starting point for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral strategies. Further knowledge about their mechanism of action is required to improve their antiviral activity and to reduce the risk of side effects.","publish_time":"2017-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Salata, Cristiano; Calistri, Arianna; Parolin, Cristina; Baritussio, Aldo; Pal\u00F9, Giorgio","journal":"Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a5ec3f7d844b1e52bc25171a8ea4d6eaeae0015.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103695.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28286997/; https://doi.org/10.1080/14787210.2017.1305888","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects","development of broad-spectrum antivirals","approved drugs","development of broad-spectrum antiviral strategies","cells","antiviral research","main FDA-approved CADs","potential antivirals","antiviral activity","label use of CADs","infection of multiple viruses","human diseases","host functions","number of FDA","cationic amphiphilic drugs","major concern","veterinary public health","viral infections","urgent need","CADs\u2019 chemical properties","identification of molecules","recent strategy","drug repurposing studies","promising starting point","Introduction","review","risk","structures","mechanism of action","knowledge","Areas","efficacy","ability","Expert commentary"],"language":"en"},

The recent literature indicates that a variety of immune mediators induce or repress autophagy. It is also becoming increasing clear that immune signaling cascades are subject to regulation by autophagy, and that a return to homeostasis following a robust immune response is critically dependent on this pathway. Importantly, examples of non-canonical forms of autophagy in mediating immunity are pervasive.

The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, brought to light substantial weaknesses in the country\u0027s public-health system. After the SARS epidemic was brought under control, the government increased its commitment and leadership to tackle public-health problems and, among other efforts, increased public-health funding, revised laws that concerned the control of infectious diseases, implemented the world\u0027s largest internet-based disease reporting system, and started a programme to rebuild local public-health facilities. These measures contributed to acceleration in efforts to control tuberculosis. By 2005, the detection of cases of tuberculosis had increased to 80% of the estimated total new cases, permitting China to achieve the 2005 global tuberculosis control targets.

In the JHM strain of MHV, expression of the HE gene is variable and corresponds to the number of copies of a UCUAA pentanucleotide sequence present at the 3\u2032-end of the leader RNA. This copy number varies among MHV strains, depending on their passage history. The JHM isolates with two copies of UCUAA in their leader RNA showed a high level of HE expression, whereas the JHM isolate with three copies had a low-level expression. In this study, the analysis of HE gene expression was extended to other MHV strains. The synthesis of HE mRNA in these viruses also correlates with the copy number of UCUAA in the leader RNA and the particular intergenic sequence preceding the HE gene. In one MHV strain, MHV-1, no detectable HE mRNA was synthesized, despite the presence of a proper transcription initiation signal. This lack of HE mRNA expression was consistent with a leader RNA containing three UCUAA copies. However, mutations and deletions within the coding region of the MHV-1 HE gene have generated a stretch of sequence which resembled the transcriptional initiation motif, and was shown to initiate the synthesis of a novel smaller mRNA. These findings strengthened the theory that interactions between leader RNA and transcriptional initiation sequences regulate MHV subgenomic mRNA transcription. Sequence analysis revealed that most MHV strains, through extensive mutations, deletions, or insertions, have lost the complete HE open reading frame, thus turning HE into a pseudogene. This high degree of variation is unusual as the other three structural proteins (spike, membrane, and nucleocapsid) are well-maintained. In contrast to bovine coronavirus, which apparently requires HE for viral replication, the HE protein in MHV may be only an accessory protein which is not necessary for viral replication. JHM and MHV-S, however, have preserved the expression of HE protein.","publish_time":"1991-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yokomori, Kyoko; Banner, Lisa R.; Lai, Michael M.C.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a1f147964d239e1f3f95a8f4147c7a7690f3152.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229190994M; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229190994M","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","JHM","UCUAA","MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV strains","MHV-S","JHM strain of MHV","mRNA expression","leader RNA","gene expression","MHV subgenomic mRNA transcription","copies of UCUAA","UCUAA copies","number of copies","low-level expression","copy number of UCUAA","Sequence analysis","UCUAA pentanucleotide sequence present","stretch of sequence","JHM isolates","novel smaller mRNA","transcriptional initiation sequences","transcriptional initiation motif","particular intergenic sequence","deletions","accessory protein","synthesis","viral replication","proper transcription initiation signal","strains of mouse hepatitis virus","membrane glycoprotein","extensive mutations","high level","coronavirus family","bovine coronavirus","high degree of variation","interactions","presence","spike","structural proteins","members","insertions","theory","coding region","viruses","open reading frame","nucleocapsid","lack","end","hemagglutinin-esterase","passage history","findings","contrast","study","pseudogene"],"language":"en"},

At various time points of posttransfection, the levels of S-EGFP expression and amounts of spike mRNA transcript were detected by fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, Western blot, and real-time quantitative PCR, respectively. The results showed that the cells transfected with pEGFP-optS expressed S-EGFP fusion protein at a higher level compared with those transfected with pEGFP-S, which contains wildtype SARS-CoV spike gene sequence. The green fluorescence, mean fluorescence intensity, and SARS-CoV S RNA transcripts were found significantly reduced, and the expression of SARS-CoV S glycoprotein was strongly inhibited in those cells co-transfected with either EGFP- or S-specific siRNAs.

Nidoviruses employ a complex RNA-synthesizing machinery comprising a variety of non-structural proteins (nsps). One of the postulated drivers of the expansion of nidovirus genomes is the presence of a proofreading 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exoribonuclease (ExoN) belonging to the DEDDh family. ExoN may enhance the fidelity of RNA synthesis by correcting nucleotide incorporation errors made by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Here, we review our current understanding of ExoN evolution, structure, and function. Most experimental data are derived from studies of the ExoN domain of coronaviruses (CoVs), which were triggered by the bioinformatics-based identification of ExoN in the genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and its relatives in 2003. Although convincing data supporting the proofreading hypothesis have been obtained, from biochemical assays and studies with CoV mutants lacking ExoN functionality, the features of ExoN from most other nidovirus families remain to be characterized. Remarkably, viable ExoN knockout mutants were obtained only for two CoVs, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV, whose RNA synthesis and replication kinetics were mildly affected by the lack of ExoN function. In several other CoV species, ExoN inactivation was not tolerated, and knockout mutants could not be rescued when launched using a reverse genetics system. This suggests that ExoN is also critical for primary viral RNA synthesis, a property that poorly matches the profile of an enzyme that would merely boost long-term replication fidelity. In CoVs, ExoN resides in a bifunctional replicase subunit (nsp14) whose C-terminal part has (N7-guanine)-methyltransferase activity. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV nsp14 has shed light on the interplay between these two domains, and on nsp14\u2019s interactions with nsp10, a co-factor that strongly enhances ExoN activity in vitro assays. Further elucidation of the structure-function relationships of ExoN and its interactions with other (viral and/or host) members of the CoV replication machinery will be key to understanding the enzyme\u2019s role in viral RNA synthesis and pathogenesis, and may contribute to the design of new approaches to combat emerging nidoviruses.","publish_time":"2019-08-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ogando, Natacha S.; Ferron, Francois; Decroly, Etienne; Canard, Bruno; Posthuma, Clara C.; Snijder, Eric J.","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c161375d1b822a44e873c134760ddb8600a550c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6693484.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31440227/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01813","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ExoN activity","ExoN functionality","features of ExoN","ExoN inactivation","lack of ExoN function","RNA viruses","ExoN domain of coronaviruses","structure-function relationships of ExoN","fidelity of RNA synthesis","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","viable ExoN knockout mutants","SARS-CoV","CoV nsp14","CoV mutants","current understanding of ExoN evolution","primary viral RNA synthesis","bioinformatics-based identification of ExoN","largest RNA genomes","CoV replication machinery","CoV species","complex RNA-synthesizing machinery","CoVs","crystal structure of SARS","studies","replication kinetics","long-term replication fidelity","expansion of nidovirus genomes","s interactions","biochemical assays","emerging nidoviruses","methyltransferase activity","nidovirus families","proofreading hypothesis","convincing data","experimental data","genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","correcting nucleotide incorporation errors","MHV","co-factor","enzyme\u2019s role","variety of non-structural proteins","nsp10","bifunctional replicase subunit","property","members","mouse hepatitis virus","N7-guanine","C-terminal","presence","order Nidovirales","light","host","pathogenesis","design of new approaches","postulated drivers","nsps","interplay","domains","elucidation","reverse genetics system","profile","DEDDh family","relatives","exoribonuclease"],"language":"en"},

We had suggested first that, in the past, the European colonizers, principally Romans, might have been instrumental of a progressively decrease of the frequencies southwards. Indeed, statistical analyses suggested strong negative correlations between the allele frequency and historical parameters including the colonization dates by Mediterranean civilisations. The gene flows from colonizers to native populations were extremely low but colonizers are responsible of the spread of several diseases suggesting that the dissemination of parasites in naive populations could have induced a breakdown rupture of the fragile pathocenosis changing the balance among diseases. The new equilibrium state has been reached through a negative selection of the null allele. RESULTS: Most of the human diseases are zoonoses and cat might have been instrumental in the decrease of the allele frequency, because its diffusion through Europe was a gradual process, due principally to Romans; and that several cat zoonoses could be transmitted to man. The possible implication of a feline lentivirus (FIV) which does not use CCR5 as co-receptor is discussed. This virus can infect primate cells in vitro and induces clinical signs in macaque. Moreover, most of the historical regions with null or low frequency of CCR5-\u039432 allele coincide with historical range of the wild felid species which harbor species-specific FIVs. CONCLUSION: We proposed the hypothesis that the actual European CCR5 allelic frequencies are the result of a negative selection due to a disease spreading. A cat zoonosis, could be the most plausible hypothesis. Future studies could provide if CCR5 can play an antimicrobial role in FIV pathogenesis. Moreover, studies of ancient DNA could provide more evidences regarding the implications of zoonoses in the actual CCR5-\u039432 distribution.","publish_time":"2008-10-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Faure, Eric","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ee10f61fbf042f0e6c1f90b5e26a1199c13f177.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2575341.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18925940/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-5-119","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe","Mediterranean"],"keyphrases":["allele frequency","low frequency of CCR5","\u039432 allele","chemokine receptor CCR5 allele","null allele","actual CCR5-\u039432 distribution","cat zoonoses","actual European CCR5 allelic frequencies","European colonizers","negative selection","historical range","historical parameters","historical regions","implications of zoonoses","human diseases","Romans","cat zoonosis","decrease","strong negative correlations","north-south downhill cline frequency","native populations","naive populations","FIV pathogenesis","co-receptor","plausible hypothesis","Future studies","studies of ancient DNA","wild felid species","colonization dates","fragile pathocenosis","interesting questions","diffusion","breakdown rupture","bp deletion","primate cells","clinical signs","species-specific FIVs","feline lentivirus","evidences","statistical analyses","gradual process","dissemination of parasites","gene flows","antimicrobial role","Mediterranean civilisations","possible implication","evolutionary biologists","balance","spread","new equilibrium state","macaque","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","past","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

The effectiveness of these drugs has been dramatically limited by the rapid spread of drug resistant mutations, mainly at sites S31N, V27A and L26F in the pore of the channel. Despite progress in designing inhibitors of V27A and L26F M2, there are currently no drugs targeting these mutated channels in clinical trials. Progress in developing new drugs has been hampered by the lack of a robust assay with sufficient throughput for discovery of new active chemotypes among chemical libraries and sufficient sensitivity to provide the SAR data essential for their improvement and development as drugs. In this study we adapted a yeast growth restoration assay, in which expression of the M2 channel inhibits yeast growth and exposure to an M2 channel inhibitor restores growth, into a robust and sensitive high-throughput screen for M2 channel inhibitors. A screen of over 250,000 pure chemicals and semi-purified fractions from natural extracts identified 21 active compounds comprising amantadine, rimantadine, 13 related adamantanes and 6 non-adamantanes. Of the non-adamantanes, hexamethylene amiloride and a triazine derivative represented new M2 inhibitory chemotypes that also showed antiviral activity in a plaque reduction assay. Of particular interest is the fact that the triazine derivative was not sufficiently potent for detection as an inhibitor in the traditional two electrode voltage clamp assay for M2 channel activity, but its discovery in the yeast assay led to testing of analogues of which one was as potent as amantadine.","publish_time":"2013-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Balgi, Aruna D.; Wang, Jun; Cheng, Daphne Y.

Moreover, no primary prophylaxis measures (vaccination) nor effective treatments are available. If the above represented percentages are applied to the worldwide populations, it appears clear why any measure should be considered to avoid a further diffusion of the virus and prevent the saturation and collapse of health systems and the most catastrophic pandemic since 1919 Spanish flu. Isolation of those affected and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) are the mainstay to block transmission of this pathogen, which is presumed through respiratory droplets. A 14 days quarantine is applied to subjects coming from endemic areas or who had contact with confirmed cases. It is assumed that, if in this period the subject does not develop any sign or symptoms compatible with COVID-19, he is not infected and thus the quarantine can be removed, and the subject returned to the community. Domiciliary quarantine of 14 days since a positive test is applied also for patients with a diagnosed mild disease who did not need medical support. These rules are effective in controlling infections in the community, but several doubts arise when it is necessary to transpose them in the hospital setting. Hospitals are indeed a delicate place in epidemics: they collect fragile persons who can be exposed to the virus and are subsequently readmitted to the community thus spreading the infection. Indeed, the ongoing outbreak in Northern Italy has been linked to a single infected patient who accessed to a community hospital where he transmitted the virus to several other patients and health-care operators.[6] Moreover, the isolation of patients in the hospital setting impose a significant burden in terms of PPE used by the health-care operators, space dedicated and time employed in their management. Even more complex is the situation of patients in ICU, where viral spreading is facilitated by endotracheal tubes and manoeuvres performed on the respiratory tract. Therefore, a clear definition of the infectiousness timing and intensity of viral spreading is mandatory to alleviate the burden on the health-care system. Unfortunately, the data available on the topic are scarce and composed only of measurements of viral shedding, without an assessment of the infectivity. Kim et al.[7] assessed the viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in upper and lower respiratory tract materials in the first two confirmed patients in Korea. They employed real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 and converted cycle threshold (CT) values of rRT-PCR into RNA copy number. The detection limit of rRT-PCR was 2,690 copies/mL. Overall, viral load above detection limit was detected until 14 and 25 days after symptoms onset and for 13 and 11 days after the first detection, respectively.[7] Of note, both patients received treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir. Instead, Zou and colleagues analysed viral load in repeated nasal and throat swabs obtained from the 17 symptomatic patients.[8] They also employed rRT-PCR and considered a CT of 40 as detection limit. Higher viral loads were observed in nasal swabs and in samples collected soon after symptoms onset. Overall, only two patients prese ted positive samples, and only in nasal swab, 14 days after symptoms onset, and with low viral load. In conclusion, a larger amount of data about duration of viral spreading and infectivity in hospitalized patients, especially in ICU, is badly needed to better define quarantine period and avoid nosocomial transmission. Before their availability, the canonical 14 days period of quarantine should be respected.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lombardi, Andrea; Bozzi, Giorgio; Mangioni, Davide; Muscatello, Antonio; Peri, Anna Maria; Taramasso, Lucia; Ungaro, Riccardo; Bandera, Alessandra; Gori, Andrea","journal":"J Hosp Infect","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134399.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019567012030102X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32151674/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S019567012030102X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Zou"],"organizations":["PPE","RNA"],"locations":["Korea"],"keyphrases":["confirmed patients","SARS-CoV","isolation of patients","days quarantine","situation of patients","community hospital","health-care operators","rRT-PCR","intensity of viral spreading","health-care system","severe disease","viral load kinetics of SARS","detection limit of rRT","hospital setting","respiratory droplets","defined coronavirus disease","measurements of viral shedding","diagnosed mild disease","values of rRT","collapse of health systems","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","lower respiratory tract materials","intensive care unit","ICU","COVID","new pathogen","symptoms compatible","symptoms onset","confirmed cases","single infected patient","Domiciliary quarantine","terms of PPE","significant burden","effective treatments","incubation time","clear definition","Chinese borders","medical support","data available","worldwide populations","RNA copy number","Chinese province of Hubei","new form of pneumonia","basic reproduction number","real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","vaccination","infectiousness timing","space dedicated","catastrophic pandemic","humankind","condition","use of personal protective equipment","cycle threshold","endotracheal tubes","epidemics","primary prophylaxis measures","mainstay","manoeuvres","subjects","saturation","type of immune protection","delicate place","Northern Italy","positive test","estimated case-fatality rate","ongoing outbreak","Spanish flu","topic","assessment","lopinavir","ritonavir","infections","fragile persons","endemic areas","represented percentages","Hospitals","deaths","rules","transmission","management","doubts","complex","note","copies","Korea","infectivity","period","diffusion","Kim","nasal swabs","low viral load","repeated nasal","duration of viral spreading","Higher viral loads","hospitalized patients","days period of quarantine","patients prese","symptomatic patients","quarantine period","throat swabs","positive samples","data","colleagues","nosocomial transmission","availability","Zou","detection limit","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Here, we report the results of a comprehensive screen for EVEs in crustaceans. Following up on the recent discovery of EVEs in the terrestrial isopod, Armadillidium vulgare, we scanned the genomes of six crustacean species: a terrestrial isopod (Armadillidium nasatum), two water fleas (Daphnia pulex and D. pulicaria), two copepods (the salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Eurytemora affinis), and a freshwater amphipod (Hyalella azteca). RESULTS: In total, we found 210 EVEs representing 14 different lineages belonging to five different viral groups that are present in two to five species: Bunyaviridae (\u2212ssRNA), Circoviridae (ssDNA), Mononegavirales (\u2212ssRNA), Parvoviridae (ssDNA) and Totiviridae (dsRNA). The identification of shared orthologous insertions between A. nasatum and A. vulgare indicates that EVEs have been maintained over several millions of years, although we did not find any evidence supporting exaptation. Overall, the different degrees of EVE degradation (from none to \u003E10 nonsense mutations) suggest that endogenization has been recurrent during the evolution of the various crustacean taxa. Our study is the first to report EVEs in D. pulicaria, E. affinis and H. azteca, many of which are likely to result from recent endogenization of currently circulating viruses. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we have unearthed a large diversity of EVEs from crustacean genomes, and shown that four of the five viral groups we uncovered (Bunyaviridae, Circoviridae, Mononegavirales, Parvoviridae) were and may still be present in three to four highly divergent crustacean taxa. In addition, the discovery of recent EVEs offers an interesting opportunity to characterize new exogenous viruses currently circulating in economically or ecologically important copepod species.

The effects of temperature on the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in China are unknown. Data on COVID-19 daily confirmed cases and daily mean temperatures were collected from 31 provincial-level regions in mainland China between Jan. 20 and Feb. 29, 2020. Locally weighted regression and smoothing scatterplot (LOESS), distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs), and random-effects meta-analysis were used to examine the relationship between daily confirmed cases rate of COVID-19 and temperature conditions. The daily number of new cases peaked on Feb. 12, and then decreased. The daily confirmed cases rate of COVID-19 had a biphasic relationship with temperature (with a peak at 10 \u00B0C), and the daily incidence of COVID-19 decreased at values below and above these values. The overall epidemic intensity of COVID-19 reduced slightly following days with higher temperatures with a relative risk (RR) was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.99). A random-effect meta-analysis including 28 provinces in mainland China, we confirmed the statistically significant association between temperature and RR during the study period (Coefficient = \u22120.0100, 95% CI: \u22120.0125, \u22120.0074). The DLNMs in Hubei Province (outside of Wuhan) and Wuhan showed similar patterns of temperature. Additionally, a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (M-SEIR) model, with adjustment for climatic factors, was used to provide a complete characterization of the impact of climate on the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Peng; Dong, Yinqiao; Yan, Huanchang; Zhao, Chenkai; Li, Xiaoyang; Liu, Wei; He, Miao; Tang, Shixing; Xi, Shuhua","journal":"Sci Total Environ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2b517920b4c978971337d286fec37b5454ad70aa.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720324074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32339844/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720324074?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138890","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["daily incidence of COVID","daily confirmed cases rate of COVID","effects of temperature","overall epidemic intensity of COVID","Wuhan","daily mean temperatures","mainland China","daily number of new cases","temperature conditions","similar patterns of temperature","RR","DLNMs","random-effects meta-analysis","dynamics","values","random-effect meta-analysis","higher temperatures","biphasic relationship","LOESS","distributed lag nonlinear models","smoothing scatterplot","provinces","provincial-level regions","relative risk","impact of climate","following days","adjustment","weighted regression","Coefficient","study period","significant association","SEIR","climatic factors","complete characterization","Hubei Province","peak","outbreak","end","Data","global pandemic"],"language":"en"},

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), reported as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor, is also expressed in human male testes. This suggests a potential risk in human male reproductive system. However, the characteristics of ACE2-positive cells and the expression of other SARS-CoV-2 process-related genes are still worthy of further investigation. Here, we performed singlecell RNA seq (scRNA-seq) analysis on 853 male embryo primordial germ cells (PGCs) and 2,854 normal testis cells to assess the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on the male reproductive system from embryonic stage to adulthood. We also collected and constructed the scRNA-seq library on 228 Sertoli cells from three non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) patients to assess the effects at disease state. We found that ACE2 expressing cells existed in almost all testis cell types and Sertoli cells had highest expression level and positive cells ratio. Moreover, ACE2 was also expressed in human male PGCs. In adulthood, the level of ACE2 expression decreased with the increase of age. We also found that ACE2 positive cells had high expressions of stress response and immune activation-related genes. Interestingly, some potential SARS-CoV-2 process-related genes such as TMPRSS2, BSG, CTSL and CTSB had different expression patterns in the same cell type. Furthermore, ACE2 expression level in NOA donors\u2019 Sertoli cells was significantly decreased. Our work would help to assess the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the male reproductive system.

Of these, IFITM3 potently inhibits viruses that enter cells through acidic endosomes, many of which are zoonotic and emerging viruses with bats (order Chiroptera) as natural hosts. We previously demonstrated that microbat IFITM3 is antiviral. Here we show that bat IFITMs are characterized by strong adaptive evolution and identify a highly variable and functionally important site - codon 70 - within the conserved CD225 domain of IFITMs. Mutation of this residue in microbat IFITM3 impairs restriction of four different virus families that enter cells via endosomes. This mutant shows altered subcellular localization and reduced S-palmitoylation, a phenotype copied by mutation of conserved cysteine residues in microbat IFITM3. Furthermore, we show that microbat IFITM3 is S-palmitoylated on cysteine residues C71, C72 and C105, mutation of each cysteine residue individually impairs virus restriction, and a triple C71-C72-C105 mutant loses all restriction, concomitant with subcellular re-localization of microbat IFITM3 to Golgi-associated sites. Thus, we propose that S-palmitoylation is critical for Chiropteran IFITM3 function and identify a key molecular determinant of IFITM3 S-palmitoylation.","publish_time":"2019-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Benfield, Camilla T O; MacKenzie, Farrell; Ritzefeld, Markus; Mazzon, Michela; Weston, Stuart; Tate, Edward; Han Teo, Boon; Smith, Sarah E; Kellam, Paul; Holmes, Edward C; Marsh, Mark","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/180b2bd4680762a2cdcafd397a7e9d6748900523.json; document_parses/pdf_json/311a15d92b87b2bc41f00afed881b95e93c22fcc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/737841","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["subcellular re-localization of microbat IFITM3","Chiropteran IFITM3 function","virus restriction","key molecular determinant of IFITM3 S-palmitoylation","reduced S-palmitoylation","mutation of conserved cysteine residues","cysteine residues C71","subcellular localization","C105 mutant","broad-spectrum antiviral restriction factors","bat IFITMs","cells","conserved CD225 domain of IFITMs","triple C71-C72","mutant shows","emerging viruses","acidic endosomes","different virus families","concomitant","order Chiroptera","bats","phenotype","transmembrane proteins","Golgi-associated sites","strong adaptive evolution","important site - codon","natural hosts","Host interferon"],"language":"en"},

Importantly, we provide evidence that RNA extraction can be successfully bypassed when samples are stored in UTM medium or in molecular water but not when samples are stored in saline solution and in Hanks medium.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Merindol, Natacha; P\u00E9pin, Genevi\u00E8ve; Marchand, Caroline; Rheault, Maryl\u00E8ne; Peterson, Christine; Poirier, Andr\u00E9; Houle, Claudia; Germain, Hugo; Danylo, Alexis","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ea4468adb43a7fd8e2d95f2277a6fdba6ddaaf35.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7204723.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32416598/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104423; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301657?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301657","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rapid","SeeGene","UTM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCR efficiency","rRT-PCR kit","nCoV rRT-PCR","direct rRT-PCR method","SARS-CoV","RNA extraction","samples","SeeGene AllplexTM","similar efficiency","UTM medium","Hanks medium","reliable screening of SARS","impact of swab storage media composition","RealStar","saline solution","molecular water","Altona\u0027s assays","Altona Diagnostics","viral spread","pandemic","study","evidence"],"language":"en"},

Many species in the seven genera of Polygoneae are traditional and popular medicinal herbs. Anthraquinones and stilbenes are characteristic medicinal compounds of Polygoneae, while other useful constituents, such as alkaloids, glycosides, flavonoids, volatile oils, tannins, resins, coumarins, and lignans, have also been isolated from Polygoneae species. Among versatile bioactivities of Polygoneae compounds, their effects on the cardiovascular and nervous systems and their anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiparasitic, insecticidal, anticancer, and antioxidant activities are highlighted. Interspecific hybridization and the following polyploidization play a major role in Polygoneae diversification. Nuclear ITS and chloroplast DNA sequences are retrieved to resolve the interspecific relationship and reassign some taxa to the appropriate genus. Omics study of Polygoneae is at the budding stage, which will revolutionize the sustainable utilization of Polygoneae medicinal resources.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hao, Da Cheng; Gu, Xiao-Jie; Xiao, Pei Gen","journal":"Medicinal Plants","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a4f0b6baa85871705a0cfa6eaaad43d4e8316108.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7158354.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780081000854000128; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780081000854000128","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Polygoneae species","genera of Polygoneae","Polygoneae diversification","omics of Polygoneae medicinal resources","characteristic medicinal compounds of Polygoneae","Omics study of Polygoneae","sustainable utilization of Polygoneae medicinal resources","versatile bioactivities of Polygoneae compounds","popular medicinal herbs","Interspecific hybridization","interspecific relationship","volatile oils","anti-inflammatory","phytochemistry","bioactivity","effects","molecular phylogeny","following polyploidization","resins","alkaloids","tannins","glycosides","flavonoids","nervous systems","major role","stilbenes","current knowledge","coumarins","antiparasitic","taxa","useful constituents","Anthraquinones","chloroplast DNA sequences","antioxidant activities"],"language":"en"},

TRE possessed considerable amounts of phenolics (282.73 mg tannic acid equivalents/g of extract) and flavonoids (101.43 mg naringin equivalents/g of extract). IC(50) values for reducing power and DPPH radical scavenging activity were 52.51 and 47.83 \u03BCg, respectively. The H(2)O(2) scavenging capacity of TRE was found to be 57.68 \u03BCM \u00D7 \u03BCg(\u22121) min(\u22121). By examining the effects of TRE on SH-SY5Y cells injured by H(2)O(2), we found that after incubation of cells with TRE prior to H(2)O(2) exposure, the H(2)O(2) induced cytotoxicity was significantly reversed and the apoptotic features such as change in cellular morphology, nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation was inhibited. Moreover, TRE was very effective attenuating the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptotic cell death induced by H(2)O(2). TRE extract effectively suppressed the up-regulation of Bax, Caspase-3 and -9, and down-regulation of Bcl-2. Moreover, TRE pretreatment evidently increased the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in SH-SY5Y cells. These findings demonstrate that TRE protects SH-SY5Y cells against H(2)O(2)-induced injury and antioxidant properties may account for its neuroprotective actions and suggest that TRE might potentially serve as an agent for prevention of neurodegenerative disease associated with oxidative stress.","publish_time":"2010-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choi, Bong-Suk; Sapkota, Kumar; Kim, Seung; Lee, Hyo Jeong; Choi, Han-Seok; Kim, Sung-Jun","journal":"Neurochem Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d8c1c3a9883f12f8aaec7c909984bfbcdc0687c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089404.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20467894/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11064-010-0185-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsxNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TRE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TRE extract","effects of TRE","TRE pretreatment","capacity of TRE","SH-SY5Y cells","g of extract","incubation of cells","induced apoptosis","induced injury","human dopaminergic cells","neuroprotective effects of Tripterygium regelii extract","antioxidant activity","\u03BCg","antioxidant properties","apoptotic features","naringin equivalents","neuroprotective actions","DPPH radical scavenging activity","regulation of Bax","regulation of Bcl","apoptotic cell death","tannic acid equivalents","BDNF","disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential","cellular morphology","brain-derived neurotrophic factor","nuclear condensation","power","tyrosine hydroxylase","prevention of neurodegenerative disease","DNA fragmentation","considerable amounts of phenolics","values","agent","flavonoids","oxidative stress","Caspase","cytotoxicity","\u03BCM","findings","exposure","present work"],"language":"en"},

The long-term prediction of the dynamic distribution of contaminants in this type of system is crucial for the evaluation of pollution and further design of more efficient ventilation systems. However, few convenient methods can predict the dynamic distribution of contaminants, because the dynamic supply air concentrations resulting from air recirculation are unknown, especially over long time periods, such as months or years. In this study, a novel method is proposed to predict the dynamic distribution of contaminants over a long time period in a complex recirculating ventilation system, where an algebraic expression based on the indices of the response coefficient is applied to account for the relationship between the contaminant distribution inside the room and various boundary conditions. The method is established by obtaining comprehensive mathematical descriptions of the relationships between concentrations of contaminants in the air handling units, supply air inlets, return air outlets, and fresh air. Hourly supply air concentrations can be easily obtained by solving a matrix, and the dynamic distribution of contaminants is then calculated using an expression based on the response coefficient. The reliability of the proposed method is analyzed by both experimental and numerical methods. A simplified method is suggested to accelerate the time-consuming calculation of the response coefficient. The proposed method is beneficial for predicting three-dimensional dynamic distribution of contaminants in complex ventilation systems with an acceptable accuracy and time cost.","publish_time":"2017-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shao, Xiaoliang; Li, Xianting; Ma, Xiaojun; Zhu, Fenfei","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/554aefb29a05a8c04bab22eca4082242193ee253.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126526.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287971/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132317301956; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2017.05.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132317301956","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsxODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dynamic supply air concentrations","three-dimensional dynamic distribution of contaminants","concentrations of contaminants","air outlets","air recirculation","fresh air","proposed method","supply air inlets","Hourly supply air concentrations","contaminant distribution","air handling units","complex ventilation systems","novel method","response coefficient","simplified method","efficient ventilation systems","complex recirculating ventilation system","Abstract Recirculating ventilation systems","long time periods","time cost","type of system","algebraic expression","convenient methods","numerical methods","acceptable accuracy","room","design","relationships","comprehensive mathematical descriptions","evaluation of pollution","various boundary conditions","months","account","indices","time-consuming calculation","carriers of hazardous substances","long-term prediction","years","study","reliability","matrix"],"language":"en"},

Virus budding is a poorly understood process that challenges current models of vesicle formation. Here, a plausible mechanism for arenavirus budding is presented, building on recent evidence that viral proteins embed in the inner lipid layer of the cell membrane. Experimental results confirm that viral protein is associated with increased membrane curvature, whereas a mathematical model is used to show that localized increases in curvature alone are sufficient to generate viral buds. The magnitude of the protein-induced curvature is calculated from the size of the amphipathic region hypothetically removed from the inner membrane as a result of translation, with a change in membrane stiffness estimated from observed differences in virion deformation as a result of protein depletion. Numerical results are based on experimental data and estimates for three arenaviruses, but the mechanisms described are more broadly applicable.

METHODS: A 17-item questionnaire was distributed to ophthalmologists practicing in Israel. Data was obtained regarding demographics and clinical and surgical practice during the pandemic. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-seven ophthalmologists completed the survey from all regions of Israel. The survey was distributed during the early stages of the outbreak. At this time, no official government guidelines were in place. Most respondents reported no reduction of elective clinic visits and surgeries and no utilization of triage questionnaires. COVID-19 guidelines were reportedly promulgated to hospital ophthalmologists but not to community and private physicians. Personal protective equipment (PPE) measures were reportedly utilized; however, many respondents often acquired them individually. A majority of respondents advocated that healthcare institutions limit clinic and surgery services to emergency services.

Since the industries and people\u0027s activities have been shut off for a month or more in many parts of the world, it is expected to show some improvement in the prevailing conditions in the aforementioned spheres of environment. Here, with the help of remote sensing images, this work quantitatively demonstrated the improvement in surface water quality in terms of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the Vembanad Lake, the longest freshwater lake in India.

Not surprisingly, the dysregulated function of cathepsin L has manifested itself in several human diseases, making it an attractive target for drug development. Unfortunately, several redundant and isoform-specific functions have recently emerged, adding complexities to the drug discovery process. To address this, a series of chemical biology tools have been developed that helped define cathepsin L biology with exquisite precision in specific cellular contexts.

To take advantage of ongoing investment in rural infrastructure, an index of schistosomiasis transmission potential is needed to identify villages where environmental modifications would be particularly effective. Based on a retrospective analysis of data from 10 villages in Sichuan Province, an index linked to the basic reproductive number is shown to have promise in meeting this need. However, a lack of methods for estimating the spatial components of the proposed metric and for estimating the import of cercariae and miracidia from neighbouring villages leads to significant uncertainty in its estimation. These findings suggest a priority effort to develop methods for measuring the free-swimming forms of the parasite in surface waters.

Methods This multicentre randomized controlled trial focused on adults with LRTI not suspected for pneumonia. Patients were randomized to receive either antibiotic (amoxicillin 1 g) or placebo three times daily for 7 consecutive days using computer-generated random numbers (follow-up 28 days). In this secondary analysis of the trial, symptom duration (primary outcome), symptom severity (scored 0\u20136), and illness deterioration (reconsultation with new or worsening symptoms, or hospital admission) were analysed in pre-specified subgroups using regression models. Subgroups of interest were patients with a (strictly) bacterial, (strictly) viral, or combined infection, and patients with elevated values of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, or blood urea nitrogen. Results 2058 patients (amoxicillin n = 1036; placebo n = 1022) were randomized. Treatment did not affect symptom duration (n = 1793). Patients from whom a bacterial pathogen only was isolated (n = 207) benefited from amoxicillin in that symptom severity (n = 804) was reduced by 0.26 points (95% CI \u22120.48 to \u22120.03).

Antiviral therapy is effective when treatment is initiated within 48h of symptom onset, and delaying treatment beyond this time frame is associated with decreased efficacy. Research on anti-inflammatory therapy to ameliorate influenza-induced inflammation is currently underway and seems important to the impact on the clinical outcome. Both antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs with novel mechanisms of action are urgently needed. Current methods for evaluating the efficacy of anti-influenza drugs rely mostly on transformed cells and animals. Transformed cell models are distantly related to physiological and pathological conditions. Although animals are the best choices for preclinical drug testing, they are not time- or cost-efficient. In this study, we established an ex vivo model using mouse lung slices to evaluate both antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents against influenza virus infection. Both influenza virus PR8 (H1N1) and A/Human/Hubei/3/2005 (H3N2) can replicate efficiently in mouse lung slices and trigger significant cytokine and chemokine responses. The induction of selected cytokines and chemokines were found to have a positive correlation between ex vivo and in vivo experiments, suggesting that the ex vivo cultured lung slices may closely resemble the lung functionally in an in vivo configuration when challenged by influenza virus. Furthermore, a set of agents with known antiviral and/or anti-inflammatory activities were tested to validate the ex vivo model. Our results suggested that mouse lung slices provide a robust, convenient and cost-efficient model for the assessment of both antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents against influenza virus infection in one assay. This ex vivo model may predict the efficacy of drug candidates\u2019 antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities in vivo.","publish_time":"2015-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Rui; An, Liwei; Liu, Ge; Li, Xiaoyu; Tang, Wei; Chen, Xulin","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/415ca4cc0c126b999a89c7c0cdebc5b68ded4adb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125926.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.05.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26022197/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016635421500128X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016635421500128X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsyNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus infection","anti-inflammatory agents","influenza virus PR8","anti-inflammatory drugs","Antiviral therapy","anti-inflammatory therapy","anti-inflammatory activities","mouse lung slices","known antiviral","cultured lung slices","efficacy of anti-influenza drugs","efficacy of drug candidates\u2019 antiviral","influenza-induced inflammation","cost-efficient model","decreased efficacy","set of agents","animals","delaying treatment","time frame","transformed cells","preclinical drug testing","significant cytokine","assessment","best choices","novel mechanisms of action","chemokines","impact","recurrent epidemics","h of symptom onset","ability","H1N1","global pandemics","chemokine responses","induction of selected cytokines","Human","H3N2","positive correlation","experiments","assay","results","Research","configuration","clinical outcome","Current methods","cell models","pathological conditions","Hubei","study"],"language":"en"},

Several techniques for viral genome engineering have been developed. Homologous recombination in virus\u2010infected cells has traditionally been used to edit viral genomes; however, the frequency of the expected recombination is quite low. Alternatively, large viral genomes have been edited using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) plasmid system. However, cloning of large viral genomes into BAC plasmids is both laborious and time\u2010consuming. In addition, because it is possible for insertion into the viral genome of drug selection markers or parts of BAC plasmids to affect viral function, artificial genes sometimes need to be removed from edited viruses. Herpes simplex virus (HSV), a common DNA virus with a genome length of 152 kbp, causes labialis, genital herpes and encephalitis. Mutant HSV is a candidate for oncotherapy, in which HSV is used to kill tumor cells. In this study, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat\u2010Cas9 system was used to very efficiently engineer HSV without inserting artificial genes into viral genomes. Not only gene\u2010ablated HSV but also gene knock\u2010in HSV were generated using this method.

The thermal and acid stability of IDV were examined and directly compared with those of influenza A virus (IAV), influenza B virus (IBV), and influenza C virus (ICV). The results of our experiments demonstrated that only IDV had a high residual infectivity (~2.5 log units of 50% tissue culture infective dose [TCID(50)]/ml) after a 60-min exposure to 53\u00B0C in solution at a neutral pH, and remarkably, IDV retained this infectivity even after exposure to 53\u00B0C for 120 min. Furthermore, the data showed that IDV was extremely resistant to inactivation by low pH. After being treated at pH 3.0 for 30 min, IDV lost only approximately 20% of its original infectiousness, while all other types of influenza viruses were completely inactivated. Finally, replacement of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins of a temperature- and acid-sensitive IAV with the hemagglutinin-esterase fusion (HEF) protein of a stable IDV through a reverse genetic system largely rendered the recombinant IAVs resistant to high-temperature and low-pH treatments. Together, these results indicated that the HEF glycoprotein is a primary determinant of the exceptional temperature and acid tolerance of IDV. Further investigation into the viral entry and fusion mechanism mediated by the intrinsically stable HEF protein of IDV may offer novel insights into how the fusion machinery of influenza viruses evolve to achieve acid and thermal stability, which as a result promotes the potential to transmit across mammal species. IMPORTANCE Influenza D virus (IDV) utilizes cattle as a primary reservoir. Increased outbreaks in pigs and serological evidence of human infection have raised a concern about the potential of IDV adapting to humans. Here, we directly compared IDV\u2019s stability to that of other influenza types (A, B, and C) following prolonged incubation at high temperatures or in a low-pH environment. We found that IDV is the most stable of the four types of influenza viruses. Importantly, we demonstrated that the hemagglutinin-esterase fusion (HEF) protein, which drives the fusion between viral and host cell membranes, is the primary determinant for the high thermal and acid stability of IDV. Considering that there is a link between the acid stability of the hemagglutinin protein of influenza A virus and its cross-species transmission, further investigation of the mechanism of HEF-directed viral tolerance may offer novel insights into tissue tropism and cross-species transmission of influenza viruses.","publish_time":"2017-08-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Jieshi; Hika, Busha; Liu, Runxia; Sheng, Zizhang; Hause, Ben M.; Li, Feng; Wang, Dan","journal":"mSphere","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0bee52e6477404d2aed60b9ae06ac53bf92660de.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5549178.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28808690/; https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00254-17","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsyOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stable IDV","acid stability of IDV","influenza types","potential of IDV","influenza C virus","acid tolerance of IDV","types of influenza viruses","influenza B virus","hemagglutinin protein of influenza","stable HEF protein of IDV","fusion machinery of influenza viruses","IMPORTANCE Influenza D virus","cross-species transmission of influenza viruses","thermal stability","low pH","hemagglutinin-esterase fusion","high-temperature","fusion mechanism","mechanism of HEF","primary determinant","acid-sensitive IAV","HEF glycoprotein","primary reservoir","low-pH treatments","low-pH environment","IDV\u2019s stability","neutral pH","high temperatures","viral tolerance","high residual infectivity","exceptional temperature","novel insights","cattle","viral entry","investigation","mammal species","exposure","results","tissue tropism","recombinant IAVs resistant","tissue culture infective dose","pigs","log units","reverse genetic system","serological evidence of human infection","IBV","host cell membranes","prolonged incubation","Increased outbreaks","TCID","neuraminidase","proteins","concern","solution","inactivation","ICV","original infectiousness","replacement","experiments","humans","data","link"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we investigate whether platelet count could differentiate between COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease. Additionally, we evaluate if thrombocytopenia is associated with severe COVID-19. METHODS: An electronic search in Medline, Scopus and Web of Science was performed to identify studies reporting data on platelet count in COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis was performed, with calculation of weighted mean difference (WMD) of platelet number in COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease and odds ratio (OR) of thrombocytopenia for severe form of COVID-19. RESULTS: Nine studies with 1779 COVID-19 patients, 399 (22.4%) with severe disease, were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis revealed that platelet count was significantly lower in patients with more severe COVID-19 (WMD -31\u00D710(9)/L; 95% CI, from -35 to -29\u00D710(9)/L). A subgroup analysis comparing patients by survival, found an even lower platelet count was observed with mortality (WMD, -48\u00D710(9)/L; 95% CI, -57 to -39\u00D710(9)/L. In the four studies (n=1427) which reported data on rate of thrombocytopenia, a low platelet count was associated with over fivefold enhanced risk of severe COVID-19 (OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.8-14.6). CONCLUSIONS: Low platelet count is associated with increased risk of severe disease and mortality in patients with COVID-19, and thus should serve as clinical indicator of worsening illness during hospitalization.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lippi, Giuseppe; Plebani, Mario; Michael Henry, Brandon","journal":"Clin Chim Acta","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/45f82c4c5a222af95b1967059617a651f39d87e4.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e53601fdcfda49cda637b01cc42da5b621abba13.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102663.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.03.022; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009898120301248; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32178975/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009898120301248","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsyOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","severe form of COVID","lower platelet count","low platelet count","fivefold enhanced risk of severe COVID","increased risk of severe disease","platelet number","Coronavirus disease","WMD","studies","meta-analysis","novel infectious disease","subgroup analysis","pooled analysis","mortality","rate of thrombocytopenia","data","illness severity","clinical indicator of worsening illness","lack of established laboratory markers available","Medline","calculation of weighted mean difference","Scopus","survival","electronic search","Web of Science","hospitalization","odds ratio","METHODS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","study"],"language":"en"},

Among these viruses, La Crosse virus (LACV), a member of the California serogroup, circulates in the eastern and midwestern United States. While LACV infection is often asymptomatic, dozens of cases of encephalitis are reported yearly. Unfortunately, no antivirals have been approved to treat LACV infection. Here, we developed a method to rapidly test potential antivirals against LACV infection. From this screen, we identified several potential antiviral molecules, including known antivirals. Additionally, we identified many novel antivirals that exhibited antiviral activity without affecting cellular viability. Valinomycin, a potassium ionophore, was among our top targets. We found that valinomycin exhibited potent anti-LACV activity in multiple cell types in a dose-dependent manner. Valinomycin did not affect particle stability or infectivity, suggesting that it may preclude virus replication by altering cellular potassium ions, a known determinant of LACV entry. We extended these results to other ionophores and found that the antiviral activity of valinomycin extended to other viral families including bunyaviruses (Rift Valley fever virus, Keystone virus), enteroviruses (Coxsackievirus, rhinovirus), flavirivuses (Zika), and coronaviruses (229E and MERS-CoV). In all viral infections, we observed significant reductions in virus titer in valinomycin-treated cells. In sum, we demonstrate the importance of potassium ions to virus infection, suggesting a potential therapeutic target to disrupt virus replication. No antivirals are approved for the treatment of bunyavirus infection. The ability to rapidly screen compounds and identify novel antivirals is one means to accelerate drug discovery for viruses with no approved treatments. We used this approach to screen hundreds of compounds against La Crosse virus, an emerging bunyavirus that causes significant disease, including encephalitis. We identified several known and previously unidentified antivirals. We focused on a potassium ionophore, valinomycin, due to its promising in vitro antiviral activity. We demonstrate that valinomycin, as well as a selection of other ionophores, exhibits activity against La Crosse virus as well as several other distantly related bunyaviruses.

Employing a more realistic model that considers heterogeneous contact is consequently necessary. Here, we use a contact network to reconstruct unprotected, protected contact, and airborne spread to simulate the two-stages outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) on the \u201CDiamond Princess\u201D cruise ship. We employ Bayesian inference and Metropolis-Hastings sampling to estimate the model parameters and quantify the uncertainties by the ensemble simulation technique. During the early epidemic with intensive social contacts, the results reveal that the average transmissibility t was 0.026 and the basic reproductive number R 0 was 6.94, triple that in the WHO report, indicating that all people would be infected in one month. The t and R 0 decreased to 0.0007 and 0.2 when quarantine was implemented. The reconstruction suggests that diluting the airborne virus concentration in closed settings is useful in addition to isolation, and high-risk susceptible should follow rigorous prevention measures in case exposed. This study can provide useful implications for control and prevention measures for the other cruise ships and closed settings.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Feng; Li, Xin; Zhu, Gaofeng","journal":"Sci Bull (Beijing)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/506c014c54d10d042392c98afb6b17a41711d69a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7198438.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scib.2020.04.043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32373394/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095927320302814?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095927320302814","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjszNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["heterogeneous contact","protected contact","contact network","real contact patterns","closed settings","rigorous prevention measures","useful implications","airborne spread","cruise ships","model parameters","early epidemic","realistic model","airborne virus concentration","average transmissibility t","basic reproductive number R","results","SIR","addition","Metropolis-Hastings sampling","uncertainties","intensive social contacts","control","isolation","Abstract Traditional compartmental models","homogeneous population","Bayesian inference","epidemics","Diamond Princess","stages outbreak of COVID","coronavirus disease","ensemble simulation technique","triple","study","case","people","report","reconstruction","month","quarantine"],"language":"en"},

This situation underlines the urgent need for novel antivirals as well as innovations in vaccine production in preparation for the next influenza epidemic. Here we report the development of a cell-based high-throughput screen which we have used for the identification of compounds that modulate influenza virus growth either negatively or positively. We screened a library of compounds with known biological activity and identified distinct groups of inhibitors and enhancers that target sodium channels or protein kinase C (PKC). We confirmed these results in viral growth assays and find that treatment with a sodium channel opener or PKC inhibitor significantly reduces viral replication. In contrast, inhibition of sodium channels or activation of PKC leads to enhanced virus production in tissue culture. These diametrically opposing effects strongly support a role for PKC activity and the regulation of Na(\u002B) currents in influenza virus replication and both may serve as targets for antiviral drugs. Furthermore, we raise the possibility that compounds that result in increased viral titers may be beneficial for boosting the production of tissue culture-grown influenza vaccines.","publish_time":"2008-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoffmann, H.-Heinrich; Palese, Peter; Shaw, Megan L.","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f199cc588a9248da18570283362cce54b4c7005.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f9d941d30a663db32ceabe367cf36b6f3c2c744c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2614658.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354208003148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18585796/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354208003148; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2614658?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2008.05.008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjszNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PKC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus growth","influenza virus replication","PKC activity","anti-influenza virus drugs","influenza vaccines","influenza epidemic","enhanced virus production","PKC inhibitor","activation of PKC","vaccine production","viral replication","production of tissue culture","inhibition of sodium channels","viral growth assays","library of compounds","identification of compounds","sodium channel opener","increased viral titers","vaccine manufacturers","antiviral drugs","known biological activity","distinct groups of inhibitors","enhancers","treatment","FDA","protein kinase C","novel antivirals","innovations","regulation of Na","preparation","currents","cell","urgent need","levels of resistance","experienced demands","role","high-throughput screen","recent years","situation","targets","results","contrast","development","capacity","effects"],"language":"en"},

A functional effect of the mini-conversion was introduction of the C1 epitope into HLA-B*46:01, making it an exceptional HLA-B allotype that is recognized by the C1-specific natural killer cell receptor KIR2DL3. High-resolution mass spectrometry showed that HLA-B*46:01 has a low diversity peptidome that is distinct from those of its parents. A minority (21%) of HLA-B*46:01 peptides, with common C-terminal characteristics, form ligands for KIR2DL3. The HLA-B*46:01 peptidome is predicted to be enriched for peptide antigens derived from Mycobacterium leprae.

Some authors recommend to perform a microbiological investigation in suspected bacterial cases in order to treat the confirmed cases with antibiotics so to prevent suppurative complications and acute rheumatic fever. Differently, other authors consider pharyngitis, even streptococcal one, a benign, self-limiting disease. Consequently they wouldn\u0027t routinely perform microbiological tests and, pointing to a judicious use of antibiotics, they would reserve antimicrobial treatment to well-selected cases. It has been calculated that the number of patients needed to treat to prevent one complication after upper respiratory tract infections (including sore throat), was over 4000. Even the use of the Centor score, in order to evaluate the risk of streptococcal infection, is under debate and the interpretation of the test results may vary considerably. Penicillin is considered all over the world as first line treatment, but oral amoxicillin is also accepted and, due to its better palatability, can be a suitable option.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of results from published studies to date to provide a summary of evidence on detection of COVID-19 by chest CT and the expected CT imaging manifestations. Methods Studies were identified by searching PubMed database for articles published between December 2019 and February 2020. Pooled CT positive rate of COVID-19 and pooled incidence of CT imaging findings were estimated using a random-effect model. Results A total of 13 studies met inclusion criteria. The pooled positive rate of the CT imaging was 89.76% and 90.35% when only including thin-section chest CT. Typical CT signs were ground glass opacities (83.31%), ground glass opacities with mixed consolidation (58.42%), adjacent pleura thickening (52.46%), interlobular septal thickening (48.46%), and air bronchograms (46.46%). Other CT signs included crazy paving pattern (14.81%), pleural effusion (5.88%), bronchiectasis (5.42%), pericardial effusion (4.55%), and lymphadenopathy (3.38%). The most anatomic distributions were bilateral lung infection (78.2%) and peripheral distribution (76.95%). The incidences were highest in the right lower lobe (87.21%), left lower lobe (81.41%), and bilateral lower lobes (65.22%). The right upper lobe (65.22%), right middle lobe (54.95%), and left upper lobe (69.43%) were also commonly involved. The incidence of bilateral upper lobes was 60.87%. A considerable proportion of patients had three or more lobes involved (70.81%). Conclusions The detection of COVID-19 chest CT imaging is very high among symptomatic individuals at high risk, especially using thin-section chest CT. The most common CT features in patients affected by COVID-19 included ground glass opacities and consolidation involving the bilateral lungs in a peripheral distribution.","publish_time":"2020-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bao, Cuiping; Liu, Xuehuan; Zhang, Han; Li, Yiming; Liu, Jun","journal":"J Am Coll Radiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b3e462134e3a9d763eefec4240a8935d8c604761.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151282.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacr.2020.03.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32283052/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1546144020302623; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1546144020302623","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs5Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chest CT imaging features of COVID","Pooled CT positive rate of COVID","Typical CT signs","common CT features","expected CT imaging manifestations","pooled incidence of CT imaging findings","right lower lobe","right upper lobe","section chest","detection of COVID","bilateral lower lobes","incidence of bilateral upper lobes","middle lobe","included ground glass opacities","bilateral lungs","published studies","pooled positive rate","date","bilateral lung infection","Methods Studies","peripheral distribution","considerable proportion of patients","high risk","mixed consolidation","pericardial effusion","pleural effusion","considerable knowledge gaps","meta-analysis of results","interlobular septal thickening","adjacent pleura thickening","symptomatic individuals","Abstract Purpose","summary of evidence","crazy paving pattern","systematic review","anatomic distributions","PubMed database","total","inclusion criteria","incidences","random-effect model","articles","bronchiectasis","Conclusions","air bronchograms","lymphadenopathy"],"language":"en"},

One of the effects of such a constraint can be to modulate the interaction of the peptide with a binding partner. Here, a cysteine bis-alkylation stapling technique was applied to generate structurally isomeric peptide variants of a heterodimeric coiled-coil forming peptide. These stapled variants differed in the position and size of the formed macrocycle. C-terminal stapling showed the most significant changes in peptide structure and stability, with calorimetric binding analysis showing a significant reduction of binding entropy for stapled variants. This entropy reduction was dependent on cross-linker size and was accompanied by a change in binding enthalpy, illustrating the effects of preorganization. The stapled peptide, along with its binding partner, were subsequently employed as fusogens in a liposome model system. An increase in both lipid- and content-mixing was observed for one of the stapled peptide variants: this increased fusogenicity was attributed to increased coiled-coil binding but not to membrane affinity, an interaction theorized to be a primary driving force in this fusion system.","publish_time":"2020-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crone, Niek S.

This article reviews the lessons learnt from past experience and current knowledge on the range of measures required to limit the impact of emerging respiratory infections from public health responses down to individual patient management. Key areas of interest are surveillance programs, political limitations on our ability to respond quickly enough to emerging threats, media management, public information dissemination, infection control, prophylaxis, and individual patient management.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 16 children with laboratory-confirmed S-OIV infection (12 boys, 4 girls), with an age range of 5\u201310 years (mean 6.3 years). Pneumonia was suspected in these patients based on clinical features or confirmed by radiography. All subjects underwent CT for close evaluation of pneumonia, including characteristics, distribution, extent, and other findings such as pleural effusion, pneumothorax, and pneumomediastinum. RESULTS: The predominant CT finding was consolidation plus ground-grass opacity (GGO) (11/16, 69%). The consolidation-dominant pattern was found in 10 of 16 (66%) patients, and 1 (6%) was GGO-dominant. One (6%) had only GGO. In all, 7 of the 16 patients had segmental or lobar consolidation. Abnormal opacities were primarily distributed in the central lung zone (8/16, 50%) and were multifocal (15/16, 94%). Four showed atelectasis (4/16, 25%). Pneumomediastinum was observed in 4 of 16 (25%). One patient had negative radiographic findings but was positive on CT. CONCLUSION: Multifocal consolidation with central distribution is a common CT finding in children with S-OIV, but there are few GGO-dominant cases. Widespread consolidation (segmental or lobar) is also common.","publish_time":"2011-10-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yamada, Kentaro; Shinmoto, Hiroshi; Hamamoto, Manabu; Yoshida, Yusuke; Kawauchi, Toshio; Kaji, Tatsumi; Kosuda, Shigeru","journal":"Jpn J Radiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/15b52fb20b4dc2c15b6167011bc391a4dcf84918.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22009423/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11604-011-0620-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pneumonia"],"organizations":["GGO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lobar consolidation","Multifocal consolidation","children","common CT","Widespread consolidation","consolidation-dominant pattern","patients","GGO-dominant cases","predominant CT finding","S-OIV infection","central distribution","years","PURPOSE","pneumomediastinum","study population","clinical features","negative radiographic findings","close evaluation of pneumonia","central lung zone","features of chest computed tomography","H1N1","CONCLUSION","ground-grass opacity","characteristics","swine-origin influenza","virus","laboratory","girls","pleural effusion","pneumothorax","boys","age range","MATERIALS","METHODS","subjects","extent","RESULTS","radiography","Abnormal opacities","showed atelectasis"],"language":"en"},

Although the prevalence and clinical manifestations of the two subtypes, RSV\u2010A and RSV\u2010B, have been studied in some detail in infants and young children, they have not been determined in adults. To evaluate the prevalence of the RSV subtypes and disease severity between RSV\u2010A and RSV\u2010B infections in adults, nasal and throat swabs that were collected from patients \u226515 years old who sought medical care for acute respiratory infections at the Fever Clinic of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beijing, China between May 2005 and April 2010. The samples were tested for RSV infection using PCR and sequencing analysis. RSV was detected in 95 (1%) of the adult patients, of whom 53 (55.8%) were positive for RSV\u2010A and 42 (44.2%) for RSV\u2010B. The incidence of RSV infections increased with age (\u03C7(2) = 37.17, P = 1.66E\u221207). Demographic data and clinical manifestations of RSV\u2010A were similar to those of RSV\u2010B.

This devastating viral infection has stimulated the urgent development of viable vaccine against COVID-19 across the research institutes around the globe. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also confirmed that the recent pandemic is causing Public Health Emergency of International apprehension. Moreover, the earlier two pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and many others yet to be identified pose a universal menace. Here, in this piece of work, we have utilized an in silico structural biology and advanced immunoinformatic strategies to devise a multi-epitope subunit vaccine against ongoing COVID-19 infection. The engineered vaccine sequence is adjuvanted with \u00DF-3 defensin and comprised of B-cell epitopes, HTL epitopes and CTL epitopes. This is very likely that the vaccine will be able to elicit the strong immune response. Further, specific binding of the engineered vaccine and immune cell receptor TLR3 was estimated by molecular interaction studies. Strong interaction in the binding groove as well as good docking scores affirmed the stringency of engineered vaccine. The interaction is stable with minimal deviation in root-mean square deviation and root-mean-square fluctuation was confirmed by the molecular dynamics simulation experiment. The immune-simulation by C-ImmSim server, which mimics the natural immune environment, yielded more potent immune response data of B-cells, Th cells, Tc cells and IgG for vaccine. The encouraging data obtained from the various in-silico works indicated this vaccine as an effective therapeutic against COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ojha, Rupal; Gupta, Nidhi; Naik, Biswajit; Singh, Satyendra; Verma, Vijay Kumar; Prusty, Dhaneswar; Prajapati, Vijay Kumar","journal":"European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/feb187c73b33d8dc25b4cb33724e98c7906bfeb7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32417398/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejps.2020.105375; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928098720301640?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0928098720301640","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","CTL"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["stringency of engineered vaccine","engineered vaccine sequence","immune-simulation","ongoing COVID","strong immune response","multi-epitope subunit vaccine","urgent development of viable vaccine","Strong interaction","potent immune response data of B","B-cell epitopes","natural immune environment","ongoing enigmatic COVID","immune cell receptor TLR3","Th cells","Tc cells","root","HTL epitopes","CTL epitopes","square deviation","molecular interaction studies","minimal deviation","binding groove","square fluctuation","MERS-CoV","molecular dynamics simulation experiment","specific binding","encouraging data","silico structural biology","pathogenic SARS-CoV","devastating viral infection","World Health Organization","Public Health Emergency of International apprehension","advanced immunoinformatic strategies","good docking scores","IgG","C-ImmSim server","recent pandemic","outbreak","day","hundreds of thousands human souls","Wuhan","research institutes","defensin","countries","territories","areas","China","globe","universal menace","piece of work","year"],"language":"en"},

Combining these procedures allows one to determine the optimal sampling locations for the best possible coverage of the area to be monitored. A hypothetical episode concerned with terrorists\u2019 attack during music concert in the central square of Novosibirsk, Russia was considered to evaluate possible coverage of the area by sampling equipment to detect bioaerosols at various locations within the square.

The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are very similar to other respiratory viruses. The number of laboratory-confirmed cases and associated deaths are increasing regularly in various parts of the World. Seven coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS, MERS and, COVID-19) can naturally infect human beings. Out of these four (229E-CoV, NL63-CoV, OC43-CoV, HKU1-CoV) are responsible for mild upper respiratory infections, while SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and COVID-19 are well known for their high mortality. Few mild strains of coronaviruses are circulating in India but there is no evidence of SARS and MERS outbreaks. The COVID-19 is an emerging viral infection responsible for pandemics. Fortunately, the mortality of COVID-19 is low as compared with SARS and MERS, the majority of its cases are recovered. The death toll of COVID-19 is high even after its low mortality because COVID-19 causes a pandemic while SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cause epidemics only. COVID-19 influenced the large segments of the world population, which led to a public health emergency of international concern, putting all health organizations on high alert. COVID-19 is the first coronavirus after Spanish Flu 1918\u20131919, who has extremely influenced the health system, economy, and psychology of India.

However, it is at present largely unclear to what extent these proteases are expressed in viral target cells in human tissues. Here, we show that both HAT and TMPRSS2 are coexpressed with 2,6-linked sialic acids, the major receptor determinant of human influenza viruses, throughout the human respiratory tract. Similarly, coexpression of ACE2, the SARS-coronavirus receptor, and TMPRSS2 was frequently found in the upper and lower aerodigestive tract, with the exception of the vocal folds, epiglottis and trachea. Finally, activation of influenza virus was conserved between human, avian and porcine TMPRSS2, suggesting that this protease might activate influenza virus in reservoir-, intermediate- and human hosts. In sum, our results show that TMPRSS2 and HAT are expressed by important influenza and SARS-coronavirus target cells and could thus support viral spread in the human host.","publish_time":"2012-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bertram, Stephanie; Heurich, Adeline; Lavender, Hayley; Gierer, Stefanie; Danisch, Simon; Perin, Paula; Lucas, Jared M.; Nelson, Peter S.; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan; Soilleux, Elizabeth J.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba3522d00ecebd159c5b5dc90119df8642993c49.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3340400.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22558251/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0035876","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HAT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["important influenza","human tissues","porcine TMPRSS2","human hosts","human respiratory tract","HAT","major receptor determinant of human influenza viruses","SARS-coronavirus receptor","activation of influenza virus","viral spread","SARS-coronavirus target cells","transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSS2","viral target cells","important role","infected host","lower aerodigestive tract","exception","pathogenesis","reservoir","cell culture","vocal folds","epiglottis","sialic acids","extent","type","trachea","coexpression of ACE2","results","present","sum"],"language":"en"},

The main focus of this paper is two-fold: (a) generating short term (real-time) forecasts of the future COVID-19 cases for multiple countries; (b) risk assessment (in terms of case fatality rate) of the novel COVID-19 for some profoundly affected countries by finding various important demographic characteristics of the countries along with some disease characteristics. To solve the first problem, we presented a hybrid approach based on autoregressive integrated moving average model and Wavelet-based forecasting model that can generate short-term (ten days ahead) forecasts of the number of daily confirmed cases for Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the UK. The predictions of the future outbreak for different countries will be useful for the effective allocation of health care resources and will act as an early-warning system for government policymakers. In the second problem, we applied an optimal regression tree algorithm to find essential causal variables that significantly affect the case fatality rates for different countries.

Based on information obtained from Italian surgeons in Milan and given concerns regarding rising case numbers in Washington state, we implemented new vascular surgery guidelines, which canceled all non-emergent surgical procedures and involved significant changes to our inpatient and outpatient workflow. The consequences of these decisions are not yet understood. METHODS: The division of vascular surgery at Harborview Medical Center immediately instituted new vascular surgery COVID-19 practice guidelines on March 17, 2020. Subsequent clinic, operative, and consult volume was collected over the next 4 weeks and compared to historical averages. Washington state case/death numbers and UW Medicine hospital case volumes were collected from publicly available sources. RESULTS: Since March 10, 2020, the number of confirmed positive COVID-19 cases within the UW Medicine system has increased 1867%, with floor and intensive care unit bed utilization increasing by 120% and 215%, respectively. After instituting our new COVID-19 guidelines, our average weekly clinical volume decreased by 96.5% (43.1 patients to 1.5 per week), our average weekly surgical volume decreased by 71.7% (from 15 cases to 4.25 per week), and our inpatient consultation volume decreased to 1.81 consults per day. 60% of consultations were completed as telemedicine \u201Ce-consults\u201D in which the patient was never evaluated in-person. Trainee surgical volume has also decreased by 86.4% for the vascular surgery fellow and 84.8% for the integrated resident. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed every aspect of \u201Cnormal\u201D vascular surgical practice in a large academic institution. New practice guidelines effectively reduced operating room utilization and decreased staff and trainee exposure to potential infection, with changes to clinic volume not resulting in an immediate rise in emergency department/inpatient consultations or acute surgical emergencies.

With the emergence of the international outbreak of the coronavirus infection (COVID-19), a UK national approach to containment has been established to test people suspected of exposure to COVID-19. At the same time and separately, the RCGP RSC\u2019s surveillance has been extended to monitor the temporal and geographical distribution of COVID-19 infection in the community as well as assess the effectiveness of the containment strategy. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study are to surveil COVID-19 in both asymptomatic populations and ambulatory cases with respiratory infections, ascertain both the rate and pattern of COVID-19 spread, and assess the effectiveness of the containment policy. METHODS: The RCGP RSC, a network of over 500 general practices in England, extract pseudonymized data weekly. This extended surveillance comprises of five components: (1) Recording in medical records of anyone suspected to have or who has been exposed to COVID-19. Computerized medical records suppliers have within a week of request created new codes to support this. (2) Extension of current virological surveillance and testing people with influenza-like illness or lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI)\u2014with the caveat that people suspected to have or who have been exposed to COVID-19 should be referred to the national containment pathway and not seen in primary care. (3) Serology sample collection across all age groups. This will be an extra blood sample taken from people who are attending their general practice for a scheduled blood test. The 100 general practices currently undertaking annual influenza virology surveillance will be involved in the extended virological and serological surveillance. (4) Collecting convalescent serum samples. (5) Data curation. We have the opportunity to escalate the data extraction to twice weekly if needed. Swabs and sera will be analyzed in PHE reference laboratories. RESULTS: General practice clinical system providers have introduced an emergency new set of clinical codes to support COVID-19 surveillance. Additionally, practices participating in current virology surveillance are now taking samples for COVID-19 surveillance from low-risk patients presenting with LRTIs. Within the first 2 weeks of setup of this surveillance, we have identified 3 cases: 1 through the new coding system, the other 2 through the extended virology sampling. CONCLUSIONS: We have rapidly converted the established national RCGP RSC influenza surveillance system into one that can test the effectiveness of the COVID-19 containment policy. The extended surveillance has already seen the use of new codes with 3 cases reported. Rapid sharing of this protocol should enable scientific critique and shared learning.

Here we used this method to monitor the spatial and temporal progression of mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) infection in mice using luciferase\u2010expressing viruses. Upon intranasal inoculation, virus replication could initially be observed in the nasal cavity and the cervical lymph nodes, after which the infection spread to the brain and frequently to the eyes. The kinetics of virus spread to and clearance from the brain appeared to depend on the inoculation dose. After intraperitoneal inoculation, virus replication was predominantly observed in the liver and occasionally in the intestines, but interestingly also in the tail and paws. BLI thus elucidated new anatomic locations of virus replication. Furthermore, MHV dissemination was shown to be critically depended on the viral spike protein, but also on the mouse strain used. Widespread dissemination was observed in mice lacking a functional type I interferon response. The importance of the type I interferon system in limiting viral spread was also demonstrated by the administration of type I interferons to mice. Our results provide new insights in coronavirus pathogenesis and demonstrate the potential of BLI to study coronavirus\u2013host interactions in vivo.","publish_time":"2009-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Raaben, Matthijs; Prins, Henk\u2010Jan; Martens, Anton C.; Rottier, Peter J.

Study design Analysis of Prospective surveillance data for Beijing collected during the outbreak. Methods Surveillance data were reclassified according to World Health Organization criteria. Cases previously excluded without date of onset of illness were included in the epidemic curve from estimates using the average time between date of onset and date of hospitalization for cases with both dates. Cases who failed to give a contact history were now included; 7% ( n = 5 ) of cases during the import phase and 61% ( n = 365 ) during the peak phase. Previously excluded cases were included for plotting on an epidemic curve, and basic spot mapping for distribution of cases was used from attack rates recalculated for age, gender, occupation, residential location, date of onset of illness and demographics. Results The spot map effectively illustrated clusters by residency, with the inner-city sustaining the highest attack rate (33.42 per 100,000), followed by an easterly distribution 5\u201330km away (21.62 per 10,000), and lowest in districts 60\u2013160km away (9.21 per 100,000). The new epidemic curve shows the outbreak commencing 10 days earlier than initially reported, with a three-fold greater increase in cases during the escalation phase than previously estimated. Conclusion In hindsight, the investigation of the Beijing SARS would have benefited from the use of spot maping as an essential outbreak tool for early identification of specific geographical area(s) for quarantining. If a spot map of incidence density rates was used during the early phase of the outbreak, the inner city might have been identified as a major risk factor requiring rapid quarantining. Contact history became uncommon as the outbreak progressed, suggesting that hospitals were over-burdened or pathogenesis and environment risk factors changed, strengthening the usefulness of early spot mapping and the need to modify risk factors included as contact history as the epidemic progresses.","publish_time":"2007-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liang, W.; McLaws, M.-L.; Liu, M.; Mi, J.; Chan, D.K.Y.","journal":"Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/85ea42a51940dccec33a419fb7a3922f811fa263.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111616.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350607000819; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350607000819","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsyODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["distribution of cases","excluded cases","date of onset","early phase","basic spot mapping","new epidemic curve","epidemic progresses","contact history","usefulness of early spot mapping","date of hospitalization","Beijing SARS","escalation phase","import phase","peak phase","essential outbreak tool","use of spot maping","spot map of incidence density rates","environment risk factors","attack rates","illness","major risk factor","Methods Surveillance data","Study design Analysis of Prospective surveillance data","original analysis","rapid quarantining","easterly distribution","early identification of specific geographical area","basic epidemiological principles","highest attack rate","severe acute respiratory syndrome","gender","pathogenesis","residential location","average time","inner-city sustaining","occupation","residency","estimates","need","hospitals","investigation","clusters","World Health Organization criteria","plotting","Summary Objective","greater increase","hindsight","demographics","inner city","Conclusion","dates","days","districts"],"language":"en"},

The causative agent of the diarrhea was ultimately identified as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). In this study, we isolated a PEDV strain designated CHGD-01 from piglet intestines using Vero cell cultures, and its specific cytopathic effects were confirmed in susceptible cells by direct immunofluorescence testing and electron microscopy. The complete genome of CHGD-01 was shown to be 28,035 nucleotides in length, with a similar structure to that of PEDV reference strains. Phylogenetic analyses based on the whole genome revealed that CHGD-01 shared nucleotide sequence identities of 98.2\u201398.4% with two other Chinese isolates reported in the same year, thus constituting a new cluster. Amino acid sequence analysis based on individual virus genes indicated a close relationship between the spike protein gene of CHGD-01 and the field strain KNU0802 in Korea. Its ORF3 and nucleoprotein genes, however, were divergent from all other sequenced PEDV isolate clusters and therefore formed a new group, suggesting a new variant PEDV isolate in China.

METHODS: Hematopoietic cell transplant candidates and recipients with respiratory symptoms and LRT and URT RV testing via multiplex PCR from 2009 to 2016 were included. Logistic regression models were used to analyze risk factors for LRT RV detection. RESULTS: Two-hundred thirty-five HCT candidates or recipients had URT and LRT RV testing within 3 days. Among 115 subjects (49%) positive for a RV, 37% (42 of 115) had discordant sample pairs. Forty percent (17 of 42) of discordant pairs were positive in the LRT but negative in the URT. Discordance was common for adenovirus (100%), metapneumovirus (44%), rhinovirus (34%), and parainfluenza virus type 3 (28%); respiratory syncytial virus was highly concordant (92%).

In this study, we have developed a framework for automatic online news monitoring and classification for syndromic surveillance. The framework is unique and none of the techniques adopted in this study have been previously used in the context of syndromic surveillance on infectious diseases. In recent classification experiments, we compared the performance of different feature subsets on different machine learning algorithms. The results showed that the combined feature subsets including Bag of Words, Noun Phrases, and Named Entities features outperformed the Bag of Words feature subsets. Furthermore, feature selection improved the performance of feature subsets in online news classification. The highest classification performance was achieved when using SVM upon the selected combination feature subset.","publish_time":"2009-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Yulei; Dang, Yan; Chen, Hsinchun; Thurmond, Mark; Larson, Cathy","journal":"Decision Support Systems","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4050db34f3e0a504796a594abfdfca470082152b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114309.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167923609001109; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2009.04.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287567/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923609001109","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjszMzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["performance of feature subsets","online news classification","performance of different feature subsets","combined feature subsets","feature selection","context of syndromic surveillance","Abstract Syndromic surveillance","highest classification performance","accurate news classification system","online news sources","automatic online news monitoring","infectious diseases","recent classification experiments","Infectious disease outbreaks","selected combination feature subset","Bag of Words","major outbreaks","framework","study","public\u0027s health","public health personnel","different machine learning algorithms","SVM","important role","devastating effect","Noun Phrases","Entities","economy","global awareness","society","potential outbreak situations","results","techniques"],"language":"en"},

This paper describes examples of some of the viruses that have been detected in wildlife, and the reservoir hosts from which they have been detected. It also briefly explores the spread of arthropod-borne viruses and their diseases through the movement and establishment of vectors in new habitats.","publish_time":"2013-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mackenzie, John S; Jeggo, Martyn","journal":"Curr Opin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/385c0bda308f39357969e007d91adacc44f6d14e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102734.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625713000205; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23491947/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2013.02.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1879625713000205","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjszMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reservoir hosts of zoonotic viruses","animal hosts","natural hosts","wildlife species","enormous number of viruses","instances","cross-species transmission","knowledge","movement","establishment of vectors","rare cases","diseases","incidence","pathogenicity","types of virus","new habitats","birds","human infection","reservoirs","potential","spread of arthropod","mammals","Studies","examples","specific niches","paper","humans"],"language":"en"},

The origin of the exacerbated cytokine response is unclear. As observed previously, uncontrolled influenza virus replication could strongly influence cytokine production. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between host cytokine responses and viral levels in pandemic influenza critically ill patients. METHODS: Twenty three patients admitted to the ICU with primary viral pneumonia were included in this study. A quantitative PCR based method targeting the M1 influenza gene was developed to quantify pharyngeal viral load. In addition, by using a multiplex based assay, we systematically evaluated host cytokine responses to the viral infection at admission to the ICU. Correlation studies between cytokine levels and viral load were done by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Fifteen patients needed of intubation and ventilation, while eight did not need of mechanical ventilation during ICU hospitalization. Viral load in pharyngeal swabs was 300 fold higher in the group of patients with the worst respiratory condition at admission to the ICU. Pharyngeal viral load directly correlated with plasma levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-12p70, IFN-\u03B3, the chemotactic factors MIP-1\u03B2, GM-CSF, the angiogenic mediator VEGF and also of the immuno-modulatory cytokine IL-1ra (p \u003C 0.05). Correlation studies demonstrated also the existence of a significant positive association between the levels of these mediators, evidencing that they are simultaneously regulated in response to the virus. CONCLUSIONS: Severe respiratory disease caused by the 2009 pandemic influenza virus is characterized by the existence of a direct association between viral replication and host cytokine response, revealing a potential pathogenic link with the severe disease caused by other influenza subtypes such as H5N1.","publish_time":"2011-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Almansa, Raquel; Anton, Andres; Ramirez, Paula; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Banner, David; Pumarola, Tom\u00E1s; Xu, Luoling; Blanco, Jes\u00FAs; Ran, Longsi; Lopez-Campos, Guillermo; Martin-Sanchez, Fernando; Socias, Lorenzo; Loza, Ana; Andaluz, David; Maravi, Enrique; Gord\u00F3n, M\u00F3nica; Gallegos, Maria C; Fernandez, Victoria; Le\u00F3n, Cristobal; Merino, Pedro; Marcos, Maria \u00C1ngeles; Gand\u00EDa, Francisco; Bobillo, Felipe; Resino, Salvador; Eiros, Jose M\u00AA; Castro, Carmen; Mateo, Paula; Gonzalez-Rivera, Milagros; Rello, Jordi; de Lejarazu, Raul Ortiz; Kelvin, David J; Bermejo-Martin, Jesus F","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28b906cb5b5dd66df68bdd155ccc2ab514180c2a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3175217.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21880131/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-11-232","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjszNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","VEGF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral levels","cytokine levels","viral replication","pharyngeal viral load","viral infection","cytokine production","pandemic influenza virus","exacerbated cytokine response","influenza subtypes","primary viral pneumonia","evaluated host cytokine responses","immuno-modulatory cytokine IL","Severe disease","uncontrolled influenza virus replication","Severe respiratory disease","M1 influenza gene","plasma levels","group of patients","ill patients","ICU hospitalization","Correlation studies","IL-12p70","existence","pharyngeal swabs","admission","Spearman correlation coefficient","pro-inflammatory cytokines IL","direct association","present study","mechanical ventilation","worst respiratory condition","significant positive association","potential pathogenic link","relationship","GM-CSF","IFN-\u03B3","chemotactic factors MIP","fold higher","angiogenic mediator VEGF","assay","quantitative PCR","multiplex","intubation","mediators","H1N1virus","origin","CONCLUSIONS","objective","RESULTS","evidencing","H5N1","BACKGROUND","presence of hypercytokinemia","addition","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Three doses of ORFV-PEDV-S were given to two groups of PEDV-negative pregnant gilts, with the last dose being administered two weeks prior to farrowing. One of the two groups immunized with the ORFV-PEDV-S recombinant virus was also exposed to live PEDV orally on day 31 post-immunization (pi). Antibody responses were assessed in serum, colostrum and milk of immunized gilts, and passive transfer of antibodies was evaluated in piglet sera. The protective efficacy of ORFV-PEDV-S was evaluated after challenge of the piglets with PEDV. PEDV-specific IgG, IgA and neutralizing antibody (NA) responses were detected in ORFV-PEDV-S-immunized and ORFV-PEDV-S-immunized/PEDV-exposed gilts. PEDV NA, IgG and IgA were detected in the serum of piglets born to immunized gilts, demonstrating the transfer of antibodies through colostrum and milk. Piglets born to immunized gilts showed reduced morbidity and a marked reduction in mortality after PEDV challenge in comparison to control piglets. Piglets born to gilts that received ORFV-PEDV-S and were exposed to live PEDV showed stronger NA responses and lower clinical scores when compared to piglets born to gilts immunized with ORFV-PEDV-S alone.

Methods Since the traditional SEIR model does not evaluate the effectiveness of control strategies, a novel model in line with the current epidemics process and control measures was proposed, utilizing multisource datasets including cumulative number of reported, death, quarantined and suspected cases. Results Results show that the trend of the epidemics mainly depends on quarantined and suspected cases. The predicted cumulative numbers of quarantined and suspected cases nearly reached static states and their inflection points have already been achieved, with the epidemics peak coming soon. The estimated effective reproduction numbers using model-free and model-based methods are decreasing, as well as new infections, while new reported cases are increasing.

Temporary migrant workers have been labeled as the major driving force for the rising incidence of infectious diseases in cities. However, it has not been well recognized that temporary migration indeed may have tremendous impacts on the spread of infectious diseases in migrants\u0027 home villages. In this paper, by proposing a delay differential equation model, we provide a framework to study the influence of temporary migration on the transmission of infectious diseases in a migrant workers\u0027 home village. The model is shown to admit a unique positive equilibrium which is locally asymptotically stable and is globally asymptotically stable under certain conditions. This implies that the disease always persists at a constant level. Considering tuberculosis as an example, we explore various disease prevention and control strategies numerically to demonstrate how migration related parameters affect the early outbreak of the disease. We find that a single control strategy, such as reducing the migration time period alone, has little effect on reducing the disease endemic level. For disease prevention and control, temporary migrant workers should be identified as the top target group, and a combination of several prevention strategies should be implemented.","publish_time":"2012-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Lin; Wang, Xiao","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c97cafde895feed09acab6a38542aae0838cae7d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094136.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22266046/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.01.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519312000057; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519312000057","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjszNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["influence of temporary migration","number of temporary migrant workers","various disease prevention","disease endemic level","prevention strategies","control strategies","spread of infectious diseases","transmission of infectious diseases","rising incidence of infectious diseases","migration related parameters","migrant workers\u0027 home village","migration time period","single control strategy","urban areas","rural areas","early outbreak","constant level","migrants\u0027 home villages","delay differential equation model","emerging market economies","little effect","tremendous impacts","China","major driving force","combination","framework","cities","example","unique positive equilibrium","target group","paper","certain conditions","tuberculosis"],"language":"en"},

The recent emergence of strains resistant to all current drugs urges the development of compounds with new mechanisms of action. G-quadruplexes are nucleic acids secondary structures that may form in G-rich regions to epigenetically regulate cellular functions. Here we implemented a computational tool to scan the presence of putative G-quadruplex forming sequences in the genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and analyse their association to transcription start sites. We found that the most stable G-quadruplexes were in the promoter region of genes belonging to definite functional categories. Actual G-quadruplex folding of four selected sequences was assessed by biophysical and biomolecular techniques: all molecules formed stable G-quadruplexes, which were further stabilized by two G-quadruplex ligands. These compounds inhibited Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth with minimal inhibitory concentrations in the low micromolar range. These data support formation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis G-quadruplexes in vivo and their potential regulation of gene transcription, and prompt the use of G4 ligands to develop original antitubercular agents.","publish_time":"2017-07-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perrone, Rosalba; Lavezzo, Enrico; Riello, Erika; Manganelli, Riccardo; Pal\u00F9, Giorgio; Toppo, Stefano; Provvedi, Roberta; Richter, Sara N.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/83f6440ed5fdcf297d2728df93830c842076c33c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5515968.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28720801/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-05867-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjszOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stable G-quadruplexes","G-quadruplex ligands","Actual G-quadruplex","data support formation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis G-quadruplexes","Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth","genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis","G-rich regions","presence of putative G-quadruplex","causative agent of tuberculosis","development of compounds","selected sequences","use of G4 ligands","potential regulation of gene transcription","minimal inhibitory concentrations","molecules","current drugs","nucleic acids secondary structures","promoter region of genes","biomolecular techniques","low micromolar range","original antitubercular agents","recent emergence of strains resistant","definite functional categories","association","new mechanisms of action","cellular functions","TB","computational tool","sites","causes of death"],"language":"en"},

This process requires the specific recognition of RNA cis-acting signals located at the ends of the viral genome. To identify cellular proteins involved in coronavirus RNA synthesis, transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) genome ends, harboring essential cis-acting signals for replication, were used as baits for RNA affinity protein purification. Ten proteins were preferentially pulled down with either the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 ends of the genome and identified by proteomic analysis. Nine of them, including members of the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein family of proteins (hnRNPs), the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), the p100 transcriptional co-activator protein and two aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, showed a preferential binding to the 3\u2032 end of the genome, whereas only the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) was preferentially pulled down with the 5\u2032 end of the genome. The potential function of the 3\u2032 end-interacting proteins in virus replication was studied by analyzing the effect of their silencing using a TGEV-derived replicon and the infectious virus. Gene silencing of PABP, hnRNP Q, and glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS) caused a significant 2 to 3-fold reduction of viral RNA synthesis. Interestingly, the silencing of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), initially used as a control gene, caused a 2 to 3-fold increase in viral RNA synthesis in both systems. These data suggest that PABP, hnRNP Q, and EPRS play a positive role in virus infection that could be mediated through their interaction with the viral 3\u2032 end, and that GAPDH has a negative effect on viral infection.","publish_time":"2009-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gal\u00E1n, Carmen; Sola, Isabel; Nogales, Aitor; Thomas, Benjamin; Akoulitchev, Alexandre; Enjuanes, Luis; Almaz\u00E1n, Fernando","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a40ffc155e4d5c385e7a1fe04010a9b5469c7753.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118768.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19580983/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2009.06.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682209003493; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682209003493","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs0NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Gene"],"organizations":["PABP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral genome","genome ends","fold reduction of viral RNA synthesis","Abstract Coronavirus RNA synthesis","viral infection","RNA affinity protein purification","cellular proteins","Gene silencing of PABP","virus replication","virus infection","specific recognition of RNA cis-acting signals","polypyrimidine tract-binding protein","hnRNP Q","EPRS","silencing of glyceraldehyde","preferential binding","infectious virus","GAPDH","essential cis-acting signals","heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein family of proteins","transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus","p100 transcriptional co-activator protein","fold increase","cellular factors","negative effect","control gene","TGEV-derived replicon","aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases","glutamyl-prolyl","hnRNPs","multienzymatic replicase complex","baits","positive role","phosphate dehydrogenase","PTB","members","process","data","systems","potential function","proteomic analysis","interaction"],"language":"en"},

Most previous vaccination attempts against FIPV were unsuccessful because IgG antibodies against the surface protein enhance the infection. However, two studies have shown that poxvirus vectors (vaccinia WR and canarypox) expressing only the FIPV membrane (M) protein can elicit a partially protective immunity which is supposed to be cell-mediated (Virology 181 (1991) 327; International patent WO 97/20054 (1997)). In our study, we report the construction of another poxvirus, the modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), as an expression vector for the FIPV M protein. In this vector, the M gene has been inserted downstream a strong early/late promoter, whereas the two previously described poxviruses expressed the M protein during their early stage only. The immunogenicity of the recombinant MVA-M was evaluated in the murine model which revealed an effect of the vector on the Th1/Th2 balance. The vaccine was then tested in cats to evaluate its efficacy in an FIPV 79-1146 challenge. Vaccinated kittens developed FIPV-specific antibodies after immunization, however, none of them was protected against FIPV. Our results suggest a crucial role for the type of poxviral promoter that must be used to induce an effective immune response against FIPV.","publish_time":"2004-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hebben, Matthias; Duquesne, V\u00E9ronique; Cronier, Jo\u00EBlle; Rossi, Bernard; Aubert, Andr\u00E9","journal":"Journal of Feline Medicine \u0026 Surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ba0c95a0fd9545009ff870fa5e317b5c1ad725b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128240.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098612X04000245; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098612X04000245","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIPV","FIPV M"],"locations":["Ankara"],"keyphrases":["FIPV membrane","FIPV-specific antibodies","surface protein","expression vector","inappropriate immune response","effective immune response","IgG antibodies","modified vaccinia virus Ankara","poxvirus vectors","vaccinia WR","recombinant MVA","late promoter","early stage","type of poxviral promoter","Abstract Feline infectious peritonitis virus","canarypox","fatal systemic disease","coronavirus","crucial role","previous vaccination attempts","Th1","Vaccinated kittens","construction","Th2 balance","immunization","protective immunity","described poxviruses","cats","International patent WO","cell","murine model","results","immunogenicity","studies","gene","infection","efficacy","vaccine","Virology","study","challenge"],"language":"en"},

Although the virus neutralization test is the gold standard assay for MERS diagnosis and for investigating the zoonotic reservoir, it uses live virus and so must be performed in high containment laboratories. Competitive ELISA (cELISA), in which a labeled monoclonal antibody (MAb) competes with test serum antibodies for target epitopes, may be a suitable alternative because it detects antibodies in a species-independent manner. In this study, novel MAbs against the spike protein of MERS-CoV were produced and characterized. One of these MAbs was used to develop a cELISA. The cELISA detected MERS-CoV-specific antibodies in sera from MERS-CoV-infected rats and rabbits immunized with the spike protein of MERS-CoV. The MAb-based cELISA was validated using sera from Ethiopian dromedary camels. Relative to the neutralization test, the cELISA detected MERS-CoV-specific antibodies in 66 Ethiopian dromedary camels with a sensitivity and specificity of 98% and 100%, respectively. The cELISA and neutralization test results correlated well (Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients=0.71\u20130.76, depending on the cELISA serum dilution).

Its activity can be suppressed by the UL49.5 protein produced by bovine herpesvirus 1, although the mechanism of this inhibition has not been understood so far. Therefore, the main goal of our study was to investigate the 3D structure of bovine herpesvirus 1 - encoded UL49.5 protein. The final structure of the inhibitor was established using circular dichroism (CD), 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and molecular dynamics (MD) in membrane mimetic environments. In NMR studies, UL49.5 was represented by two fragments: the extracellular region (residues 1\u201335) and the transmembrane-intracellular fragment (residues 36\u201375), displaying various functions during viral invasion. After the empirical structure determination, a molecular docking procedure was used to predict the complex of UL49.5 with the TAP heterodimer. Our results revealed that UL49.5 adopted a highly flexible membrane-proximal helical structure in the extracellular part. In the transmembrane region, we observed two short \u03B1-helices. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic part had an unordered structure. Finally, we propose three different orientations of UL49.5 in the complex with TAP.

The effectiveness of applying these techniques varies widely, and pollutant removal efficiency is usually determined in controlled laboratory environments which may not be realized in practice. Some air cleaners are largely ineffective, and some produce harmful by-products. To summarize what is known regarding the effectiveness of fan-driven air cleaning technologies, a state-of-the-art review of the scientific literature was undertaken by a multidisciplinary panel of experts from Europe, North America, and Asia with expertise in air cleaning, aerosol science, medicine, chemistry and ventilation. The effects on health were not examined. Over 26,000 articles were identified in major literature databases; 400 were selected as being relevant based on their titles and abstracts by the first two authors, who further reduced the number of articles to 160 based on the full texts. These articles were reviewed by the panel using predefined inclusion criteria during their first meeting. Additions were also made by the panel. Of these, 133 articles were finally selected for detailed review. Each article was assessed independently by two members of the panel and then judged by the entire panel during a consensus meeting. During this process 59 articles were deemed conclusive and their results were used for final reporting at their second meeting. The conclusions are that: (1) None of the reviewed technologies was able to effectively remove all indoor pollutants and many were found to generate undesirable by-products during operation. (2) Particle filtration and sorption of gaseous pollutants were among the most effective air cleaning technologies, but there is insufficient information regarding long-term performance and proper maintenance. (3) The existing data make it difficult to extract information such as Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR), which represents a common benchmark for comparing the performance of different air cleaning technologies. (4) To compare and select suitable indoor air cleaning devices, a labeling system accounting for characteristics such as CADR, energy consumption, volume, harmful by-products, and life span is necessary. For that purpose, a standard test room and condition should be built and studied. (5) Although there is evidence that some air cleaning technologies improve indoor air quality, further research is needed before any of them can be confidently recommended for use in indoor environments.","publish_time":"2011-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Yinping; Mo, Jinhan; Li, Yuguo; Sundell, Jan; Wargocki, Pawel; Zhang, Jensen; Little, John C.; Corsi, Richard; Deng, Qihong; Leung, Michael H.K.; Fang, Lei; Chen, Wenhao; Li, Jinguang; Sun, Yuexia","journal":"Atmos Environ (1994)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e47402fcd7e6c22a95beeaa06f1f7e94cb7a4e42.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185562.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231011005346; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362761/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1352231011005346; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2011.05.041","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs2NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CADR"],"locations":["Europe","North America","Asia"],"keyphrases":["Air cleaning techniques","driven air cleaning technologies","effective air cleaning technologies","air cleaners","indoor air quality","performance of different air cleaning technologies","suitable indoor air cleaning devices","Clean Air Delivery Rate","indoor pollutants","reviewed technologies","indoor environments","entire panel","number of articles","multidisciplinary panel of experts","CADR","consensus meeting","produce harmful by-products","undesirable by-products","insufficient information","state-of-the-art review","scientific literature","detailed review","effectiveness of fan","sorption of gaseous pollutants","major literature databases","controlled laboratory environments","expertise","labeling system accounting","aerosol science","characteristics","Europe","medicine","Asia","North America","volume","energy consumption","standard test room","chemistry","abstracts","Particle filtration","results","predefined inclusion criteria","pollutant removal efficiency","life span","proper maintenance","purpose","condition","ventilation","titles","final reporting","common benchmark","goal","research","evidence","existing data","authors","operation","members","process","use","effects","health","Additions","practice","texts","conclusions"],"language":"en"},

While its clinical manifestations have been extensively studied, its pathogenesis is not yet fully understood. A limited number of autopsy studies have revealed that the lungs and the immune system are the organs that sustain the most severe damage. Other organs affected include the kidneys, brain, digestive tract, heart, liver, thyroid gland and urogenital tract. The primary target cells are pneumocytes and enterocytes, both cell types abundantly expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 which is the main SARS-CoV receptor. Other cell types infected include the epithelial cells of renal tubules, cerebral neurons, and immune cells. The pathology of this disease results from both direct and indirect injury. Direct injury is caused by infection of the target cells by the virus. Indirect injury mainly results from immune responses, circulatory dysfunction, and hypoxia. In this review, we summarize the major pathological findings at the gross, cellular and molecular levels and discuss the various possible mechanisms that may contribute to the pathogenesis of SARS. The implications of the proposed pathogenesis for prevention, diagnosis and therapy of the disease are discussed.","publish_time":"2008-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Yong; Korteweg, Christine; McNutt, Michael A.; Gu, Jiang","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d04109a96e0e83707af8ee9d4fef609666141066.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114157.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170207002663; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170207002663","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs2NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune cells","pathogenesis of SARS","disease results","indirect injury","acute respiratory disease","primary target cells","immune responses","immune system","cell types","organs","proposed pathogenesis","epithelial cells of renal tubules","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome","digestive tract","urogenital tract","main SARS-CoV receptor","severe damage","liver","cerebral neurons","gross","heart","pneumocytes","enterocytes","molecular levels","thyroid gland","prevention","brain","diagnosis","significant morbidity","major pathological findings","various possible mechanisms","lungs","circulatory dysfunction","kidneys","enzyme","mortality","therapy","infection","limited number of autopsy studies","hypoxia","implications","angiotensin","review","pathology"],"language":"en"},

Here, we show that similar to yeast, human IRE1\u03B1\u2019s ER-lumenal domain (hIRE1\u03B1 LD) binds peptides with a characteristic amino acid bias. Peptides and unfolded proteins bind to hIRE1\u03B1 LD\u2019s MHC-like groove and induce allosteric changes that lead to its oligomerization. Mutation of a hydrophobic patch at the oligomerization interface decoupled peptide binding to hIRE1\u03B1 LD from its oligomerization, yet retained peptide-induced allosteric coupling within the domain. Importantly, impairing oligomerization of hIRE1\u03B1 LD abolished IRE1\u2019s activity in living cells.

Viral RNA quantification was performed at 7 sampling days post-laboratory inoculation (d 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 42) and infectivity was assessed via bioassay with 10-d-old pigs. There was a tendency for treatment \u00D7 feed matrix \u00D7 day interaction (P = 0.094), in which the cycle threshold (Ct) value increased over time in FEED when treated with both feed additives, whereas there was no increase over time observed in SDPP treated with both feed additives. There was a feed matrix \u00D7 day interaction (P \u003C 0.001) in which Ct increased over time in FEED, whereas very little increase over time was observed in SDPP. A tendency for a treatment \u00D7 feed matrix effect (P = 0.085) was observed where FEED treated with the combination of EO and BA had a greater (P \u003C 0.05) PEDV Ct value than other FEED treatments, and all SDPP treatments had the lower PEDV Ct values compared to FEED treatments (P \u003C 0.05). Overall, the combination of both feed additives was most effective at reducing the quantity of genetic material as detected by qRT-PCR (P \u003C 0.001) compared to either additive alone or no feed additive. Virus shedding was observed in the d 7 postinoculation SDPP treatment that was treated with both feed additives, as well as d 0 untreated FEED and d 0 FEED treated with both feed additives. No other treatment bioassay room had detectible RNA shed and detected in fecal swabs or cecal contents. In summary, the combination of EO and BA enhanced the degradation of PEDV RNA in feed but had little impact on RNA degradation in SDPP. Both untreated feed and feed treated with the combination of EO and BA resulted in infection at d 0 post-laboratory inoculation; however, neither set of samples was infective at d 1 postinoculation. In addition, SDPP harbored greater levels of quantifiable RNA for a longer duration of time compared to FEED, and these viral particles remained viable for a longer duration of time indicating differences in viral stability exist between different feed matrices.","publish_time":"2018-08-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gebhardt, Jordan T; Woodworth, Jason C; Jones, Cassandra K; Tokach, Mike D; Gauger, Philip C; Main, Rodger G; Zhang, Jianqiang; Chen, Qi; DeRouchey, Joel M; Goodband, Robert D; Stark, Charles R; Bergstrom, Jon R; Bai, Jianfa; Dritz, Steve S","journal":"Transl Anim Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cac5cab0acc600d9346ead6e63b17f06e681fe6d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107256.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/tas/txy100; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289110/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DSM Nutritional Products Inc.","EO","FEED","PEDV RNA","SDPP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["feed additives","FEED treatments","untreated FEED","feed matrix effect","different feed matrices","SDPP treatments","BA","combination of EO","postinoculation SDPP treatment","degradation of PEDV RNA","RNA degradation","longer duration of time","detectible RNA","Viral RNA quantification","d-old pigs","treatment bioassay room","lower PEDV Ct values","greater levels of quantifiable RNA","inclusion","qRT-PCR","viral stability","viral particles","day interaction","little increase","tendency","sampling days post-laboratory inoculation","little impact","Virus shedding","Mitigation of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","DSM Nutritional Products","spray-dried porcine plasma","real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","differences","infection","Parsippany","fecal swabs","essential oil","swine gestation diet","NJ","benzoic acid","quantity of genetic material","cecal contents","cycle threshold","samples","addition","summary","infectivity"],"language":"en"},

Vaccinia virus (VacV) encodes two decapping enzymes (D9, D10) that remove protective 5\u2032 caps on mRNAs, presumably generating substrates for degradation by the host exonuclease Xrn1. Surprisingly, we find VacV infection of Xrn1-depleted cells inhibits protein synthesis, compromising virus growth. These effects are aggravated by D9-deficiency and dependent upon a virus transcription factor required for intermediate and late mRNA biogenesis. Considerable double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) accumulation in Xrn1-depleted cells is accompanied by activation of host dsRNA-responsive defenses controlled by PKR and 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), which respectively inactivate the translation initiation factor eIF2 and stimulate RNA cleavage by RNase L. This proceeds despite VacV-encoded PKR and RNase L antagonists being present. Moreover, Xrn1-depletion sensitizes uninfected cells to dsRNA treatment. Thus, Xrn1 is a cellular factor regulating dsRNA accumulation and dsRNA-responsive innate immune effectors.","publish_time":"2015-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burgess, Hannah M.; Mohr, Ian","journal":"Cell Host \u0026 Microbe","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0ff533f68fec471a60c99300e6bda29378c4fd1.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1c4c174e591ead5cf400388a195faa903c9776ae.json; document_parses/pdf_json/473fbfa4949e8349434157a9f65687087176e605.json; document_parses/pdf_json/db4f76bdb78122aedee7b6cc281f5fcf80a7feb0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4826345.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312815000608; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2015.02.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312815000608; http://www.cell.com/article/S1931312815000608/pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25766294/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PKR","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dsRNA accumulation","Xrn1-depleted cells","host exonuclease Xrn1","dsRNA treatment","host defenses","Xrn1-depletion","VacV infection of Xrn1","virus mRNA translation","activation of host dsRNA-responsive defenses","host protein synthesis","virus transcription factor","virus growth","Vaccinia virus","dsRNA-responsive innate immune effectors","uninfected cells","cellular factor","RNase","VacV-encoded PKR","translation initiation factor eIF2","late mRNA biogenesis","global mRNA decay","RNA cleavage","D9-deficiency","Considerable double-stranded RNA","proceeds","viruses","substrates","degradation","decapping enzymes","mRNAs","D10","antagonists","caps","OAS","oligoadenylate synthetase","effects"],"language":"en"},

The selective treatment measure for mitigating and controlling the emerging infectious diseases should be implemented due to limited medical resources.

To address this, we derive a non-smooth Filippov system induced by selective treatment measure. The dynamic behaviors of two subsystems have been discussed completely, and the existence conditions for sliding segment, sliding mode dynamics and different types of equilibria such as regular equilibrium, pseudo-equilibrium, boundary equilibrium and tangent point have been provided. Further, numerical sliding bifurcation analyses show that the proposed Filippov system has rich sliding bifurcations. Especially, the most interesting results are those for the fixed parameter set as the bifurcation parameter varies, the sliding bifurcations occur sequentially: crossing \u2192 buckling \u2192 real/virtual equilibrium \u2192 buckling \u2192 crossing.

Index test results were compared with those derived from routine diagnostic tests, i.e., white blood cell (WBC) counts, neutrophil percentages, and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) levels. METHODS: This prospective, multicenter study was carried out in the most important children\u2019s hospitals (n = 11) in Italy and 433 otherwise healthy children hospitalized for radiologically confirmed CAP were enrolled. Among cases for whom etiology could be determined, CAP was ascribed to bacteria in 235 (54.3%) children and to one or more viruses in 111 (25.6%) children. A total of 312 (72.2%) children had severe disease. RESULTS: CRP and PCT had the best performances for both bacterial and viral CAP identification. The cut-off values with the highest combined sensitivity and specificity for the identification of bacterial and viral infections using CRP were \u22657.98 mg/L and \u22647.5 mg/L, respectively. When PCT was considered, the cut-off values with the highest combined sensitivity and specificity were \u22650.188 ng/mL for bacterial CAP and \u22640.07 ng/mL for viral CAP. For the identification of severe cases, the best results were obtained with evaluations of PCT and MR-proANP. However, in both cases, the biomarker cut-off with the highest combined sensitivity and specificity (\u22650.093 ng/mL for PCT and \u226533.8 pmol/L for proANP) had a relatively good sensitivity (higher than 70%) but a limited specificity (of approximately 55%). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that in children with CAP, sTREM-1, MR-proANP, and MR-proADM blood levels have poor abilities to differentiate bacterial from viral diseases or to identify severe cases, highlighting that PCT maintains the main role at this regard.","publish_time":"2016-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Esposito, Susanna; Di Gangi, Maria; Cardinale, Fabio; Baraldi, Eugenio; Corsini, Ilaria; Da Dalt, Liviana; Tovo, Pier Angelo; Correra, Antonio; Villani, Alberto; Sacco, Oliviero; Tenero, Laura; Dones, Piera; Gambino, Monia; Zampiero, Alberto; Principi, Nicola","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4dd75f2cd80aa8704156923f916dd338bb88ab9b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5113019.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27846213/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0163262","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bacterial CAP","viral CAP identification","MR-proANP","identification of bacterial","confirmed CAP","identification of severe cases","evaluations of PCT","healthy children","highest combined sensitivity","viral diseases","viral community","viral infections","CRP","MR-proADM blood levels","good sensitivity","cut-off values","best results","severe disease","multicenter study","limited specificity","STUDY DESIGN","biomarker cut-off","sTREM","Index test results","best performances","midregional proadrenomedullin","white blood cell","routine diagnostic tests","midregional proatrial natriuretic peptide","diagnostic accuracy of soluble triggering receptor","counts","poor abilities","neutrophil percentages","WBC","serum C-reactive protein","myeloid cells","procalcitonin","pneumonia","important children\u2019s hospitals","METHODS","main role","Italy","regard","pmol","etiology","CONCLUSIONS","viruses","total"],"language":"en"},

Most histamine release occurred during the first 15 to 30 minutes after challenge, depending on the dose of virus used; release initiated by virus was complete by 1 hour. At a virus/cell ratio of 1:1, Sendai virus caused 41 \u00B1 9% histamine release, whereas parainfluenza type 3 (PI-3) virus caused 25 \u00B1 5% release and respiratory syncytial (RS) virus caused 19 \u00B1 5% release. Sendai, but not PI-3 or RS, also caused a decrease in cell number and release of lactic dehydrogenase; however, this apparent cell lysis did not account for all the histamine released. Incubation of cells with virus desensitized them to subsequent triggering by viruses but did not affect response of cells to other stimuli. Histamine release was dependent on the virus/cell ratio, temperature, and metabolic energy, but it was not strictly dependent on the presence of calcium in the extracellular medium. Histamine release was not affected by preincubation of cells with colchicine, suggesting that microtubules were not involved in the release process. Basophils desensitized by anti-IgE in the absence of calcium or treated with lactic acid to dissociate IgE molecules from membrane receptors released amounts of histamine similar to that of control basophils; thus, release was not initiated through Fc\u03F5 receptors. It was found, however, that histamine release by these viruses was greatly reduced when concanavalin A was used for desensitization. These data demonstrate that the respiratory viruses studied can cause direct nonimmunologic release of histamine from human basophils. Our findings provide evidence for another mechanism by which respiratory viruses can initiate inflammation.","publish_time":"1989-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sanchez-Legrand, Fernando; Smith, Thomas F.","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ccb2a20dec9859ceb38ce5171b0dff907dddba1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0091674989903680; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0091674989903680","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["histamine release","release process","direct nonimmunologic release of histamine","release of lactic dehydrogenase","Sendai virus","dose of virus","amounts of histamine similar","respiratory viruses","human basophils","cell ratio","cell number","control basophils","direct incubation","human peripheral blood basophils","apparent cell lysis","preincubation of cells","response of cells","IgE molecules","lactic acid","membrane receptors","anti-IgE","presence of calcium","absence of calcium","Fc\u03F5 receptors","temperature","mechanism","decrease","parainfluenza type","metabolic energy","subsequent triggering","extracellular medium","evidence","colchicine","microtubules","paramyxoviruses","challenge","findings","stimuli","concanavalin","data","inflammation","minutes","desensitization","hour"],"language":"en"},

A growing body of evidence points to an inseparable link between attributes of the nursing work environment and nurse and patient outcomes. While most studies have adopted a survey design to examine the workforce and work environment issues, this study employed a phenomenological approach to provide empirical evidence regarding nurses\u2019 perceptions of their work and work environment. Aim The aim of this study was to advance our understanding of the phenomenon of increasing nurse turnover through exploring frontline registered nurses\u2019 lived experiences of working in Hong Kong public hospitals. Methods and participants A modified version of Van Kaam\u0027s controlled explication method was adopted. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 frontline nurses recruited from ten acute regional, district and non-acute public hospitals in Hong Kong. Their perspectives in regard to their work and work environment, such as workload, manpower demand and professional values, were extensively examined, and a hypothetical description relating the nursing work environment with nurses\u2019 turnover intention was posited. Results Contemplation of nurses\u2019 experiences revealed the vulnerable aspects of nursing work and six essential constituents of the nursing work environment, namely staffing level, work responsibility, management, co-worker relationships, job, and professional incentives. These essential constituents have contributed to two sets of forces, stabilizing and destabilizing forces, which originate from the attributes of the nursing work environment. Nurses viewed harmonious co-worker relationships, recognition and professional development as the crucial retaining factors. However, nurses working in an unfavorable environment were overwhelmed by destabilizing forces; they expressed frustration and demonstrated an intention to leave their work environment. Conclusions The nursing work environment is a complex entity comprising multiple constituents; its attributes affect nurses\u2019 perceptions of their work and work environment, which warrant special attention in addressing the phenomenon of increasing nurse turnover.","publish_time":"2011-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choi, Sandy Pin-pin; Pang, Samantha Mei-che; Cheung, Kin; Wong, Thomas Kwok-shing","journal":"International Journal of Nursing Studies","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e609d623397a01e6205b437b6a49cf673bf806d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094531.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0020748911000952; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020748911000952; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2011.03.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21470611/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Van Kaam"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["nursing work environment","work environment issues","work responsibility","unfavorable environment","vulnerable aspects of nursing work","nurses\u2019 perceptions","nurses\u2019 turnover intention","attributes","phenomenon of increasing nurse turnover","frontline registered nurses\u2019","increasing attention","essential constituents","frontline nurses","destabilizing forces","Results Contemplation of nurses\u2019 experiences","professional development","professional values","professional incentives","Hong Kong public hospitals","multiple constituents","study","sets of forces","aim","non-acute public hospitals","harmonious co-worker relationships","empirical evidence","special attention","growing body of evidence","recognition","modified version of Van Kaam\u0027s controlled explication method","complex entity","district","management","workload","level","participants","phenomenological approach","job","workforce","inseparable link","manpower demand","crucial retaining factors","patient outcomes","understanding","Individual semi-structured interviews","hypothetical description","Abstract Background","regard","context of care delivery","survey design","Methods","recent years","frustration","Conclusions","studies","perspectives"],"language":"en"},

Multivariate analysis showed 5 factors to be key predictors of nurses\u0027 compliance with the recommended use of facial protection. These factors include full-time work status, greater than 5 years tenure as a nurse, at least monthly use of facial protection, a belief that media coverage of infectious diseases impacts risk perception and work practices, and organizational support for health and safety.

Five of six rHuG-CSF-treated cats had significant increases in neutrophil counts that peaked on days 11\u201321 of treatment. All rHuG-CSF-treated cats exhibited an increase in myeloid:erythroid ratios of the bone marrow cells without significant changes in lymphocyte, CD4 counts, CD4/CD8 ratios, RBC counts, FIV antibody titers, and FIV loads in peripheral blood, and without clinical and hematological toxicities. Five of six rHuG-CSF-treated cats developed antibodies to rHuG-CSF by 14\u201321 days of treatment, which correlated with decreasing neutrophil counts and increasing neutralizing antibodies to rHuG-CSF. Three cats re-treated with rHuG-CSF rapidly developed neutralizing antibodies to rHuG-CSF, while one cat also developed neutralizing antibodies to recombinant feline G-CSF (rFeG-CSF). Overall, rHuG-CSF treatment increased neutrophil counts in FIV-infected cats without affecting the infection status of cats. However, long-term use of rHuG-CSF is not recommended in cats because of the neutralizing antibody production to rHuG-CSF that affects the drug activity. In addition, a preliminary finding suggests that repeated treatment cycle can also induce cross-neutralizing antibodies to rFeG-CSF, which may potentially affect the homeostasis of endogenous FeG-CSF.","publish_time":"2005-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Phillips, K.; Arai, M.; Tanabe, T.; Raskin, R.; Volz, M.; Uhl, E.

First, primary cell cultures were used to determine the susceptibility of each type of neural cells to virus infection. Neurons were the target cells, undergoing degeneration during infection, in part due to apoptosis. Second, neuropathogenicity was investigated in susceptible mice. Intracerebral inoculation of HCoV-OC43 into BALB/c mice led to an acute encephalitis with neuronal cell death by necrosis and apoptosis. Infectious virus was apparently cleared from surviving animals, whereas viral RNA persisted for several months. Some of the animals surviving to acute encephalitis presented an abnormal limb clasping reflex and a decrease in motor activity starting several months post-infection. These results suggest that viral persistence could be associated with an increased neuronal degeneration leading to neuropathology and motor deficits in susceptible individuals.","publish_time":"2006-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jacomy, H\u00E9l\u00E8ne; Fragoso, Gabriela; Almazan, Guillermina; Mushynski, Walter E.; Talbot, Pierre J.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/427a3e2947a3a75b52e4fdfef9a1832965e5dd82.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111850.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682206000389; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682206000389","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCoV-OC43","virus infection","OC43 strain of human coronavirus","acute encephalitis","human respiratory coronavirus","months post-infection","susceptible mice","Infectious virus","surviving animals","apoptosis","neuronal cell death","infectious respiratory pathogen","increased neuronal degeneration","motor activity","motor deficits","target cells","c mice","susceptible individuals","viral RNA","viral persistence","type of neural cells","Intracerebral inoculation of HCoV","primary cell cultures","neuropathology","CNS","decrease","reflex","central nervous system","lead","abnormal limb","BALB","necrosis","neurological disease","susceptibility","notion","results"],"language":"en"},

Integration of an unmodified CTB-coding sequence into chloroplast genomes (up to 10,000 copies per cell), resulted in the accumulation of up to 4.1% of total soluble tobacco leaf protein as functional oligomers (410-fold higher expression levels than that of the unmodified LTB gene expressed via the nuclear genome). However, expresssion levels reported are an underestimation of actual accumulation of CTB in transgenic chloroplasts, due to aggregation of the oligomeric forms in unboiled samples similar to the aggregation observed for purified bacterial antigen. PCR and Southern blot analyses confirmed stable integration of the CTB gene into the chloroplast genome. Western blot analysis showed that the chloroplast-synthesized CTB assembled into oligomers and were antigenically identical with purified native CTB. Also, binding assays confirmed that chloroplast- synthesized CTB binds to the intestinal membrane GM1-ganglioside receptor, indicating correct folding and disulfide bond formation of CTB pentamers within transgenic chloroplasts. In contrast to stunted nuclear transgenic plants, chloroplast transgenic plants were morphologically indistinguishable from untransformed plants, when CTB was constitutively expressed in chloroplasts. Introduced genes were inherited stably in subsequent generations, as confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analyses. Increased production of an efficient transmucosal carrier molecule and delivery system, like CTB, in transgenic chloroplasts makes plant-based oral vaccines and fusion proteins with CTB needing oral administration commercially feasible. Successful expression of foreign genes in transgenic chromoplasts and availability of marker-free chloroplast transformation techniques augurs well for development of vaccines in edible parts of transgenic plants. Furthermore, since the quaternary structure of many proteins is essential for their function, this investigation demonstrates the potential for other foreign multimeric proteins to be properly expressed and assembled in transgenic chloroplasts.","publish_time":"2001-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Daniell, Henry; Lee, Seung-Bum; Panchal, Tanvi; Wiebe, Peter O.","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1622e5febd59e8a8fef0afd6a256324fb3473a1a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9f95a9f5f4a288925daaf6ee484a3f95eb76327d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3473180.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283601949216; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3473180?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283601949216","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Escherichia coli"],"organizations":["Vibrio","CTB","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CTB gene","transgenic chloroplasts","chloroplast-synthesized CTB","chloroplast- synthesized CTB","chloroplast transgenic plants","nuclear transgenic plants","purified native CTB","transgenic chromoplasts","unmodified CTB-coding sequence","underestimation of actual accumulation of CTB","chloroplast genomes","edible parts of transgenic plants","disulfide bond formation of CTB pentamers","untransformed plants","Southern blot analyses","free chloroplast transformation techniques","oral vaccines","unmodified LTB gene","aggregation","fusion proteins","PCR","foreign multimeric proteins","nuclear genome","Successful expression of foreign genes","higher expression levels","Western blot analysis","functional oligomers","development of vaccines","oral administration","stable integration","expresssion levels","availability of marker","efficient transmucosal carrier molecule","correct folding","delivery system","intestinal membrane GM1-ganglioside receptor","cholera toxin of Vibrio cholerae","total soluble tobacco leaf protein","B subunits of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli","unboiled samples similar","oligomeric forms","potential","Increased production","investigation","candidate vaccine antigens","binding assays","quaternary structure","subsequent generations","copies","contrast","cell","bacterial antigen"],"language":"en"},

We argue that the information-based economy is emphatically urban-based and that it has forged new spatial inequalities in and between cities and among urban populations. Income gaps have widened, inter-city disparities have grown, suburbs have been re-sorted into a wide array on the basis of class and race or ethnicity, and many central cities have assumed a renewed importance within metropolitan areas. We argue that attention to urban spatial dimensions at various scales is critical to understanding current inequality trends, from intra-urban to regional and global scales. Contributions to this special issue from North America, Europe, South America, and China suggest that deepening urban inequalities are pervasive across the globe.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nijman, Jan; Wei, Yehua Dennis","journal":"Appl Geogr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de1fec7aadf710eaf8a72c06b13e22a64736090e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124478.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622820301910; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.102188; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0143622820301910; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287517/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs0NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["North America","Europe","South America","China"],"keyphrases":["urban inequalities","urban populations","urban spatial dimensions","importance of urban spatial context","inequality studies","renewed importance","new spatial inequalities","current inequality trends","North America","various scales","broader present-day inequality debates","South America","renewed prominence","global scales","central cities","special issue of Applied Geography","information-based economy","Europe","basis of class","ethnicity","China","inter-city disparities","suburbs","race","attention","Income gaps","wide array","social sciences","introduction","metropolitan areas","Contributions","globe","decade"],"language":"en"},

Many have focused on the militaristic language used to report and explain this illness, a type of language that has permeated discourses of immunology, bacteriology and infection for at least a century. In this article, we examine how language and metaphor were used in the UK media\u0027s coverage of another previously unknown and severe infectious disease: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). SARS offers an opportunity to explore the cultural framing of a less extraordinary epidemic disease. It therefore provides an analytical counter-weight to the very extensive body of interpretation that has developed around HIV/AIDS. By analysing the total reporting on SARS of five major national newspapers during the epidemic of spring 2003, we investigate how the reporting of SARS in the UK press was framed, and how this related to media, public and governmental responses to the disease. We found that, surprisingly, militaristic language was largely absent, as was the judgemental discourse of plague. Rather, the main conceptual metaphor used was SARS as a killer. SARS as a killer was a single unified entity, not an army or force. We provide some tentative explanations for this shift in linguistic framing by relating it to local political concerns, media cultures, and spatial factors.","publish_time":"2005-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wallis, Patrick; Nerlich, Brigitte","journal":"Social Science \u0026 Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/045174ec80eae64513e957633c70d66c5d3d91ec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117051.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953604005891; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953604005891","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs0Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reporting of SARS","militaristic language","severe infectious disease","type of language","extraordinary epidemic disease","linguistic framing","cultural framing","metaphorical framing","illness","killer","AIDS","media cultures","social scientists","epidemic of spring","social context","UK press","total reporting","emergence of HIV","UK media\u0027s coverage","main conceptual metaphor","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","major national newspapers","local political concerns","single unified entity","discourses of immunology","sociologists of health","governmental responses","bacteriology","infection","army","shift","tentative explanations","spatial factors","extensive body of interpretation","analytical counter-weight","opportunity","judgemental discourse of plague","century","force","Abstract","article"],"language":"en"},

The first, initiated around 1975, dealt with identifying the enzyme, establishing the relevant assay systems and investigating its biological activities and significance in cancer and other pathologies. Studies performed during the first area are briefly introduced in a layman style followed by the relevant abstracts presented chronologically, essentially as appears in PubMed. The second era started in 1999 when the heparanase gene was independently cloned by 4 research groups [1\u20134]. As expected, cloning of the heparanase gene boosted heparanase research by virtue of the readily available recombinant enzyme, molecular probes, and anti-heparanase antibodies.

The extreme severity of the recent 2014\u201316 EBOV outbreak in terms of fatality rate and rapid spread out of Africa led to the understanding that EBOV is a global health risk and highlights the necessity to find countermeasures against it. In the recent years, several small molecules have been shown to display in vitro and in vivo efficacy against EBOV and some of them have advanced into clinical trials. In addition, also existing drugs have been tested for their anti-EBOV activity and were shown to be promising candidates. However, despite the constant effort addressed to identify anti-EBOV therapeutics, no approved drugs are available against EBOV yet. In this chapter, we describe the main EBOV life cycle steps, providing a detailed picture of the druggable viral and host targets that have been explored so far by different technologies.

However, the etiological agents are poorly identified. This study, conducted during the pandemic outbreak of H1N1 influenza in 2009, aims to determine the main etiological agents responsible for acute respiratory infections in children from Lima, Peru. Nasopharyngeal swabs collected from 717 children with acute respiratory infections between January 2009 and December 2010 were analyzed by multiplex RT\u2010PCR for 13 respiratory viruses: influenza A, B, and C virus; parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1, 2, 3, and 4; and human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, among others. Samples were also tested with direct fluorescent\u2010antibodies (DFA) for six respiratory viruses. RT\u2010PCR and DFA detected respiratory viruses in 240 (33.5%) and 85 (11.9%) cases, respectively. The most common etiological agents were RSV\u2010A (15.3%), followed by influenza A (4.6%), PIV\u20101 (3.6%), and PIV\u20102 (1.8%). The viruses identified by DFA corresponded to RSV (5.9%) and influenza A (1.8%). Therefore, respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) were found to be the most common etiology of acute respiratory infections.

The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other regions. OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical manifestations and epidemiological characteristics of patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Hunan Province in 2020. STUDY DESIGN: From January 19 to February 7, 2020, 33 patients with positive in nucleic acid test of pharyngeal swab were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: There are 33 COVID-19 patients (16 male, 17 female), and the median age was 46 years. Nineteen patients (48 %) were associated with a family cluster outbreak. Seventeen patients (52 %) had traveled or lived in Hubei Province. These patients are early mild cases, most common symptoms are fever [23 (70 %)] and cough [13 (39 %)]. Most patients\u0027 white blood cell counts are normal, while they manifest as significant reduction in lymphocytes [17/28 (61 %)]. The levels of c-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate suggest a typical viral infection. Procalcitonin did not increase and D-dimer increased slightly. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels have elevated in most patients. CT images of these patients showed bilateral multiple plaques or nodular ground-glass opacities (68.4 %). Fecal nucleic acid results were positive in eight COVID-19 patients accompanied with diarrhea. Tear nucleic acid results were negative in six COVID-19 patients. And four asymptomatic patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical symptoms, laboratory results and imaging reports of patients with COVID-19 in Hunan area are significantly different from those in Wuhan area. For non-Wuhan epidemic areas, more attention should be paid to nucleic acid test results of throat swabs and stools, and it is not easily to diagnose based on clinical symptoms and CT results. Reduced whole blood lymph count can be used as an adjuvant diagnosis of early SARS-CoV-2 infection. Attention should be paid to asymptomatic carriers, which is of great significance for the control of the global epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yin, Sheng; Peng, Yizhi; Ren, Yaping; Hu, Min; Tang, Lingli; Xiang, Zhongyuan; Li, Xianping; Wang, Min; Wang, Wenlong","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f74936aecf802c05630ee6b5e49c82310c12a622.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7192082.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301396; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104397; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301396?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388472/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs1ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Wuhan","Hunan"],"keyphrases":["asymptomatic patients","COVID","epidemiological characteristics of patients","imaging reports of patients","CT results","Fecal nucleic acid results","laboratory results","nucleic acid test results of throat swabs","clinical symptoms","Wuhan area","Hunan Province","Hubei Province","nucleic acid test of pharyngeal swab","common symptoms","clinical manifestations","adjuvant diagnosis of early SARS-CoV","attention","non-Wuhan epidemic areas","coronavirus Disease","Hunan area","typical viral infection","levels of c","CT images","global epidemic","asymptomatic carriers","early mild cases","blood lymph count","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","patients\u0027 white blood cell counts","erythrocyte sedimentation rate","bilateral multiple plaques","reactive protein","nodular ground-glass opacities","great significance","control","female","stools","median age","Lactate dehydrogenase","LDH","fever","CONCLUSIONS","China","significant reduction","family cluster outbreak","lymphocytes","years","OBJECTIVES","diarrhea","D-dimer","STUDY DESIGN","Procalcitonin","BACKGROUND","regions","cough"],"language":"en"},

It has also illustrated that familiar ethical issues in infectious disease management endure despite considerable efforts to understand and mitigate such issues in the wake of past outbreaks. To improve future global outbreak preparedness and response, we must examine these shortcomings and reflect upon the current state of ethical preparedness. To this end, we focus our efforts in this article on the examination of one substantial area: ethical guidance in pandemic plans. We argue that, due in part to their focus on considerations arising specifically in relation to pandemics of influenza origin, pandemic plans and their existing ethical guidance are ill-equipped to anticipate and facilitate the navigation of unique ethical challenges that may arise in other infectious disease pandemics. We proceed by outlining three reasons why this is so, and situate our analysis in the context of the EVD outbreak and the threat posed by drug-resistant tuberculosis: (1) different infectious diseases have distinct characteristics that challenge anticipated or existing modes of pandemic prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery, (2) clear, transparent, context-specific ethical reasoning and justification within current influenza pandemic plans are lacking, and (3) current plans neglect the context of how other significant pandemics may manifest. We conclude the article with several options for reflecting upon and ultimately addressing ethical issues that may emerge with different infectious disease pandemics.","publish_time":"2015-10-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Maxwell J.; Silva, Diego S.","journal":"Monash Bioeth Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3af4ec33c00a04b6ae6d24747fa190b563dd9aa6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100556.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26507138/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40592-015-0038-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EVD"],"locations":["West Africa"],"keyphrases":["novel ethical issues","familiar ethical issues","existing ethical guidance","current state of ethical preparedness","different infectious disease pandemics","current plans","context-specific ethical reasoning","current influenza pandemic plans","infectious disease management","EVD outbreak","navigation of unique ethical challenges","future global outbreak preparedness","significant pandemics","different infectious diseases","pandemics of influenza origin","unprecedented outbreak of Ebola virus disease","existing modes of pandemic prevention","response","article","focus","considerable efforts","justification","West Africa","substantial area","distinct characteristics","threat","relation","examination","drug-resistant tuberculosis","reflecting","wake of past outbreaks","shortcomings","considerations","recovery","options","analysis","end","reasons"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of children diagnosed with ADV infection were retrospectively reviewed. The enrolled children were divided into two groups based on the identified respiratory viruses: ADV group and coinfection group. Clinical and laboratory parameters were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: In total, 105 children (60 males and 45 females) with a median age of 29 months (range: 0-131 months) diagnosed with an ADV infection were enrolled. Fever (99.0%) was by far the most frequent symptom, followed by respiratory (82.9%), and gastrointestinal (22.9%) symptoms. Upper and lower respiratory tract infections were diagnosed in 56 (53.3%), and 32 (30.5%) children, respectively. Five (4.8%) children received oxygen therapy, and no child died due to ADV infection. Coinfection was diagnosed in 32 (30.5%) children, with rhinovirus (46.9%), and respiratory syncytial virus (21.9%) being the most frequent. The proportions of children younger than 24 months (P \u003C0.001), with underlying medical conditions (P = 0.020), and diagnosed with lower respiratory tract infection (P = 0.011) were significantly higher in the coinfection group than in the ADV group. In a multivariate analysis, only the younger age was significantly associated with coinfection (P \u003C0.001). Although more children in the coinfection group received oxygen therapy (P = 0.029), the duration of fever and hospitalization was not significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Respiratory viral coinfection with ADV occurred more frequently in children younger than 24 months of age compared with children aged 24 months or older. Respiratory viral coinfection may increase the severity of ADV infection, however, appropriate therapy prevented prolonged hospitalization and poor prognosis due to coinfection.","publish_time":"2016-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Hyun Jun; Seo, Young Eun; Han, Seung Beom; Jeong, Dae Chul; Kang, Jin Han","journal":"Infect Chemother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4ad1eb3352c4b02e769ba152f1fa89209a0e70a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5204010.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3947/ic.2016.48.4.309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27883373/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ADV"],"locations":["Korea"],"keyphrases":["ADV group","coinfection group","enrolled children","severity of ADV infection","proportions of children younger","Medical records of children","clinical impact of viral coinfection","months of age","identification of respiratory viral coinfections","identified respiratory viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","lower respiratory tract infections","younger age","groups","oxygen therapy","appropriate therapy","median age","prolonged hospitalization","duration of fever","frequent symptom","underlying medical conditions","introduction of multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction tests","poor prognosis","METHODS","females","Korea","year","range","CONCLUSION","MATERIALS","total","multivariate analysis","adenovirus","laboratory parameters","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","symptoms","rhinovirus"],"language":"en"},

Methods: Adults and children presenting to hospital with acute asthma and a confirmed respiratory virus infection were studied acutely and at recovery 4\u20136 weeks later by clinical evaluation and induced sputum for viral and inflammatory mediator detection. Results: Viral RNA was detected during both acute asthma and recovery visits in 17 subjects (viral persistence), whereas in 22 subjects viral RNA had cleared by recovery (viral clearance). The following viruses were detected at recovery: human rhinovirus: 16; respiratory syncytial virus: 2; influenza: 2. In subjects with viral persistence, eight isolates were different to the virus detected at Visit 1. Forty\u2010four per cent of the human rhinovirus isolates were infective at recovery.

The story began with Hippocrates 400 B.C. with his description of mumps and diphtheria. No further discoveries were recorded until 1100 A.D. when the smallpox vaccine was described. During the eighteenth century, vaccines for cholera and yellow fever were reported and Edward Jenner, the father of vaccination and immunology, published his work on smallpox. The nineteenth century was a major landmark, with the \u201CGerm Theory of disease\u201D of Louis Pasteur, the discovery of the germ tubercle bacillus for tuberculosis by Robert Koch, and the isolation of pneumococcus organism by George Miller Sternberg. Another landmark was the discovery of diphtheria toxin by Emile Roux and its serological treatment by Emil Von Behring and Paul Ehrlih. In addition, Pasteur was able to generate the first live-attenuated viral vaccine against rabies. Typhoid vaccines were then developed, followed by the plague vaccine of Yersin. At the beginning of World War I, the tetanus toxoid was introduced, followed in 1915 by the pertussis vaccine. In 1974, The Expanded Program of Immunization was established within the WHO for bacille Calmette\u2013Guerin, Polio, DTP, measles, yellow fever, and hepatitis B. The year 1996 witnessed the launching of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative. In 1988, the WHO passed a resolution to eradicate polio by the year 2000 and in 2006; the first vaccine to prevent cervical cancer was developed. In 2010, \u201CThe Decade of vaccines\u201D was launched, and on April 1st 2012, the United Nations launched the \u201Cshot@Life\u201D campaign. In brief, the armamentarium of vaccines continues to grow with more emphasis on safety, availability, and accessibility. This mini review highlights the major historical events and pioneers in the course of development of vaccines, which have eradicated so many life-threatening diseases, despite the vaccination attitudes and waves appearing through history.","publish_time":"2015-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hajj Hussein, Inaya; Chams, Nour; Chams, Sana; El Sayegh, Skye; Badran, Reina; Raad, Mohamad; Gerges-Geagea, Alice; Leone, Angelo; Jurjus, Abdo","journal":"Front Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d85a85112817de11b60dd2e8f8177a48c3015442.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4659912.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26636066/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2015.00269","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Edward Jenner","Robert Koch","George Miller Sternberg","Emile Roux","Emil Von Behring","Paul Ehrlih"],"organizations":["The Expanded Program of Immunization","United Nations"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["history of vaccines","smallpox vaccine","viral vaccine","armamentarium of vaccines","Typhoid vaccines","Decade of vaccines","pertussis vaccine","plague vaccine of Yersin","International AIDS Vaccine Initiative","yellow fever","live-attenuated viruses","Polio","major landmark","year","century","discovery of diphtheria toxin","inactivated organisms","inactivated toxins","vaccination attitudes","father of vaccination","Louis Pasteur","germ tubercle bacillus","major historical events","Germ Theory of disease","Emile Roux","serological treatment","Robert Koch","DTP","measles","isolation of pneumococcus organism","Behring","Guerin","pioneers","tuberculosis","Edward Jenner","launching","George Miller Sternberg","mini review","immunology","course of development","hepatitis","cholera","Paul Ehrlih","bacille Calmette","beginning of World War","pathogen","safety","availability","tetanus toxoid","life-threatening diseases","segments","work","waves","emphasis","rabies","description of mumps","Multiple cornerstones","Expanded Program of Immunization","Hippocrates","immune response","accessibility","addition","resolution","cervical cancer","brief","United Nations","campaign","discoveries"],"language":"en"},

This report describes a virus identification method featuring high throughput, high resolution, and high sensitivity detection of viruses. Identification of virus is based on liquid hybridization of different lengths of virus-specific probes to their corresponding viruses. The probes bound to target sequences are removed by a biotin\u2013streptavidin pull-down mechanism and the supernatant is analyzed by capillary electrophoresis. The probes depleted from the sample appear as diminished peaks in the electropherograms and the remaining probes serve as calibrators to align peaks in different capillaries. The virus identities are unraveled by a signal processing and peak detection algorithm developed in-house. Nine viruses were used in the study to demonstrate how the system works to unravel the virus identity in single and double virus infections. With properly designed probes, the system is able to distinguish closely related viruses. The system takes advantage of the high resolution feature of capillary electrophoresis to resolve probes that differ by length. The method may facilitate virus identity screen from more candidate viruses with an automated 4-color DNA sequencer.","publish_time":"2012-07-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Chin-Yu; Hsiao, Tzu-Hung; Chu, Liang-Hui; Lin, Yi-Ling; Huang, Jau-Ling; Chen, Chung-Hsuan; Peck, Konan","journal":"Analytica Chimica Acta","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a30e61b8c966c35fb848cfe3cd332e3e7730925a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094614.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003267012006381; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22704476/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003267012006381; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2012.04.040","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus identities","Identification of virus","virus identification method","virus identity screen","double virus infections","specific probes","remaining probes","designed probes","high sensitivity detection of viruses","candidate viruses","system","corresponding viruses","related viruses","liquid hybridization of different lengths of virus","high throughput","high resolution feature of capillary electrophoresis","different capillaries","diminished peaks","peak detection algorithm","emergence of new viral infections","signal processing","pandemics","supernatant","calibrators","large number of clinical samples","biotin","streptavidin pull-down mechanism","electropherograms","faster methods","advantage","color DNA sequencer","need","Abstract","report","sequences","study"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: To describe the nature, frequency, treatment, and clinical course of respiratory tract exacerbations in patients with CVID and to describe pathogens isolated during respiratory tract exacerbations. METHODS: We performed a prospective diary card exercise in 69 patients with CVID recruited from a primary immunodeficiency clinic in the United Kingdom, generating 6210 days of symptom data. We collected microbiology (sputum microscopy and culture, atypical bacterial PCR, and mycobacterial culture) and virology (nasopharyngeal swab multiplex PCR) samples from symptomatic patients with CVID. RESULTS: There were 170 symptomatic exacerbations and 76 exacerbations treated by antibiotics. The strongest symptomatic predictors for commencing antibiotics were cough, shortness of breath, and purulent sputum. There was a median delay of 5 days from the onset of symptoms to commencing antibiotics. Episodes characterized by purulent sputum responded more quickly to antibiotics, whereas sore throat and upper respiratory tract symptoms responded less quickly. A pathogenic virus was isolated in 56% of respiratory exacerbations and a potentially pathogenic bacteria in 33%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CVID delay and avoid treatment of symptomatic respiratory exacerbations, which could result in structural lung damage. However, viruses are commonly represented and illnesses dominated by upper respiratory tract symptoms respond poorly to antibiotics, suggesting that antibiotic usage could be better targeted.","publish_time":"2017-07-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sperlich, Johannes M.; Grimbacher, Bodo; Workman, Sarita; Haque, Tanzina; Seneviratne, Suranjith L.; Burns, Siobhan O.; Reiser, Veronika; Vach, Werner; Hurst, John R.; Lowe, David M.","journal":"J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/417cc66866cbe8108fbc116d45ec1d5d2ffbe16e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185402.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213219817303872; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213219817303872; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28734862/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2017.05.024","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs3MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CVID"],"locations":["United Kingdom"],"keyphrases":["symptomatic exacerbations","treatment of symptomatic respiratory exacerbations","symptomatic patients","clinical course of respiratory tract exacerbations","upper respiratory tract symptoms","frequent respiratory tract infections","CVID delay","symptomatic triggers","significant quantities of antibiotics","purulent sputum","strongest symptomatic predictors","sputum microscopy","onset of symptoms","mycobacterial culture","median delay","microbiological nature","pathogenic bacteria","pathogenic virus","atypical bacterial PCR","primary immunodeficiency clinic","common variable immunodeficiency","days of symptom data","nasopharyngeal swab multiplex PCR","immunoglobulin replacement","samples","virology","sore throat","United Kingdom","prospective diary card exercise","cough","shortness of breath","illnesses","pathogens","antibiotic usage","BACKGROUND","frequency","microbiology","CONCLUSIONS","structural lung damage","METHODS","Episodes","response","RESULTS","viruses","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

This results in antigenic switching and genetic variation, finally leading to the emergence of novel and new MERS-CoV subtypes which are uncontrollable by vaccines.

This virus can spread from human to human, but transmission from dromedary camels to humans plays a crucial epidemiological significance. Dromedary camel acts as \u201Cgene mixing vessels\u201D for MERS-CoV and these virus particles undergo rapid change in them.

Because many pathogens exhibit epidemic cycling and FOI is the result of processes acting across the scales of individuals and populations, a flexible framework that extends to epidemic dynamics and links within\u2010host processes to FOI is needed.

RNA pseudoknots are also of interest because of their key role in the control of ribosomal frameshifting by viral RNAs. Their mechanical properties are directly relevant to their unfolding by ribosomes during translation. We have used optical tweezers to study the kinetics and thermodynamics of mechanical unfolding and refolding of single RNA molecules. Here we describe the unfolding of the frameshifting pseudoknot from infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), three constituent hairpins, and three mutants of the IBV pseudoknot. All four pseudoknots cause \u22121 programmed ribosomal frameshifting. We have measured the free energies and rates of mechanical unfolding and refolding of the four frameshifting pseudoknots. Our results show that the IBV pseudoknot requires a higher force than its corresponding hairpins to unfold. Furthermore, its rate of unfolding changes little with increasing force, in contrast with the rate of hairpin unfolding. The presence of Mg2\u002B significantly increases the kinetic barriers to unfolding the IBV pseudoknot, but has only a minor effect on the hairpin unfolding. The greater mechanical stability of pseudoknots compared to hairpins, and their kinetic insensitivity to force supports the hypothesis that \u22121 frameshifting depends on the difficulty of unfolding the mRNA.","publish_time":"2008-01-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Green, Lisa; Kim, Chul-Hyun; Bustamante, Carlos; Tinoco, Ignacio","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50d1a16a5ffe90c274ab9de84e102ea4743aa336.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094456.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283607007115; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283607007115","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs3NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rates of mechanical unfolding","thermodynamics of mechanical unfolding","IBV pseudoknot","frameshifting pseudoknots","rate of hairpin unfolding","rate of unfolding changes","RNA pseudoknots","RNA stability","greater mechanical stability of pseudoknots","control of ribosomal frameshifting","programmed ribosomal frameshifting","mechanical properties","pseudoknots cause","constituent hairpins","increasing force","higher force","single RNA molecules","corresponding hairpins","kinetics","important RNA structural element","kinetic barriers","kinetic insensitivity","infectious bronchitis virus","excellent model system","contributions of tertiary interactions","contrast","viral RNAs","free energies","mutants","key role","minor effect","ribosomes","hypothesis","optical tweezers","presence of Mg2","difficulty","translation","results","mRNA"],"language":"en"},

Growing hand, foot and mouth disease outbreaks were observed worldwide in recent years and caused devastating losses both economically and politically. However, vaccines or effective drugs are unavailable to date. The genome of EV71 consists of a positive sense, single-stranded RNA of \u223C7400 bp, encoding a large precursor polyprotein that requires proteolytic processing to generate mature viral proteins. The proteolytic processing mainly depends on EV71 3C protease (3Cpro) that possesses both proteolysis and RNA binding activities, which enable the protease to perform multiple tasks in viral replication and pathogen\u2013host interactions. The central roles played by EV71 3Cpro make it an appealing target for antiviral drug development. We determined the first crystal structure of EV71 3Cpro and analyzed its enzymatic activity. The crystal structure shows that EV71 3Cpro has a typical chymotrypsin-like fold that is common in picornaviral 3Cpro. Strikingly, we found an important surface loop, also denoted as \u03B2-ribbon, which adopts a novel open conformation in EV71 3Cpro. We identified two important residues located at the base of the \u03B2-ribbon, Gly123 and His133, which form hinges that govern the intrinsic flexibility of the ribbon. Structure-guided mutagenesis studies revealed that the hinge residues are important to EV71 3Cpro proteolytic activities. In summary, our work provides the first structural insight into EV71 3Cpro, including a mobile \u03B2-ribbon, which is relevant to the proteolytic mechanism. Our data also provides a framework for structure-guided inhibitor design against EV71 3Cpro.","publish_time":"2011-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cui, Sheng; Wang, Jing; Fan, Tingting; Qin, Bo; Guo, Li; Lei, Xiaobo; Wang, Jianwei; Wang, Meitian; Jin, Qi","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/084730ad52ec598976332e8ce55afa4b8b55c25a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094522.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283611002609; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283611002609; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.03.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21396941/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genome of EV71","crystal structure of EV71","Cpro proteolytic activities","proteolytic processing","mobile \u03B2-ribbon","important residues","proteolytic mechanism","foot","structure-guided inhibitor design","Structure-guided mutagenesis studies","mouth disease outbreaks","RNA binding activities","important surface loop","viral replication","Growing hand","major pathogen","hinge residues","C protease","mature viral proteins","single-stranded RNA","positive sense","appealing target","bp","large precursor polyprotein","framework","multiple tasks","recent years","novel open conformation","typical chymotrypsin","effective drugs","hinges","fold","antiviral drug development","host interactions","Gly123","His133","proteolysis","structural insight","base","vaccines","date","devastating losses","intrinsic flexibility","young children","picornaviral","Abstract Human enterovirus","central roles","enzymatic activity","data","summary"],"language":"en"},

Traders at LBMs exhibit a variety of trading practices, which may influence the transmission of AIVs. We identified trading practices that impacted on AIV prevalence in chickens marketed in northern Vietnamese LBMs. We generated sequencing data for 31 H9N2 and two H5N6 viruses.

The position of a vendor in the trading network impacted on their odds of having AIV\u2010infected chickens. Being a retailer and purchasing chickens from middlemen was associated with increased odds of infection, whereas odds decreased if vendors purchased chickens directly from large farms. Odds of infection were also higher for vendors having a greater volume of ducks unsold per day.

METHODS: We reviewed trends in these aspects in models for influenza pandemic preparedness that aimed to generate policy insights for epidemic management and were published from 2000 to September 2011, i.e. before and after the 2009 pandemic. RESULTS: We find that many influenza pandemics models rely on parameters from previous modelling studies, models are rarely validated using observed data and are seldom applied to low-income countries. Mechanisms for international data sharing would be necessary to facilitate a wider adoption of model validation. The variety of modelling decisions makes it difficult to compare and evaluate models systematically. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a model Characteristics, Construction, Parameterization and Validation aspects protocol (CCPV protocol) to contribute to the systematisation of the reporting of models with an emphasis on the incorporation of economic aspects and host behaviour. Model reporting, as already exists in many other fields of modelling, would increase confidence in model results, and transparency in their assessment and comparison.","publish_time":"2013-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carrasco, Luis R; Jit, Mark; Chen, Mark I; Lee, Vernon J; Milne, George J; Cook, Alex R","journal":"Emerg Themes Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b124808cb49c3530b23b6fda834fcbbc8af1988.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3666982.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-7622-10-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23651557/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reporting of models","influenza pandemics models","model results","Model reporting","Validation aspects protocol","volume of influenza pandemic modelling studies","model Characteristics","fields of modelling","previous modelling studies","influenza pandemic preparedness","wider adoption of model validation","incorporation of economic aspects","validation techniques","variety of modelling decisions","economic analyses","sophisticated parameterization","CCPV protocol","host behaviour","behaviour of individuals","observed data","international data sharing","parameters","Construction","transparency","confidence","emphasis","policy insights","epidemic management","assessment","Mechanisms","BACKGROUND","trends","systematisation","comparison","CONCLUSIONS","low-income countries","METHODS","decade"],"language":"en"},

Design Cross-sectional study Methods A Google Forms survey was distributed to athletes from 15 sports in the final phase (last week of April 2020) of the level 5 lockdown period. Descriptive statistics were used to describe player demographic data. Chi-squared tests investigated significance (p\u003C0.05) between observed and expected values and explored sex differences. Post-hoc tests with a Bonferroni adjustment were included where applicable. Results 67% of the 692 respondents were males. The majority (56%) expected RTS after 1-6months. Most athletes trained alone (61%; p\u003C0.0001), daily (61%; p\u003C0.0001) at moderate intensity (58%; p\u003C0.0001) and for 30-60min (72%). During leisure time athletes preferred sedentary above active behaviour (p\u003C0.0001). Sleep patterns changed significantly (79%; p\u003C0.0001). A significant number of athletes consumed excessive amounts of carbohydrates (76%; p\u003C0.0001; males 73%; females 80%). Many athletes felt depressed (52%), and required motivation to keep active (55%). Most had access to healthcare during lockdown (80%) and knew proceedings when suspecting COVID-19 (92%). Conclusions COVID-19 had physical, nutritional and psychological consequences that may impact on the safe RTS and general health of athletes. Lost opportunities and uncertain financial and sporting futures may have significant effects on athletes and the sports industry. Government and sporting federations must support athletes and develop and implement guidelines to reduce the risk in a COVID-19 environment.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pillay, Lervasen; Janse van Rensburg, Dina C.

DESIGN: A retrospective approach was adopted. SETTING: AED, involving all local public emergency departments from 2001 to 2012. PARTICIPANTS: 63 557 subjects aged 0\u201319 years with fall injury record were included in the analysis. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Fall-related injury number and rates were calculated and reported. Poisson and negative binomial regression models were used to study the trends of injury incidence rate at different body regions. RESULTS: AED fall-related attendance rate increased significantly with an annual percentage change of 4.45 (95% CI 3.43 to 5.47%, p\u003C0.0001). The attendance number of male subjects was persistently higher than female subjects. The standardised rate of fracture injury increased by 1.31% (95% CI 0.56 to 2.05%, p\u003C0.0001) and that of non-fracture injury increased by 9.23% (95% CI 7.07 to 11.43%, p\u003C0.0001) annually. Upper limb was the most frequently fractured location. It included forearm/elbow, shoulder/upper arm and wrist/hand with descending order of frequency. On the contrary, head was the most frequent non-fracture location, followed by forearm/elbow. CONCLUSIONS: The rates of fall-related attendance have been increasing and still remain high. There were significant increases in non-fracture injuries. Fractures were most frequently found in the upper extremity of a child while the most common non-fracture location was head. It appears that more efforts should be made and preventive measures should be implemented for children and adolescents in Hong Kong.","publish_time":"2017-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, James Chun-Yin; Tung, Keith Tsz-Suen; Li, Tim M H; Ho, Frederick Ka-Wing; Ip, Patrick; Wong, Wilfred Hing-Sang; Chow, Chun-Bong","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/38db3b3d3d82b08a9d95490fd0871d04d7001efe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5306530.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28174223/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013724","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs5MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Poisson"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["non-fracture injury","Fall-related injury number","fall injury record","AED fall-related attendance rate","standardised rate of fracture injury","injury type","rates of fall","non-fracture injuries","frequent non-fracture location","common non-fracture location","trends of injury incidence rate","characteristics of fall","attendance number of male subjects","children","upper arm","head","female subjects","adolescents","fractured location","forearm","Upper limb","upper extremity","elbow","Hong Kong","preventive measures","present study","PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES","local public emergency departments","associated average length of stay","hand","wrist","LOS","accident","different body regions","shoulder","negative binomial regression models","Poisson","descending order of frequency","significant increases","years","RESULTS","annual percentage change","DESIGN","retrospective approach","OBJECTIVES","efforts","SETTING","analysis","CONCLUSIONS","PARTICIPANTS","Fractures"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Airflow was marked with intrapulmonary smoke. Coughing bouts were generated by short bursts of oxygen flow at 650, 320, and 220L/min to simulate normal, mild and poor coughing efforts, respectively. The coughing jet was revealed by laser light-sheet and images were captured by high definition video. Smoke concentration in the plume was estimated from the light scattered by smoke particles. Significant exposure was arbitrarily defined where there was \u2265 20% of normalized smoke concentration. RESULTS: During normal cough, expelled air dispersion distances were 68, 30 and 15 cm along the median sagittal plane when the HPS wore no mask, a surgical mask and a N95 mask, respectively. In moderate lung injury, the corresponding air dispersion distances for mild coughing efforts were reduced to 55, 27 and 14 cm, respectively, p \u003C 0.001. The distances were reduced to 30, 24 and 12 cm, respectively during poor coughing effort as in severe lung injury. Lateral dispersion distances during normal cough were 0, 28 and 15 cm when the HPS wore no mask, a surgical mask and a N95 mask, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Normal cough produced a turbulent jet about 0.7 m towards the end of the bed from the recumbent subject. N95 mask was more effective than surgical mask in preventing expelled air leakage during coughing but there was still significant sideway leakage.","publish_time":"2012-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hui, David S.; Chow, Benny K.; Chu, Leo; Ng, Susanna S.; Lee, Nelson; Gin, Tony; Chan, Matthew T.

In parallel, to enhance the cost-effectiveness of the clinical microbiology laboratories (CMLs), European laboratory professionals have streamlined their organization leading to amalgamation of activities and restructuring of their professional relationships with clinicians and public health specialists. Through this consolidation process, an operational model has emerged that combines large centralized clinical laboratories performing most tests on one high-throughput analytical platform connected to several distal laboratories dealing locally with urgent analyses at near point of care. The centralization of diagnostic services over a large geographical region has given rise to the concept of regional-scale \u201Cmicrobiology laboratories network.\u201D Although the volume-driven cost savings associated with such laboratory networks seem self-evident, the consequence(s) for the quality of patient care and infectious disease surveillance and control remain less obvious. In this article, we describe the range of opportunities that the changing landscape of CMLs in Europe can contribute toward improving the quality of patient care but also the early detection and enhanced surveillance of public health threats caused by infectious diseases. The success of this transformation of health services is reliant on the appropriate preparation in terms of staff, skills, and processes that would be inclusive of stakeholders. In addition, rigorous metrics are needed to set out more concrete laboratory service performance objectives and assess the expected benefits to society in terms of saving lives and preventing diseases.","publish_time":"2018-02-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vandenberg, Olivier; Kozlakidis, Zisis; Schrenzel, Jacques; Struelens, Marc Jean; Breuer, Judith","journal":"Front Med (Lausanne)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e0b5bbe1af91b80c9ac2fa22fea4d845c6230c8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5801420.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2018.00015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29457001/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["public health surveillance","quality of patient care","public health specialists","clinical microbiology laboratories","distal laboratories","enhanced surveillance of public health threats","transformation of health services","microbiology laboratories network","large centralized clinical laboratories","infectious disease surveillance","laboratory networks","near point of care","infectious diseases","European laboratory professionals","centralization of diagnostic services","terms of staff","concrete laboratory service performance objectives","large geographical region","changing landscape of CMLs","new innovative diagnostic approaches","tests","professional relationships","early detection","appropriate preparation","clinicians","urgent analyses","expected benefits","concept of regional","major impact","high-throughput analytical platform","restructuring","rise","organization","consequence","scale","years","control","operational model","volume-driven cost savings","processes","amalgamation of activities","range of opportunities","society","skills","cost-effectiveness","consolidation process","lives","success","addition","rigorous metrics","inclusive of stakeholders","article"],"language":"en"},

To assess local cultural attitudes towards bats for formulating a targeted conservation campaign, we conducted a survey of consumption practices of bats in 2013 at the eight major markets near Manado. Locals eat flying foxes at least once a month, but the frequency increases tenfold around Christian holidays. Approximately 500 metric tons of bats are imported from other provinces, with South Sulawesi as the main provider at 38%. No action has been taken to conserve the bats, as continued abundance in the market masks the effects of the bushmeat trade on wild populations. We suggest: (1) engaging churches as conduits for environmental education and quota enforcement; (2) legal regulation of interprovincial trade; (3) substituting bats with a sustainable option; (4) involving local students as campaigners to ensure higher receptiveness from local communities. Grassroots conservation initiatives combined with enforcement of existing laws aim to affect change on a local level, which has been successful in other conservation programs.

The fixation of duplications and insertions in 3\u2032 region of nsP3 genes from all lineages of alphaviruses, suggests they provide some fitness advantage.","publish_time":"2011-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aaskov, John; Jones, Anita; Choi, Wilson; Lowry, Kym; Stewart, Emerald","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/00cc4fafd19f95fa6462e630bd318892af8d142f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173084.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682210007439; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682210007439; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2010.11.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21185049/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Epidemic Polyarthritis","RRV"],"locations":["Pacific Islands","Australia"],"keyphrases":["lineages of RRV","region of nsP3 genes","nsP3 protein","lineages of alphaviruses","lineage of RRV","amino acid sequence P","coding","nsP3 gene of Ross River virus","amino acid sequence HADTVSLDSTVS","earlier lineages","Multiple copies","C-terminal region","new lineage","duplicated element","residents","major outbreak of Epidemic Polyarthritis","insertions","nucleotides","Pacific Islands","coinciding","appearance","time","Australia","elements","fixation of duplications","African origin","fitness advantage"],"language":"en"},

In temperate countries, seasonal activity of respiratory viruses has been reported, particularly in association with temperature, while inconsistent correlation of respiratory viral activity with humidity and rain is found in tropical countries. A retrospective study was performed from 1982-2008 to investigate the viral etiology of children (\u2264 5 years old) admitted with RTI in a tertiary hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. METHODS: A total of 10269 respiratory samples from all children \u2264 5 years old received at the hospital\u0027s diagnostic virology laboratory between 1982-2008 were included in the study. Immunofluorescence staining (for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1-3, and adenovirus) and virus isolation were performed. The yearly hospitalization rates and annual patterns of laboratory-confirmed viral RTIs were determined. Univariate ANOVA was used to analyse the demographic parameters of cases. Multiple regression and Spearman\u0027s rank correlation were used to analyse the correlation between RSV cases and meteorological parameters. RESULTS: A total of 2708 cases were laboratory-confirmed using immunofluorescence assays and viral cultures, with the most commonly detected being RSV (1913, 70.6%), parainfluenza viruses (357, 13.2%), influenza viruses (297, 11.0%), and adenovirus (141, 5.2%). Children infected with RSV were significantly younger, and children infected with influenza viruses were significantly older. The four main viruses caused disease throughout the year, with a seasonal peak observed for RSV in September-December. Monthly RSV cases were directly correlated with rain days, and inversely correlated with relative humidity and temperature. CONCLUSION: Viral RTIs, particularly due to RSV, are commonly detected in respiratory samples from hospitalized children in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. As in temperate countries, RSV infection in tropical Malaysia also caused seasonal yearly epidemics, and this has implications for prophylaxis and vaccination programmes.","publish_time":"2012-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khor, Chee-Sieng; Sam, I-Ching; Hooi, Poh-Sim; Quek, Kia-Fatt; Chan, Yoke-Fun","journal":"BMC Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a78a46678c2ec819d3c308e281b92dcee49bbb48.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3337250.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22429933/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2431-12-32","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Spearman"],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":["Kuala Lumpur","Malaysia"],"keyphrases":["RSV infection","Monthly RSV cases","respiratory samples","seasonal activity of respiratory viruses","viral etiology of children","viral RTIs","inconsistent correlation of respiratory viral activity","Viral respiratory tract infections","viral cultures","parainfluenza viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","tropical Malaysia","hospitalized children","temperate countries","main viruses","demographic parameters of cases","Southeast Asian tropical countries","Kuala Lumpur","seasonal yearly epidemics","years old","seasonal peak","temperature","total","adenovirus","annual patterns of laboratory","Spearman\u0027s rank correlation","hospital\u0027s diagnostic virology laboratory","Immunofluorescence staining","immunofluorescence assays","rain days","relative humidity","virus isolation","meteorological parameters","parainfluenza types","retrospective study","yearly hospitalization rates","implications","tertiary hospital","Multiple regression","BACKGROUND","prophylaxis","vaccination programmes","disease","association","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","METHODS","Univariate ANOVA"],"language":"en"},

Inefficient induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs are observed during infection of this group of viruses, suggesting that they may have evolved to escape the host immune surveillance for efficient survival. Recent studies have identified viral proteins regulating the innate immune signaling, and among these, nsp1 (nonstructural protein 1) is the most potent IFN antagonist. For porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), individual subunits (nsp1\u03B1 and nsp1\u03B2) of nsp1 suppress type I IFN production. In particular, PRRSV-nsp1\u03B1 degrades CREB (cyclic AMP responsive element binding)-binding protein (CBP), a key component of the IFN enhanceosome, whereas PRRSV-nsp1\u03B2 degrades karyopherin-\u03B11 which is known to mediate the nuclear import of ISGF3 (interferon-stimulated gene factor 3). All individual subunits of nsp1 of PRRSV, equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) appear to contain IFN suppressive activities. As with PRRSV-nsp1\u03B1, CBP degradation is evident by LDV-nsp1\u03B1 and partly by SHFV-nsp1\u03B3. This review summarizes the biogenesis and the role of individual subunits of nsp1 of arteriviruses for innate immune modulation.","publish_time":"2014-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Mingyuan; Yoo, Dongwan","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7334f0e1c2973f27bed7c437ed9849d7b494686d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114407.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25262851/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.09.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170214003943; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170214003943","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN","CBP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRSV-nsp1\u03B1","PRRSV-nsp1\u03B2","LDV-nsp1\u03B1","role of individual subunits of nsp1","immune cells","IFN enhanceosome","IFN production","innate immune modulation","equine arteritis virus","binding protein","respiratory syndrome virus","host immune surveillance","potent IFN antagonist","IFN suppressive activities","type","lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus","simian hemorrhagic fever virus","CBP degradation","Abstract Arteriviruses","nonstructural protein","SHFV-nsp1\u03B3","cyclic AMP responsive element binding","CREB","EAV","viral proteins","interferon-stimulated gene factor","Inefficient induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines","key component","nuclear import of ISGF3","IFNs","persistence","efficient survival","biogenesis","infection","Recent studies","karyopherin-\u03B11","infected hosts","group of viruses","review"],"language":"en"},

The vaccine shows high efficacy in preventing infection against HPV types 16 and 18 responsible for 70% of cervical cancer. However, to be most effective, the vaccine needs to be administered before exposure to the viruses and therefore, ideally, before young people become sexually active. The introduction of any new vaccine, and perhaps particularly one given to young teenage girls to prevent a sexually transmitted cancer-causing virus, has the potential to attract a great deal of media attention. This paper reports on content analysis of 344 articles published between January 2005 and December 2008 in 15 UK newspapers. It includes both manifest and latent analysis to examine newsprint media coverage of the introduction of the HPV vaccination programme and its role in HPV advocacy. We concluded that the newspapers were generally positive towards the new HPV vaccination and that over the 4 years period the newsworthiness of the HPV vaccination programme increased. In 2008 two events dominated coverage, firstly, the introduction of the HPV programme in September 2008 and secondly, in August 2008 the diagnosis on camera of cervical cancer given to Jade Goody, a 27 year old mother of two, who gained fame and notoriety in the UK through her participation in several reality television shows. There are two conclusions from this study. Firstly, the positive media coverage surrounding the introduction of the HPV vaccination programme is to be welcomed as it is likely to contribute towards influencing public perceptions about the acceptability and need for HPV vaccination. Secondly, the focus on prevalence rates of HPV infection among women and on women\u0027s sexual behaviours, in relation to HPV vaccination \u2018encouraging\u2019 promiscuity, is an unhelpful aspect of media coverage.","publish_time":"2010-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hilton, Shona; Hunt, Kate; Langan, Mairi; Bedford, Helen; Petticrew, Mark","journal":"Social Science \u0026 Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a5ef516f5458dfd7a221c905db137d6e5bd3a91.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2835855.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953609008417; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953609008417; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20064682/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.11.027","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Jade Goody"],"organizations":["UK","HPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HPV programme","HPV vaccination programme","new HPV vaccination","HPV types","HPV advocacy","introduction","prevalence rates of HPV infection","positive media coverage","immunisation programme","newsprint media coverage","unhelpful aspect of media coverage","new vaccine","UK newspapers","great deal of media attention","camera of cervical cancer","latent analysis","content analysis","years period","years of age","young people","young teenage girls","reality television shows","Jade Goody","women\u0027s sexual behaviours","potential","participation","relation","newsworthiness","role","human papillomavirus","high efficacy","transmitted cancer-causing virus","year old mother","focus","acceptability","promiscuity","paper reports","public perceptions","articles","fame","notoriety","diagnosis","exposure","schoolgirls","conclusions","study","viruses","Abstract","events"],"language":"en"},

This viral epidemic in China has led to the deaths of over 1800 people, mostly elderly or those with an underlying chronic disease or immunosuppressed state. This is the third serious Coronavirus outbreak in less than 20 years, following SARS in 2002\u20132003 and MERS in 2012. While human strains of Coronavirus are associated with about 15% of cases of the common cold, the SARS-CoV-2 may present with varying degrees of severity, from flu-like symptoms to death. It is currently believed that this deadly Coronavirus strain originated from wild animals at the Huanan market in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province. Bats, snakes and pangolins have been cited as potential carriers based on the sequence homology of CoV isolated from these animals and the viral nucleic acids of the virus isolated from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Extreme quarantine measures, including sealing off large cities, closing borders and confining people to their homes, were instituted in January 2020 to prevent spread of the virus, but by that time much of the damage had been done, as human-human transmission became evident. While these quarantine measures are necessary and have prevented a historical disaster along the lines of the Spanish flu, earlier recognition and earlier implementation of quarantine measures may have been even more effective. Lessons learned from SARS resulted in faster determination of the nucleic acid sequence and a more robust quarantine strategy. However, it is clear that finding an effective antiviral and developing a vaccine are still significant challenges.

Chronic (\u003E4 weeks) cough in children following ARI is associated with decreased quality-of-life scores and increased health and societal economic costs. We will determine whether a validated evidence-based cough algorithm, initiated when chronic cough is first diagnosed after presentation with ARI, improves clinical outcomes in children compared with usual care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multicentre, parallel group, open-label, randomised controlled trial, nested within a prospective cohort study in Southeast Queensland, Australia, is underway. 750 children aged \u003C15 years will be enrolled and followed weekly for 8 weeks after presenting with an ARI with cough. 214 children from this cohort with persistent cough at day 28 will be randomised to either early initiation of a cough management algorithm or usual care (107 per group). Randomisation is stratified by reason for presentation, site and total cough duration at day 28 (\u003C6 and \u22656 weeks). Demographic details, risk factors, clinical histories, examination findings, cost-of-illness data, an anterior nasal swab and parent and child exhaled carbon monoxide levels (when age appropriate) are collected at enrolment. Weekly contacts will collect cough status and cost-of-illness data. Additional nasal swabs are collected at days 28 and 56. The primary outcome is time-to-cough resolution. Secondary outcomes include direct and indirect costs of illness and the predictors of chronic cough postpresentation.

Uterine infection and abortion represent the major complaint in camelid veterinary practice. The major infectious organisms in endometritis and metritis are E. coli and Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus. Abortion rates due to infectious diseases vary from 10% to more than 70% in some areas. Leptospirosis, toxoplasmosis and chlamydiosis have been diagnosed as the major causes of abortion in llamas and alpacas. In camels, brucellosis and trypanosomiasis represent the major causes of infectious abortion in the Middle East and Africa. Mastitis is rare in South American camelids. The prevalence of subclinical udder infection in camels can reach very high proportions in dairy camels. Udder infections are primarily due to Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus. Neonatal mortality is primarily due to diarrhea following failure of passive transfer and exposure to E. coli, rotavirus, coronavirus, Coccidia and Salmonella.

Saaremaa, genetically closely related to Dobrava, is also known to induce HFRS, with low or no mortality. In this study, mice were inoculated with Dobrava and Saaremaa viruses to test for infectibility, lethality, viremia, nitric oxide production and antibody responses. Out of suckling mice intracerebrally inoculated with 50, 500 and 5000 focus-forming units of Dobrava virus, respectively, 1/8, 2/8 and 7/8 died within 18\u201326 days. In all but one of the lethally infected mice high levels of replicating virus were detected, and most were positive for neutralizing antibodies and showed elevated levels of nitric oxide production. All suckling mice intracerebrally inoculated with 50, 500, or 5000 focus-forming units of Saaremaa virus survived and all seroconverted. Clearly lower viral titers were observed for the Saaremaa virus-inoculated mice, also when sacrificed at day 18 after infection, compared to those in mice that died following Dobrava virus infection. Dobrava, Saaremaa, Puumala and Hantaan virus infections of adult mice were asymptomatic, and the anti-nucleocapsid protein IgG2a/IgG1-titer ratio was higher in mice inoculated with Dobrava virus than in those inoculated with Saaremaa virus. Elevated nitric oxide production was not detected in asymptomatically infected mice, and iNOS\u2212/\u2212 mice, like normal mice, cleared viremia.

If various issues directly related to health security risks could have been predicted accurately, public health and medical contingency plans might have been prepared and activated in advance of an epidemic such as COVID-19. This paper evaluates an important source of health security, the Global Health Security Index (2019), which provided data before the discovery of COVID-19 in December 2019. Therefore, it is possible to evaluate how countries might have been prepared for a global epidemic, or pandemic, and acted accordingly in an effective and timely manner. The GHS index numerical scores are calculated as the arithmetic (AM), geometric (GM), and harmonic (HM) means of six categories, where AM uses equal weights for each category. The GHS Index scores are regressed on the numerical score rankings of the six categories to check if the use of equal weights of 0.167 in the calculation of the GHS Index using AM is justified, with GM and HM providing a check of the robustness of the arithmetic mean. The highest weights are determined to be around 0.244-0.246, while the lowest weights are around 0.186-0.187 for AM. The ordinal GHS Index is regressed on the ordinal rankings of the six categories to check for the optimal weights in the calculation of the ordinal Global Health Security (GHS) Index, where the highest weight is 0.368, while the lowest is 0.142, so the estimated results are wider apart than for the numerical score rankings. Overall, Rapid Response and Detection and Reporting have the largest impacts on the GHS Index score, whereas Risk Environment and Prevention have the smallest effects. The quantitative and qualitative results are different when GM and HM are used.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Chia-Lin; McAleer, Michael","journal":"International journal of environmental research and public health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32370069/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17093161","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","Global Health","GHS Index","Global Health Security","Risk Environment and Prevention","GM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ordinal GHS Index","Global Health Security Index","GHS Index scores","GHS index numerical scores","ordinal Global Health Security","health security risks","public health","highest weights","lowest weights","important source of health security","numerical score rankings","categories","ordinal rankings","global epidemic","GM","optimal weights","check","use of equal weights","calculation","discovery of COVID","SARS-CoV","estimated results","qualitative results","arithmetic mean","medical contingency plans","well-documented history of SARS","Risk Environment","MERS","largest impacts","Detection","Reporting","Prevention","advisory aspects","discussion","robustness","smallest effects","various issues","Rapid Response","paper","virus","infectious diseases","volume of research","timely manner","outbreak","data","advance","pandemic","category","countries"],"language":"en"},

Maintenance resource management (MRM) or maintenance human factors (MHF) programs started with a unique, three-party research program. The aviation industry (airlines and repair stations), federal agencies (the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)), and the academic community came together to study specific safety issues in the technical operations environment (line and base maintenance facilities, maintenance, repair, and overhaul-MRO-facilities, as well as ramp operations). The FAA and NASA funded this research, university faculty members and students conducted the research activities, and the industry partners provided access to facilities and personnel. At an international level, the FAA and NASA, Transport Canada, and United Kingdom. Civil Aviation Authority participated in another three-way partnership that enabled information sharing among the researchers, regulators, and practitioners. This chapter also reviews some of the most commonly used incident review tools and the associated taxonomies. With the increased use of structured approach to incident investigation, the use of MRM programs moved from simple awareness programs to reactive error-correction programs, and subsequently matured to proactive, error-avoidance programs, paving the way for predictive trend analysis programs. Finally, this chapter reviews the influence of MRM programs on the safety culture in technical operations and identifies some emerging opportunities for continued research and development.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patankar, Manoj S.","journal":"Crew Resource Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ddd100faa8dd53b1e89abfcb15ab1e318ca4eaab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150112.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128129951000130; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128129951000130","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Technical Operations","FAA","Federal Aviation Administration","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","NASA","Civil Aviation Authority"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of MRM programs","influence of MRM programs","error-avoidance programs","simple awareness programs","reactive error-correction programs","NASA","research activities","three-party research program","continued research","FAA","chapter","predictive trend analysis programs","base maintenance facilities","technical operations environment","aviation industry","ramp operations","Federal Aviation Administration","overall safety culture","maintenance human factors","Maintenance resource management","specific safety issues","Civil Aviation Authority","incident investigation","repair stations","federal agencies","used incident review tools","industry partners","Space Administration","increased use of structured approach","typical training content","students","emerging opportunities","different delivery models","university faculty members","National Aeronautics","Transport Canada","MHF","airlines","brief historical overview","key findings","three-way partnership","associated taxonomies","information","outcomes","development","access","United Kingdom","overhaul-MRO","researchers","regulators","personnel","academic community","international level","practitioners"],"language":"en"},

Instead of detecting the pulse wave via pressure sensors, bioimpedance measurements can be performed to acquire minuscule changes in the conductivity of the tissue, caused by the pulse wave. This work presents a microcontroller-based bioimpedance measurement system, which has the capability to acquire impedance measurements from up to four independent channels simultaneously. By combining a problem-specific analog measurement circuit with a 24 bits analog-to-digital converter, the system is capable of acquiring 1000 impedances per second with a signal-to-noise ratio in a range from 92 to 96 dB. For data storage and analysis, the digitized data are sent via universal serial bus to a host PC. A graphical user interface filters and plots the data of all channels in real-time. The performance of the system regarding measuring constant impedances, as well as impedance changes over time is demonstrated. Two different applications for pulse wave analysis via multichannel bioimpedance measurements are presented. Additionally, first measurement results from a human subject are shown to demonstrate the system\u0027s applicability of analyzing the pulse wave morphology as well as the aortic pulse wave velocity.","publish_time":"2019-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kusche, Roman; Klimach, Paula; Ryschka, Martin","journal":"IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e6bac36c4925a7d385f9b945e955579d9bad02a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/tbcas.2018.2812222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29877824/; https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.09379v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjszOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Pulse wave analysis","pulse wave morphology","aortic pulse wave velocity","cardiovascular system","microcontroller-based bioimpedance measurement system","multichannel bioimpedance measurements","digitized data","data storage","measurement results","impedance changes","problem-specific analog measurement circuit","bits analog","minuscule changes","independent channels","measuring constant impedances","universal serial bus","digital converter","important method","pressure sensors","different applications","host PC","signal","information","system\u0027s applicability","tissue","capability","graphical user interface filters","human subject","range","noise ratio","conductivity","second","work","performance","time","dB"],"language":"en"},

However, disinfection guidelines for low-resource outbreak settings are inconsistent and not evidence-based. Methods A systematic review of surface disinfection efficacy studies was conducted to inform low-resource outbreak guideline development. Due to variation in experimental procedures, outcomes were synthesized in a narrative summary focusing on chlorine-based disinfection against seven pathogens with potential to produce outbreaks in low-resource settings (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella spp., hepatitis A virus, rotavirus, norovirus, Ebola virus). Results Data were extracted from 89 laboratory studies and made available, including 20 studies on relevant pathogens used in combination with surrogate data to determine minimum target concentration \u00D7 time (\u201CCT\u201D) factors. Stainless steel (68%) and chlorine-based disinfectants (56%) were most commonly tested. No consistent trend was seen in the influence of chlorine concentration and exposure time on disinfection efficacy. Disinfectant application mode; soil load; and surface type were frequently identified as influential factors in included studies. Conclusions This review highlights that surface disinfection efficacy estimates are strongly influenced by each study\u0027s experimental conditions. We therefore recommend laboratory testing to be followed by field-based testing/monitoring to ensure effectiveness is achieved in situ.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gallandat, Karin; Kolus, Riley C.; Julian, Timothy R.; Lantagne, Daniele S.","journal":"American journal of infection control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1977bbcbb1892c85dc50bd2f04e8c34876a34943.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655320303114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32442652/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655320303114?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.05.014","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs5OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chlorine-based disinfection","disinfection guidelines","surface disinfection efficacy estimates","systematic review of surface disinfection efficacy studies","laboratory studies","low-resource settings","chlorine-based disinfectants","low-resource outbreak settings","field-based testing","surface type","low-resource outbreak guideline development","influence of chlorine concentration","laboratory testing","exposure time","surrogate data","relevant pathogens","Ebola virus","Results Data","influential factors","experimental procedures","minimum target concentration","study\u0027s experimental conditions","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","Vibrio cholerae","hepatitis","Salmonella","soil load","combination","fomites","outcomes","rotavirus","norovirus","outbreaks","highlights","potential","Disinfectant application mode","narrative summary","contaminated surfaces","objects","effectiveness","monitoring","Methods","ABSTRACT Background Infectious diseases","variation","evidence","Conclusions","consistent trend","transmission route","Stainless steel","situ"],"language":"en"},

Dendritic cells (DCs), through uptake and presentation of antigens to T cells, initiate distinct immune responses to different infections. In this study, an attenuated TGEV (STC3) and a virulent TGEV (SHXB) were used to determine whether porcine DCs play an important role in pathogenetic differences between these two TGEVs. Our results showed that immature and mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) were susceptible to infection with SHXB and STC3. However, only SHXB inhibited Mo-DCs to activate T-cell proliferation by down-regulating the expression of cell\u2013surface markers and the secretion of cytokines in vitro. In addition, after 48h of SHXB infection, there was the impairment in the ability of porcine intestinal DCs to sample the antigen, to migrate from the villi to the lamina propria and to activate T-cell proliferation in vivo. In contrast, these abilities of intestinal DCs were enhanced in STC3-infected piglets. In conclusion, our results show that SHXB significantly impaired the functions of Mo-DCs and intestinal DCs in vitro and in vivo, while STC3 had the opposite effect. These differences may underlie the pathogenesis of virulent and attenuated TGEV in piglets, and could help us to develop a better strategy to prevent virulent TGEV infection.","publish_time":"2014-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Shanshan; Gao, Qi; Qin, Tao; Yin, Yinyan; Lin, Jian; Yu, Qinghua; Yang, Qian","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/67429a584e3520328633995356bf900afbeebb64.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117177.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24742951/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.03.017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113514001679; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113514001679","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SHXB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["porcine DCs","attenuated TGEV","virulent TGEV infection","SHXB inhibited Mo-DCs","abilities of intestinal DCs","ability of porcine intestinal DCs","T cells","results","h of SHXB infection","T-cell proliferation","STC3-infected piglets","pathogenesis of virulent","functions of Mo","expression of cell","mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells","Abstract Virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus","pathogenetic differences","high mortality","distinct immune responses","severe pathology","surface markers","presentation of antigens","important role","uptake","impairment","different infections","moderate clinical reactions","better strategy","secretion of cytokines","lamina propria","villi","contrast","study","TGEVs","opposite effect","addition","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

A vaccine to prevent maternal acquisition of HCMV during pregnancy is necessary to reduce the incidence of infant disease. The glycoprotein B (gB) \u002B MF59 adjuvant subunit vaccine platform is the most successful HCMV vaccine tested to-date, demonstrating approximately 50% efficacy in preventing HCMV acquisition in phase II trials. However, the mechanism of vaccine protection remains unknown. Plasma from 33 gB/MF59 vaccinees at peak immunogenicity was tested for gB epitope specificity as well as neutralizing and non-neutralizing anti-HCMV effector functions, and compared to an HCMV-seropositive cohort. gB/MF59 vaccination elicited IgG responses with gB-binding magnitude and avidity comparable to natural infection. Additionally, IgG subclass distribution was similar with predominant IgG1 and IgG3 responses induced by gB vaccination and HCMV infection. However, vaccine-elicited antibodies exhibited limited neutralization of the autologous virus, negligible neutralization of multiple heterologous strains, and limited binding responses against gB structural motifs targeted by neutralizing antibodies including AD-1, AD-2, and Domain I. Interestingly, vaccinees had high-magnitude IgG responses against AD-3 linear epitopes, demonstrating immunodominance against this non-neutralizing, cytosolic region. Finally, vaccine-elicited IgG robustly bound trimeric, membrane-associated gB on the surface of transfected or HCMV-infected cells and mediated virion phagocytosis, though were poor mediators of NK cell activation. Altogether, these data suggest that non-neutralizing antibody functions, including virion phagocytosis, likely played a role in the observed 50% vaccine-mediated protection against HCMV acquisition. Significance The CDC estimates that every hour, a child is born in the United States with permanent neurologic disability resulting from human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection \u2013 more than is caused by Down syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, and neural tube defects combined. A maternal vaccine to block transmission of HCMV to the developing fetus is a necessary intervention to prevent these adverse outcomes. The gB/MF59 vaccine is the most successful tested clinically to-date, achieving 50% reduction in HCMV acquisition.

Fundamental questions about circulating viruses and transmission routes remain. METHODS: We assessed routinely collected epidemiologic data for MERS-CoV cases reported in Saudi Arabia during 1 January\u2013 30 June 2015 and conducted a more detailed investigation of cases reported during February 2015. Available respiratory specimens were obtained for sequencing. RESULTS: During the study period, 216 MERS-CoV cases were reported. Full genome (n = 17) or spike gene sequences (n = 82) were obtained from 99 individuals. Most sequences (72 of 99 [73%]) formed a discrete, novel recombinant subclade (NRC-2015), which was detected in 6 regions and became predominant by June 2015. No clinical differences were noted between clades. Among 87 cases reported during February 2015, 13 had no recognized risks for secondary acquisition; 12 of these 13 also denied camel contact. Most viruses (8 of 9) from these 13 individuals belonged to NRC-2015. DISCUSSIONS: Our findings document the spread and eventual predominance of NRC-2015 in humans in Saudi Arabia during the first half of 2015. Our identification of cases without recognized risk factors but with similar virus sequences indicates the need for better understanding of risk factors for MERS-CoV transmission.","publish_time":"2016-06-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Assiri, Abdullah M.; Midgley, Claire M.; Abedi, Glen R.; Saeed, Abdulaziz Bin; Almasri, Malak M.; Lu, Xiaoyan; Al-Abdely, Hail M.; Abdalla, Osman; Mohammed, Mutaz; Algarni, Homoud S.; Alhakeem, Raafat F.; Sakthivel, Senthilkumar K.; Nooh, Randa; Alshayab, Zainab; Alessa, Mohammad; Srinivasamoorthy, Ganesh; AlQahtani, Saeed Yahya; Kheyami, Ali; HajOmar, Waleed Husein; Banaser, Talib M.; Esmaeel, Ahmad; Hall, Aron J.; Curns, Aaron T.; Tamin, Azaibi; Alsharef, Ali Abraheem; Erdman, Dean; Watson, John T.; Gerber, Susan I.","journal":"Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5348f31e9d907f0a613506d1423e16c4ac9290b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5712457.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27302191/; https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-pdf/214/5/712/17412544/jiw236.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiw236","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV cases","MERS-CoV transmission","identification of cases","detailed investigation of cases","recognized risk factors","humans","Saudi Arabia","viruses","individuals","severe respiratory illness","similar virus sequences","Available respiratory specimens","eventual predominance of NRC","spike gene sequences","better understanding of risk factors","recognized risks","transmission routes","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","need","spread","BACKGROUND","study period","epidemiologic data","findings","novel recombinant subclade","Fundamental questions","secondary acquisition","sequencing","clinical differences","clades","DISCUSSIONS","RESULTS","half","camel contact","regions","METHODS","genome"],"language":"en"},

Rapid point-of-care testing (POCT) for respiratory viruses might improve clinical care by reducing unnecessary antibiotic use, shortening length of hospital stay, improving influenza detection and treatment, and rationalising isolation facility use; however, insufficient evidence exists to support its use over standard clinical care. We aimed to assess the effect of routine POCT on a broad range of clinical outcomes including antibiotic use. METHODS: In this pragmatic, parallel-group, open-label, randomised controlled trial, we enrolled adults (aged \u226518 years) within 24 h of presenting to the emergency department or acute medical unit of a large UK hospital with acute respiratory illness or fever higher than 37\u00B75\u00B0C (\u22647 days duration), or both, over two winter seasons. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), via an internet-based allocation sequence with random permuted blocks, to have a molecular POC test for respiratory viruses or routine clinical care. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who received antibiotics while hospitalised (up to 30 days). Secondary outcomes included duration of antibiotics, proportion of patients receiving single doses or brief courses of antibiotics, length of stay, antiviral use, isolation facility use, and safety. Analysis was by modified intention to treat, excluding patients who declined intervention or were withdrawn for protocol violations. This study is registered with ISRCTN, number 90211642, and has been completed. FINDINGS: Between Jan 15, 2015, and April 30, 2015, and between Oct 1, 2015, and April 30, 2016, we enrolled 720 patients (362 assigned to POCT and 358 to routine care). Six patients withdrew or had protocol violations. 301 (84%) of 360 patients in the POCT group received antibiotics compared with 294 (83%) of 354 controls (difference 0\u00B76%, 95% CI \u22124\u00B79 to 6\u00B70; p=0\u00B784). Mean duration of antibiotics did not differ between groups (7\u00B72 days [SD 5\u00B71] in the POCT group vs 7\u00B77 days [4\u00B79] in the control group; difference \u22120\u00B74, 95% CI \u22121\u00B72 to 0\u00B74; p=0\u00B732). 50 (17%) of 301 patients treated with antibiotics in the POCT group received single doses or brief courses of antibiotics (\u003C48 h) compared with 26 (9%) of 294 patients in the control group (difference 7\u00B78%, 95% CI 2\u00B75 to 13\u00B71; p=0\u00B70047; number needed to test=13). Mean length of stay was shorter in the POCT group (5\u00B77 days [SD 6\u00B73]) than in the control group (6\u00B78 days [7\u00B77]; difference \u22121\u00B71, 95% CI \u22122\u00B72 to \u22120\u00B73; p=0\u00B70443). Appropriate antiviral treatment of influenza-positive patients was more common in the POCT group (52 [91%] of 57 patients) than in the control group (24 [65%] of 37 patients; difference 26\u00B74%, 95% CI 9\u00B76 to 43\u00B72; p=0\u00B70026; number needed to test=4). We found no differences in adverse outcomes between the groups (77 [21%] of 360 patients in the POCT group vs 88 [25%] of 354 patients in the control group; \u22123\u00B75%, \u22129\u00B77 to 2\u00B77; p=0\u00B729). INTERPRETATION: Routine use of molecular POCT for respiratory viruses did not reduce the proportion of patients treated with antibiotics. However, the primary outcome measure failed to capture differences in antibiotic use because many patients were started on antibiotics before the results of POCT could be made available. Although POCT was not associated with a reduction in the duration of antibiotics overall, more patients in the POCT group received single doses or brief courses of antibiotics than did patients in the control group. POCT was also associated with a reduced length of stay and improved influenza detection and antiviral use, and appeared to be safe.

No effective vaccine or treatment has been developed for SARS-coronavirus or FIP virus, both of which cause lethal diseases. It has been reported that a cyclophilin inhibitor, cyclosporin A (CsA), could inhibit the replication of coronaviruses. CsA is a well-known immunosuppressive drug that binds to cellular cyclophilins to inhibit calcineurin, a calcium-calmodulin-activated serine/threonine-specific phosphatase. The inhibition of calcineurin blocks the translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells from the cytosol into the nucleus, thus preventing the transcription of genes encoding cytokines such as interleukin-2. Cyclophilins are peptidyl-prolyl isomerases with physiological functions that have been described for many years to include chaperone and foldase activities. Also, many viruses require cyclophilins for replication; these include human immunodeficiency virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and hepatitis C virus.

To investigate the structural basis of HSV membrane fusion and identify new targets for inhibition, we have investigated the different membranotropic domains of HSV-1 gH envelope glycoprotein. We observed that fusion peptides when added exogenously are able to inhibit viral fusion likely by intercalating with viral fusion peptides upon adopting functional structure in membranes. Interestingly, peptides analogous to the predicted HSV-1 gH loop region inhibited viral plaque formation more significantly. Their inhibitory effect appears to be a consequence of their ability to partition into membranes and aggregate within them. Circular dichroism spectra showed that peptides self-associate in aqueous and lipidic solutions, therefore the inhibition of viral entry may occur via peptides association with their counterpart on wild-type gH. The antiviral activity of HSV-1 peptides tested provides an attractive basis for the development of new fusion peptide inhibitors corresponding to regions outside the fusion protein heptad repeat regions.","publish_time":"2008-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Galdiero, Stefania; Falanga, Annarita; Vitiello, Mariateresa; D\u2019Isanto, Marina; Cantisani, Marco; Kampanaraki, Aikaterini; Benedetti, Ettore; Browne, Helena; Galdiero, Massimiliano","journal":"Peptides","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae8f4598c2389bcb09eddaae7e30d0d1fb0c9a95.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172891.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18572274/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196978108002088; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2008.04.022; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196978108002088","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsxNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral fusion peptides","structural basis of HSV membrane fusion","predicted HSV","peptides association","peptides analogous","fusion protein heptad","peptides self-associate","anti-HSV therapy","antiviral activity of HSV","development of new fusion peptide inhibitors","inhibition of viral entry","different membranotropic domains of HSV","viral plaque formation","regions","attractive basis","membranes","gH loop region","wild-type gH","gH envelope glycoprotein","attractive target","new targets","lipidic solutions","counterpart","functional structure","Circular dichroism spectra","Herpes simplex virus","consequence","ability","inhibitory effect","aggregate"],"language":"en"},

Group A rotaviruses (RV-A) are the main etiological agent of acute viral gastroenteritis in infants and young children worldwide. Understanding the extent and causes of biases in codon usage is essential to the understanding of viral evolution. However, the factors shaping synonymous codon usage bias and nucleotide composition in human RV-A are currently unknown. In order to gain insight into these matters, we analyzed the codon usage and base composition constraints on the two genes that codify the two outer capsid proteins (VP4 [VP8*] and VP7) of 58 P[4]G2 RV-A strains isolated in Brazil and investigated the possible key evolutionary determinants of codon usage bias. The results of these studies revealed that the frequencies of codon usage in both RV-A proteins studied are significantly different than the ones used by human cells. In order to observe if similar trends of codon usage are found when RV-A complete genomes are considered, we compare these results with results found using a dataset of 10 reference strains for whom the complete codes of the 11 segments are known. Similar results were obtained using capsid proteins or complete genomes. The general correlations found between the position of each sequence on the first axis generated by correspondence analysis and the relative dinucleotide abundances indicate that codon usage in RV-A can also be strongly influenced by underlying biases in dinucleotide frequencies. CpG and GpC containing codons are markedly suppressed. Thus, the results of this study suggest that RV-A genomic biases are the result of the evolution of genome composition in relation to host adaptation and the ability to escape antiviral cell responses.","publish_time":"2011-01-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"G\u00F3mez, Mariela Mart\u00EDnez; Tort, Luis Fernando Lopez; de Mello Volotao, Eduardo; Recarey, Ricardo; Moratorio, Gonzalo; Musto, H\u00E9ctor; Leite, Jos\u00E9 Paulo G.; Cristina, Juan","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b4673cf125af9990a6e8dc146eaec13b3d25b015.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172681.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134811000098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21255687/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2011.01.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134811000098","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsxNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CpG"],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["frequencies of codon usage","human RV","synonymous codon usage bias","similar trends of codon usage","G2 RV","Similar results","possible key evolutionary determinants of codon usage bias","complete genomes","evolution of genome composition","nucleotide composition","outer capsid proteins","understanding of viral evolution","dinucleotide frequencies","genomic biases","underlying biases","complete codes","order","base composition constraints","reference strains","human cells","segments of double","relative dinucleotide abundances","main etiological agent of acute viral gastroenteritis","infants","ability","correspondence analysis","VP4","VP8","adaptation","genes","Brazil","young children","family Reoviridae","dataset","matters","factors","antiviral cell responses","Rotavirus genus","axis","VP7","stranded RNA","ones","study","studies","CpG","GpC","codons","general correlations","sequence","insight","extent","rotaviruses"],"language":"en"},

Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most important pathogen; however, emerging resistance of this organism to antimicrobial agents has affected empirical treatment of CAP. Atypical pathogens have been quite commonly identified in several prospective studies. The clinical significance of these pathogens (with the exception of Legionella spp) is not clear, partly because of the lack of rapid, standardised tests. Diagnostic evaluation of CAP is important for appropriate assessment of severity of illness and for establishment of the causative agent in the disease. Until better rapid diagnostic methods are developed, most patients will be treated empirically. Antimicrobials continue to be the mainstay of treatment, and decisions about specific agents are guided by several considerations that include spectrum of activity, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles. Several factors have been shown to be associated with a beneficial clinical outcome in patients with CAP. These factors include administration of antimicrobials in a timely manner, choice of antibiotic therapy, and the use of a critical pneumonia pathway. The appropriate use of vaccines against pneumococcal disease and influenza should be encouraged. Several guidelines for management of CAP have recently been published, the recommendations of which are reviewed.","publish_time":"2003-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"File, Thomas M","journal":"The Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce7967841d0be3469689d24ffe370fbb2a3c6966.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119317.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673603150210; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673603150210","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsxODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["management of CAP","Diagnostic evaluation of CAP","important pathogen","empirical treatment of","clinical course","diagnostic testing","mainstay of treatment","clinical significance","patients","factors","better rapid diagnostic methods","appropriate use of vaccines","beneficial clinical outcome","seminar reviews important features","antimicrobial agents","specific agents","pneumococcal disease","administration of antimicrobials","lack of rapid","Atypical pathogens","management issues of community","appropriate assessment of severity","critical pneumonia pathway","cause","light of new information","timely manner","emerging resistance","immunocompetent adults","illness","choice of antibiotic therapy","organism","spectrum of activity","establishment","considerations","Summary","decisions","causative agent","exception of Legionella spp","pharmacodynamic principles","standardised tests","influenza","Streptococcus pneumoniae","prevention","guidelines","prospective studies","recommendations"],"language":"en"},

Despite evidence-based guidelines, antibiotics are still commonly used to treat infections likely caused by respiratory viruses. In this study, we examined the temporal relationships between antibiotic usage and respiratory infections in the Republic of Korea. METHODS: The number of monthly antibiotic prescriptions and the incidence of acute respiratory tract infections between 2010 and 2015 at all primary care clinics were obtained from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. The monthly detection rates of respiratory viruses, including adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, human coronavirus, and human rhinovirus, were collected from Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cross-correlation analysis was conducted to quantify the temporal relationship between antibiotic use and respiratory virus activities as well as respiratory infections in primary clinics. RESULTS: The monthly use of different classes of antibiotic, including penicillins, other beta-lactam antibacterials, macrolides and quinolones, was significantly correlated with influenza virus activity. These correlations peaked at the 0-month lag with cross-correlation coefficients of 0.45 (p \u003C 0.01), 0.46 (p \u003C 0.01), 0.40 (p \u003C 0.01), and 0.35 (\u003C 0.01), respectively. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between acute bronchitis and antibiotics, including penicillin (0.73, p \u003C 0.01), macrolides (0.74, p \u003C 0.01), and quinolones (0.45, p \u003C 0.01), at the 0-month lag. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that there is a significant temporal relationship between influenza virus activity and antibiotic use in primary clinics. This relationship indicates that interventions aimed at reducing influenza cases in addition to effort to discourage the prescription of antibiotics by physicians may help to decrease unnecessary antibiotic consumption.","publish_time":"2018-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ryu, Sukhyun; Kim, Sojung; Kim, Bryan I.; Klein, Eili Y.; Yoon, Young Kyung; Chun, Byung Chul","journal":"Antimicrob Resist Infect Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b31dc72ffc01a849e4f2fce7ddd09067cfc82770.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5922305.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29736236/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13756-018-0347-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service","Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"],"locations":["Republic of Korea"],"keyphrases":["respiratory infections","antibiotic use","respiratory syncytial virus","respiratory virus activities","influenza virus activity","antibiotic usage","monthly use of different classes of antibiotic","incidence of acute respiratory tract infections","Inappropriate use of antibiotics","primary clinics","monthly detection rates of respiratory viruses","number of monthly antibiotic prescriptions","unnecessary antibiotic consumption","significant temporal relationship","influenza cases","prescription of antibiotics","significant correlation","primary care clinics","temporal relationships","cross-correlation coefficients","macrolides","quinolones","Cross-correlation analysis","month lag","human coronavirus","human rhinovirus","acute bronchitis","Korea Centers","Republic of Korea","adenovirus","penicillins","Korean Health Insurance Review","Assessment Service","beta-lactam antibacterials","effort","Disease Control","Prevention","addition","resistance","physicians","evidence-based guidelines","interventions","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","METHODS","findings","study","effectiveness","CONCLUSIONS","correlations"],"language":"en"},

STUDY DESIGN: We performed a diagnostic comparison study by testing nasopharyngeal samples on the two assays. Assay agreement was assessed by overall percent agreement and Cohen\u2019s kappa coefficient. RESULTS: A total of 184 nasopharyngeal samples were tested using the two assays, of which 180 showed valid results and were included for the comparative analysis. Overall percent agreement between the assays was 98.3 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 95.2\u201399.7) and kappa coefficient was 0.97 (95 % CI 0.93\u20131.0).

In the first, a Marxist view of inequity, society\u2013space is a \u2018structured coherence\u2019 \u2013 a sociospatial formation, whose territorial boundaries approximate politicojuridical boundaries.

The second, a post-structuralist/Foucauldian approach, sees society\u2013space as a \u2018strategic field\u2019. Space forms part of the technology of governance that constitutes subjects either as normal/abnormal, legal/illegal, or through states of exception \u2013 such as the enemy noncombatant or the illegal alien.

For accurate and sensitive detection of rotavirus RNA from stool samples by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the extraction process must be robust. However, some extraction methods may not remove the strong RT-PCR inhibitors known to be present in stool samples. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the performance of six extraction methods used commonly for extraction of rotavirus RNA from stool, which have never been formally evaluated: the MagNA Pure Compact, KingFisher Flex and NucliSENS\u00AE easyMAG\u00AE instruments, the NucliSENS\u00AE miniMAG\u00AE semi-automated system, and two manual purification kits, the QIAamp Viral RNA kit and a modified RNaid\u00AE kit. Using each method, total nucleic acid or RNA was extracted from eight rotavirus-positive stool samples with enzyme immunoassay optical density (EIA OD) values ranging from 0.176 to 3.098. Extracts prepared using the MagNA Pure Compact instrument yielded the most consistent results by qRT-PCR and conventional RT-PCR. When extracts prepared from a dilution series were extracted by the 6 methods and tested, rotavirus RNA was detected in all samples by qRT-PCR but by conventional RT-PCR testing, only the MagNA Pure Compact and KingFisher Flex extracts were positive in all cases. RT-PCR inhibitors were detected in extracts produced with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit. The findings of this study should prove useful for selection of extraction methods to be incorporated into future rotavirus detection and genotyping protocols.","publish_time":"2013-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Esona, Mathew D.; McDonald, Sharla; Kamili, Shifaq; Kerin, Tara; Gautam, Rashi; Bowen, Michael D.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/41dc9f76acf105489cebce52935679a9b1d90790.json; document_parses/pdf_json/988eb76f99bdb20992a35c3e9e5bdcd5105d58e5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4603280.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2013.08.023; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093413003558; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093413003558; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4603280?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24036075/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MagNA Pure Compact","KingFisher Flex","EIA OD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["extraction of rotavirus RNA","qRT-PCR","rotavirus-positive stool samples","conventional RT-PCR testing","strong RT-PCR inhibitors","QIAamp Viral RNA kit","sensitive detection of rotavirus RNA","selection of extraction methods","QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit","extraction process","KingFisher Flex extracts","future rotavirus detection","MagNA Pure Compact instrument","NucliSENS","study","major cause of viral gastroenteritis","enzyme immunoassay optical density","reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","manual purification kits","EIA OD","semi-automated system","consistent results","modified RNaid","miniMAG","instruments","easyMAG","values","children","total nucleic acid","genotyping protocols","Rotaviruses","cases","dilution series","findings","performance","objective"],"language":"en"},

There was very high nucleotide and amino acid identity between canine strain RV198/95 and other canine strains, and to the human strain HCR3A. Strain RV52/96, however, was found to have about 95% identity to the G3 serotype canine strains K9, A79-10 and CU-1 and 96% identity to strain RV198/95 and to the simian strain RRV. Therefore both of the canine strains belong to the G3 serotype. Nevertheless, detailed analysis of the VP7 variable regions revealed that RV52/96 possesses amino acid substitutions uncommon to the other canine isolates. In addition, strain RV52/96 exhibited a nucleotide divergence greater than 16% from all the other canine strains studied; however, it revealed the closest identity (90.4%) to the simian strain RRV. With only a few exceptions, phylogenetic analysis allowed clear differentiation of the G3 rotaviruses on the basis of the species of origin.

In this study, we show that reducing the levels of expression of CtsW reduces viral titers for different subtypes of IAV, and we map the target step of CtsW requirement to viral entry. Using a set of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting CtsW, we demonstrate that knockdown of CtsW results in a decrease of IAV nucleoprotein accumulation in the nuclei of infected cells at 3 h postinfection. Assays specific for the individual stages of IAV entry further show that attachment, internalization, and early endosomal trafficking are not affected by CtsW knockdown. However, we detected impaired escape of viral particles from late endosomes in CtsW knockdown cells. Moreover, fusion analysis with a dual-labeled influenza virus revealed a significant reduction in fusion events, with no detectable impact on endosomal pH, suggesting that CtsW is required at the stage of viral fusion. The defect in IAV entry upon CtsW knockdown could be rescued by ectopic expression of wild-type CtsW but not by the expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of CtsW, suggesting that the proteolytic activity of CtsW is required for successful entry of IAV. Our results establish CtsW as an important host factor for entry of IAV into target cells and suggest that CtsW could be a promising target for the development of future antiviral drugs.","publish_time":"2015-06-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Edinger, Thomas O.; Pohl, Marie O.; Y\u00E1ng\u00FCez, Emilio; Stertz, Silke","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8de34443c38db9422b06a2f583416660f1dca670.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4462628.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26060270/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00297-15","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["type CtsW","CtsW knockdown cells","knockdown of CtsW results","proteolytic activity of CtsW","inactive mutant of CtsW","target step of CtsW requirement","viral entry","successful entry of IAV","individual stages of IAV entry","target cells","different subtypes of IAV","stage of viral fusion","viral titers","decrease of IAV nucleoprotein accumulation","promising target","influenza virus","levels of expression","fusion events","fusion analysis","impaired escape of viral particles","nuclei of infected cells","ectopic expression of wild","endosomal pH","early endosomal trafficking","late endosomes","important host factor","RNAi","screen","detectable impact","siRNAs","internalization","significant reduction","genome-wide RNA interference","attachment","set of small interfering RNAs","development of future antiviral drugs","defect","Assays specific","h postinfection","Human cathepsin W","replication","cysteine protease","study"],"language":"en"},

In this study, which began in 2010, we surveyed EV-D68 in children with ARIs and analyzed sequences of EV-D68 strains detected. Real-time PCR of 19 respiratory viruses or subtypes of viruses, including enterovirus, was performed on 2,215 specimens from ARI patients (\u003C10 years of age) collected between November 2010 and December 2015 in Osaka City, Japan. EV-D68 was identified in 18 enterovirus-positive specimens (n = 4 in 2013, n = 1 in 2014, and n = 13 in 2015) by analysis of viral protein 1 (VP1) or VP4 sequences, followed by a BLAST search for similar sequences. All EV-D68 strains were detected between June and October (summer to autumn), except for one strain detected in 2014. A phylogenetic analysis of available VP1 sequences revealed that the Osaka strains detected in 2010, 2013, and 2015 belonged to distinct clusters (Clades C, A, and B [Subclade B3], respectively). Comparison of the 5\u2032 untranslated regions of these viruses showed that Osaka strains in Clades A, B (Subclade B3), and C commonly had deletions at nucleotide positions 681\u2013703 corresponding to the prototype Fermon strain. Clades B and C had deletions from nucleotide positions 713\u2013724. Since the EV-D68 epidemic in 2010, EV-D68 re-emerged in Osaka City, Japan, in 2013 and 2015. Results of this study indicate that distinct clades of EV-D68 contributed to re-emergences of this virus in 2010, 2013, and 2015 in this limited region.","publish_time":"2017-09-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kaida, Atsushi; Iritani, Nobuhiro; Yamamoto, Seiji P.; Kanbayashi, Daiki; Hirai, Yuki; Togawa, Masao; Amo, Kiyoko; Kohdera, Urara; Nishigaki, Toshinori; Shiomi, Masashi; Asai, Sadasaburo; Kageyama, Tsutomu; Kubo, Hideyuki","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/60d5290b70e9b780174187da93ecf4392b97539d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5597212.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28902862/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ARIs","Clades"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Osaka City","Japan"],"keyphrases":["EV-D68 strains","sequences of EV","EV-D68 epidemic","distinct clades of EV","Osaka strains","upsurge of enterovirus D68","Osaka City","Clades C","Clades B","Japan","respiratory viruses","VP4 sequences","similar sequences","subtypes of viruses","phylogenetic analysis of available VP1 sequences","deletions","nucleotide positions","enterovirus-positive specimens","Subclade B3","study","distinct clusters","analysis of viral protein","prototype Fermon strain","causative agent of acute respiratory infections","BLAST search","re-emergences","children","ARI patients","Real-time PCR","untranslated regions","years of age","Comparison","autumn","Results","limited region","summer"],"language":"en"},

A maternal vaccine may protect both the mother and infant from RSV illness. The epidemiology and clinical presentation of RSV in pregnant and postpartum women is not well-described. METHODS: Data were collected from a prospective, randomized trial of influenza immunization in pregnant women in rural southern Nepal. Women were enrolled in their second trimester of pregnancy and followed until six months postpartum. Active weekly home-based surveillance for febrile respiratory illness was performed. Mid-nasal swabs collected with episodes of respiratory illness were tested for RSV by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: RSV was detected in 14 (0.4%) illness episodes in 3693 women over 3554 person-years of surveillance from 2011\u20132014. RSV incidence was 3.9/1000 person-years overall, and 11.8/1000 person-years between September and December. Seven (50%) women sought care for RSV illness; none died. Of the 7 (50%) illness episodes during pregnancy, all had live births with 2 (29%) preterm births and a median birthweight of 3060 grams. This compares to 469 (13%) preterm births and a median birthweight of 2790 grams in women without RSV during pregnancy. Of the 7 mothers with postpartum RSV infection, RSV was detected in 4 (57%) of their infants. CONCLUSIONS: RSV was an uncommon cause of febrile respiratory illness in mothers during pregnancy in Nepal. These data will inform prevention and therapeutic strategies against RSV in resource-limited settings.","publish_time":"2016-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chu, Helen Y.; Katz, Joanne; Tielsch, James; Khatry, Subarna K.; Shrestha, Laxman; LeClerq, Steven C.; Magaret, Amalia; Kuypers, Jane; Steinhoff, Mark C.; Englund, Janet A.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33d46081e98cd5a3b1152ecee6361ae8f9f89ea9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4816499.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0152015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27031702/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjszMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RSV illness","RSV incidence","postpartum RSV infection","illness episodes","clinical presentation of RSV","episodes of respiratory illness","postpartum women","pregnant women","uncommon cause of febrile respiratory illness","person-years","trimester of pregnancy","preterm births","Respiratory syncytial virus","mothers","median birthweight","months postpartum","grams","live births","Data","rural southern Nepal","important cause of viral pneumonia","Active weekly home-based surveillance","randomized trial of influenza immunization","therapeutic strategies","real-time polymerase chain reaction","children","resource-limited settings","Mid-nasal swabs","prevention","BACKGROUND","epidemiology","CONCLUSIONS","care","maternal vaccine","METHODS","RESULTS","infants"],"language":"en"},

A convenience sample of 100 dairies throughout California, providing a study population of 4,636 calves, were visited between May 2014 and April 2016. During each farm visit, in-person interviews with the herd manager or calf caretaker were conducted to collect information about herd demographics, maternity pen, colostrum and calf management, herd vaccinations, and dust abatement. A random sample of preweaned calves was identified and evaluated for the presence of BRD using a standardized tool. A survey-adjusted generalized linear mixed model with a logit link function was fitted with calf as the unit of analysis and dairy as the random effect. Mean study herd size (\u00B1SE) was 1,718 (\u00B1189.9) cows. Survey-adjusted estimates of breed types in the sample were 81.6% (\u00B10.6) Holstein, 13.1% (\u00B10.4) Jersey, and 5.3% (\u00B10.5) crossbred or other purebred breeds, and calf sex proportions were 73.8% (\u00B11.0) female and 26.2% (\u00B11.0) male. Overall survey-adjusted BRD prevalence in the study herds was 6.91% (\u00B10.69). Housing factors positively associated with BRD were metal hutches compared with wood hutches [odds ratio (OR) = 11.19; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.80\u201344.78], calf-to-calf contact in calves \u003E75 d of age (OR = 9.95, 95% CI = 1.50\u201365.86), feeding Holstein calves \u003C2.84 L of milk or replacer per day (OR = 7.16, 95% CI = 1.23\u201341.68), and lagoon water used for flushing manure under hutches compared with no flush (OR = 12.06, 95% CI = 1.93\u201375.47).

Cyclophilin inhibitors such as alisporivir have shown strong anti\u2013hepatitis C virus activity in vitro and in clinical studies. However, little is known about whether hepatocyte cyclophilins are involved in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) life cycle. We investigated the effects of 2 cyclophilin inhibitors (alisporivir and NIM811) on HBV replication and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) production in cell lines. METHODS: Liver-derived cell lines producing full-length HBV and HBsAg particles, owing to stable (HepG2215) or transient (HuH-7) transfection, or infected with HBV (HepaRG cells; Invitrogen [Carlsbad, CA]), were incubated with alisporivir or NIM811 alone, or alisporivir in combination with a direct antiviral (telbivudine). The roles of individual cyclophilins in drug response was evaluated by small interfering RNA knockdown of cyclophilin (CYP)A, CYPC, or CYPD in HepG2215 cells, or CYPA knockdown in HuH-7 cells. The kinetics of antiviral activity were assessed based on levels of HBV DNA and HBsAg and Southern blot analysis. RESULTS: In HepG2215, HuH-7, and HepaRG cells, alisporivir reduced intracellular and secreted HBV DNA, in a dose-dependent manner. Knockdown of CYPA, CYPC, or CYPD (reduced by 80%) significantly reduced levels of HBV DNA and secreted HBsAg. Knockdown of CYPA significantly reduced secretion of HBsAg, leading to accumulation of intracellular HBsAg; the addition of alisporivir greatly reduced levels of HBsAg in these cells. The combination of alisporivir and telbivudine had greater antiviral effects than those of telbivudine or alisporivir alone. CONCLUSIONS: Alisporivir inhibition of cyclophilins in hepatocyte cell lines reduces replication of HBV DNA and HBsAg production and secretion. These effects are potentiated in combination with direct antiviral agents that target HBV-DNA polymerase.","publish_time":"2014-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Phillips, Sandra; Chokshi, Shilpa; Chatterji, Udayan; Riva, Antonio; Bobardt, Michael; Williams, Roger; Gallay, Philippe; Naoumov, Nikolai V.","journal":"Gastroenterology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b95b96d1faf8d2fb5324ca5d068ff081be6eff1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172380.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25305505/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016508514011998; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0016508514011998; https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2014.10.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjszMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BACKGROUND","HBV","Invitrogen","CYPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HBV replication","combination of alisporivir","replication of HBV DNA","reduced levels of HBV DNA","secreted HBV DNA","reduced levels of HBsAg","full-length HBV","HBV-DNA polymerase","HBsAg production","secreted HBsAg","addition of alisporivir","reduced secretion of HBsAg","Alisporivir inhibition of cyclophilins","HBsAg particles","HepG2215 cells","accumulation of intracellular HBsAg","HepaRG cells","CYPA knockdown","Knockdown of CYPA","hepatitis B virus","hepatitis C virus replication","hepatocyte cyclophilins","telbivudine","hepatitis C virus activity","hepatocyte cell lines","greater antiviral effects","Cyclophilin inhibitors","direct antiviral agents","kinetics of antiviral activity","hepatitis B surface antigen","Liver-derived cell lines","roles of individual cyclophilins","small interfering RNA knockdown of cyclophilin","NIM811","CYPC","CYPD","host factors","drug response","Invitrogen","Southern blot analysis","life cycle","AIMS","Carlsbad","METHODS","clinical studies","dose-dependent manner","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","transfection","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

However, some experimental and clinical studies have suggested that the pathogenesis of acute lung injury in influenza virus infections is associated with excessive host response including a cell-mediated immune reaction. During the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza A virus infections in Korea, we experienced a dramatic effect of immune-modulators (corticosteroids) on the patients with severe pneumonia who had significant respiratory distress at presentation and those who showed rapidly progressive pneumonia during oseltamivir treatment. We also found that the pneumonia patients treated with corticosteroids showed the lowest lymphocyte differential and that the severity of pneumonia was associated with the lymphocyte count at presentation. From our findings and previous experimental and clinical studies, we postulated that hyperactive immune cells (T cells) may be involved in the acute lung injury of influenza virus infections, using a hypothesis of \u2018protein homeostasis system\u2019; the inducers of the cell-mediated immune response are initially produced at the primary immune sites by the innate immune system. These substances reach the lung cells, the main target organ, via the systemic circulation, and possibly the cells of other organs, including myocytes or central nerve system cells, leading to extrapulmonary symptoms (e.g., myalgia and rhabdomyolysis, and encephalopathy). To control these substances that may be possibly toxic to host cells, the adaptive immune reaction may be operated by immune cells, mainly lymphocytes. Hyperimmune reaction of immune cells produces higher levels of cytokines which may be associated with acute lung injury, and may be controlled by early use of immune-modulators. Early initiation and proper dosage of immune-modulators with antiviral agents for severe pneumonia patients may reduce morbidity and prevent progressive fatal pneumonia.","publish_time":"2011-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Kyung-Yil; Rhim, Jung-Woo; Kang, Jin-Han","journal":"Medical Hypotheses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8502bbc9c55829306187ff46b78832fa8af095fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131389.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987710003361; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2010.08.032; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987710003361; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20822853/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjszNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung cells","hyperactive immune cells","immune response","Hyperimmune reaction of immune cells","innate immune system","adaptive immune reaction","early use of immune","acute lung injury of influenza virus infections","T cells","proper dosage of immune","primary immune sites","dramatic effect of immune","progressive pneumonia","pathogenesis of acute lung injury","severe pneumonia patients","lung tissues","severity of pneumonia","central nerve system cells","modulators","progressive fatal pneumonia","virus-induced cytopathy","corticosteroids","upper respiratory tract","clinical studies","lower respiratory tract","presentation","substances","significant respiratory distress","protein homeostasis system","excessive host response","Early initiation","lymphocyte count","lowest lymphocyte differential","antiviral agents","myocytes","hypothesis","morbidity","main target organ","higher levels of cytokines","extrapulmonary symptoms","inducers","Korea","systemic circulation","myalgia","viruses","organs","findings","pandemic H1N1","rhabdomyolysis","oseltamivir treatment","encephalopathy","lymphocytes","Summary"],"language":"en"},

We review the different causes of thrombocytosis in childhood, the differential diagnosis, and the available treatments in case of extreme thrombocytosis.","publish_time":"2014-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Lama Caro-Pat\u00F3n, G.; Garc\u00EDa-Salido, A.; Iglesias-Bouzas, M.

We conducted quantification of viral RNA in cell culture supernatants and immunofluorescent staining for the detection of PDCoV or PEDV antigen in two primary bovine cell types inoculated with the PDCoV strain OH-FD22 or PEDV strain PC22-P40 grown in LLC-PK or Vero cells, respectively, and supplemented with 1.25\u223C5 \u03BCg/mL of trypsin in the cell culture medium. The primary cells were isolated from the kidney or heart of a gnotobiotic calf, and both cell types were vimentin-positive, but E-Cadherin-negative, resembling mesenchymal cells. Similar to the previous in vivo observation, cytopathic effects (CPE) that consisted of enlarged and rounded cells, followed by cell shrinkage and detachment, were identified in the two primary cell types inoculated with PDCoV. Unexpectedly, similar CPE was also identified in the two cell types inoculated with PEDV. High PDCoV or PEDV RNA titers and PDCoV or PEDV antigens were detected in the cell culture supernatants and CPE-positive cells, respectively.

However, the methodology and results of these studies have varied, and there has been no systematic review of MERS. This study reviews the characteristics and associated risk factors of MERS. METHOD: We searched international (PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane) and Korean databases (DBpia, KISS) for English- or Korean-language articles using the terms \u201CMERS\u201D and \u201CMiddle East respiratory syndrome\u201D. Only human studies with \u003E 20 participants were analysed to exclude studies with low representation. Epidemiologic studies with information on transmissibility and severity of MERS as well as studies containing MERS risk factors were included. RESULT: A total of 59 studies were included. Most studies from Saudi Arabia reported higher mortality (22\u201369.2%) than those from South Korea (20.4%). While the R(0) value in Saudi Arabia was \u003C 1 in all but one study, in South Korea, the R(0) value was 2.5\u20138.09 in the early stage and decreased to \u003C 1 in the later stage. The incubation period was 4.5\u20135.2 days in Saudi Arabia and 6\u20137.8 days in South Korea. Duration from onset was 4\u201310 days to confirmation, 2.9\u20135.3 days to hospitalization, 11\u201317 days to death, and 14\u201320 days to discharge. Older age and concomitant disease were the most common factors related to MERS infection, severity, and mortality. CONCLUSION: The transmissibility and severity of MERS differed by outbreak region and patient characteristics. Further studies assessing the risk of MERS should consider these factors.","publish_time":"2018-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Ji-Eun; Jung, Soyoung; Kim, Aeran; Park, Ji-Eun","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e29425dbc37811e314513aed5880fbd088f52971.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5930778.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29716568/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-018-5484-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjszODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["severity of MERS","risk of MERS","days","MERS infection","MERS risk factors","Epidemiologic studies","human studies","associated risk factors of MERS","systematic review of MERS","transmissibility","Saudi Arabia","South Korea","common factors","Middle East respiratory syndrome","study","value","Korean databases","patient characteristics","higher mortality","early stage","later stage","Korean-language articles","Cochrane","ScienceDirect","DBpia","English","concomitant disease","KISS","terms","outbreak region","information","PubMed","BACKGROUND","Older age","participants","onset","incubation period","methodology","results","low representation","total","CONCLUSION","confirmation","hospitalization","death","Duration"],"language":"en"},

The result showed that the combination of certain chloroquine analogs and Akt inhibitors are highly effective. In particular, the chloroquine analog N\u2032-(7-fluoro-quinolin-4-yl)-N,N-dimethyl-ethane-1,2-diamine (compound 5) was highly effective in sensitizing cancer cell killing when combined with either Akt inhibitor 8 (1-{1-[4-(7-phenyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-g]quinoxalin-6-yl)-benzyl]-piperidin-4-yl}-1,3-dihydro-benzoimidazol-2-one) or 9 ([4-(2-chloro-4a,10a-dihydro-phenoxazin-10-yl)-butyl]-diethyl-amine hydrochloride). Importantly, the enhancement of chloroquine analogs 5 on cell killing by Akt inhibitors 8 and 9 was cancer-specific. Thus, this combinational approach is highly promising in controlling tumors with a minimum side effect.

Qualified personnel with adequate technical and managerial skills comprise an integral component of any quality assured laboratory. Training a new generation of TB laboratory specialists was identified as a critical priority in the European Union /European Economic Area (EU/EEA). A tailored training programme for TB reference laboratory professionals was developed and implemented within the European Reference Laboratory Network for Tuberculosis to increase the pool of technical experts available to step into leadership roles in the TB laboratory community. Three cohorts of selected laboratory specialists participated in a series of trainings from 2009 to 2016. METHODS: We conducted an evaluation of the training programme using a structured questionnaire administered via the EUSurvey website, with the aim of documenting the benefits and contribution as well as suggesting improvements and future direction of the programme. All graduated participants and all current ERLTB-Net members were invited to participate in the online survey and descriptive quantitative analysis was performed. RESULTS: The evaluation found significant benefits for both the participants and the participants\u2019 institutions, with improvements being reported in laboratory practices and management including implementation of new diagnostic techniques and career progression for participants. The training programme differed from other international and European initiatives in a number of important ways; the curriculum is unique in the scope and range of topics covered; the programme targets senior level professionals and future directors; cohorts were limited to 8\u201310 participants; and the programme involved a number of workshops (5\u20137) taking place over a two-year period. Relationships and collaborations established between individuals and institutions were valued as an important success of the initiative. Suggestions on how the impact of the programme could be enhanced included equipping participants to perform laboratory assessments in low-resource settings outside the EU, thus bolstering global TB control. CONCLUSION: Based on the findings presented the training programme has proved to be successful in developing leadership, expertise, partnerships and networks to support TB laboratories and has contributed significant benefits to strengthening European National Reference laboratories in the fight against TB.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Raftery, Philomena; K\u00F6dm\u00F6n, Csaba; van der Werf, Marieke J.; Nikolayevskyy, Vladyslav","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6843b894fdcd6bd53bae86f07a3b9cd71442412.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7212721.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32393246/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-05240-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EU/EEA","European Reference Laboratory Network for Tuberculosis","EU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TB laboratory community","TB reference laboratory professionals","TB laboratories","tailored training programme","laboratory assessments","laboratory practices","European Reference Laboratory Network","new generation of TB laboratory specialists","quality assured laboratory","global TB control","cohorts of selected laboratory specialists","European Union","European initiatives","European National Reference laboratories","equipping participants","graduated participants","significant benefits","European Economic Area","Tuberculosis","improvements","evaluation","number of important ways","leadership roles","developing leadership","future directors","important success","future direction","control programmes","participants\u2019 institutions","number of workshops","senior level professionals","implementation of new diagnostic techniques","pool of technical experts available","step","managerial skills","integral component","management","partnerships","career progression","low-resource settings","expertise","curriculum","structured questionnaire","networks","critical priority","fight","Qualified personnel","current ERLTB-Net members","online survey","descriptive quantitative analysis","scope","EUSurvey website","clinical care","aim","range of topics","EEA","public health","collaborations","individuals","series of trainings","contribution","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","findings","place","two-year period","Relationships","impact","Suggestions","CONCLUSION","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

This study examined the prevalence and genetic diversity of these BECs in diarrheic calves in South Korea. Among a total of 645 diarrheic fecal specimens obtained from 629 cattle herds, these unclassified BECs were detected in 59 (9.1%) diarrheic fecal samples from 57 herds (9.3%) by either RT-PCR or nested PCR. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the partial RdRp gene showed that all the Korean BECs clustered together and were closely related to the NB-like viruses (80.9\u201388.1% nucleotide and 84.5\u201398.4% amino acid) but not to the NA1-like viruses (75.8\u201378.4% nucleotide and 79.7\u201382.8% amino acid). Although these viruses could not be classified into NA1- and NB-like viruses from the sequence and phylogenetic data of the entire capsid gene, all the Korean BECs clustered together on a branch separate from the other known BECs. These results show that these BEC infections are endemic in diarrheic calves in South Korea.

SHIRI will describe the frequency of influenza virus infections among HCP, identify predictors of vaccine acceptance, examine how repeated influenza vaccination may modify immunogenicity, and evaluate influenza vaccine effectiveness in preventing influenza illness and missed work. METHODS: Cohort enrollment began in October, 2016; a second year of the study and a second wave of cohort enrollment began in June 2017. The study will run for at least 3 years and will follow approximately 2000 HCP (who are both employees and members of Clalit Health Services [CHS]) with routine direct patient contact. Eligible HCP are recruited using a stratified sampling strategy. After informed consent, participants complete a brief enrollment survey with questions about occupational responsibilities and knowledge, attitudes, and practices about influenza vaccines. Blood samples are collected at enrollment and at the end of influenza season; HCP who choose to be vaccinated contribute additional blood one month after vaccination. During the influenza season, participants receive twice-weekly short message service (SMS) messages asking them if they have acute respiratory illness or febrile illness (ARFI) symptoms. Ill participants receive follow-up SMS messages to confirm illness symptoms and duration and are asked to self-collect a nasal swab. Information on socio-economic characteristics, current and past medical conditions, medical care utilization and vaccination history is extracted from the CHS database. Information about missed work due to illness is obtained by self-report and from employee records. Respiratory specimens from self-collected nasal swabs are tested for influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and coronaviruses using validated multiplex quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. The hemagglutination inhibition assay will be used to detect the presence of neutralizing influenza antibodies in serum. DISCUSSION: SHIRI will expand our knowledge of the burden of respiratory viral infections among HCP and the effectiveness of current and repeated annual influenza vaccination in preventing influenza illness, medical utilization, and missed workdays among HCP who are in direct contact with patients.

Its receptor-binding motif (S-RBM) is located between residues 424 and 494, which folds into 2 anti-parallel \u03B2-sheets, \u03B25 and \u03B26. We have previously demonstrated that fragment 450\u2013650 of the S protein (S450\u2013650) is predominantly recognized by convalescent sera of SARS patients. The N-terminal 60 residues (450\u2013510) of the S450\u2013650 fragment covers the entire \u03B26 strand of S-RBM. In the present study, we demonstrate that patient sera predominantly recognized 2 linear epitopes outside the \u03B26 fragment, while the mouse antisera, induced by immunization of BALB/c mice with recombinant S450\u2013650, mainly recognized the \u03B26 strand-containing region. Unlike patient sera, however, the mouse antisera were unable to inhibit the infectivity of S protein-expressing (SARS-CoV-S) pseudovirus. Fusion protein between green fluorescence protein (GFP) and S450\u2013650 (S450\u2013650-GFP) was able to stain Vero E6 cells and deletion of the \u03B26 fragment rendered the fusion product (S511\u2013650-GFP) unable to do so. Similarly, recombinant S450\u2013650, but not S511\u2013650, was able to block the infection of Vero E6 cells by the SARS-CoV-S pseudovirus. Co-precipitation experiments confirmed that S450\u2013650 was able to specifically bind with ACE2 molecules in lysate of Vero E6 cells. However, the ability of S450\u2013510, either alone or in fusion with GFP, to bind with ACE2 was significantly poorer compared with S450\u2013650. Our data suggest a possibility that, although the \u03B26 strand alone is able to bind with ACE2 with relatively high affinity, residues outside the S-RBM could also assist the receptor binding of SARS-CoV-S protein.","publish_time":"2007-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Jincun; Wang, Wei; Yuan, Zhihong; Jia, Rujing; Zhao, Zhendong; Xu, Xiaojun; Lv, Ping; Zhang, Yan; Jiang, Chengyu; Gao, Xiao-Ming","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc8292af4f471e661f0a74093046bf75ae1da1af.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103343.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682206006775; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682206006775","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","BALB","Vero"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CoV-S protein","S-RBM","S pseudovirus","recombinant S450","infectivity of S protein","SARS-CoV","\u03B26 fragment","ability of S450","entire \u03B26 strand of S","Fusion protein","protein of SARS coronavirus","GFP","receptor binding of SARS","ACE2 molecules","residues","convalescent sera of SARS patients","green fluorescence protein","lysate of Vero E6 cells","infection of Vero E6 cells","patient sera","viral binding","mouse antisera","receptor-binding motif","fusion product","S511","immunization of BALB","\u03B25","c mice","linear epitopes","deletion","anti-parallel \u03B2-sheets","high affinity","Co-precipitation experiments","possibility","spike","present study","N-terminal","region","data"],"language":"en"},

A large number of HIV-1-related studies are based on three non-human model animals: chimpanzee, rhesus macaque, and mouse. However, the differences in host-HIV-1 interactions between human and these model organisms have remained unexplored. DESCRIPTION: Here we present CAPIH (Comparative Analysis of Protein Interactions for HIV-1), the first web-based interface to provide comparative information between human and the three model organisms in the context of host-HIV-1 protein interactions. CAPIH identifies genetic changes that occur in HIV-1-interacting host proteins. In a total of 1,370 orthologous protein sets, CAPIH identifies ~86,000 amino acid substitutions, ~21,000 insertions/deletions, and ~33,000 potential post-translational modifications that occur only in one of the four compared species. CAPIH also provides an interactive interface to display the host-HIV-1 protein interaction networks, the presence/absence of orthologous proteins in the model organisms in the networks, the genetic changes that occur in the protein nodes, and the functional domains and potential protein interaction hot sites that may be affected by the genetic changes. The CAPIH interface is freely accessible at http://bioinfo-dbb.nhri.org.tw/capih. CONCLUSION: CAPIH exemplifies that large divergences exist in disease-associated proteins between human and the model animals. Since all of the newly developed medications must be tested in model animals before entering clinical trials, it is advisable that comparative analyses be performed to ensure proper translations of animal-based studies. In the case of AIDS, the host-HIV-1 protein interactions apparently have differed to a great extent among the compared species. An integrated protein network comparison among the four species will probably shed new lights on AIDS studies.","publish_time":"2009-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Fan-Kai; Pan, Chia-Lin; Yang, Jinn-Moon; Chuang, Trees-Juen; Chen, Feng-Chi","journal":"BMC Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/41c7a01f11ed47591d99f45774e43e45aeba0619.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2782265.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19674441/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2180-9-164","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAPIH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host-HIV","model organisms","protein nodes","CAPIH interface","protein interaction networks","Comparative Analysis of Protein Interactions","host proteins","non-human model animals","orthologous protein sets","large number of HIV","present CAPIH","context of host","AIDS studies","based studies","genetic changes","potential protein interaction hot sites","integrated protein network comparison","compared species","web-based interface","Human Immunodeficiency Virus type","comparative information","comparative analyses","absence of orthologous proteins","related studies","interactive interface","case of AIDS","disease-associated proteins","large divergences","potential post-translational modifications","functional domains","chimpanzee","presence","rhesus macaque","Immune Deficiency Syndrome","proper translations of animal","amino acid substitutions","major causing pathogen","clinical trials","insertions","deletions","BACKGROUND","new lights","great extent","mouse","CONCLUSION","total","developed medications","DESCRIPTION","differences"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The study aimed to investigate the genetic diversity, temporal distribution, population history and clinical symptoms of betacoronavirus infections in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia between 2012 and 2013. A total of 2,060 adults presented with acute respiratory symptoms were screened for the presence of betacoronaviruses using multiplex PCR. The spike glycoprotein, nucleocapsid and 1a genes were sequenced for phylogenetic reconstruction and Bayesian coalescent inference. RESULTS: A total of 48/2060 (2.4 %) specimens were tested positive for HCoV-OC43 (1.3 %) and HCoV-HKU1 (1.1 %). Both HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were co-circulating throughout the year, with the lowest detection rates reported in the October-January period. Phylogenetic analysis of the spike gene showed that the majority of HCoV-OC43 isolates were grouped into two previously undefined genotypes, provisionally assigned as novel lineage 1 and novel lineage 2. Sign of natural recombination was observed in these potentially novel lineages. Location mapping showed that the novel lineage 1 is currently circulating in Malaysia, Thailand, Japan and China, while novel lineage 2 can be found in Malaysia and China. Molecular dating showed the origin of HCoV-OC43 around late 1950s, before it diverged into genotypes A (1960s), B (1990s), and other genotypes (2000s). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 27.3 % of the HCoV-HKU1 strains belong to genotype A while 72.7 % belongs to genotype B. The tree root of HCoV-HKU1 was similar to that of HCoV-OC43, with the tMRCA of genotypes A and B estimated around the 1990s and 2000s, respectively. Correlation of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 with the severity of respiratory symptoms was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: The present study reported the molecular complexity and evolutionary dynamics of human betacoronaviruses among adults with acute respiratory symptoms in a tropical country. Two novel HCoV-OC43 genetic lineages were identified, warranting further investigation on their genotypic and phenotypic characteristics.

This type of survey has been also applied to infectious disease research; however, previous studies were insufficient as they underestimated articles published in non-English or regional journals. METHODS: Using a combination of Scopus\u2122 and PubMed, the databases of scientific literature, and English and non-English keywords directly linked to infectious disease control, we identified international and regional infectious disease journals. In order to ascertain whether the newly selected journals were appropriate to survey a wide range of research articles, we compared the number of original articles and reviews registered in the selected journals to those in the \u0027Infectious Disease Category\u0027 of the Science Citation Index Expanded\u2122 (SCI Infectious Disease Category) during 1998-2006. Subsequently, we applied the newly selected journals to survey the number of original articles and reviews originating from 11 Asian countries during the same period. RESULTS: One hundred journals, written in English or 7 non-English languages, were newly selected as infectious disease journals. The journals published 14,156 original articles and reviews of Asian origin and 118,158 throughout the world, more than those registered in the SCI Infectious Disease Category (4,621 of Asian origin and 66,518 of the world in the category). In Asian trend analysis of the 100 journals, Japan had the highest percentage of original articles and reviews in the area, and no noticeable increase in articles was revealed during the study period. China, India and Taiwan had relatively large numbers and a high increase rate of original articles among Asian countries. When adjusting the publication of original articles according to the country population and the gross domestic product (GDP), Singapore and Taiwan were the most productive. CONCLUSION: A survey of 100 selected journals is more sensitive than the SCI Infectious Disease Category from the viewpoint of avoiding underestimating the number of infectious disease research articles of Asian origin. The survey method is applicable to grasp global trends in disease research, although the method may require further development.","publish_time":"2009-10-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Takahashi-Omoe, Hiromi; Omoe, Katsuhiko; Okabe, Nobuhiko","journal":"BMC Med Res Methodol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75aa45fec583443ad040672ab48b2c90825a94bb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2766390.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2288-9-67; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19804650/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SCI Infectious Disease Category"],"locations":["Japan","India","Taiwan","China"],"keyphrases":["regional infectious disease journals","selected journals","number of infectious disease research articles of Asian origin","SCI Infectious Disease Category","number of original articles","infectious disease control","publication of original articles","Quantitative survey of research articles","regional journals","highest percentage of original articles","wide range of research articles","reviews of Asian origin","high increase rate of original articles","Asian countries","survey method","type of survey","Asian trend analysis","various medical research fields","non-English keywords","non-English languages","Taiwan","world","overall trends","global trends","noticeable increase","study period","large numbers","country population","gross domestic product","Science Citation Index","databases of scientific literature","PubMed","Singapore","GDP","effective tool","Japan","previous studies","area","viewpoint","India","application of bibliometrics","BACKGROUND","combination of Scopus","METHODS","China","CONCLUSION","development","order","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Cyclooxygenases (COXs) and their final product, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), are known to play important roles in the modulation of both the host response to infection and the replicative cycles of several viruses. However, the precise mechanism(s) by which the COX/PGE(2) pathway regulates sapovirus replication remains largely unknown. In this study, infection with porcine sapovirus (PSaV) strain Cowden, the only cultivable virus within the genus Sapovirus, markedly increased COX-2 mRNA and protein levels at 24 and 36 h postinfection (hpi), with only a transient increase in COX-1 levels seen at 24 hpi. The treatment of cells with pharmacological inhibitors, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against COX-1 and COX-2, significantly reduced PGE(2) production, as well as PSaV replication. Expression of the viral proteins VPg and ProPol was associated with activation of the COX/PGE(2) pathway. We observed that pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 dramatically increased NO production, causing a reduction in PSaV replication that could be restored by inhibition of nitric oxide synthase via the inhibitor N-nitro-l-methyl-arginine ester. This study identified a pivotal role for the COX/PGE(2) pathway in the regulation of NO production during the sapovirus life cycle, providing new insights into the life cycle of this poorly characterized family of viruses. Our findings also reveal potential new targets for treatment of sapovirus infection. IMPORTANCE Sapoviruses are among the major etiological agents of acute gastroenteritis in both humans and animals, but little is known about sapovirus host factor requirements. Here, using only cultivable porcine sapovirus (PSaV) strain Cowden, we demonstrate that PSaV induced the vitalization of the cyclooxygenase (COX) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) pathway. Targeting of COX-1/2 using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as the COX-1/2 inhibitor indomethacin and the COX-2-specific inhibitors NS-398 and celecoxib or siRNAs targeting COXs, inhibited PSaV replication. Expression of the viral proteins VPg and ProPol was associated with activation of the COX/PGE(2) pathway. We further demonstrate that the production of PGE(2) provides a protective effect against the antiviral effector mechanism of nitric oxide. Our findings uncover a new mechanism by which PSaV manipulates the host cell to provide an environment suitable for efficient viral growth, which in turn can be a new target for treatment of sapovirus infection.","publish_time":"2017-01-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alfajaro, Mia Madel; Choi, Jong-Soon; Kim, Deok-Song; Seo, Ja-Young; Kim, Ji-Yun; Park, Jun-Gyu; Soliman, Mahmoud; Baek, Yeong-Bin; Cho, Eun-Hyo; Kwon, Joseph; Kwon, Hyung-Jun; Park, Su-Jin; Lee, Woo Song; Kang, Mun-Il; Hosmillo, Myra; Goodfellow, Ian; Cho, Kyoung-Oh","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd78c67dd1bf9aea39f8fb3a1fe1761628dbe422.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5244346.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27881647/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01656-16","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COX/PGE","PGE","COX"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["increased COX","sapovirus replication","production of PGE","pharmacological inhibition of COX","treatment of sapovirus infection","genus Sapovirus","pathway","reduced PGE","sapovirus life cycle","cultivable porcine sapovirus","inhibited PSaV replication","new mechanism","sapovirus host factor requirements","new insights","viral proteins VPg","strain Cowden","nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs","siRNAs","potential new targets","host response","pharmacological inhibitors","COXs","host cell","humans","ProPol","prostaglandin E","activation","treatment of cells","precise mechanism","animals","Expression","findings","study","hpi","antiviral effector mechanism of nitric oxide","inhibition of nitric oxide synthase","severe acute gastroenteritis","efficient viral growth","important pathogens","protein levels","cultivable virus","important roles","inhibitor indomethacin","major etiological agents of acute gastroenteritis","inhibitor N-nitro","specific inhibitors NS","characterized family of viruses","small interfering RNAs","celecoxib","environment suitable","genera Norovirus","turn","protective effect","final product","replicative cycles","modulation","mRNA","NSAIDs","pivotal role","IMPORTANCE Sapoviruses","Enteric caliciviruses","h postinfection","transient increase","methyl-arginine ester","vitalization","reduction","regulation","Cyclooxygenases"],"language":"en"},

For the management of severe ARDS ventilator settings, positioning therapy, infection control, and supportive measures are essential to improve survival. METHODS AND RESULTS: A precise definition of life-threating hypoxemia is not identified. Typical clinical determinations are: arterial partial pressure of oxygen \u003C 60 mmHg and/or arterial oxygenation \u003C 88 % and/or the ratio of PaO(2)/FIO(2) \u003C 100. For mechanical ventilation specific settings are recommended: limitation of tidal volume (6 ml/kg predicted body weight), adequate high PEEP (\u003E12 cmH(2)O), a recruitment manoeuvre in special situations, and a \u2018balanced\u2019 respiratory rate (20-30/min). Individual bedside methods to guide PEEP/recruitment (e.g., transpulmonary pressure) are not (yet) available. Prone positioning [early (\u2264 48 hrs after onset of severe ARDS) and prolonged (repetition of 16-hr-sessions)] improves survival. An advanced infection management/control includes early diagnosis of bacterial, atypical, viral and fungal specimen (blood culture, bronchoalveolar lavage), and of infection sources by CT scan, followed by administration of broad-spectrum anti-infectives. Neuromuscular blockage (Cisatracurium \u2264 48 hrs after onset of ARDS), as well as an adequate sedation strategy (score guided) is an important supportive therapy. A negative fluid balance is associated with improved lung function and the use of hemofiltration might be indicated for specific indications.

However, little is known about the key genes and corresponding expression profiling involved in the biosynthesis pathways of these ingredients. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is a powerful, commonly-used method for gene expression analysis, but the accuracy of the quantitative data produced depends on the appropriate selection of reference genes. RESULTS: In this study, the systematic analysis of the reference genes was performed for quantitative real-Time PCR normalization in I. indigotica. We selected nine candidate reference genes, including six traditional housekeeping genes (ACT, \u03B1-TUB, \u03B2-TUB, UBC, CYP, and EF1-\u03B1), and three newly stable internal control genes (MUB, TIP41, and RPL) from a transcriptome dataset of I. indigotica, and evaluated their expression stabilities in different tissues (root, stem, leaf, and petiole) and leaves exposed to three abiotic treatments (low-nitrogen, ABA, and MeJA) using geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and comprehensive RefFind algorithms. The results demonstrated that MUB and EF1-\u03B1 were the two most stable reference genes for all samples. TIP41 as the optimal reference gene for low-nitrogen stress and MeJA treatment, while ACT had the highest ranking for ABA treatment and CYP was the most suitable for different tissues. CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed that the selection and validation of appropriate reference genes for normalizing data is mandatory to acquire accurate quantification results. The necessity of specific internal control for specific conditions was also emphasized. Furthermore, this work will provide valuable information to enhance further research in gene function and molecular biology on I. indigotica and other related species.

Given that BCoV is better studied than equine coronaviruses and given the possibility of interspecies transmission of these viruses, this research was designed to compare the partial sequences of the spike glycoprotein (S), hemagglutinin-esterase protein (HE), and nucleoprotein (N) genes from coronaviruses from adult cattle with winter dysentery, calves with neonatal diarrhea, and horses. To achieve this, eleven fecal samples from dairy cows with winter dysentery, three from calves, and two from horses, all from Brazil, were analysed. It could be concluded that the enteric BCoV genealogy from newborn and adult cattle is directly associated with geographic distribution patterns, when S and HE genes are taken into account. A less-resolved genealogy exists for the HE and N genes in cattle, with a trend for an age-related segregation pattern. The coronavirus strains from horses revealed Betacoronavirus sequences indistinguishable from those found in cattle, a fact previously unknown.","publish_time":"2013-11-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barros, Iracema N.; Silva, Sheila O.

Caveolae are integral to numerous signaling pathways and these membrane domains have been previously implicated in viral entry but not antiviral defense. This study shows, for the first time, the importance of spatio-temporal regulation of signaling receptors and the importance of the regulation of clustering for downstream signaling. A novel mechanism for virus evasion of host cell defenses is demonstrated through disruption of clusters of signaling molecules organized within caveolin-rich domains. Viral infection leads to a downregulation in Caveolin-1b (Cav-1b), disrupting clusters of CRFB1, a zebrafish type I interferon receptor (\u2013R) subunit. Super-resolution microscopy has enabled the first single-molecule imaging of CRFB1 association with cav-1b-containing membrane domains. Strikingly, downregulation of Cav-1b, the major protein component of caveolae, caused CRFB1 clusters to disperse. Dispersal of CRFB1 clusters led to a suppressed antiviral immune response both in vitro and in vivo, through abrogation of downstream signaling. This response strongly suggests that CRFB1 organization within cav-1b-containing membrane domains is critical for IFN-mediated antiviral defense and presents a previously undescribed antiviral evasion strategy to alter IFN signaling and the antiviral immune response.","publish_time":"2013-07-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gabor, Kristin A.; Stevens, Chad R.; Pietraszewski, Matthew J.; Gould, Travis J.; Shim, Juyoung; Yoder, Jeffrey A.; Lam, Siew Hong; Gong, Zhiyuan; Hess, Samuel T.; Kim, Carol H.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b454887997af026ed0589fcb18e59aed44473e1d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3706321.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068759; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23874753/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clusters of CRFB1","antiviral defense","membrane domains","Dispersal of CRFB1 clusters","CRFB1 organization","suppressed antiviral immune response","downregulation of Cav","undescribed antiviral evasion strategy","disruption of clusters","caveolin-rich domains","IFN","resistant membrane fractions","single-molecule imaging of CRFB1 association","dynamics of receptors","importance of spatio","temporal regulation","regulation of clustering","Viral infection","viral entry","major protein component of caveolae","virus evasion of host cell defenses","conventional studies of detergent","unperturbed membranes","pathways","molecules","interferon receptor","novel mechanism","role","zebrafish","spatial distribution","subunit","time","information","Super-resolution microscopy","study","abrogation"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, we aimed to identify novel protein receptor targets for TCDD using computational and in vitro validation experiments. Interestingly, results from computational methods predicted that Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 1 (VEGFR1) could be one of the potential targets for TCDD in both mouse and humans. Results from molecular docking studies showed that human VEGFR1 (hVEGFR1) has less affinity towards TCDD compared to the mouse VEGFR1 (mVEGFR1). In vitro validation results showed that TCDD can bind and phosphorylate hVEGFR1. Further, results from molecular dynamic simulation studies showed that hVEGFR1 interaction with TCDD is stable throughout the simulation time.

Clinically, YPFS has been widely used to regulate immune functions; however, the action mechanism of it is not known. Here, we addressed this issue by providing detail analyses of chemical and biological properties of YPFS. By using rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, fifteen chemicals deriving from different herbs of YPFS were determined, and which served as a control for the standardization of the herbal extract of YPFS. In general, the amounts of chosen chemical markers were higher in a preparation of YPFS as compared to that of single herb or two-herb compositions. In order to reveal the immune functions of YPFS, the standardized extract was applied onto cultured murine macrophages. The treatment of YPFS stimulated the mRNA and protein expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines via activation of NF-\u03BAB by enhancing I\u03BAB\u03B1 degradation. In contrast, the application of YPFS suppressed the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines significantly in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced chronic inflammation model. In addition, YPFS could up regulate the phagocytic activity in cultured macrophages. These results therefore supported the bi-directional immune-modulatory roles of YPFS in regulating the releases of cytokines from macrophages.","publish_time":"2013-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Du, Crystal Y.

The objectives of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics using normal rats and toxicity of nasal cilia as well as immunomodulating effects using immunosuppression rats after intranasal delivery of thymopentin with or without an absorption enhancer. The absorption extent of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled TP 5 via nasal delivery at a single dose is significantly improved by incorporating sodium deoxycholate, Brij 35 and chitosan, respectively. FITC-TP 5 can also be absorbed to such an extent ranging from 15 to 28% after intranasal administration of FITC-TP 5 alone, FITC-TP 5 with sodium caprylate, or with bacitracin, respectively. After seven consecutive days multiple dosing, TP 5 formulation with sodium deoxycholate or Brij 35 caused apparently injury to nasal cilia, indicating these two enhancers would not be appropriate for nasal delivery. Results from superoxide dismutase activity, maleic dialdehyde, T-lymphocyte subsets (CD3\u002B, CD4\u002B, CD8\u002B and CD4\u002B/CD8\u002B ratio) analyses suggest that all the selected enhancers improve the modulating effects of TP 5 in the immunosuppression rats.

For the CC, as for any multiparental population (MPP), effective experimental design and analysis benefit from detailed knowledge of the genetic differences between strains. Such differences can be directly determined by sequencing, but until now whole-genome sequencing was not publicly available for individual CC strains. An alternative and complementary approach is to infer genetic differences by combining two pieces of information: probabilistic estimates of the CC haplotype mosaic from a custom genotyping array, and probabilistic variant calls from sequencing of the CC founders. The computation for this inference, especially when performed genome-wide, can be intricate and time-consuming, requiring the researcher to generate nontrivial and potentially error-prone scripts. To provide standardized, easy-to-access CC sequence information, we have developed the Inbred Strain Variant Database (ISVdb). The ISVdb provides, for all the exonic variants from the Sanger Institute mouse sequencing dataset, direct sequence information for CC founders and, critically, the imputed sequence information for CC strains. Notably, the ISVdb also: (1) provides predicted variant consequence metadata; (2) allows rapid simulation of F1 populations; and (3) preserves imputation uncertainty, which will allow imputed data to be refined in the future as additional sequencing and genotyping data are collected. The ISVdb information is housed in an SQL database and is easily accessible through a custom online interface (http://isvdb.unc.edu), reducing the analytic burden on any researcher using the CC.","publish_time":"2017-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oreper, Daniel; Cai, Yanwei; Tarantino, Lisa M.; de Villena, Fernando Pardo-Manuel; Valdar, William","journal":"G3 (Bethesda)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/942326084a2892419bebfb4508ed7158c158fac9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5473744.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.117.041491; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28592645/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs4MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Collaborative Cross","CC","Inbred Strain Variant Database","ISVdb"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CC founders","ISVdb information","individual CC strains","access CC sequence information","genome sequencing","CC haplotype mosaic","imputed sequence information","direct sequence information","pieces of information","additional sequencing","genetic differences","Sanger Institute mouse sequencing dataset","probabilistic variant calls","established multiparental recombinant inbred mouse strains","genotyping data","Inbred Strain Variant Database","imputed data","researcher","custom genotyping array","probabilistic estimates","multiparental population","predicted variant consequence metadata","SQL database","genome-wide","custom online interface","effective experimental design","detailed knowledge","analysis benefit","panel","MPP","exonic variants","future","complementary approach","error-prone scripts","rapid simulation of F1 populations","imputation uncertainty","Collaborative Cross","inference","analytic burden","computation"],"language":"en"},

The antiviral activity of P9 was attributed to its high-affinity binding to viral glycoproteins, as well as the abundance of basic amino acids in its composition. After binding viral particles through viral surface glycoproteins, P9 entered into cells together with the viruses via endocytosis and prevented endosomal acidification, which blocked membrane fusion and subsequent viral RNA release.

Only 13.3% of the respondents planned to receive the H1N1 vaccine, compared with 37.5% for the seasonal influenza vaccine. Vaccination against seasonal influenza in the preceding season strongly predicted the likelihood of H1N1 vaccination. The main reason cited for H1N1 vaccination was self-protection, and reasons for rejecting vaccination included possible side effects, ineffectiveness of the vaccine, and the mild nature of the disease. Personal contact with patients with H1N1 or severe acute respiratory syndrome at work did not significantly increase the likelihood of receiving the H1N1 vaccine. More than 40% of the respondents were undecided at the time of the survey. The promotion of vaccination against seasonal influenza may play a role in improving H1N1 vaccination coverage.

WHO is working directly with its Member States to promote this approach, more specifically around how to better embed the IHR (2005) core capacities into the main health system functions. This paper looks at how and where the intersections between the IHR and the health system can be best leveraged towards developing greater health system resilience.

To improve measles control strategy, the epidemic trend and population immunity of measles were investigated in 1951\u20132011 in Beijing. METHODS: The changing trend of measles since 1951 was described based on measles surveillance data from Beijing Centre of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The measles vaccination coverage and antibody level were assessed by routinely reported measles vaccination data and twenty-one sero-epidemiological surveys. RESULTS: The incidence of measles has decreased significantly from 593.5/100,000 in 1951 (peaked at 2721.0/100,000 in 1955), to 0.5/100,000 in 2011 due to increasing vaccination coverage of 95%-99%. Incidence rebounded from 6.6/100,000 to 24.5/100,000 since 2005 and decreased after measles vaccine (MV) supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) in 2010. Measles antibody positive rate was 85%-95% in most of years since 1981. High-risk districts were spotted in Chaoyang, Fengtai and Changping districts in recent 15 years. Age-specific incidence and proportion of measles varied over time. The most affected population were younger children of 1\u20134 years before 1978, older children of 5\u201314 years in 1978\u20131996, infant of \u003C1 years and adults of \u226515 years in period of aim to measles elimination. CONCLUSION: Strategies at different stages had a prevailing effect on the epidemic dynamics of measles in recent 60 years in Beijing. It will be essential to validate reported vaccination coverage, improve vaccination coverage in adults and strengthen measles surveillance in the anticipated elimination campaign for measles.","publish_time":"2013-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Juan; Lu, Li; Pang, Xinghuo; Sun, Meiping; Ma, Rui; Liu, Donglei; Wu, Jiang","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b3873c777b754d108ce93d5feca0c3dff4a74564.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4016557.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24143899/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-13-986","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs4NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Beijing"],"keyphrases":["incidence of measles","measles elimination","measles vaccine","proportion of measles","measles vaccination coverage","measles vaccination data","years","measles surveillance data","epidemic dynamics of measles","measles control strategy","changing trend of measles","population immunity of measles","Measles antibody positive rate","reported vaccination coverage","epidemic trend","adults","Beijing Centre of Disease Control","Age-specific incidence","Changping districts","antibody level","affected population","younger children","High-risk districts","older children","anticipated elimination campaign","prevailing effect","MV","supplementary immunization activities","different stages","Chaoyang","Prevention","Fengtai","period of aim","Strategies","SIAs","sero-epidemiological surveys","China","CONCLUSION","CDC","global effort","METHODS","infant","time","RESULTS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

At the background of such cultivation stands the absence of positing a mind-body duality and a lack of concern with a particular physical location of the mind in early Buddhist thought. Moreover, the various exercises that involve directing mindfulness to the body need to be considered in conjunction in order to arrive at a balanced understanding of their overarching purpose. Out of the different possible modalities of cultivating mindfulness in this way, the discourses present awareness directed to one\u2019s own bodily postures as a practice already undertaken by the Buddha-to-be when he was still in quest of awakening. In this particular setting, such mindfulness of postures served as a way of facing fear. The potential of this exercise to provide a grounding in embodied mindfulness, being fully in the here and now, is of particular relevance to the challenges posed by the current pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"An\u0101layo, Bhikkhu","journal":"Mindfulness (N Y)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/47518d2cc708c0397053b6f4397248d2acbeb79a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7205602.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12671-020-01382-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32391113/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs4ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mindfulness of postures","cultivation of mindfulness","way","embodied mindfulness","mind-body duality","particular setting","particular relevance","different possible modalities of cultivating mindfulness","particular physical location","bodily postures","discourses present awareness","relevant P\u0101li discourses","lack of concern","balanced understanding","early Buddhist thought","challenges","absence","central object","order","overarching purpose","practice","parallels","grounding","current pandemic","background","conjunction","various exercises","quest of awakening","potential","Buddha","fear"],"language":"en"},

With a continued global urgency to address spread of pathogenic microbes, contributions of microorganisms to both infectious and noninfectious processes merit more attention from the exposure science community. Today, discoveries of the importance of the human microbiome as a determinant of health and disease are precipitating a second revolution. Emerging knowledge creates a major opportunity to expand the scope of exposure science to incorporate the human microbiome as a target and modulator of exposure. A study committee of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has defined a research strategy to address health risks that pertain to the interaction of environmental chemicals with the human microbiome.

The analysis is based on a calibrated residential building stock model for Saudi Arabia supported by national statistics regarding the characteristics of AC systems. Various housing prototypes, vintages, and locations are included in the analysis. Specifically, the analysis considers the scaling up of the government\u0027s High Efficiency AC (HEAC) program which offers 900 Saudi Riyals (240 USD) per unit to consumers for up to 6 split system units with an energy efficiency rating (EER) of 13.0 or more per household. The main findings of the study suggest that upgrading the existing old stock of window units and split systems currently in place to the requirements of HEAC program would generate a reduction in electricity consumption of around 33 TWh/year and 24 million tons of CO2. Due to the effect of the HEAC consumer subsidy, purchasing a high efficiency unit has a simple payback period for the consumer of 5 years which is faster than less efficient AC options. This would come at a cost to the government of approximately 6 Billion USD resulting in an annual income of 3.0 Billion USD from the sale of avoided fuel associated with the saved electricity consumption.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krarti, M.; Howarth, Nicholas","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ada5d576f37c31dd20c27a0129a329e113f6ad2e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352710220300073; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352710220300073?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AC","High Efficiency AC","HEAC"],"locations":["Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["high efficiency unit","government\u0027s High Efficiency AC","USD","analysis","characteristics of AC systems","high efficiency air conditioning","existing units specific","energy efficiency rating","existing old stock of window units","split system units","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","Saudi Riyals","split systems","HEAC consumer subsidy","requirements of HEAC program","efficient AC options","calibrated residential building stock model","saved electricity consumption","equipment","simple payback period","national statistics","place","benefits of transitioning","sale of avoided fuel","vintages","study","years","locations","TWh","consumers","reduction","scaling","Various housing prototypes","EER","effect","KSA","annual income","tons of CO2","main findings","paper","cost","household"],"language":"en"},

By constructing a series of deletion mutants, the putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) were mapped to 81RRAR84 and 86RPRRPRRRPRRR97 respectively. Specific deletion of the putative NLS, NoLS or both abrogated nuclear localization, nucleolar localization or both respectively. Furthermore, NLS was able to direct trimeric EYFP predominantly to the nucleus but excluded from the nucleolus, whereas NoLS targeted trimeric EYFP primarily to the nucleus, and enriched in the nucleolus with faint staining in the cytoplasm.

The chapter also focuses on the need for a building\u2019s interior air quality, as this is one of the most pivotal factors in maintaining building occupants\u2019 safety, productivity, and well-being. Other important factors that are focused on are ventilation and filtration, including air cleaners and ventilation systems. The leading inorganic indoor contaminants are discussed such as asbestos, radon, and lead, exposure to which can create significant health risks. Likewise, organic contaminants including aldehydes, volatile organic compounds/semivolatile organic compounds, and pesticides are examined and analyzed. Several combustion-generated contaminates such as carbon dioxide, water, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides are also looked into. Toward the end of the chapter, the best practices for IEQ are outlined and discussed.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kubba, Sam","journal":"LEED v4 Practices, Certification, and Accreditation Handbook","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128038307000074; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128038307000074","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Chapter","organic contaminants","semivolatile organic compounds","causes of building","optimum IEQ","pivotal factors","various factors","important factors","building occupants\u2019 safety","sick building syndrome","indoor environmental quality","carbon monoxide","carbon dioxide","air cleaners","building\u2019s interior air quality","ventilation systems","leading inorganic indoor contaminants","best practices","best current approaches","BRI","aldehydes","related illness","water","need","exposure","productivity","filtration","nitrogen oxides","radon","well-being","SBS","pesticides","significant health risks","Abstract","outset","end","combustion","increase"],"language":"en"},

Two-hundred and twenty stool specimens were collected from infants and young children with diarrhoea, and 10\u201320% faecal suspensions were made. Several methods of rotavirus dsRNA extraction were assayed. Electrophoretic analysis of viral RNA was carried out on 10% polyacrylamide gols followed by silver staining. RT/PCR was performed using oligonucleotide primers specific for both 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of the rotavirus gene encoding VP7 which ere highly conserved among group A rotaviruses. Following RNA extraction with phenol-chloroform and ethanol precipitation, RT/PCR could detect rotaviral RNA in only 11 of 25 samples known to contain rotaviruses by conventional methods. The purification of RNA extracts by CF11 cellulose and the application of the RNAID method were equally effective in extracting RNA and/or removing inhibitory substances from the faecal samples. RT/PCR led to the detection of 66 positive samples from 220 specimens tested (30%). whilst 64 specimens were positive by EUSA (29%), 59 (26.3%) by PAGE and 56 (25.4%) by EM. In our study, RT/PCR was 100 times more sensitive than the ELISA test in detecting rotaviruses serially diluted in a faecal suspension. Although RT/PCR is theoretically much more sensitive than ELISA, PAGE and EM for detection of rotaviruses, great care must be taken to remove inhibitory substances from the enzymatic reactions. We do not consider that RT/PCR should replace immunoassays with high sensitivity and specificity for rotavirus testing in faecal samples, although this technique has other applications, like the search for rotavirus in different clinical specimens (sera, cerebrospinal fluid, respiratory secretions, etc.) and in environmental samples, as well as the typing of viral strains using serotype-specific primers.","publish_time":"1996-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Buesa, J.; Colomina, J.; Raga, J.; Villanueva, A.; Prat, J.","journal":"Research in Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/29313228f64fd883baa8d6855e8ce9fac859b41b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0923251697851278; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0923251697851278","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RT/PCR","RNA","EUSA","EM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCR","RT","faecal samples","rotavirus testing","rotavirus gene","rotavirus double stranded RNA","detection of rotaviruses","extracting RNA","rotaviral RNA","positive samples","EM","PAGE","environmental samples","methods of rotavirus dsRNA extraction","purification of RNA extracts","Electrophoretic analysis of viral RNA","stool specimens","faecal suspensions","ELISA test","different clinical specimens","inhibitory substances","technique","serotype-specific primers","oligonucleotide primers specific","infected children","young children","polyacrylamide gols","conventional methods","polyacrylamide gel etectrophoresis","typing of viral strains","sera","specificity","cerebrospinal fluid","polymerase chain reaction","comparison","electron microscopy","high sensitivity","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","reverse transcription","CF11 cellulose","phenol-chloroform","routine diagnostic procedure","ethanol precipitation","RNAID method","infants","search","immunoassays","times","respiratory secretions","VP7","great care","aim","silver staining","diarrhoea","group","enzymatic reactions","applications","EUSA","study","Summary"],"language":"en"},

Inoculation of the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) into the central nervous system (CNS) of mice resulted in the rapid mobilization of PMNs expressing the chemokine receptor CXCR2 into the blood. Migration of PMNs to the CNS coincided with increased expression of transcripts specific for the CXCR2 ELR-positive chemokine ligands CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL5 within the brain. Treatment of JHMV-infected mice with anti-CXCR2 blocking antibody reduced PMN trafficking into the CNS by \u003E95%, dampened MMP-9 activity, and abrogated blood-brain-barrier (BBB) breakdown. Correspondingly, CXCR2 neutralization resulted in diminished infiltration of virus-specific T cells, an inability to control viral replication within the brain, and 100% mortality. Blocking CXCR2 signaling did not impair the generation of virus-specific T cells, indicating that CXCR2 is not required to tailor anti-JHMV T cell responses. Evaluation of mice in which CXCR2 is genetically silenced (CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice) confirmed that PMNs neither expressed CXCR2 nor migrated in response to ligands CXCL1, CXCL2, or CXCL5 in an in vitro chemotaxis assay. Moreover, JHMV infection of CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice resulted in an approximate 60% reduction of PMN migration into the CNS, yet these mice survived infection and controlled viral replication within the brain. Treatment of JHMV-infected CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice with anti-CXCR2 antibody did not modulate PMN migration nor alter viral clearance or mortality, indicating the existence of compensatory mechanisms that facilitate sufficient migration of PMNs into the CNS in the absence of CXCR2. Collectively, these findings highlight a previously unappreciated role for ELR-positive chemokines in enhancing host defense during acute viral infections of the CNS.","publish_time":"2009-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hosking, Martin P.; Liu, Liping; Ransohoff, Richard M.; Lane, Thomas E.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c851e8a17951dc6f713c2a832e6a516f72154a79.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2766051.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000648; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19893623/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CXC","CNS","JHMV","PMN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected CXCR2","CXCR2 neutralization","absence of CXCR2","JHMV infection of CXCR2","anti-CXCR2 antibody","CNS","chemokine receptor CXCR2","infected mice","CXCR2 ELR-positive chemokine ligands CXCL1","Evaluation of mice","Treatment of JHMV","viral clearance","sufficient migration of PMNs","ELR-positive chemokines","specific T cells","acute viral infections","controlled viral replication","reduction of PMN migration","anti-JHMV T cell responses","abrogated blood-brain","acute viral-induced encephalomyelitis","host defense","positive CXC chemokines","generation of virus","functional role of ELR","CXCL2","PMN trafficking","CXCL5","rapid mobilization of PMNs","mortality","diminished infiltration of virus","increased expression of transcripts specific","unappreciated role","neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus","existence of compensatory mechanisms","activity","barrier","central nervous system","inability","BBB","Inoculation","dampened MMP","breakdown","chemotaxis assay","findings"],"language":"en"},

As of 10(th) April 2020, more than 1.5 million people are affected globally with around 95000 deaths. Vaccines for this deadly virus are currently under development and many drugs used for other indications have been repurposed and investigated for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID 19. As per SOLIDARITY trial by WHO, some of the most promising candidates include chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine which are anti-malarial medications, Remdesivir, Lopinavir-Ritonavir combination with or without interferon which are anti-HIV drugs and convalescent plasma therapy. The current evidence of efficacy and ongoing research has been elaborated in the article. Besides, there has been evidence regarding inflammatory pathogenesis of this virus leading to cytokine storm in susceptible individuals. Thus, anti-proinflammatory cytokine drugs like Anakinra and Tocilizumab are undergoing multiple trials and some results are encouraging. Similarly, use of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-37 and IL-38 is hypothesised to be useful and is under research. The situation is still evolving and hence there is yet no definitive therapy but to conclude the use of repurposed medications can be a boon till a definitive therapy and vaccines are developed.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Salvi, Rachana; Patankar, Panini","journal":"Biomed Pharmacother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5731e7ffe5047158950478b269c4dd1b2d510723.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7221369.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110267; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332220304595?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32410772/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0753332220304595","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COVID"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["deadly virus","novel virulent corona virus","definitive therapy","anti-HIV drugs","anti-proinflammatory cytokine drugs","Novel Corona-virus Disease","anti-malarial medications","use of repurposed medications","Vaccines","convalescent plasma therapy","cytokine storm","ongoing research","fatal virulent pneumonia","current evidence of efficacy","hydroxychloroquine","Anakinra","Tocilizumab","Remdesivir","severe respiratory distress syndrome","chloroquine phosphate","international concern","Lopinavir-Ritonavir combination","interferon","boon","public health emergency","multiple trials","promising candidates","susceptible individuals","inflammatory pathogenesis","Pandemic","nCOVID","development","anti-inflammatory cytokines","prophylaxis","treatment of COVID","results","SOLIDARITY trial","article","indications","people","deaths","situation"],"language":"en"},

This was a cross-sectional study that evaluated students in the clinical phase of medical school. The data were collected by an online questionnaire. The measurements were obtained using a researcher-administered and a self-reported questionnaire that had been previously validated. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. One hundred and thirty-six students participated and showed good awareness regarding the clinical aspects of MERS, such as etiology, diagnosis, management, and prevention. However, 76% of the students were not aware of the mortality rate. Conversely, this study uncovered a low level of awareness in the basic sciences. Interestingly, fifth year medical students were more familiar with the incubation period than final year students (p-value \u003C0.05). Regarding gender differences, more female students were knowledgeable about the incubation period and the possible asymptomatic presentation of the disease than male students (p-value \u003C0.05). However, male students were more aware of the diagnostic tests for MERS than their female counterparts. Medical students were knowledgeable about the clinical aspects of MERS but were lacking background awareness in the basic sciences.","publish_time":"2016-08-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Mohrej, Ahmad; Agha, Sajida","journal":"J Infect Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d39f9d3b8ccb3f07d43ddad416dabfd48be44f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102843.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27502524/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034116301022; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034116301022; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2016.06.013","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["King Saud bin Abdulaziz University"],"organizations":["Health Sciences"],"locations":["King Abdulaziz Medical City"],"keyphrases":["female students","year medical students","final year students","clinical aspects of MERS","health awareness","outbreak of MERS","p-value","Health Sciences","background awareness","good awareness","basic sciences","King Abdulaziz Medical City","clinical phase of medical school","incubation period","low level of awareness","female counterparts","cross-sectional study","online questionnaire","King Saud bin Abdulaziz University","self-reported questionnaire","possible asymptomatic presentation","disease","CoV","KSAU-HS","KAMC","diagnostic tests","diagnosis","etiology","gender differences","researcher","management","Riyadh","mortality rate","prevention","data","communities","measurements"],"language":"en"},

Phage display is a technique with wide application, in particular, the identification of key antigen epitopes for the development of therapeutic and diagnostic reagents and vaccines. To identify antigen epitopes with specificity for PEDV, a monoclonal antibody (MAb-5E12) against the immunodominant region of the PEDV Spike protein (S1) was used as the target for biopanning a 12-mer phage display, random peptide library. After multiple rounds of biopanning and stringent washing, three phage-displayed peptides, designated L, W and H, were identified that recognize MAb-5E12. Sequence analysis showed that the one or more of the peptides exhibited partial sequence similarity to the native S1 sequence \u2018MQYVYTPTYYML\u2019 (designated peptide M) at position 201\u2013212. In combination with software analysis for the prediction of B cell epitopes, aa 201\u2013212 exhibited characteristics of a linear epitope on the PEDV S1 protein. In contrast to peptide M, a consensus motif \u2018PxxY\u2019 was identified on both peptides L and W, and on the S1 protein, but not on peptide H. Peptide M and the MAb-5E12-recognizing peptides L and W significantly inhibited the adsorption of PEDV on the cell surface as monitored through plaque-reduction assays. Furthermore, data from real-time PCR and indirect immunofluorescence assays were consistent with the ability of peptides M, L and W to block viral protein expression and thereby function as antiviral agents for PEDV.","publish_time":"2015-08-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cao, Liyan; Ge, Xuying; Gao, Yu; Zarlenga, Dante S.; Wang, Kexiong; Li, Xunliang; Qin, Zhaoheng; Yin, Xiangping; Liu, Jisheng; Ren, Xiaofeng; Li, Guangxin","journal":"Virus Genes","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089464.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-015-1234-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26292945/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","H.

Findings suggest that, although there was a breakdown in communication between small city governments/ municipalities and higher levels of government at the State and Federal levels, prior training and collaborative relationships helped in improvised decision-making.

The research was carried out in 14 out of 16 Polish provinces in the years 2003\u20132005. The investigation was conducted on three types of farms: large farms (\u003E100 sows), medium farms (25\u2013100 sows) and small farms (\u003C25 sows). Diarrhoea of unweaned piglets was observed on all the examined farms. Overall, 780litters of suckling piglets from 104 farms and 267 mother sows were examined. The faeces were analyzed with the modified McMaster method. Isopsora suis was found in 217 (27.8%) litters from 70 (66.7%) farms. Eimeria spp. was detected only in 20 (2.6%) litters from 12 (11.5%) farms. On the large farms I. suis infection was detected in 31.7% of litters whereas Eimeria spp. in 1.4% of them. On the medium sized farms I. suis was found in 18.1% of litters and Eimeria spp. in 0.6%. On the small farms I. suis was detected in only 13.2% of litters, whereas Eimeria spp. in as many as 28.9%. I. suis and Eimeria spp. oocysts were found in 18 (6.7%) and 16 (6%) sows respectively. From 72 sows producing I. suis infected piglets only 12 (16.7%) shed I. suis oocysts and as little as 4 (5.6%) shed Eimeria oocysts. In the remaining 56 sows (77.8%) no cases of coccidian infections were detected. The results of this investigation demonstrate the high prevalence of I. suis in suckling piglets on the large swine farms in Poland.","publish_time":"2007-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karamon, Jacek; Ziomko, Irena; Cencek, Tomasz","journal":"Veterinary Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a1679a198e5d4e1edede496ce4e3881e0c37904a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130805.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401707001781; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401707001781","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Isopsora"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["large farms","medium farms","small farms","examined farms","types of farms","suis oocysts","large swine farms","medium sized farms","suis infected piglets","litters of suckling piglets","mother sows","suis infection","Isopsora suis","Eimeria oocysts","investigation","Diarrhoea of unweaned piglets","prevalence of coccidian infections","Poland","cases of coccidian infections","high prevalence of","modified McMaster method","Polish provinces","years","faeces","results","aim","research"],"language":"en"},

Calves fed 27/33, 29/16, and WM received 180 g/d of CP to support 650g of ADG based on predictions from the 2001 NRC. Calves were fed 3 times daily for 4 wk. Weight, hip height, wither height, heart girth, and body length were measured weekly. Weekly plasma samples were analyzed for plasma urea nitrogen, nonesterified fatty acids, and glucose. A subset of calves from each treatment was killed [29/16 (n=7), 27/33 (n=6), 20/20 (n=6), and WM (n=5)] at the end of wk 4 of treatment; processed for whole-body analysis of fat, protein, ash, and DM; and compared with baseline slaughter calves to estimate composition of empty BW gain. Calves did not differ in average weekly scour score or medication days. Feed efficiency and ADG were greatest for calves fed WM and least for calves fed 20/20; calves fed 29/16 and 27/33 did not differ. Calves fed 27/33 or WM had the greatest % body fat and gained more grams of fat than calves fed other diets. Calves fed 29/16 or 20/20 had similar % fat in empty body as baseline.

Design Cross sectional telephone survey using random digit dialling. Setting Interviews by telephone between 8 and 12 May. Participants 997 adults aged 18 or more who had heard of swine flu and spoke English. Main outcome measures Recommended change in behaviour (increases in handwashing and surface cleaning or plans made with a \u201Cflu friend\u201D) and avoidance behaviours (engaged in one or more of six behaviours such as avoiding large crowds or public transport). Results 37.8% of participants (n=377) reported performing any recommended behaviour change \u201Cover the past four days . . . because of swine flu.\u201D 4.9% (n=49) had carried out any avoidance behaviour. Controlling for personal details and anxiety, recommended changes were associated with perceptions that swine flu is severe, that the risk of catching it is high risk, that the outbreak will continue for a long time, that the authorities can be trusted, that good information has been provided, that people can control their risk of catching swine flu, and that specific behaviours are effective in reducing the risk. Being uncertain about the outbreak and believing that the outbreak had been exaggerated were associated with a lower likelihood of change. The strongest predictor of behaviour change was ethnicity, with participants from ethnic minority groups being more likely to make recommended changes (odds ratio 3.2, 95% confidence interval 2.0 to 5.3) and carry out avoidance behaviours (4.1, 2.0 to 8.4). Conclusions The results support efforts to inform the public about specific actions that can reduce the risks from swine flu and to communicate about the government\u2019s plans and resources. Tackling the perception that the outbreak has been \u201Cover-hyped\u201D may be difficult but worthwhile.

It can cause encephalitis and pneumonia, and has a high case fatality rate. Nipah is a One Health zoonotic infectious disease linked to fruit bats, and sometimes pigs or horses. We advocate anticipating and preparing for urban and larger rural outbreaks of Nipah. Immediate enhanced preparations would include standardized guidance on infection prevention and control, and personal protective equipment, from the World Health Organization (WHO) on their OpenWHO website and 2018 \u201CManaging Epidemics\u201D handbook, along with adding best clinical practices by experts in countries with multiple outbreaks such as Bangladesh and India. Longer-term enhanced preparations include accelerating development of field diagnostics, antiviral drugs, immune-based therapies, and vaccines. WHO-coordinated multi-partner protocols to test investigational treatments, diagnostics, and vaccines are needed, by analogy to such protocols for Ebola during the unanticipated pan-epidemic in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

Although the mechanism of transmission of COVID-19 is not known with certainty, current evidence suggests that COVID-19 is transmitted primarily through respiratory droplets. Therefore, strict adherence to hand hygiene and consistent use of recommended personal protective equipment are cornerstones for reducing transmission. In addition, it is critical that health care professionals receive training on and practice correct donning (putting on) and doffing (removing) of personal protective equipment and avoid touching their faces as well as their facial protection to minimize self-contamination.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jamieson, Denise J.; Steinberg, James P.; Martinello, Richard A.; Perl, Trish M.; Rasmussen, Sonja A.","journal":"Obstet Gynecol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bdc41513f083e1eb9f4ffacccec158648e8dc781.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7188024.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000003919; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32304512/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health care personnel","use of personal protective equipment","health care professionals","risk of health care","health care systems","COVID","adequate supplies of personal protective equipment","consistent use of recommended personal protective equipment","associated transmission","mechanism of transmission","isolating ill pregnant women","critical strategy","number of personnel","ill patient","training","hand hygiene","mask","room","confusion","screening","coronavirus disease","cornerstones","strict adherence","practice correct donning","facial protection","faces","delivery units","physical distancing","case identification","self-contamination","certainty","current evidence","anxiety","doffing","labor","obstetricians","addition","respiratory droplets","coworkers","patients","strategies"],"language":"en"},

The retinal pigment epithelial (RPE), a unique retinal cell, displays a number of essential functions to support the health of the retina. In this review, we highlight how the RPE cell plays a pivotal role in immune defense. The RPE cell orchestrates both innate and adaptive immunity since it expresses TLRs, complement components, MHC class I and II molecules, and serves as an antigen presenting cell. Moreover, both of these immune responses result in the production of a plethora of cytokines, mainly proinflammatory. In order to counteract these inflammatory factors and silence unwanted immune reactivity, the RPE cell also generates suppressive molecules. Recently, chronic immune reactivity has been implicated in a number of retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Current evidence suggests that the generation of excessive retinal inflammation may be the consequence of a loss of RPE immunosuppressive factors. Herein, we summarize the varied interactions of the RPE cell with the immune response and highlight how the RPE cell survives and participates in this dynamic environment.","publish_time":"2010-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Detrick, Barbara; Hooks, John J.","journal":"Immunol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65347ac0ac9dfa10b5aacc4c5955ee74d87662cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091130.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20082152/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12026-009-8146-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RPE","MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RPE cell","unique retinal cell","immune defense","immune responses","chronic immune reactivity","loss of RPE immunosuppressive factors","silence unwanted immune reactivity","number of retinal diseases","generation of excessive retinal inflammation","retinal pigment epithelial","number of essential functions","inflammatory factors","suppressive molecules","consequence","TLRs","pivotal role","age-related macular degeneration","adaptive immunity","MHC class","infections","production","regulation","plethora of cytokines","components","AMD","health","varied interactions","Current evidence","proinflammatory","order","antigen","dynamic environment","review"],"language":"en"},

For this purpose, contact-tracing apps are being proposed for large scale adoption by many countries. A centralized approach, where data sensed by the app are all sent to a nation-wide server, raises concerns about citizens\u0027 privacy and needlessly strong digital surveillance, thus alerting us to the need to minimize personal data collection and avoiding location tracking. We advocate the conceptual advantage of a decentralized approach, where both contact and location data are collected exclusively in individual citizens\u0027\u0022personal data stores\u0022, to be shared separately and selectively, voluntarily, only when the citizen has tested positive for COVID-19, and with a privacy preserving level of granularity. This approach better protects the personal sphere of citizens and affords multiple benefits: it allows for detailed information gathering for infected people in a privacy-preserving fashion; and, in turn this enables both contact tracing, and, the early detection of outbreak hotspots on more finely-granulated geographic scale. Our recommendation is two-fold. First to extend existing decentralized architectures with a light touch, in order to manage the collection of location data locally on the device, and allow the user to share spatio-temporal aggregates - if and when they want, for specific aims - with health authorities, for instance. Second, we favour a longer-term pursuit of realizing a Personal Data Store vision, giving users the opportunity to contribute to collective good in the measure they want, enhancing self-awareness, and cultivating collective efforts for rebuilding society.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nanni, Mirco; Andrienko, Gennady; Barab\u0027asi, Albert-L\u0027aszl\u0027o; Boldrini, Chiara; Bonchi, Francesco; Cattuto, Ciro; Chiaromonte, Francesca; Comand\u0027e, Giovanni; Conti, Marco; Cot\u0027e, Mark; Dignum, Frank; Dignum, Virginia; Domingo-Ferrer, Josep; Ferragina, Paolo; Giannotti, Fosca; Guidotti, Riccardo; Helbing, Dirk; Kaski, Kimmo; Kertesz, Janos; Lehmann, Sune; Lepri, Bruno; Lukowicz, Paul; Matwin, Stan; Jim\u0027enez, David Meg\u0027ias; Monreale, Anna; Morik, Katharina; Oliver, Nuria; Passarella, Andrea; Passerini, Andrea; Pedreschi, Dino; Pentland, Alex; Pianesi, Fabio; Pratesi, Francesca; Rinzivillo, Salvatore; Ruggieri, Salvatore; Siebes, Arno; Trasarti, Roberto; Hoven, Jeroen van den; Vespignani, Alessandro","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/79164aec34709012be2b7f02f49a29ebc0e363e3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05222v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs5MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Personal Data Store"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["personal data collection","personal data stores","collection of location data","Personal Data Store vision","citizens\u0027 privacy","location tracking","contact tracing","decentralized approach","personal sphere of citizens","contact-tracing apps","order","early detection of outbreaks","individual citizens\u0027","early detection of outbreak hotspots","collective efforts","existing decentralized architectures","large scale adoption","granulated geographic scale","rapid dynamics of COVID","effective tracking of virus transmission chains","users","multiple benefits","opportunity","light touch","concerns","detailed information","infected people","strong digital surveillance","health authorities","nation-wide server","longer-term pursuit","pandemic","lockdown","spatio-temporal aggregates","specific aims","restriction measures","self-awareness","rebuilding society","countries","fashion","conceptual advantage","turn","purpose","device","need","instance","phase","contagion resurgence","level of granularity","recommendation","fold"],"language":"en"},

The trends showed that as soon as COVID-19 cases were observed, the statistics started improving, regardless of government actions. This suggests that a portion of population who could and were willing to practice social distancing voluntarily and naturally reacted to the emergence of COVID-19 cases.

The study suggests that there is a natural behavior inertia toward social distancing, which puts a limit on the extent of improvement in the social-distancing-related statistics.

Starting from the classical SEIR model, the model is modified so as to better describe characteristic features of the underlying pathogen and its infectious modes. In line with the large number of secondary infections not related to contact with documented infectious individuals, the model includes a cohort of asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic infectious individuals, not accounted for in the data of new daily counts of infections. A Bayesian particle filtering algorithm is used to update dynamically the relevant cohort and simultaneously estimate the transmission rate as the new data on the number of new infections and disease related death become available. The underlying assumption of the model is that the infectivity rate is dynamically changing during the epidemics, either because of a mutation of the pathogen or in response to mitigation and containment measures. The sequential Bayesian framework naturally provides a quantification of the uncertainty in the estimate of the model parameters, including the reproduction number, and of the size of the different cohorts. Moreover, we introduce a dimensionless quantity, which is the equilibrium ratio between asymptomatic and symptomatic cohort sizes, and propose a simple formula to estimate the quantity. This ratio leads naturally to another dimensionless quantity that plays the role of the basic reproduction number $R_0$ of the model. When we apply the model and particle filter algorithm to COVID-19 infection data from several counties in Northeastern Ohio and Southeastern Michigan we found the proposed reproduction number $R_0$ to have a consistent dynamic behavior within both states, thus proving to be a reliable summary of the success of the mitigation measures.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Calvetti, Daniela; Hoover, Alexander; Rose, Johnie; Somersalo, Erkki","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a109af6463e6a42804135b3c8c56ee0f879897f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04365v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs5NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Northeastern Ohio"],"keyphrases":["model parameters","number of new infections","dynamic epidemiology model","classical SEIR model","new data","proposed reproduction number","basic reproduction number","estimate","cohort of asymptomatic","infection data","large number of secondary infections","dimensionless quantity","data of new daily counts of infections","COVID","relevant cohort","documented infectious individuals","oligosymptomatic infectious individuals","underlying pathogen","infectious modes","mitigation measures","Bayesian particle filtering algorithm","symptomatic cohort sizes","particle filter algorithm","equilibrium ratio","transmission rate","underlying assumption","infectivity rate","containment measures","disease related death","consistent dynamic behavior","sequential Bayesian framework","Southeastern Michigan","counties","Northeastern Ohio","quantification","response","contact","spread","role","success","simple formula","states","mutation","characteristic features","line","uncertainty","reliable summary","different cohorts","epidemics"],"language":"en"},

Recently, Broniatowski et al. found that foreign powers, and especially Russia, were implicated in information operations using public health crises to promote discord -- including racial conflict -- in American society (Broniatowski, 2018). This brief considers the problem of automatically detecting changes in overall attitudes, that may be associated with emerging information operations, via artificial intelligence. Accurate analysis of these emerging topics usually requires laborious, manual analysis by experts to annotate millions of tweets to identify biases in new topics. We introduce extensions of the Word Embedding Association Test from Caliskan et. al to a new domain (Caliskan, 2017). This practical and unsupervised method is applied to quantify biases being promoted in information operations. Analyzing historical information operations from Russia\u0027s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections, we quantify biased attitudes for presidential candidates, and sentiment toward Muslim groups. We next apply this method to a corpus of tweets containing anti-Chinese hashtags. We find that roughly 1% of tweets in our corpus reference Russian-funded news sources and use anti-Chinese hashtags and, beyond the expected anti-Chinese attitudes, we find that this corpus as a whole contains pro-Russian attitudes, which are not present in a control Twitter corpus containing general tweets. Additionally, 4% of the users in this corpus were suspended within a week. These findings may indicate the presence of abusive account activity associated with rapid changes in attitudes around the COVID-19 public health crisis, suggesting potential information operations.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Toney, Autumn; Pandey, Akshat; Guo, Wei; Broniatowski, David; Caliskan, Aylin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/23f28ba5aa5ebfb8ef2ea936554d0676b74a2f5d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08726v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs5NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","United States","Russia","U.S."],"keyphrases":["corpus of tweets","emerging information operations","potential information operations","historical information operations","expected anti-Chinese attitudes","anti-Chinese hashtags","anti-Chinese sentiment","biased attitudes","overall attitudes","pro-Russian attitudes","millions of tweets","general tweets","control Twitter corpus","emerging topics","biases","new topics","Broniatowski","corpus reference Russian-funded news sources","public health crisis","public health crises","presidential candidates","rapid changes","manual analysis","presidential elections","Accurate analysis","Caliskan et","recent COVID","unsupervised method","new domain","Russia\u0027s interference","presence of abusive account activity","Word","Association Test","discord","experts","racial conflict","American society","United States","artificial intelligence","Muslim groups","extensions","problem","foreign powers","findings","pandemic","Wuhan","China","brief","users","week"],"language":"en"},

First, we collect a global dataset on internet searches indicative of economic anxieties. We find that the arrival of coronavirus in a country led to a substantial increase in such internet searches of up to 58 percent. Second, leveraging two US representative survey experiments conducted in early and mid-March 2020, we document a rapid surge in economic anxieties after the arrival of the coronavirus in the US. Third, to understand how information about the coronavirus affects these anxieties, we measure perceptions about the coronavirus. We find substantial heterogeneity in participants\u0027 beliefs about the mortality from and contagiousness of the virus.

In response, many countries all over the world have used different methods to reduce the infection rate, such as including case isolation, the closure of schools and universities, banning public events, and mostly forcing social distancing, including local and national lockdowns. In our work, we use a Monte-Carlo (MC) based algorithm to predict the virus infection rate for different population densities using the most recent epidemic data. We test the spread of the Coronavirus using three different lockdown models, and eight various combinations of constraints, which allow us to examine the efficiency of each model and constraint. The main prediction of this model is that a cyclic schedule of one week without restrictions and two weeks of lockdown can help to control the virus infection. In particular, this model reduces the infection rate when accompanied by social distancing and complete isolation of symptomatic patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"De-Leon, Hilla; Pederiva, Francesco","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18adc6ce9f107dcb81a4e2b826d93ce95ec2093d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10357v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs5OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus infection rate","social distancing","different methods","different lockdown models","countries","spread","different population densities","case isolation","weeks of lockdown","complete isolation of symptomatic patients","restrictions","closure of schools","algorithm","public events","universities","recent epidemic data","cyclic schedule","Coronavirus","various combinations of constraints","national lockdowns","Monte-Carlo","MC","world","COVID","pandemic","efficiency","main prediction","middle","people","work","response"],"language":"en"},

Many drug therapy developments consist in investigating through different clinical trials the effects of different specific drug combinations by delivering it into a test group of ill patients, meanwhile a placebo treatment is delivered to the remaining ill patients, known as the control group. We compare the above technique to a new technique in which all patients receive a different and reasonable combination of drugs and use this outcome to feed a Neural Network. By averaging out fluctuations and recognizing different patient features, the Neural Network learns the pattern that connects the patients initial state to the outcome of the treatments and therefore can predict the best drug therapy better than the above method. In contrast to many available works, we do not study any detail of drugs composition nor interaction, but instead pose and solve the problem from a phenomenological point of view, which allows us to compare both methods. Although the conclusion is reached through mathematical modeling and is stable upon any reasonable model, this is a proof-of-concept that should be studied within other expertises before confronting a real scenario. All calculations, tools and scripts have been made open source for the community to test, modify or expand it.

For fast pandemics where nobody has prior immunity and everyone has immunity after recovery, the SEIQR model decouples into two nonlinear delay differential equations (DDEs) with five parameters. One parameter is set to unity by scaling time. The subcase of perfect quarantining and zero self-recovery before quarantine, with two free parameters, is examined first. The method of multiple scales yields a hyperbolic tangent solution; and a long-wave approximation yields a first order ordinary differential equation (ODE). With imperfect quarantining and nonzero self-recovery, the long-wave approximation is a second order ODE. These three approximations each capture the full outbreak, from infinitesimal initiation to final saturation. Low-dimensional dynamics in the DDEs is demonstrated using a six state non-delayed reduced order model obtained by Galerkin projection. Numerical solutions from the reduced order model match the DDE over a range of parameter choices and initial conditions. Finally, stability analysis and numerics show how correctly executed time-varying social distancing, within the present model, can cut the number of affected people by almost half. Alternatively, faster detection followed by near-certain quarantining can potentially be even more effective.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vyasarayani, C.

The reports pertaining to the treatment of this pandemic are still lacking. We firmly believe that Nature itself provides a simple solution for any complicated problem created in it which motivated us to carry out In Silico investigations on some bioactive natural compounds reportedly found in the fruits and leaves of Anthocephalus Cadamba which is a miraculous plant found on the earth aiming to predict the potential inhibitors against aforesaid virus. Having modeled the ground state ligand structure of the such nine natural compounds applying density functional theory at B3LYP/631\u002BG (d, p) level we have performed their molecular docking with SARS-COV-2 protease to calculate the binding affinity as well as to screen the binding at S-protein site during ligand-protein interactions. Out of these nine studied naturally occurring compounds; Oleanic Acid has been appeared to be potential inhibitor for COVID-19 followed by Ursolic Acid, IsoVallesiachotamine,Vallesiachotamine,Cadambine,Vincosamide-N-Oxide, Isodihydroamino-cadambine, Pentyle Ester of Chlorogenic Acid and D-Myo-Inositol. Hence these bioactive natural compounds or their structural analogs may be explored as anti-COVID19 drug agent which will be possessing the peculiar feature of cost-less synthesis and less or no side effect due to their natural occurrence. The solubility and solvent-effect related to the phytochemicals may be the point of concern.

Drug discovery is a multistep process with a high failure rate, high cost and it takes approximately 10-12 years for the development of new molecules into the clinical candidate. On the other side, drug repurposing also called old drugs for new uses, is an attractive alternative approach for a new application of marketed FDA approved or investigational drugs. In the current pandemic situation raised due to COVID-19, repurposing of existing FDA approved drugs are emerging as the first line of the treatment. The causative viral agent of this highly contagious disease and acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) shares high nucleotide similarity. Therefore, many existing viral targets are structurally expected to be similar to SARS-CoV and likely to be inhibited by the same compounds. Here, we selected three viral key proteins based on their vital role in viral life cycle: ACE2 (helps in entry into the human host), viral nonstructural proteins RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) NSP12, and NSP16 which helps in replication, and viral latency (invasion from immunity). The FDA approved drugs chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), remdesivir (RDV) and arbidol (ABD) are emerging as promising agents to combat COVID-19.

The docking studies were carried out through Autodock and online COVID-19 docking server.

Various studies have been performed to understand the molecular mechanisms of viral infection for predicting drug repurposing candidates. However, such information is spread across many publications and it is very time-consuming to access, integrate, explore, and exploit. We developed CoVex, the first interactive online platform for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 host interactome exploration and drug (target) identification. CoVex integrates 1) experimentally validated virus-human protein interactions, 2) human protein-protein interactions and 3) drug-target interactions. The web interface allows user-friendly visual exploration of the virus-host interactome and implements systems medicine algorithms for network-based prediction of drugs. Thus, CoVex is an important resource, not only to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 pathogenicity, but also in clinical research for the identification and prioritization of candidate therapeutics. We apply CoVex to investigate recent hypotheses on a systems biology level and to systematically explore the molecular mechanisms driving the virus life cycle. Furthermore, we extract and discuss drug repurposing candidates involved in these mechanisms. CoVex renders COVID-19 drug research systems-medicine-ready by giving the scientific community direct access to network medicine algorithms integrating virus-host-drug interactions.

An increasingly worrying aspect is the gap between the exponential disease spread and the delay in adopting preventive measures. This gap is attributed to the lack of awareness about the disease and its preventive measures. Nowadays, social media platforms (ie., Twitter) are frequently used to create awareness about major events, including COVID-19. In this paper, we use Twitter to characterize public awareness regarding COVID-19 by analyzing the information flow in the most affected countries. Towards that, we collect more than 46K trends and 622 Million tweets from the top twenty most affected countries to examine 1) the temporal evolution of COVID-19 related trends, 2) the volume of tweets and recurring topics in those trends, and 3) the user sentiment towards preventive measures. Our results show that countries with a lower pandemic spread generated a higher volume of trends and tweets to expedite the information flow and contribute to public awareness. We also observed that in those countries, the COVID-19 related trends were generated before the sharp increase in the number of cases, indicating a preemptive attempt to notify users about the potential threat. Finally, we noticed that in countries with a lower spread, users had a positive sentiment towards COVID-19 preventive measures. Our measurements and analysis show that effective social media usage can influence public behavior, which can be leveraged to better combat future pandemics.","publish_time":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saad, Muhammad; Hassan, Muhammad; Zaffar, Fareed","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2c18d5879fd2cf63769d75fa4ae03059dec62bc9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.08379v3.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["preventive measures","related trends","public awareness","affected countries","lower spread","higher volume of trends","temporal evolution of COVID","volume of tweets","lack of awareness","users","social distancing","social media platforms","lower pandemic","information flow","public behavior","Twitter","gap","effective social media usage","positive sentiment","user sentiment","exponential disease","analysis","number of cases","sharp increase","preemptive attempt","recurring topics","delay","better combat future pandemics","measurements","quarantine","major events","potential threat","aspect","results","coronavirus","paper","lifestyles"],"language":"en"},

The susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model and its variants have been used for modeling the pandemic.

Moreover, very few models account for possible inaccuracies of the reported cases.

Here we propose a multi-model ordinary differential equation set neural network (MMODEs-NN) and model-free methods to predict the interprovincial transmissions in mainland China, especially those from Hubei Province. Compared with the previously proposed epidemiological models, the proposed network can simulate the transportations with the ODEs activation method, while the model-free methods based on the sigmoid function, Gaussian function, and Poisson distribution are linear and fast to generate reasonable predictions. According to the numerical experiments and the realities, the special policies for controlling the disease are successful in some provinces, and the transmission of the epidemic, whose outbreak time is close to the beginning of China Spring Festival travel rush, is more likely to decelerate before February 18 and to end before April 2020. The proposed mathematical and artificial intelligence methods can give consistent and reasonable predictions of the 2019-nCoV ending.

Most of the existing studies are based on large and private annotated datasets that are impractical to obtain from a single institution, especially when radiologists are busy fighting the coronavirus disease. Furthermore, it is hard to compare current COVID-19 CT segmentation methods as they are developed on different datasets, trained in different settings, and evaluated with different metrics. In this paper, we created a COVID-19 3D CT dataset with 20 cases that contains 1800\u002B annotated slices and made it publicly available. To promote the development of annotation-efficient deep learning methods, we built three benchmarks for lung and infection segmentation that contain current main research interests, e.g., few-shot learning, domain generalization, and knowledge transfer. For a fair comparison among different segmentation methods, we also provide unified training, validation and testing dataset splits, and evaluation metrics and corresponding code. In addition, we provided more than 40 pre-trained baseline models for the benchmarks, which not only serve as out-of-the-box segmentation tools but also save computational time for researchers who are interested in COVID-19 lung and infection segmentation.

Standard SEIR models distinguish essentially two regimes: either the disease is controlled and the number of infected people rapidly decreases, or the disease spreads and contaminates a significant fraction of the population until herd immunity is achieved. After lockdown, at first sight it seems that social distancing is not enough to control the outbreak. We discuss here a possible explanation, namely that the lockdown is creating social heterogeneity: even if a large majority of the population complies with the lockdown rules, a small fraction of the population still has to maintain a normal or high level of social interactions, such as health workers, providers of essential services, etc. This results in an apparent high level of epidemic propagation as measured through re-estimations of the basic reproduction ratio. However, these measures are limited to averages, while variance inside the population plays an essential role on the peak and the size of the epidemic outbreak and tends to lower these two indicators.

Although the recent international joint effort on making the availability of all sorts of open data, the public collection of CXR images is still relatively small for reliably training a deep neural network (DNN) to carry out COVID-19 prediction. To better address such inefficiency, we design a cascaded learning strategy to improve both the sensitivity and the specificity of the resulting DNN classification model.

Although often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that two different pathogens can exhibit, even when they have the same $R_0$. Here, we show how to predict outbreak size using estimates of the distribution of secondary infections, leveraging both its average $R_0$ and the underlying heterogeneity. To do so, we reformulate and extend a classic result from random network theory that relies on contact tracing data to simultaneously determine the first moment ($R_0$) and the higher moments (representing the heterogeneity) in the distribution of secondary infections. Further, we show the different ways in which this framework can be implemented in the data-scarce reality of emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19, the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically. Taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond $R_0$ when predicting epidemic size.","publish_time":"2020-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"H\u0027ebert-Dufresne, Laurent; Althouse, Benjamin M.; Scarpino, Samuel V.; Allard, Antoine","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02d6caabf04e46c315704f66b176eb44c49c78dc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04004v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsyNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["distribution of secondary infections","contact tracing data","emerging infectious diseases","emerging infectious disease outbreaks","data-scarce reality of emerging pathogens","underlying heterogeneity","different pathogens","outbreak size ranges","epidemic size","critical need","single number","different ways","basic reproductive number","random network theory","COVID","estimates","misapplied numbers","classic result","pandemic risk","uncertainty","complexity","public health","framework","average","higher moments"],"language":"en"},

Our results emphasize the importance of diminishing the inter-group infections in the effort of substantial flattening and delaying of the epi(demiologic) curve with concomitant mitigation of disastrous economy and social consequences. To exemplify with a limiting case, splitting a population into m (say, 5 or 10) noninteracting groups while keeping intra-group interaction unchanged yields a stretched epidemiologic curve having the maximum number of daily infections reduced and postponed in time by the same factor $m$ (5 or 10). More generally, our study suggests a practical approach to fight against SARS-CoV-2 virus spread based on population splitting into groups and minimizing intermingling between them. This strategy can be pursued by large-scale infrastructure reorganization of activity at different levels in big logistic units (e.g., large productive networks, factories, enterprises, warehouses, schools, (seasonal) harvest work). Importantly, unlike total lockdwon strategy, the proposed approach prevents economic ruin and keeps social life at a more bearable level than distancing everyone from anyone.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baldea, Ioan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/231f332378bba270eb2985c0a599c97e0dc17bee.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03054v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsyNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["population","inter-group infections","inter-group interactions","noninteracting groups","network of groups","intra-group interaction unchanged yields","proposed approach","social life","practical approach","social consequences","harvest work","stretched epidemiologic curve","total lockdwon strategy","maximum number of daily infections","different levels","big logistic units","concomitant mitigation of disastrous economy","large productive networks","factories","enterprises","schools","large-scale infrastructure reorganization of activity","economic ruin","warehouses","fight","effort of substantial flattening","SARS-CoV","bearable level","importance","COVID","time","study","pandemic dynamics","virus","distancing","limiting case","intermingling","results"],"language":"en"},

It expresses a mismatch between probabilities used in a formal model of a decision (i.e. model parameters) and probabilities inferred from real people\u0027s decisions (the same parameters estimated empirically). The inferred probabilities are called\u0022decision weights.\u0022It is considered a robust experimental finding that decision weights are higher than probabilities for rare events, and (necessarily, through normalisation) lower than probabilities for common events. Typically this is presented as a cognitive bias, i.e. an error of judgement by the person. Here we point out that the same observation can be described differently: broadly speaking, probability weighting means that a decision maker has greater uncertainty about the world than the observer. We offer a plausible mechanism whereby such differences in uncertainty arise naturally: when a decision maker must estimate probabilities as frequencies in a time series while the observer knows them a priori. This suggests an alternative presentation of probability weighting as a principled response by a decision maker to uncertainties unaccounted for in an observer\u0027s model.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peters, Ole; Adamou, Alexander; Kirstein, Mark; Berman, Yonatan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f65d8dc8975b9b7fcc1f1e7b1a17cb7fa1d2505.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00056v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjszMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["decision maker","decision weights","inferred probabilities","model parameters","formal model","observer\u0027s model","alternative presentation of probability weighting","greater uncertainty","common events","rare events","labels","patterns","principled response","uncertainties unaccounted","frequencies","robust experimental finding","human economic behaviour","real people\u0027s decisions","time series","world","error of judgement","Behavioural economics","plausible mechanism","differences","normalisation","cognitive bias","person","mismatch","observation"],"language":"en"},

The second group (experimental) corresponds to students from 2019/2020, which is the group of students that interrupted their face-to-face activities because of the confinement. The results show that there is a significant positive effect of the COVID-19 confinement on students performance. This effect is also significative in activities that did not change their format when performed after the confinement. We find that this effect is significative both in subjects that increased the number of assessment activities and subjects that did not change the workload of students. Additionally, an analysis of students learning strategies before confinement shows that students did not study in a continuous basis. Based on these results, we conclude that COVID-19 confinement changed students learning strategies to a more continuous habit, improving their efficiency. For these reasons, better scores in students assessment are expected due to COVID-19 confinement that can be explained by an improvement in their learning performance.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gonzalez, T.; Rubia, M.

In the absence of efficient contact tracing tools, Govt. and the policymakers may not be paying attention to the risk of hospital-based transmission. To explore more on this important route and its possible impact on lockdown effect, we developed a mechanistic model with hospital-based transmission. Using daily notified COVID-19 cases from six states (Maharashtra, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh) and overall India, we estimated several important parameters of the model. Moreover, we provided an estimation of the basic ($R_{0}$), the community ($R_{C}$), and the hospital ($R_{H}$) reproduction numbers for those seven locations. To obtain a reliable forecast of future COVID-19 cases, a BMA post-processing technique is used to ensemble the mechanistic model with a hybrid statistical model. Using the ensemble model, we forecast COVID-19 notified cases (daily and cumulative) from May 3, 2020, till May 20, 2020, under five different lockdown scenarios in the mentioned locations. Our analysis of the mechanistic model suggests that most of the new COVID-19 cases are currently undetected in the mentioned seven locations. Furthermore, a global sensitivity analysis of four epidemiologically measurable \\\u0026controllable parameters on $R_{0}$ and as well on the lockdown effect, indicate that if appropriate preventive measures are not taken immediately, a much larger COVID-19 outbreak may trigger from hospitals and quarantined centers.

Presently, there is no effective PEDV vaccine available. In this study, we developed a plant-produced monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2C10 as a prophylactic candidate to prevent the PEDV infection. Recently, plant expression systems have gained interest as an alternative for the production of antibodies because of many advantages, such as low production cost, lack of human and animal pathogen, large scalability, etc. The 2C10 mAb was transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana and lettuce using geminiviral vector. After purification by protein A affinity chromatography, the antibody was tested for the binding and neutralizing activity against PEDV. Our result showed that the plant produced 2C10 mAb can bind to the virus and also inhibit PEDV infection in vitro .

To identify human genetic susceptibility to A(H7N9) infection, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) involving 102 A(H7N9) patients and 106 heavily-exposed healthy poultry workers, a sample size critically restricted by the small number of human A(H7N9) cases. To tackle the stringent significance cutoff of GWAS, we utilized an artificial imputation program SnipSnip to improve the association signals. In single-SNP analysis, one of the top SNPs was rs13057866 of LGALS1. The artificial imputation (AI) identified three non-genotyped causal variants, which can be represented by three anchor/partner SNP pairs rs13057866/rs9622682 (AI P = 1.81 \u00D7 10(\u22127)), rs4820294/rs2899292 (2.13 \u00D7 10(\u22127)) and rs62236673/rs2899292 (4.25 \u00D7 10(\u22127)) respectively. Haplotype analysis of rs4820294 and rs2899292 could simulate the signal of a causal variant. The rs4820294/rs2899292 haplotype GG, in association with protection from A(H7N9) infection (OR = 0.26, P = 5.92 \u00D7 10(\u22127)) correlated to significantly higher levels of LGALS1 mRNA (P = 0.050) and protein expression (P = 0.025) in lymphoblast cell lines. Additionally, rs4820294 was mapped as an eQTL in human primary monocytes and lung tissues.

Antipsychotic drugs generally target the dopamine pathways with some variation. As research of schizophrenia pathophysiology has shifted away from a strictly dopamine-centric focus, the development of new pharmacotherapies has waned. A field of inquiry with centuries-old roots is gaining traction in psychiatric research circles and may represent a new frontier for drug discovery in schizophrenia. At the forefront of this investigative effort is the immune system and its many components, pathways and phenotypes, which are now known to actively engage the brain. Studies in schizophrenia reveal an intricate association of environmentally-driven immune activation in concert with a disrupted genetic template. A consistent conduit through this gene-environmental milieu is the gut-brain axis, which when dysregulated can generate pathological autoimmunity. In this review, we present epidemiological and biochemical evidence in support of an autoimmune component in schizophrenia and depict gut processes and a dysbiotic microbiome as a source and perpetuator of autoimmune dysfunction in the brain. Within this framework, we review the role of infectious agents, inflammation, gut dysbioses and autoantibody propagation on CNS pathologies such as neurotransmitter receptor hypofunction and complement pathway-mediated synaptic pruning. We then review the new pharmacotherapeutic horizon and novel agents directed to impact these pathological conditions. At the core of this discourse is the understanding that schizophrenia is etiologically and pathophysiologically heterogeneous and thus its treatment requires individualized attention with disease state variants diagnosed with objective biomarkers.","publish_time":"2018-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Severance, Emily G.; Dickerson, Faith B.; Yolken, Robert H.","journal":"Pharmacology \u0026 Therapeutics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0280191838881dab3b360cd7e443b26180a6d60a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6097895.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pharmthera.2018.05.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163725818300792; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163725818300792; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29742478/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["research of schizophrenia pathophysiology","review","gut-brain axis","gut dysbioses","gut processes","new frontier","dopamine pathways","development of new pharmacotherapies","new pharmacotherapeutic horizon","novel agents","autoimmune component","immune activation","immune system","classes of drugs","Antipsychotic drugs","impact compliance","pathological conditions","pathological autoimmunity","role of infectious agents","perpetuator of autoimmune dysfunction","psychiatric research circles","dopamine-centric focus","CNS pathologies","inflammation","disease state variants","autoantibody propagation","traction","support","neurotransmitter receptor hypofunction","centuries-old roots","gene-environmental milieu","individualized attention","concert","source","dysbiotic microbiome","biochemical evidence","intricate association","objective biomarkers","disrupted genetic template","investigative effort","components","understanding","line treatments","drug discovery","atypical antipsychotics","field of inquiry","consistent conduit","effects","discourse","Studies","synaptic pruning","core","forefront","phenotypes","variation","framework"],"language":"en"},

An alkyl or aryl substituent was also introduced at the 1-position of the octahydroisochromene scaffold and expected to introduce additional interactions with the protease. Sharpless\u2013Katsuki asymmetric epoxidation and Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation were employed to construct the octahydroisochromene scaffold. The introductions of the P1 site His-al and the substituent at 1-position was achieved using successive reductive amination reactions. Our initial evaluations of the diastereo-isomeric mixtures (16a\u2013d) revealed that the octahydroisochromene moiety functions as a core hydrophobic scaffold for the S2 pocket of the protease and the substituent at the 1-position may form additional interactions with the protease. The inhibitory activities of the diastereoisomerically-pure inhibitors (3a\u2013d) strongly suggest that a specific stereo-isomer of the octahydroisochromene scaffold, (1S, 3S) 3b, directs the P1 site imidazole, the warhead aldehyde, and substituent at the 1-position of the fused ring to their appropriate pockets in the protease.","publish_time":"2020-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yoshizawa, Shin-ichiro; Hattori, Yasunao; Kobayashi, Kazuya; Akaji, Kenichi","journal":"Bioorganic \u0026 Medicinal Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dfdbbed7b06c9e9c988682c4371629b522c33a15.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127348.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2019.115273; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0968089619319637; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089619319637; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31926775/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["octahydroisochromene scaffold","position","protease inhibitor","core hydrophobic scaffold","aryl substituent","octahydroisochromene moiety functions","S2 pocket","additional interactions","novel hydrophobic core","Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation","P1 site imidazole","Katsuki asymmetric epoxidation","warhead aldehyde","diastereo-isomeric mixtures","diastereoisomerically-pure inhibitors","fused ring","appropriate pockets","specific stereo-isomer","successive reductive amination reactions","initial evaluations","inhibitory activities","known SARS","alkyl","introductions"],"language":"en"},

The present study aimed to estimate the case fatality ratio (CFR) by appropriately taking into account the time delay from illness onset to death. We then compare our estimate against previously published values of the CFR for MERS, i.e., 20% and 40%. Methods Dates of illness onset and death of the MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea were extracted from secondary data sources. Using the known distribution of time from illness onset to death and an integral equation model, we estimated the delay-adjusted risk of MERS death for the South Korean cluster. Results Our most up-to-date estimate of CFR for the MERS outbreak in South Korea was estimated at 20.0% (95% confidence intervals (CI): 14.6, 26.2). During the course of the outbreak, estimate of the CFR in real time appeared to have decreased and become significantly lower than 40%. Conclusions The risk of MERS death in Korea was consistent with published CFR. The estimate decreased with time perhaps due to time-dependent increase in case ascertainment.

METHODS: Countries\u2019 self-reported assessments implemented by percentages as IHR Monitoring Tools (IHRMT) in 2016 and 2017 were used to represent national capacity regarding infectious disease control. WHO Disease Outbreak News and matched diseases reports on ProMED-mail were collected in 2016 to represent disease control outcomes of countries. Disease control outcomes were divided in good, normal and bad groups based on the development of outbreaks listed in the reports. The Human Development Index (HDI), density of physicians and nurses, health expenditure, number of arrivals of international tourists were also collected for control. Chi-square test and logistic regression were applied for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 907 cases occurred in 92 countries. For all diseases, cases occurring in high international travel volume countries presented twice the risk of having a bad disease control outcomes than cases occurring in low international travel volume countries (OR = 2.19 for IHR 2016, OR = 2.97 for IHR 2017). Cases occurring in low IHR average score countries had significant higher risk (OR = 7.83 for IHR 2016 and OR = 2.23 for IHR 2017) of having a bad disease control outcomes than countries with high IHR average scores. For only human diseases, cases occurring in high international travel volume countries presented twice the risk of having a bad disease control outcomes than cases occurring in low international travel volume countries for IHR 2017 (OR = 2.79). Cases occurring in low IHR average score countries had significant higher risk (OR = 11.16 for IHR 2016 and OR = 3.45 for IHR 2017) of having a bad disease control outcomes than countries with high IHR average scores. The HDI, health workforce density and total health expenditure were all positively associated with disease control outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Countries\u2019 self-reported infectious disease control capacities positively correlated with their disease control outcomes. While the self-reported IHR scores were accountable to some degree, this approach was useful for understanding global capacity in infectious disease control and in allocating resources for future preparedness.","publish_time":"2020-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsai, Feng-Jen; Tipayamongkholgul, Mathuros","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ba845e26468986fb62bfda4b4cc23238f0a4a89.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7057569.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32131785/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-8359-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["International Health","IHR","HDI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease control outcomes of countries","bad disease control outcomes","infectious disease control outcomes","cases","low IHR average score countries","high IHR average scores","self-reported IHR scores","Countries\u2019 self-reported infectious disease control capacities","low international travel volume countries","high international travel volume countries","IHR Monitoring Tools","Disease Outbreak News","countries\u2019 self-reported International Health Regulation","international tourists","Countries\u2019 self-reported assessments","bad groups","significant higher risk","total health expenditure","capacity assessments","human diseases","health workforce density","global capacity","national capacity","matched diseases","HDI","reports","Human Development Index","density of physicians","development of outbreaks","percentages","allocating resources","associations","number of arrivals","approach","nurses","degree","CONCLUSIONS","logistic regression","IHRMT","METHODS","ProMED-mail","future preparedness","Chi-square test","study","analysis","RESULTS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

By doing so, the infected monocytes can escape antibody-dependent cell lysis. In the present study, we investigated which kinases and cytoskeletal proteins are of importance during internalisation and subsequent intracellular transport. The experiments showed that myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and myosin 1 are crucial for the initiation of the internalisation. With co-localisation stainings, it was found that MLCK and myosin 1 co-localise with antigens even before internalisation started. Myosin 6 co-localised with the internalising complexes during passage through the cortical actin, were it might play a role in moving or disintegrating actin filaments, to overcome the actin barrier. One minute after internalisation started, vesicles had passed the cortical actin, co-localised with microtubules and association with myosin 6 was lost. The vesicles were further transported over the microtubules and accumulated at the microtubule organising centre after 10 to 30 min. Intracellular trafficking over microtubules was mediated by MLCK, myosin 1 and a small actin tail. Since inhibiting MLCK with ML-7 was so efficient in blocking the internalisation pathway, this target can be used for the development of a new treatment for FIPV.","publish_time":"2014-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dewerchin, Hannah L; Desmarets, Lowiese M; Noppe, Ytse; Nauwynck, Hans J","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/69e95489dff0da006349ceb3a46a1f215cb1b910.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3937040.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1297-9716-45-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24517254/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MLCK","FIPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MLCK","cortical actin","microtubules","actin barrier","caveolae-independent internalisation pathway","disintegrating actin filaments","small actin tail","myosin light chain kinase","cytoskeletal proteins","co-localisation stainings","infected monocytes","vesicles","express viral proteins","new clathrin","new treatment","Intracellular trafficking","subsequent intracellular transport","coronavirus","importance","internalising complexes","feline infectious peritonitis virus","kinases","passage","antibody-dependent cell lysis","development","plasma membranes","experiments","association","FIPV","role","target","initiation","antigens","present study","centre","binding of antibodies","minute"],"language":"en"},

The elucidation of the structure of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer has further fueled the search for Env immunogens that induce bNAbs, but while native Env trimer mimetics are often capable of inducing strain-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against the parental virus, they have not yet induced potent bNAb responses. To improve the performance of Env trimer immunogens, researchers have studied the immune responses that Env trimers have induced in animals; they have evaluated how to best use Env trimers in various immunization regimens; and they have engineered increasingly stabilized Env trimer variants.

The results show that both events generated economic losses. The unexpected negative economic impact of the Beijing Olympics seems attributable to visa restrictions. Suggestions for the alleviation of the negative impact of visa regulations are provided.","publish_time":"2013-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, ShiNa; Song, Haiyan","journal":"Annals of Tourism Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/617415a245d1d662527a0ebd19d89ddce080d67f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160738313001047; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0160738313001047","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Beijing Olympics"],"keyphrases":["economic effects of visa restrictions","unexpected negative economic impact","economic losses","negative impact of visa regulations","Beijing Olympics","tourism demand","impacts of large scale events","policy suggestions","Beijing Olympic Games","computable general equilibrium","innovative combination of econometric","Tian\u2019an Men Square Incident","CGE","models","alleviation","paper","Abstract Increasing attention","results","factors"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of combining point-of-care molecular viral test and serum procalcitonin (PCT) level for antibiotic stewardship in the emergency department (ED). Design A prospective twin-center cohort study was conducted between January 2017 and March 2018. Setting and Participants Older adult patients who presented to the ED with SARIs received a rapid molecular test for 17 respiratory viruses and a PCT test. Measures To evaluate the clinical impact, we compared the outcomes of SARI patients between the experimental cohort and a propensity score\u2013matched historical cohort. The primary outcome was the proportion of antibiotics discontinuation or de-escalation in the ED. The secondary outcomes included duration of intravenous antibiotics, length of hospital stay, and mortality. Results A total of 676 patients were included, of which 169 patients were in the experimental group and 507 patients were in the control group. More than one-fourth (27.9%) of the patients in the experimental group tested positive for virus. Compared with controls, the experimental group had a significantly higher proportion of antibiotics discontinuation or de-escalation in the ED (26.0% vs 16.1%, P = .007), neuraminidase inhibitor uses (8.9% vs 0.6%, P \u003C .001), and shorter duration of intravenous antibiotics (10.0 vs 14.5 days, P \u003C .001). Conclusions and Implications Combining rapid viral surveillance and PCT test is a useful strategy for early detection of potential viral epidemics and antibiotic stewardship. Clustered viral respiratory infections in a nursing home is common. Patients transferred from nursing homes to ED may benefit from this approach.","publish_time":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Chien-Chang; Chang, Julia Chia-Yu; Mao, Xiao-Wei; Hsu, Wan-Ting; Chen, Shey-Ying; Chen, Yee-Chun; How, Chorng-Kuang","journal":"Journal of the American Medical Directors Association","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7115e78573daaa6ed64ecfbb559d1c558ec4579e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106143.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525861019307017; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525861019307017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31791902/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2019.09.020","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["SARI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["experimental group","PCT test","experimental cohort","molecular viral test","outcomes of SARI patients","vs","Participants Older adult patients","rapid molecular test","Clustered viral respiratory infections","control group","rapid viral surveillance","higher proportion of antibiotics discontinuation","shorter duration of intravenous antibiotics","respiratory viruses","antibiotic stewardship","de-escalation","SARIs","clinical impact","severe acute respiratory infections","matched historical cohort","early detection of potential viral epidemics","older adults","secondary outcomes","nursing homes","prospective twin-center cohort study","Abstract Objectives Virus infection","useful strategy","serum procalcitonin","level","propensity score","Implications","length of hospital","emergency department","Conclusions","point","days","primary outcome","neuraminidase inhibitor","mortality","Measures","controls","approach","total"],"language":"en"},

Three clinical cases of patients presenting severe lung disease requiring mechanical ventilation and prolonged intensive care fitted on the variable spectra of AFOP histopathology and had poor outcome: a 23 year-old women had AFOP in the context of antiphospholipid syndrome pulmonary compromise; a 35 year-old man developed a letal intensive care pneumonia with AFOP pattern registered in post-mortem biopsy; and a 79 year-old man died 21 days after intensive care unit treatment of a sub-pleural organizing pneumonia with intra-alveolar fibrin, seen in post-mortem biopsy.

How do we maintain safety? What is reactive hazard? What is biohazard? Chemical transformation, or biotransformation, means change. Any changes have irreversible consequences. Managing the changes can help us, but changes can also be harmful. The first line of defense on any potential unwanted transformations is isolation or containment. WHO defines four risk groups of biosafety levels. There are six key knowledge bases for biosafety. With chemical safety, substance identification is the first step. The global harmonized system of classification and labeling is generally accepted by the world health safety bodies. The hazards are divided into three categories: physical, health, and environmental. Chemical reactivity hazard is a situation where an uncontrolled reaction could result directly or indirectly in serious harm to people, property, or equipment. Fire and explosion are common reactivity hazards. To safeguard processes and facilities, one needs to first identify the threat by screening for reactivity hazards. Combustion processes proceed with chain reactions and the reaction is highly exothermic. Combined with the high activation energy, combustion depends largely on temperature. The overall reaction products can also vary (partial oxidation versus total oxidation). Partial oxidation reactions are important in the chemical industry. Pyrolysis and gasification of biomass, for example, are useful technologies in biomass conversion. An explosion is a fast, transient, exothermic reaction. Unintended and accidental explosions can occur due to: (1) the accumulation of reactive chemicals (gas, liquid, or solid) in confined space; (2) leakage of a \u201Csignificant amount\u201D of reactive chemicals (gas, liquid, or solid) to the atmosphere or environment; or (3) reactor runaway.

No specific analysis has been done on the epidemiological and clinical features of HAdV in pediatric pneumonia in China. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from hospitalized children with pneumonia from June 2009 to May 2014. All samples that tested positive for HAdV were typed by sequencing the hexon and fiber genes. From a total of 3089 samples, 208 (6.7 %) were positive for HAdV, identified as belonging to HAdV-B (186, 89.4 %), HAdV-C (9, 4.3 %) and HAdV-E (1, 0.5 %). HAdV-7 (104, 50.0 %) and HAdV-3 (78, 37.5 %) were the two major types, followed by HAdV-1, HAdV-55 and HAdV-14. There were 87 (41.8 %) single HAdV infections, of which 80 % were HAdV-7 infections. Multivariate analysis showed that single infections with HAdV-7 were associated with a higher prevalence of severe pneumonia. Temporal patterns showed that, except for a simultaneous outbreak of HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 during the years 2010\u20132011, HAdV-7 and HAdV-3 were alternately predominant, and the dominance shifted to HAdV-3 after 2014. Identification of the predominant HAdV genotypes and their epidemical features is useful for determining preventive strategies. HAdV-7 associated severe pneumonia needs to be considered with high priority in clinical practice.","publish_time":"2014-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wo, Ying; Lu, Qing-Bin; Huang, Dou-Dou; Li, Xiao-Kun; Guo, Chen-Tao; Wang, Hong-Yu; Zhang, Xiao-Ai; Liu, Wei; Cao, Wu-Chun","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65d2bfb78df71bc61051b485151ddee7f7c91cd5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087000.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25504360/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-014-2308-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["HAdV-E","HAdV-B","HAdV-C","single HAdV infections","clinical features of HAdV","predominant HAdV genotypes","simultaneous outbreak of HAdV","single infections","associated severe pneumonia","pediatric pneumonia","species B","higher prevalence of severe pneumonia","samples","epidemical features","frequent causative agents of acute respiratory infections","clinical practice","Multivariate analysis","specific analysis","hospitalized children","preventive strategies","high priority","Human adenoviruses","Nasopharyngeal aspirates","hexon","Identification","China","fiber genes","major types","dominance","years","Temporal patterns","total"],"language":"en"},

In addition to being a potent source of IFN-\u03B1, other properties of these porcine CD4hiCD172lo cells including their morphological transition from a plasma cell-like shape during quiescence to one resembling a dendritic cell (DC) after activation by TGEV and their relatively strong constitutive expression of interferon regulatory factor-7 (IRF-7) conformed to the expectations of genuine pDCs. While a substantial IFN-\u03B1 response was also elicited from the porcine pDCs by pseudorabies virus (PrV), swine influenza virus (SIV), and TLR7 and 9 agonists, there was an agent-dependent induction of varying amounts of IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IFN-\u03B3, and TNF-\u03B1. Notably, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) failed to provoke the pDCs to secrete any of the measured cytokines except IL-2. Moreover, whereas pDCs exposed to TGEV or the TLR9 agonist rapidly increased IRF-7 production and morphed into DCs with enhanced CD80/86 expression, similar alterations were not observed during incubation with PRRSV. This atypical response of pDCs to PRRSV may contribute to its pathogenesis, which unlike that associated with PrV, SIV or TGEV includes persistent infection and limited development of protective immunity.","publish_time":"2010-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Calzada-Nova, Gabriela; Schnitzlein, William; Husmann, Robert; Zuckermann, Federico A.","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0fa03b4184a6c51b8be6c4f0af4e05cd010293e2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126865.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242709003523; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2009.10.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19939462/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242709003523","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PBMC","TGEV","PRRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["porcine pDCs","TGEV","PRRSV","atypical response of pDCs","substantial IFN-\u03B1 response","expectations of genuine pDCs","pseudorabies virus","TNF-\u03B1","IFN-\u03B3","porcine CD4hiCD172lo cells","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","swine influenza virus","respiratory syndrome virus","PrV","plasma cell","SIV","potent source of IFN","agent-dependent induction of varying amounts of IL","increased IRF","Abstract Plausible representatives of plasmacytoid dendritic cells","novel fluorescent-activated cell sorting procedures","strong constitutive expression of interferon regulatory factor","persistent infection","known stimulant","exposure","morphological transition","limited development of protective immunity","production","enhanced CD80","preponderance of individuals","TLR9 agonist","quiescence","activation","properties","selected phenotype","similar alterations","regards","pigs","blood","incubation","shape","TLR7","resultant subset","measured cytokines","agonists","addition","paucity","PBMC","pathogenesis"],"language":"en"},

GA has shown pleiotropic effects in vitro, including: antitumor effects through inhibition of lipogenesis; decreased expression of invasion associated proteins through AMPK activation; and potential rescue of amyloid-\u03B2 (A\u03B2) induced synaptic impairment. GA was also reported to have activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Several mechanisms for this activity have been suggested including: SUMOylation inhibition; blocking formation of the E1-SUMO intermediate; inhibition of fatty acid synthase; non-specific SIRT inhibition; and activation of protein phosphatase type-2C. Here we report that GA inhibits Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) by inhibition of both fusion and viral protein synthesis. Additionally, we report that GA inhibits human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) genome replication and Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of normal human astrocytes (NHA). We show a broad spectrum of fusion inhibition by GA of all three classes of fusion proteins including HIV, Ebola virus (EBOV), influenza A virus (IAV) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV). In addition, we show inhibition of a non-enveloped adenovirus. Our experiments suggest that GA inhibits virion entry by blocking the initial fusion event. Data showing inhibition of HSV-1 and CMV replication, when GA is administered post-infection, suggest a possible secondary mechanism targeting protein and DNA synthesis. Thus, in light of the strong effect of GA on viral infection, even after the infection begins, it may potentially be used to treat acute infections (e.g. Coronavirus, EBOV, ZIKV, IAV and measles), and also topically for the successful treatment of active lesions (e.g. HSV-1, HSV-2 and varicella-zoster virus (VZV)).","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Borenstein, Ronen; Hanson, Barbara A.; Markosyan, Ruben M.; Gallo, Elisa S.; Narasipura, Srinivas D.; Bhutta, Maimoona; Shechter, Oren; Lurain, Nell S.; Cohen, Fredric S.; Al-Harthi, Lena; Nicholson, Daniel A.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7eacd1839afa5931b0b506ae156bbbcecc08b5d0.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c4c795a6703372b7af4628fcb8eb39ff79361dc3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7075884.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-61700-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32179788/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsyMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ginkgolic","Epstein Barr"],"organizations":["Ginkgo","GA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inhibition of HSV","inhibition of lipogenesis","SUMOylation inhibition","strong effect of GA","Ebola virus","Zika virus","broad spectrum of fusion inhibition","non-specific SIRT inhibition","viral infection","inhibition of fatty acid synthase","Epstein Barr virus","varicella-zoster virus","Herpes simplex virus type","post-infection","classes of fusion proteins","viral protein synthesis","ZIKV","EBOV","infection of normal human astrocytes","activation of protein phosphatase type","IAV","initial fusion event","activity","AMPK activation","genome replication","human cytomegalovirus","CMV replication","antitumor effects","DNA synthesis","pleiotropic effects","HCMV","possible secondary mechanism","decreased expression of invasion","E1-SUMO intermediate","HIV","potential rescue of amyloid","alkylphenol constituents","virion entry","leaves","A\u03B2","formation","Coronavirus","influenza","Escherichia coli","Staphylococcus aureus","NHA","successful treatment of active lesions","fruits of Ginkgo biloba","Ginkgolic acids","synaptic impairment","acute infections","VZV","EBV","non-enveloped adenovirus","light","experiments","measles","Data","mechanisms","addition"],"language":"en"},

Antiviral activity was analyzed by plaque reduction assays and mode of antiviral action was determined by addition of the drugs to uninfected cells, to the virus prior to infection or to herpesvirus-infected cells. Star anise oil reduced viral infectivity by \u003E99%, phenylpropanoids inhibited HSV infectivity by about 60\u201380% and sesquiterpenes suppressed herpes virus infection by 40\u201398%. Both, star anise essential oil and all isolated compounds exhibited anti-HSV-1 activity by direct inactivation of free virus particles in viral suspension assays. All tested drugs interacted in a dose-dependent manner with herpesvirus particles, thereby inactivating viral infectivity. Star anise oil, rich in trans-anethole, revealed a high selectivity index of 160 against HSV, whereas among the isolated compounds only \u03B2-caryophyllene displayed a high selectivity index of 140. The presence of \u03B2-caryophyllene in many essential oils might contribute strongly to their antiviral ability. These results indicate that phenylpropanoids and sesquiterpenes present in essential oils contribute to their antiviral activity against HSV.","publish_time":"2011-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Astani, Akram; Reichling, J\u00FCrgen; Schnitzler, Paul","journal":"Evid Based Complement Alternat Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/015729be3f439e9ef2033276a4ef14df8873dda9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3096453.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20008902/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ecam/nep187","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral activity","Essential oil of star anise","star anise essential oil","Star anise oil","essential oils","\u03B2-caryophyllene oxide","\u03B2-eudesmol","presence of \u03B2","anti-HSV","viral infectivity","phenylpropanoids inhibited HSV infectivity","antiviral ability","herpes virus infection","sesquiterpenes present","mode of antiviral action","trans-anethole","herpesvirus particles","isolated compounds","herpes simplex virus type","viral suspension assays","high selectivity index","direct inactivation of free virus particles","herpesvirus-infected cells","uninfected cells","tested drugs","plaque reduction assays","eugenol","farnesol","dose-dependent manner","addition","example","results"],"language":"en"},

Most IBV strains have the typical genomic organization of other gamacoronaviruses, however, two strains lacked 3a and 5b genes as a result of a nucleotide change within the start codon in the 3a or 5b genes. Analysis of our 110 viruses revealed that recombination events may be responsible for the emergence of the LX4 genotype with different topologies. Most of these viruses disappeared (before mid-2005) because they were not \u201Cfit\u201D to adaptation in chickens.

Previous studies suggested a tumor-promoting role of IL-10 in breast cancer, whereas recent discoveries that IL-10 activated and expanded tumor-resident CD8(\u002B) T cells challenged the traditional view. Here, we investigated the role of IL-10 in HLA-A2-positive breast cancer patients with Grade III, Stage IIA or IIB in-situ and invasive ductal carcinoma, and compared it with that of IL-2, the canonical CD8(\u002B) T cell growth factor. We first observed that breast cancer patients presented higher serum levels of IL-2 and IL-10 than healthy controls. Upon prolonged TCR stimulation, peripheral blood CD8(\u002B) T cells from breast cancer patients tended to undergo apoptosis, which could be prevented by the addition of IL-2 and/or IL-10. The cytotoxicity of TCR-activated CD8(\u002B) T cells was also enhanced by exogenous IL-2 and/or IL-10. Interestingly, IL-2 and IL-10 demonstrated synergistic effects, since the enhancement in CD8(\u002B) T cell function when both cytokines were added was greater than the sum of the improvements mediated by each individual cytokine. IL-10 by itself could not promote the proliferation of CD8(\u002B) T cells but could significantly enhance IL-2-mediated promotion of CD8(\u002B) T cell proliferation. In addition, the cytotoxicity of tumor-infiltrating CD8(\u002B) T cells in breast tumor was elevated when both IL-2 and IL-10 were present but not when either one was absent. This synergistic effect was stopped by CD4(\u002B)CD25(\u002B) regulatory T cells (Treg), which depleted IL-2 in a cell number-dependent manner. Together, these results demonstrated that IL-2 and IL-10 could work synergistically to improve the survival, proliferation, and cytotoxicity of activated CD8(\u002B) T cells, an effect suppressible by CD4(\u002B)CD25(\u002B) Treg cells.","publish_time":"2017-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Xiaogang; Lu, Ping; Li, Bo; Zhang, Wanfu; Yang, Rong; Chu, Yan; Luo, Kaiyuan","journal":"Int J Biochem Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a38bfafc579bf328e38cdf0e6f66213385247c9e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185534.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28274688/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1357272517300493; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2017.03.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1357272517300493","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IIB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of IL","addition of IL","exogenous IL","regulatory T cells","proliferation of CD8","higher serum levels of IL","T cell proliferation","infiltrating CD8","canonical CD8","cytotoxicity of activated CD8","T cell function","breast tumor","Treg cells","T cell growth factor","mediated promotion of CD8","positive breast cancer patients","expanded tumor-resident CD8","peripheral blood CD8","cytotoxicity of tumor","cytotoxicity of TCR","CD25","CD4","cell number-dependent manner","precise role of interleukin","effect suppressible","synergistic effects","prolonged TCR stimulation","Grade","situ","IIB","HLA-A2","Stage IIA","recent discoveries","improvements","cytokines","enhancement","invasive ductal carcinoma","traditional view","apoptosis","Previous studies","individual cytokine","sum","survival","healthy controls","results"],"language":"en"},

A series of interventions were examined: administration of antiviral drugs by two approaches [targeted antiviral prophylaxis (TAP) and school-age targeted antiviral prophylaxis (STAP)], school closure, restraint, and combinations of these four interventions. METHODS: In order to generate a more realistic situation, we constructed an individual-based model (IBM) for the transmission of influenza in which each individual was assigned personal information on the basis of the National Census and Employment Status Survey of Sapporo city. In addition, data on high-risk casual contact groups commuting in crowded trains and buses were obtained from a census on transportation modes and introduced into the model. Observational data from previous pandemics were used for the epidemiological parameters. RESULTS: Both TAP and STAP interventions were highly effective in suppressing the spread of infection during the early period of an outbreak, but STAP was inferior to TAP in terms of the ripple effect of the administration of antiviral drugs. School closure and restraint were able to bring about a delay in the peak of infection. The combination of TAP, school closure, and restraint interventions were highly effective in decreasing the total number of patients and shortening the epidemic period. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the simulation results, we recommend implementing TAP together with both school closure and restraint as strategies against a future novel influenza outbreak.","publish_time":"2009-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morimoto, Tomoko; Ishikawa, Hirofumi","journal":"Environmental Health and Preventive Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e03412888918245ff6e23b00b78ba81f6b9395b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2854337.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19941171/; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs12199-009-0122-9.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12199-009-0122-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBM","STAP","TAP"],"locations":["Hokkaido","Japan"],"keyphrases":["school closure","restraint interventions","STAP interventions","school-age","combination of TAP","administration of antiviral drugs","targeted antiviral prophylaxis","series of interventions","novel influenza epidemic","future novel influenza outbreak","transmission of influenza","epidemic period","individual-based model","intervention strategies","National Census","Observational data","early period","spread of infection","simulation results","peak of infection","Employment Status Survey of Sapporo city","simulations of various scenarios","high-risk casual contact groups","approaches","crowded trains","basis","Hokkaido","IBM","previous pandemics","ripple effect","study","buses","addition","terms","combinations","total number of patients","personal information","order","delay","realistic situation","transportation modes","Japan","epidemiological parameters","OBJECTIVES","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Routine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis can be extended through the calculation of the albumin quotient (Q (alb)), a marker of the integrity of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), and IgG index, an estimate of intrathecal IgG synthesis. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to validate nephelometric methods for CSF protein analysis, and to use the Q (alb) and IgG index to discriminate blood\u2010 and brain\u2010derived immunoglobulin fractions in cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Methods: Cats presented to our clinic between 2001 and 2005 were included in the study based on clinical and laboratory data and histopathologic findings at necropsy. Cats were grouped as having nonneurologic disease (controls; n=37), brain tumors (n=8), FIP involving the CNS (n=12), and extraneural FIP (n=12). CSF\u2010total protein (TP) was measured and albumin and IgG concentrations were measured in paired CSF/serum samples; Q (alb) and IgG index were calculated. Intraassay and interassay precision of the nephelometric assays were determined using pooled samples. Results: Coefficients of variation for the nephelometric assays ranged from 2.7% to 7.2%. In control cats, CSF\u2010TP concentration ranged from 0.06 to 0.36 g/L, Q (alb) ranged from 0.6 to 5.7 \u00D7 10(\u22123), and IgG index ranged from 0.3 to 0.6. Q (alb) and IgG index were significantly higher in cats with brain tumors and cats with CNS\u2010FIP compared with other groups. Compared with control cats, pleocytosis was evident in 8 of 12 (67%) cats and CSF\u2010TP was increased in 3 of 12 (25%) cats with CNS\u2010FIP. Conclusion: Nephelometry is a reliable method for measurement of CSF protein, albumin, and IgG in cats. The Q (alb) and IgG index did not identify a CSF protein pattern specific for BBB dysfunction or intrathecal IgG synthesis in cats with CNS\u2010FIP.","publish_time":"2008-06-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Steinberg, Tanja Alexandra; Boettcher, Irene Christine; Matiasek, Kaspar; Hirschvogel, Katrin; Hartmann, Katrin; Fischer, Andrea; Kuntz, Anne","journal":"Vet Clin Pathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37f1e02013ec0f53bde8bcb3fc78a04df1cdf811.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169305.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1939-165x.2008.00028.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18533921/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CSF","CNS","BBB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IgG index","control cats","IgG concentrations","CNS","CSF protein analysis","paired CSF","measurement of CSF protein","estimate of intrathecal IgG synthesis","CSF protein pattern specific","extraneural FIP","brain tumors","brain barrier","nephelometric assays","total protein","nephelometric methods","blood","albumin quotient","TP concentration","study","BBB dysfunction","serum samples","pooled samples","derived immunoglobulin fractions","laboratory data","reliable method","feline infectious peritonitis","histopathologic findings","central nervous system","frequent condition","Inflammation","necropsy","Nephelometry","Coefficients of variation","interassay precision","integrity","etiology","Routine cerebrospinal fluid","nonneurologic disease","calculation","Background","Conclusion","Intraassay","controls","marker","pleocytosis","Results","Objectives","purpose","clinic","groups"],"language":"en"},

However, until now there has been no systematic analysis of typical characteristics of outbreaks, for which closure was considered necessary. This article presents data on features of such nosocomial epidemics published during the past 40 years in the medical literature. A search of the Outbreak Database (1561 nosocomial outbreaks in file) revealed a total of 194 outbreaks that ended up with some kind of closure of the unit (median closure time: 14 days). Closure rates (CRs) were calculated and stratified for medical departments, for causative pathogens, for outbreak sources, and for the assumed mode of transmission. Data were then compared to the overall average CR of 12.4% in the entire database. Wards in geriatric patient care were closed significantly more frequently (CR: 30.3%; P \u003C0.001) whereas paediatric wards showed a significantly lower CR (6.1%; P =0.03). Pathogen species with the highest CR were norovirus (44.1%; P \u003C0.001) and influenza/parainfluenza virus (38.5%; P \u003C0.001).

This study sought to define platelet activation dynamics in KD patients by assaying platelet-derived microparticles (PDMPs). We measured plasma PDMPs levels in 46 patients with KD using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Blood samples were collected before, at 2\u20135 days, and 9\u201315 days after intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion, 2 months and 4\u20135 months after the onset of KD. We measured PDMP levels in 23 febrile and 10 afebrile control patients. In the acute phase of KD patients, PDMP levels increased significantly after IVIG treatment (12.04 \u00B1 5.58 nmol before IVIG infusion vs. 19.81 \u00B1 13.21 nmol at 2\u20135 days after IVIG infusion, P = 0.006). PDMP levels were negatively correlated with age and positively correlated with procalcitonin levels in the acute phase of KD. No significant difference was found in PDMP levels between KD patients with and without coronary artery lesion (CAL). Elevated PDMP levels after IVIG therapy significantly decreased below the pre-IVIG level in subacute phase (19.81 \u00B1 13.21 nmol at 2\u20135 days after IVIG infusion vs. 8.33 \u00B1 2.02 nmol at 9\u201315 days after IVIG infusion, P \u003C 0.001), and PDMP levels stayed below the pre-IVIG level in the convalescent phase, during which antiplatelet therapy was given. However, PDMP levels rebounded after discontinuing aspirin in 17 patients. In conclusion, enhanced platelet activation was noted before treatment of KD and peaked immediately after IVIG treatment. Recurrent rising of PDMP levels was observed after discontinuing aspirin, although there were no significant differences between the PDMP levels at 2 months after the onset of KD and those at 4\u20135 months after the onset of the disease.","publish_time":"2017-05-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Hyun Jung; Choi, Eun-Hye; Lim, Yeon Jung; Kil, Hong Ryang","journal":"J Korean Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a3e2f4a9e9c1bc50381ef0161f062bb6f925b7be.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5461319.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2017.32.7.1147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28581272/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs1Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kawasaki","KD","PDMP","IVIG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IVIG infusion","Elevated PDMP levels","IVIG therapy","IVIG treatment","procalcitonin levels","treatment of KD","onset of KD","Recurrent rising of PDMP levels","acute phase of KD patients","days","pre-IVIG level","plasma PDMPs levels","nmol","months","platelet dynamics","platelet activation dynamics","afebrile control patients","convalescent phase","subacute phase","enhanced platelet activation","effect of antiplatelet therapy","aspirin","assaying platelet-derived microparticles","Kawasaki disease","significant differences","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","coronary artery lesion","ELISA","intravenous immunoglobulin","age","conclusion","study","Blood samples"],"language":"en"},

Recently, the outbreak of the epidemic disease has been a serious problem in swine industry. The objective of this study is to develop a rapid, sensitive, and real-time reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method for the detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in less equipped laboratories. RESULTS: The optimal reaction condition of the current real-time RT-LAMP for PEDV was 62 \u00B0C for 45 min. It was capable of detecting PEDV from clinical samples and differentiating PEDV from several related porcine viruses, while it did not require additional expensive equipment. The minimum detection limit of the real-time RT-LAMP assay was 0.07PFU per reaction for PEDV RNA, making this assay approximately 100-fold more sensitive than that of one-step RT-PCR. By screening a panel of clinical specimens, the results showed that this method presented a similar sensitivity with real-time RT-PCR and was somewhat sensitive than one-step RT-PCR in detection of clinical samples. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we have developed a new real-time RT-LAMP method, which is rapid, sensitive and efficient to detect PEDV.This method holds great promises not only in laboratory detection and discrimination of PEDV but also in large scale field and clinical studies.","publish_time":"2015-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Xuewu; Shi, Lin; Lv, Xiaoping; Yao, Wei; Cao, Minghui; Yu, Hanxun; Wang, Xiurong; Zheng, Shimin","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af728043c4fdbde717229134e2cd8bada6760176.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4459462.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-015-0297-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25972083/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs1Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["real-time RT-PCR","real-time RT-LAMP assay","current real-time RT-LAMP","new real-time RT-LAMP method","differentiating PEDV","discrimination of PEDV","PEDV RNA","one-step RT-PCR","detection of clinical samples","detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","laboratory detection","epidemic disease","clinical studies","real-time reverse transcription loop","minimum detection limit","watery diarrhea","panel of clinical specimens","RESULTS","study","related porcine viruses","swine industry","optimal reaction condition","contagious enteric disease","isothermal amplification","severe enteritis","PFU","large scale field","serious problem","great promises","similar sensitivity","BACKGROUND","fold","equipped laboratories","additional expensive equipment","outbreak","CONCLUSIONS","objective"],"language":"en"},

Several diagnostic assays have been employed to detect the presence of the virus in stool samples from calves. Despite this, the frequency of BCoV infection among Brazilian and even South American cattle herds has yet to be well characterised. This study describes the occurrence of BCoV infection among calves from dairy and beef herds in four Brazilian states. A total of 282 stool samples from 1 to 60-day-old calves were evaluated for the presence of BCoV by a semi-nested (SN) PCR assay. The animals were from herds (n = 23) located in three geographical regions in Brazil (south, southeast, and center-west). The specific BCoV amplicon was detected in 15.6% (44/282) of the faecal specimens examined, of which 95.4% (42/44) were from diarrhoeic and 4.6% (2/44) from asymptomatic calves. The specificity of the SN-PCR amplicons was evaluated by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The results show that the BCoV is widespread, mainly among calves from 16 to 30-days-old (p = 0.0023), and verify the association between BCoV infection and clinical signs of diarrhoea (p = 0.005). These findings emphasise the importance of this virus in enteric infections of Brazilian cattle herds.","publish_time":"2009-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stipp, Danilo T.; Barry, Aline F.; Alfieri, Alice F.; Takiuchi, Elisabete; Amude, Alexandre M.; Alfieri, Amauri A.","journal":"Trop Anim Health Prod","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/feb29b8c51f4a521c4f373b83a37aee6c1a7e2a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089217.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19370396/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11250-009-9347-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs1ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["presence of BCoV","occurrence of BCoV infection","frequency of BCoV infection","specific BCoV amplicon","day-old calves","asymptomatic calves","beef herds","South American cattle herds","enteric infections of Brazilian cattle herds","Brazilian states","stool samples","SN-PCR amplicons","PCR assay","clinical signs of diarrhoea","main causes of neonatal calf diarrhoea","restriction fragment length polymorphism","RFLP","analysis","importance","association","specificity","study","days-old","geographical regions","findings","animals","total","Bovine coronavirus","results","diagnostic assays","center-west","faecal specimens"],"language":"en"},

Meeting the demand for pork has forced the revolution of swine production from traditional husbandry practices that involved a few pigs or small herds to intensive concentration of swine raised in multisite production systems. This dramatic change has made the production of pork very efficient, but it has also changed the ecology of many swine diseases, may encourage the emergence of new diseases, and amplifies the economic impact of swine diseases. Sustained treatment of diseases in livestock production is not feasible making prevention of disease a priority. Prevention of livestock diseases involves eliminating exposure to pathogens and anti-viral strategies to prevent or reduce clinical disease. For some swine diseases, efficacious vaccines can be made, however, for other diseases the host/pathogen relationship is more complex and efficacious vaccines are not available. Given the increasing demand for pork, the development of new approaches to improve swine anti-viral immunity is critical. Rate-limiting steps to improving vaccines are understanding how the pathogen interacts with the host\u0027s immune system, any immunopathology resulting from such interactions and how the host\u0027s immune system resolves the infection. Solving this puzzle will require sustained research and may require new technologies to battle contemporary diseases now wreaking havoc in swine production systems around the world. This Special Issue will focus on current swine viral diseases that are the most challenging to the global production of pork with contributions focusing on anti-viral immunity.","publish_time":"2019-09-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lager, Kelly M.; Buckley, Alexandra C.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/156938683b15aebd7ee7f83d0629344ef9dc47f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6776623.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611874/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.02258","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["current swine viral diseases","swine production systems","revolution of swine production","contemporary diseases","economic impact of swine diseases","Prevention of livestock diseases","emergence of new diseases","swine anti-viral immunity","livestock production","global production of pork","Sustained treatment of diseases","intensive concentration of swine","multisite production systems","anti-viral strategies","efficacious vaccines","new technologies","host\u0027s immune system","development of new approaches","pathogen relationship","feasible making prevention of disease","sustained research","clinical disease","increasing demand","pigs","exposure","traditional husbandry practices","pathogens","contributions","small herds","havoc","priority","immunopathology","interactions","Special Issue","infection","world","dramatic change","puzzle","steps","number","meat","ecology"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we carried out detailed phylogenetic analysis and sequence comparisons based on 74 complete nucleotide sequences of the IBV S1 gene, including strain I0636/16 and 73 representative sequences from each genotype and lineage. The results showed that strain I0636/16 represented a novel genotype, designated as lineage 1 within genotype VII (GVII-1). Further comparative genomic analysis revealed at least two recombination sites that replaced the spike gene in a lineage 18 within genotype I (GI-18)-like virus with an as-yet-unidentified sequence, likely derived from another IBV strain, resulting a novel serotype with a lower affinity to the respiratory tract in chickens. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first evidence for recombination leading to replacement of the complete spike gene and the emergence of a novel genotype/serotype with a lower affinity to the respiratory tract in chickens comparing to one of its parental virus ck/CH/LGX/111119. These results emphasize the importance of limiting exposure to novel IBVs that may serve as a source of genetic material for emerging viruses, as well as the importance of IBV surveillance in chicken flocks.","publish_time":"2019-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Tianxin; Xu, Liwen; Ren, Mengting; Shen, Jie; Han, Zongxi; Sun, Junfeng; Zhao, Yan; Liu, Shengwang","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/72d032a52bbe9a9028275d30caebd3f9ad62548d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117389.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113518312094; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113518312094; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.01.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827386/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","VII"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel genotype","novel serotype","IBV strain","novel IBVs","lineage","IBV S1 gene","strain I0636","emergence of novel infectious bronchitis virus","complete spike gene","importance of IBV surveillance","lower affinity","recombination sites","respiratory tract","chickens","results","complete nucleotide sequences","parental virus ck","Abstract Recombination events","sequence comparisons","representative sequences","unidentified sequence","detailed phylogenetic analysis","comparative genomic analysis","replacement","emerging viruses","source of genetic material","LGX","chicken flocks","genotypes","exposure","evidence","knowledge","study","GVII","best"],"language":"en"},

Classes of signals have been identified that direct a fraction of elongating ribosomes to shift reading frame by one base in the 5\u2032 (\u22121) or 3\u2032 (\u002B1) direction. This is called programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF). Although mechanisms of PRF differ, a common feature is induction of ribosome pausing, which alters kinetic partitioning rates between in-frame and out-of-frame codons at specific \u201Cslippery\u201D sequences. Many viruses use PRF to ensure synthesis of the correct ratios of virus-encoded proteins required for proper viral particle assembly and maturation, thus identifying PRF as an attractive target for antiviral therapeutics. In contrast, recent studies indicate that PRF signals may primarily function as mRNA destabilizing elements in cellular mRNAs. These studies suggest that PRF may be used to fine-tune gene expression through mRNA decay pathways. The possible regulation of PRF by non-coding RNAs is also discussed.","publish_time":"2012-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dinman, Jonathan D.","journal":"Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: RNA","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7bfeecd3323b17d62c43a3aa713a2849d6c67e64.json; document_parses/pdf_json/75f738d7c0c45a44ac72d7cee16b2f5f1c1afd0a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3419312.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3419312?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22715123/; https://doi.org/10.1002/wrna.1126","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRF signals","mechanisms of PRF","possible regulation of PRF","frame codons","translational reading frame","Classes of signals","cis-acting signals","cellular mRNAs","higher order information content","fine tune gene expression","recent studies","primary genetic information","mRNA destabilizing elements","mRNA decay pathways","fraction of elongating ribosomes","encoded proteins","proper viral particle assembly","polypeptides","function","correct ratios of virus","synthesis","maturation","non-coding RNAs","common feature","induction of ribosome","attractive target","kinetic partitioning rates","antiviral therapeutics","sequences","programmed ribosomal frameshifting","contrast","viruses","base","direction"],"language":"en"},

During infection animals experience a characteristic transient leucopenia and the number of cells per volume of blood changes over time; so quantitation of viral load by reference to a cellular housekeeping gene is not ideal as this may hide significant animal to animal variation. Therefore, to facilitate comparison of different samples, an external RNA reference was used for normalisation whereby each sample was spiked with the RNA virus, Canine Enteric Coronavirus (CECov), prior to RNA extraction, for comparative purposes. Real-time RT-PCR was carried out with two primer sets designed to amplify either a 156bp region of the BVDV 5\u2032-UTR or a 280bp region of the CECov nucleocapsid protein gene. Linearity and efficiency of the assay was established and the method assessed using samples from BVDV-challenged calves. Viral RNA was quantified on days 6 and 14 post-challenge by real-time RT-PCR. Infectious virus isolation by traditional cell culture was negative after day 7. This study demonstrates encouraging results for rapid, sensitive and reliable detection of acute BVDV infection and provides an alternative real-time RT-PCR method for use on whole blood samples or samples where suitable housekeeping genes are not available.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Young, N.

Enrichment blood culture/PCR using Bartonella alpha Proteobacteria growth medium (BAPGM) confirmed initial infection with the same Bartonella henselae genotype in all three cases. With the exception of anemia and neutropenia, complete blood counts, serum biochemical profiles and urinalysis results were within reference intervals. Also, tests for feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, Toxoplasma gondii and feline coronavirus antibodies were negative. Serial daily temperature monitoring in one case confirmed a cyclic, relapsing febrile temperature pattern during 1 month, with resolution during and after treatment with azithromycin. Bartonella henselae Western immunoblot (WB) results did not consistently correlate with BAPGM enrichment blood culture/PCR results or B henselae indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) titers, and WB titration results were not informative for establishing antibiotic treatment failure. During the respective follow-up periods, no illnesses or additional febrile episodes were reported, despite repeat documentation of B henselae bacteremia in two cats available for follow-up (one with the same genotype and the other with a different B henselae genotype); one cat was, unfortunately, killed by dogs before follow-up testing. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: We conclude that microbiological diagnosis and treatment of B henselae infection in cats can be challenging, that antibody titration results and resolution of clinical abnormalities may not correlate with a therapeutic cure, and that fever and potentially neutropenia should be differential diagnostic considerations for young cats with suspected bartonellosis.","publish_time":"2015-09-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Breitschwerdt, Edward B; Broadhurst, Jack J; Cherry, Natalie A","journal":"JFMS Open Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/366d302151fd854813f4519551c7d8c5381c4fd7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5362002.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28491382/; https://doi.org/10.1177/2055116915600454","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs4MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Bartonella alpha Proteobacteria","WB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Bartonella henselae genotype","treatment of B henselae infection","different B henselae genotype","PCR results","Bartonella henselae Western","urinalysis results","antibody titration results","WB titration results","documentation of B henselae bacteremia","B henselae indirect fluorescent antibody","young cats","cats available","BAPGM enrichment blood culture","feline immunodeficiency virus","feline leukemia virus","neutropenia","febrile temperature pattern","follow-up testing","complete blood counts","feline coronavirus antibodies","additional febrile episodes","respective follow-up periods","antibiotic treatment failure","adopted feral flea-infested cats","initial infection","Bartonella alpha Proteobacteria growth medium","different time points","CASE SERIES SUMMARY","resolution of clinical abnormalities","Serial daily temperature monitoring","Toxoplasma gondii","IFA","serum biochemical profiles","titers","differential diagnostic considerations","months","illnesses","microbiological diagnosis","suspected bartonellosis","fever","exception of anemia","household","tests","veterinary technician","NOVEL INFORMATION","reference intervals","cases","therapeutic cure","RELEVANCE","dogs","azithromycin"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to investigate if disinfection of calf pens with hydrated lime would reduce contamination of C. parvum oocysts and improve calf health in herds with C. parvum associated diarrhea problems. Four dairy herds with ongoing C. parvum associated calf diarrhea problems each participated in the study over six to seven months. During the study period, all pens/huts for young calves were cleaned according to the usual farm routine before a new calf entered. Hydrated lime was then used to disinfect half of the pens/huts. Diarrhea incidence was recorded by the farmers and by veterinarians, who clinically examined the calves every second month. In total, 402 calves participated in the study. The farmers detected diarrhea in 214 (53%) calves, with similar proportions in calves kept in lime disinfected and control pens. Age at diarrhea onset was significantly higher in lime disinfected pens than in control pens, 9.0 days and 7.6 days, respectively. There was no difference between the groups regarding duration or severity index recorded by the farmers. The body condition score in 6\u20138 week old calves was significantly higher in calves that had been kept in lime disinfected pens during their first weeks of life, indicating that calves in disinfected pens/huts were less affected by their infections. Faecal samples from 5 to 21 day old calves, were collected on four occasions at each farm (n = 95). Cryptosporidium positive samples were found at all samplings in all four herds. Cryptosporidium spp. was detected in 79 (83%) samples with no difference between lime disinfected and control pens. C. parvum was the dominant species. Two different C. parvum subtypes were found; IIaA16G1R1b in three herds and IIaA16G1R1b_variant in one herd. Only one subtype was found in each herd. Disinfection of calf pens with slaked lime delayed onset of diarrhea and improved the body condition in the calves, but did not affect diarrhea incidence or duration. Although lime disinfection alone will not be sufficient to control Cryptosporidium associated diarrhea in herds with extensive calf diarrhea problems, these results suggest that it can be a valuable complement to other measures.","publish_time":"2018-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bj\u00F6rkman, Camilla; von Br\u00F6mssen, Claudia; Troell, Karin; Svensson, Catarina","journal":"Veterinary Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/adc08c82dcc848eeb0edacfd01dcb4e34a833ba5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126765.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401718303716; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30503093/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2018.11.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401718303716","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs4MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lime disinfected pens","control pens","young calves","disinfection of calf pens","diarrhea onset","Diarrhea incidence","lime disinfection","Abstract Diarrhea","extensive calf diarrhea problems","hydrated lime","week old calves","day old calves","slaked lime delayed onset of diarrhea","Cryptosporidium parvum infection","calf health","new calf","parvum oocysts","parvum subtypes","huts","dairy herds","farmers","Cryptosporidium positive samples","study period","IIaA16G1R1b","duration","difference","Faecal samples","days","body condition score","usual farm routine","contamination of","weeks of life","groups","severity index","results","similar proportions","samplings","occasions","variant","Age","half","valuable complement","measures","infections","dominant species","veterinarians","aim","months","total"],"language":"en"},

Depending on the infrastructure, human resources and databases available in different countries, the appropriate option or combination of options can be determined by regulatory agencies and investigators.","publish_time":"2019-09-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kochhar, Sonali; Excler, Jean-Louis; Bok, Karin; Gurwith, Marc; McNeil, Michael M.; Seligman, Stephen J.; Khuri-Bulos, Najwa; Klug, Bettina; Laderoute, Marian; Robertson, James S.; Singh, Vidisha; Chen, Robert T.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7270ff5e268e22e5d15f9637967f9b006f54af7e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6535369.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X18312350; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X18312350; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30497831/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.08.085","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs4NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AEFI","Treescan"],"locations":["Ebola"],"keyphrases":["available options","considerations of pre-clinical","pre-specified AESI","clinical trials data","pre-specified adverse events of special","databases available","potential adverse events","combination of options","unknown clustering\u2019s of AEFI","optimal risk window","live recombinant vectored vaccines","length of time","prospective monitoring","regulatory agencies","time period","epidemiologic studies","validated large linked vaccine safety databases","development of novel vaccines","list of likely potential","case-control studies","Abstract Live viral vectors","current relevant regulatory guidelines","Rapid Cycle Analysis","different countries","serious infectious agents","heterologous antigens","biological plausibility","replication-competent","immunization","appropriate option","human resources","evidence","HIV","key challenge","practical feasibility","Ebola","Treescan","infrastructure","care","systematic literature search","target pathogen","registry","unsuspected outcomes","panel of experts","investigators"],"language":"en"},

We applied a \u201Cnext-generation\u201D parallel sequencing platform for viral detection in nasopharyngeal and fecal samples collected during seasonal influenza virus (Flu) infections and norovirus outbreaks from 2005 to 2007 in Osaka, Japan. Random RT-PCR was performed to amplify RNA extracted from 0.1\u20130.25 ml of nasopharyngeal aspirates (N = 3) and fecal specimens (N = 5), and more than 10 \u00B5g of cDNA was synthesized. Unbiased high-throughput sequencing of these 8 samples yielded 15,298\u201332,335 (average 24,738) reads in a single 7.5 h run. In nasopharyngeal samples, although whole genome analysis was not available because the majority (\u003E90%) of reads were host genome\u2013derived, 20\u2013460 Flu-reads were detected, which was sufficient for subtype identification. In fecal samples, bacteria and host cells were removed by centrifugation, resulting in gain of 484\u201315,260 reads of norovirus sequence (78\u201398% of the whole genome was covered), except for one specimen that was under-detectable by RT-PCR. These results suggest that our unbiased high-throughput sequencing approach is useful for directly detecting pathogenic viruses without advance genetic information. Although its cost and technological availability make it unlikely that this system will very soon be the diagnostic standard worldwide, this system could be useful for the earlier discovery of novel emerging viruses and bioterrorism, which are difficult to detect with conventional procedures.","publish_time":"2009-01-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nakamura, Shota; Yang, Cheng-Song; Sakon, Naomi; Ueda, Mayo; Tougan, Takahiro; Yamashita, Akifumi; Goto, Naohisa; Takahashi, Kazuo; Yasunaga, Teruo; Ikuta, Kazuyoshi; Mizutani, Tetsuya; Okamoto, Yoshiko; Tagami, Michihira; Morita, Ryoji; Maeda, Norihiro; Kawai, Jun; Hayashizaki, Yoshihide; Nagai, Yoshiyuki; Horii, Toshihiro; Iida, Tetsuya; Nakaya, Takaaki","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/672ae4f77f6a2cc3358bfe1e492c268e2dbe3d7a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2625441.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0004219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19156205/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs4NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["fecal samples","nasopharyngeal samples","Flu-reads","host genome","viral detection","unbiased high-throughput sequencing approach","fecal specimens","nasopharyngeal aspirates","genome analysis","parallel sequencing platform","Random RT-PCR","earlier discovery of novel emerging viruses","earlier detection of emerging infectious diseases","avian influenza viral pandemics","pathogenic viruses","host cells","norovirus outbreaks","norovirus sequence","seasonal influenza virus","renewed attention","new surveillance systems","infections","severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic","bioterrorism","advance genetic information","generation","bacteria","technological availability","cost","centrifugation","diagnostic standard","h run","subtype identification","Osaka","conventional procedures","majority","average","results","\u00B5g of cDNA","Japan","gain","RNA"],"language":"en"},

Thus, we analyzed the available data on time to negative MERS-CoV test in patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection and asymptomatic positive contacts. Methods Data from repeated laboratory testing of respiratory samples received at the Saudi Arabian virology reference laboratory in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from September 1, 2012 to September 31, 2013 were recorded. A real-time RT-PCR test for MERS-CoV was used. Data were analyzed by origin of sample, sample type, and MERS-CoV PCR test results. Results Twenty-six individuals (13 patients and 13 contacts) had repeated testing done until a negative test was obtained. Most samples from MERS-CoV cases were tracheal aspirate/sputum (p =0.0006) and most samples from contacts were nose and throat swabs (p =0.0002). Kaplan\u2013Meier curve analysis showed that contacts cleared the virus at a much earlier time than patients. On day 12, 30% of contacts and 76% of cases were still positive for MERS-CoV by PCR. Conclusions Contacts cleared MERS-CoV earlier than ill patients. This finding could be related to the types of sample as well as the types of patient studied. More ill patients with significant comorbidities shed the virus for a significantly longer time. The results of this study could have critical implications for infection control guidance and its application in healthcare facilities handling positive cases.","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Memish, Ziad A.; Assiri, Abdullah M.; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A.","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46067d716cff57e0f8cdfbb6015e3d2af2e9a105.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110713.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971214016440; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971214016440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25448335/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2014.10.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs4ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV test","MERS-CoV cases","MERS-CoV PCR test results","confirmed MERS-CoV infection","ill patients","long patients","Conclusions Contacts","asymptomatic positive contacts","positive cases","negative test","types of sample","earlier time","repeated laboratory testing of respiratory samples","real-time RT-PCR test","respiratory secretions","repeated testing","sample type","origin of sample","Methods Data","available data","longer time","types of patient","Saudi Arabian virology reference laboratory","infection control guidance","description of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","Jeddah","application","tracheal aspirate","critical implications","healthcare facilities","sputum","Meier curve analysis","study","significant comorbidities","throat swabs","Kaplan","individuals","Summary Background","finding","day"],"language":"en"},

In the resulting reports, one of several issues raised for future study was the potential for recombination of virus-vectored vaccines with wild type pathogenic virus strains. This paper presents an assessment of this issue formulated by the Brighton Collaboration. To provide an appropriate context for understanding the potential for recombination of virus-vectored vaccines, we review briefly the current status of virus vectored vaccines, mechanisms of recombination between viruses, experience with recombination involving live attenuated vaccines in the field, and concerns raised previously in the literature regarding recombination of virus-vectored vaccines with wild type virus strains. We then present a discussion of the major variables that could influence recombination between a virus-vectored vaccine and circulating wild type virus and the consequences of such recombination, including intrinsic recombination properties of the parent virus used as a vector; sequence relatedness of vector and wild virus; virus host range, pathogenesis and transmission; replication competency of vector in target host; mechanism of vector attenuation; additional factors potentially affecting virulence; and circulation of multiple recombinant vectors in the same target population. Finally, we present some guiding principles for vector design and testing intended to anticipate and mitigate the potential for and consequences of recombination of virus-vectored vaccines with wild type pathogenic virus strains.","publish_time":"2016-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Condit, Richard C.; Williamson, Anna-Lise; Sheets, Rebecca; Seligman, Stephen J.; Monath, Thomas P.; Excler, Jean-Louis; Gurwith, Marc; Bok, Karin; Robertson, James S.; Kim, Denny; Hendry, Michael; Singh, Vidisha; Mac, Lisa M.; Chen, Robert T.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/872c5e6e8028d2477552d7970c45124d5a4b2ab8.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d14d3af5767b34cf3c202149c52feb8568e02fc3.json; document_parses/pdf_json/07270df0848b50751a878475a863cd66b25907f1.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2f2339c3dc2dea779f9459f4ef758ed9c42be553.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5204448.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5204448?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X16302250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27346303/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X16302250; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.04.060","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recombination of virus","wild virus","virus-vectored vaccines","parent virus","wild type virus strains","live virus vectors","current status of virus vectored vaccines","virus host range","wild type pathogenic virus strains","consequences of recombination","mechanisms of recombination","intrinsic recombination properties","live attenuated vaccines","quality aspects of vaccines","vector design","potential","mechanism of vector attenuation","replication competency of vector","sequence relatedness of vector","target host","target population","circulation of multiple recombinant vectors","informal consultations","characterization","transmission","pathogenesis","experience","virulence","viruses","additional factors","World Health Organization","issues","guiding principles","testing","field","future study","literature","concerns","major variables","appropriate context","paper","assessment","Brighton Collaboration","resulting reports","discussion"],"language":"en"},

To our knowledge, no one has looked specifically at the impact of COVID-19 on students with disabilities/health concerns. In this paper, we present data from a survey of 147 students with and without disabilities collected in late March to early April of 2020 to assess the impact of COVID-19 on these students\u0027 education and mental health. Our findings show that students with disabilities/health concerns were more concerned about classes going online than their peers without disabilities. In addition, students with disabilities/health concerns also reported that they have experienced more COVID-19 related adversities compared to their peers without disabilities/health concerns.

This control is induced by the aggregation of individuals\u0027 decisions to limit their social interactions: when the epidemic is ongoing, an individual can diminish his/her contact rate in order to avoid getting infected, but this effort comes at a social cost. If each individual lowers his/her contact rate, the epidemic vanishes faster, but the effort cost may be high. A Mean Field Nash equilibrium at the population level is formed, resulting in a lower effective transmission rate of the virus. We prove theoretically that equilibrium exists and compute it numerically. However, this equilibrium selects a sub-optimal solution in comparison to the societal optimum (a centralized decision respected fully by all individuals), meaning that the cost of anarchy is strictly positive. We provide numerical examples and a sensitivity analysis, as well as an extension to a SEIR compartmental model to account for the relatively long latent phase of the COVID-19 disease. In all the scenarii considered, the divergence between the individual and societal strategies happens both before the peak of the epidemic, due to individuals\u0027 fears, and after, when a significant propagation is still underway.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Elie, Romuald; Hubert, Emma; Turinici, Gabriel","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/469aace9e8053cbefb9d8eb2469f3e772583783f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08221v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsxMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Mean Field Nash","SEIR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epidemic","contact rate","social cost","effort cost","COVID","cost of anarchy","control","SEIR compartmental model","societal optimum","societal strategies","standard SIR compartmental model","Mean Field Nash equilibrium","lower effective transmission rate","social interactions","individuals\u0027 fears","aggregation of individuals\u0027 decisions","pandemic","comparison","sub-optimal solution","population level","centralized decision","virus","extension","divergence","sensitivity analysis","numerical examples","order","peak","latent phase","significant propagation","disease","scenarii"],"language":"en"},

Hence, we deduce that several testing protocols for the recognition are not fair and that the neural networks are learning patterns in the dataset that are not correlated to the presence of COVID-19. Finally, we show that creating a fair testing protocol is a challenging task, and we provide a method to measure how fair a specific testing protocol is.

The model considers different levels of COVID-19 transmission during travel, daily arrival rate and total migrant workers.

It is observed that reduced daily arrival rate of migrant workers can help Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to lower the rise in confirmed and active cases. By the end of May, 2020, the daily arrival rate of migrant workers will have similar effect on Rajasthan. For the daily arrival rate of migrant workers considered, Madhya Pradesh may experience higher rise in confirmed and active cases.

We extend the SIR epidemiological model to include endogenous meeting rates. Individuals benefit from economic activity, but higher activity also leads to more interactions with potentially infected individuals. The main focus is a theoretical analysis of the contagion dynamics with a population of optimizing agents reacting myopically to the current disease prevalence. In the leading case, the infection prevalence is single-peaked. We obtain a simple condition for when several types of public-health interventions or changes in disease prevalence will paradoxically increase infection rates due to risk compensation. This condition implies that behavioral responses are most likely to undermine public-health interventions near the peak of severe diseases. We also derive an explicit formula for the behavior of a heterogeneous population. A key difference from the homogeneous case is that high-risk individuals may choose to temporarily stop all activity when they are likely to encounter infected low-risk individuals.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dasaratha, Krishna","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ace08ec825f8a96d7e2245993c28105fcea1fc9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14533v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsxODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection prevalence","current disease prevalence","infected individuals","contagious disease","high-risk individuals","infected low-risk individuals","public-health interventions","infection rates","higher activity","economic activity","types of public","homogeneous case","leading case","risk compensation","heterogeneous population","simple condition","endogenous meeting rates","theoretical analysis","changes","SIR epidemiological model","contagion dynamics","peak of severe diseases","agents","people","interactions","behavioral responses","main focus","key difference","spread","explicit formula","epidemics","COVID"],"language":"en"},

However, current art-making robots are typically either contingent, controlled as a tool by a human artist, or creative, programmed to paint independently, possibly because some complex and idiosyncratic concepts related to art, such as emotion and creativity, are not yet well understood. For example, the role of personalized taste in forming beauty evaluations has been studied in empirical aesthetics, but how to generate art that appears to an individual to express certain emotions such as happiness or sadness is less clear. In the current article, a collaborative prototyping/Wizard of Oz approach was used to explore generic robot art-making strategies and personalization of art via an open-ended emotion profile intended to identify tricky concepts. As a result of conducting an exploratory user study, participants indicated some preference for a robot art-making strategy involving\u0022visual metaphors\u0022to balance exogenous and endogenous components, and personalized representational sketches were reported to convey emotion more clearly than generic sketches. The article closes by discussing personalized abstract art as well as suggestions for richer art-making strategies and user models. Thus, the main conceptual advance of the current work lies in suggesting how an interactive robot can visually express emotions through personalized art; the general aim is that this could help to inform next steps in this promising area and facilitate technological acceptance of robots in everyday human environments.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cooney, Martin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e4d83a6db2c8758e34e6904ad1d32ce16459405.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05084v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsyMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["personalized art","art therapy","personalization of art","richer art","personalized abstract art","generic robot art","current article","personalized representational sketches","role of personalized taste","strategies","human therapists","interactive robot","human artist","express emotions","current work","assistive robots","generic sketches","technological acceptance of robots","everyday human environments","open-ended emotion profile","certain emotions","user models","tricky concepts","idiosyncratic concepts","exploratory user study","suggestions","endogenous components","beauty evaluations","collaborative prototyping","approach","participants","people\u0027s well-being","contexts","preference","promising area","happiness","sadness","Wizard","visual metaphors","main conceptual advance","way","strategy","general aim","result","empirical aesthetics","example","tool","paintings","individual","steps","creativity"],"language":"en"},

Recent work on the spread of interacting contagions on networks has highlighted that these interacting contagions can have counter-intuitive interplay with network structure. Here we generalize one of these frameworks to tackle three important features of the spread of awareness and disease: one, we model the dynamics on highly clustered, cliquish, networks to mimic the role of workplaces and households; two, the awareness contagion affects the spread of the biological contagion by reducing its transmission rate where an aware or vaccinated individual is less likely to be infected; and three, the biological contagion also affects the spread of the awareness contagion but by increasing its transmission rate where an infected individual is more receptive and more likely to share information related to the disease. Under these conditions, we find that increasing network clustering, which is known to hinder disease spread, can actually allow them to sustain larger epidemics of the disease in models with awareness. This counter-intuitive result goes against the conventional wisdom suggesting that random networks are justifiable as they provide worst-case scenario forecasts. To further investigate this result, we provide a closed-form criterion based on a two-step branching process (i.e., the numbers of expected tertiary infections) to identify different regions in parameter space where the net effect of clustering and co-infection varies. Altogether, our results highlight once again the need to go beyond random networks in disease modeling and illustrate the type of analysis that is possible even in complex models of interacting contagions.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"H\u0027ebert-Dufresne, Laurent; Mistry, Dina; Althouse, Benjamin M.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b770c8fea8d8b72322f113033ddc4a69721423f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10604v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsyMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease spread","spread of awareness","awareness contagion","spread of interacting contagions","biological contagion","spread of related information","random networks","disease modeling","complex models of interacting contagions","transmission rate","infected individual","counter-intuitive result","increasing network clustering","counter-intuitive interplay","rich history of models","vaccinated individual","network structure","net effect of clustering","influenza vaccination campaign","different regions","interaction","parameter space","conventional wisdom","numbers of expected tertiary infections","co-infection","type of analysis","households","important features","role of workplaces","closed-form criterion","worst-case scenario forecasts","Recent work","two-step","process","need","larger epidemics","dynamics","frameworks","conditions","results"],"language":"en"},

We describe the present limitations and difficulties encountered in most of the open-data resources. To facilitate the access to the main open-data portals and resources, we identify the most relevant institutions, at a world scale, providing Covid-19 information and/or auxiliary variables (demographics, mobility, etc.). We also describe several open resources to access Covid-19 data-sets at a country-wide level (i.e. China, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, U.S., etc.).

This approach is limited by the shortage of radiology experts who can provide a timely interpretation of these images. Motivated by this challenge, our paper proposes a novel learning architecture, called Detail-Oriented Capsule Networks (DECAPS), for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 from Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Our network combines the strength of Capsule Networks with several architecture improvements meant to boost classification accuracies. First, DECAPS uses an Inverted Dynamic Routing mechanism which increases model stability by preventing the passage of information from non-descriptive regions. Second, DECAPS employs a Peekaboo training procedure which uses a two-stage patch crop and drop strategy to encourage the network to generate activation maps for every target concept. The network then uses the activation maps to focus on regions of interest and combines both coarse and fine-grained representations of the data. Finally, we use a data augmentation method based on conditional generative adversarial networks to deal with the issue of data scarcity. Our model achieves 84.3% precision, 91.5% recall, and 96.1% area under the ROC curve, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. We compare the performance of the DECAPS model with three experienced, well-trained thoracic radiologists and show that the architecture significantly outperforms them. While further studies on larger datasets are required to confirm this finding, our results imply that architectures like DECAPS can be used to assist radiologists in the CT scan mediated diagnosis of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mobiny, Aryan; Cicalese, Pietro Antonio; Zare, Samira; Yuan, Pengyu; Abavisani, Mohammadsajad; Wu, Carol C.; Ahuja, Jitesh; Groot, Patricia M. de; Nguyen, Hien Van","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7fff71ea425413f203662c57d4f8c878813e3db0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07407v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsyNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Inverted Dynamic Routing","CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["architecture improvements","data augmentation method","model stability","Oriented Capsule Networks","strength of Capsule Networks","automatic diagnosis of COVID","activation maps","CT scan mediated diagnosis of COVID","novel learning architecture","issue of data scarcity","alternative method","conditional generative adversarial networks","Radiographic images","well-trained thoracic radiologists","non-descriptive regions","rapid screening","passage of information","monitoring of Coronavirus Disease","Inverted Dynamic Routing mechanism","Computed Tomography","ROC curve","strategy","paper","timely interpretation","shortage of radiology experts","stage patch crop","finding","area","state-of-the-art methods","scans","fine-grained representations","classification accuracies","target concept","larger datasets","Peekaboo training procedure","results","architectures","studies","recall","challenge","precision","approach","performance","patients"],"language":"en"},

A common question is if and when a country or region will reach herd immunity $h$. The classical herd immunity level $h_C$ is defined as $h_C=1-1/R_0$, where $R_0$ is the basic reproduction number, for covid-19 estimated to lie somewhere in the range 2.2-3.5 depending on country and region. It is shown here that the disease-induced herd immunity level $h_D$, after an outbreak has taken place in a country/region with a set of preventive measures put in place, is actually substantially smaller than $h_C$. As an illustration we show that if $R_0=2.5$ in an age-structured community with mixing rates fitted to social activity studies, and also categorizing individuals into three categories: low active, average active and high active, and where preventive measures affect all mixing rates proportionally, then the disease-induced herd immunity level is $h_D=43\\%$ rather than $h_C=1-1/2.5=60\\%$. Consequently, a lower fraction infected is required for herd immunity to appear. The underlying reason is that when immunity is induced by disease spreading, the proportion infected in groups with high contact rates is greater than that in groups with low contact rates. Consequently, disease-induced immunity is stronger than when immunity is uniformly distributed in the community as in the classical herd immunity level.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Britton, Tom; Ball, Frank; Trapman, Pieter","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d60e4ae975693d78c802b5ef65d87982f7db2032.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03085v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsyNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease-induced immunity","disease-induced herd immunity level","classical herd immunity level","mixing rates","country","region","high contact rates","low contact rates","set of preventive measures","groups","various levels of preventive measures","place","ongoing covid","age-structured community","lower fraction infected","pandemic","individuals","social activity studies","categories","proportion","basic reproduction number","outbreak","underlying reason","common question","countries","illustration","range"],"language":"en"},

Thus, every individual, every human, and every inhabitant of the world is the key player -- very different to many past crises\u0027. And since the individual is involved -- all individuals -- his/her (a) health and (b) privacy shall be considered in a very carefully crafted balance, not overruling one aspect with another one or even prioritizing certain aspects. Privacy remains the key. Thus, the solution of the current pandemic\u0027s data collection can be based on a fully privacy-preserving application, which can be used by individuals on their mobile devices, such as smartphones, while maintaining at the same time their privacy. Additionally, respective data collected in such a fully distributed setting does help to confine the pandemic and can be achieved in a democratic and very open, but still and especially privacy-protecting world. Therefore, the WeTrace approach and application as described in this paper utilizes the Bluetooth Low Energy (BTE) communication channel, many modern mobile devices offer, where asymmetric cryptography is being applied to allows for the decyphering of a message for that destination it had been intended for. Since literally every other potential participant only listens to random data, even a brute force attack will not succeed.

Public health interventions such as vaccination programs typically focus on individual viral species. However, observational data suggest that the spread of one species may impact the dynamics of another. This finding would have important implications for the predicted impact of seasonal vaccines but currently lacks statistical support. The aim of this paper is to develop a statistical framework to identify non-independent viral dynamics. As Bayesian multivariate disease mapping models naturally encompass a between-disease covariance matrix, we extended this framework to model multivariate time series data accounting for within- and between-year dependencies. By inferring non-zero off-diagonal entries of the between-disease covariance matrix, we present a novel technique that successfully identifies significant viral interactions. We illustrate this framework using incidence data from five co-circulating respiratory viruses (adenovirus [AdV], coronavirus [Cov], human metapneumovirus [MPV], influenza B virus [IBV] and respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]) detected by routine diagnostics at the West of Scotland Specialist Virology Center (WoSSVC) between 2005 and 2013.

Current COVID-19 time series for many countries are short: pre- and post-lockdown series are shorter still. Accurate estimation of potentially interesting cycles within such series seems beyond reach. We solve the problem of obtaining accurate estimates from short time series by using recent Bayesian spectral fusion methods. Here we show that transformed new daily COVID-19 cases for many countries generally contain three cycles operating at wavelengths of around 2.7, 4.1 and 6.7 days (weekly). We show that the shorter cycles are suppressed after lockdown. The pre- and post lockdown differences suggest that the weekly effect is at least partly due to non-epidemic factors, whereas the two shorter cycles seem intrinsic to the epidemic. Unconstrained, new cases grow exponentially, but the internal cyclic structure causes periodic falls in cases. This suggests that lockdown success might only be indicated by four or more daily falls in cases. Spectral learning for epidemic time series contributes to the understanding of the epidemic process, helping evaluate interventions and assists with forecasting. Spectral fusion is a general technique that is able to fuse spectra recorded at different sampling rates, which can be applied to a wide range of time series from many disciplines.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nason, Guy P.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/872ebba306ba6886cf0d25fa8071af9a0934b7a4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07696v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsyOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epidemic time series","short time series","post-lockdown series","shorter cycles","oscillatory time series behaviours","wide range of time series","interesting cycles","new cases","Spectral analysis","accurate estimation","Spectral learning","epidemic process","lockdown success","accurate estimates","countries","post lockdown differences","non-epidemic factors","daily falls","new daily COVID","recent Bayesian spectral fusion methods","periodic falls","Current COVID","weekly effect","internal cyclic structure","understanding","general technique","reasonable numbers of observations","different sampling rates","interventions","problem","disciplines","days","wavelengths","reach","forecasting"],"language":"en"},

In the past decade, network medicine had developed a framework consisting of a series of quantitative approaches and predictive tools to study host-pathogen interactions, unveil the molecular mechanisms of the infection, identify comorbidities as well as rapidly detect drug repurpusing candidates. Here, we adapt the network-based toolset to COVID-19, recovering the primary pulmonary manifestations of the virus in the lung as well as observed comorbidities associated with cardiovascular diseases. We predict that the virus can manifest itself in other tissues, such as the reproductive system, and brain regions, moreover we predict neurological comorbidities. We build on these findings to deploy three network-based drug repurposing strategies, relying on network proximity, diffusion, and AI-based metrics, allowing to rank all approved drugs based on their likely efficacy for COVID-19 patients, aggregate all predictions, and, thereby to arrive at 81 promising repurposing candidates. We validate the accuracy of our predictions using drugs currently in clinical trials, and an expression-based validation of selected candidates suggests that these drugs, with known toxicities and side effects, could be moved to clinical trials rapidly.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gysi, Deisy Morselli; Valle, \u0027Italo Do; Zitnik, Marinka; Ameli, Asher; Gan, Xiao; Varol, Onur; Sanchez, Helia; Baron, Rebecca Marlene; Ghiassian, Dina; Loscalzo, Joseph; Barab\u0027asi, Albert-L\u0027aszl\u0027o","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71ac7b4b5b88ea681eb11c925dcd02591b66fce2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07229v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["network-based toolset","network-based drug repurposing strategies","drug repurpusing candidates","COVID","network proximity","network medicine","expression-based validation of selected candidates","AI-based metrics","promising repurposing candidates","approved drugs","observed comorbidities","neurological comorbidities","clinical trials","virus","predictions","rapid identification of drug","predictive tools","host-pathogen interactions","series of quantitative approaches","likely efficacy","diffusion","brain regions","molecular mechanisms","reproductive system","framework","lung","patients","pandemic","primary pulmonary manifestations","tissues","effects","known toxicities","cardiovascular diseases","infection","past decade","accuracy","findings"],"language":"en"},

In the WD-NS reverse evolution the primary star evolves and transfers mass to the secondary star, forms a PN, and leaves a WD remnant. If the mass transfer brings the secondary star to have a mass of\u003E8Mo before it develops a helium core, it explodes as a CCSN and leaves a NS remnant. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) we find that in the reverse evolution the time period from the formation of the PN by the primary star to the explosion of the secondary star is longer than a million years. By that time the PN has long dispersed into the interstellar medium. If we start with two stars that are too close in mass to each other, then the mass transfer takes place after the secondary star has developed a helium core and it ends forming a PN and a WD. The formation of a CCSN inside a PN (so called CCSNIP) requires the presence of a third star, either as a tertiary star in the system or as a nearby member in an open cluster. The third star should be less massive than the secondary star but by no more than few 0.01Mo. We estimate that the rate of CCSNIP is about 0.0001 times the rate of all CCSNe.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bear, Ealeal; Soker, Noam","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04437v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CCSN","PN","WD","Stellar Astrophysics"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["secondary star","primary star","PN","neutron star","tertiary star","mass transfer","WD-NS reverse evolution","transfers mass","helium core","WD remnant","NS remnant","explosion","formation","rate of CCSNIP","core collapse supernova","time period","Experiments","Stellar Astrophysics","nearby member","simulations of white dwarf","times","system","place","open cluster","Modules","MESA","planetary nebula","CCSNe","stars","presence","interstellar medium","years"],"language":"en"},

The IB virus primarily affects respiratory tract, but various strains differ in their tropism for other target organs such as kidney and alimentary tract. The objective of this study was to estimate the pathogenicity of Iranian IBV variant (IR-1), which is limited exclusively to Iran. Specific pathogen free chicks were inoculated intranasally. Sera, fecal swabs and different tissue samples were collected on different days post infection (DPI). Clinical signs, gross pathology and histological changes were recorded. The viral load was quantified in the RNA extractions from different tissue samples using real-time PCR. Anti-IBV antibodies were detected in serum samples. The IgG antibody were found on 21 and 28 DPI. Severe histological lesions were observed in the trachea and lung while the lesions in kidney were appeared to be milder. Viral RNA was detected in all tested tissues from 1 DPI to the last day of the experiment. The highest viral load was measured in the trachea and feces on 1(st) and 5(th) DPI, respectively. It can be concluded the IR-1 had broad tropism for respiratory tract, digestive system, and renal tissue, reflecting its epitheliotropic nature, but it caused the most severe lesions in the respiratory tract.

It concludes that although there is the basis of an accountability framework for the right to health in China, the effective operation of accountability mechanisms is hindered by longstanding cultural and political barriers.","publish_time":"2017-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qiu, Shengnan; Macnaughton, Gillian","journal":"Health Hum Rights","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c2d4efc02a8e37fb93eafe7ddb9eff42e0c600b2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5473057.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5473057/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs1MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["accountability framework","related accountability mechanisms","range of health","effective operation of accountability mechanisms","social accountability arrangements","Article","Western concept of accountability","formal mechanisms","cultural framework","political barriers","Cultural Rights","current Chinese institutional mechanisms","China\u2019s existing political","International Covenant","use","duty-bearers","domestic level","appropriate measures","important component","overview","protection","potential","obligations","basis"],"language":"en"},

The complete sequence of ORF1b (6873 nucleotides) was determined. Like the coronaviruses, BEV was shown to express its ORF1b by ribosomal frameshifting during translation of the genomic RNA. The predicted tertiary RNA structure (a pseudoknot) in the toro- and coronaviral frameshift-directing region is similar. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of the predicted BEV ORF1b translation product revealed homology with the ORF1b product of coronaviruses. Four conserved domains were identified: the putative polymerase domain, an area containing conserved cysteine and histidine residues, a putative helicase motif, and a domain which seems to be unique for toro- and coronaviruses. The data on the 3\u0027 part of the polymerase gene of BEV supplement previously observed similarities between toro- and coronaviruses at the level of genome organization and expression.

Recently, the biochemistry and structure of these enzymes, from yeast and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, have been extensively studied. They were found to share a common active site, characterized by two conserved histidines, with the bacterial tRNA-ligating enzyme LigT and the vertebrate myelin-associated 2\u2032,3\u2032 phosphodiesterases. Using sensitive sequence profile analysis methods, we show that these enzymes define a large superfamily of predicted phosphoesterases with two conserved histidines (hence 2H phosphoesterase superfamily). We identify several new families of 2H phosphoesterases and present a complete evolutionary classification of this superfamily. We also carry out a structure\u2013 function analysis of these proteins and present evidence for diverse interactions for different families, within this superfamily, with RNA substrates and protein partners. In particular, we show that eukaryotes contain two ancient families of these proteins that might be involved in RNA processing, transcriptional co-activation and post-transcriptional gene silencing. Another eukaryotic family restricted to vertebrates and insects is combined with UBA and SH3 domains suggesting a role in signal transduction. We detect these phosphoesterase modules in polyproteins of certain retroviruses, rotaviruses and coronaviruses, where they could function in capping and processing of viral RNAs. Furthermore, we present evidence for multiple families of 2H phosphoesterases in bacteria, which might be involved in the processing of small molecules with the 2\u2032,3\u2032 cyclic phosphoester linkages. The evolutionary analysis suggests that the 2H domain emerged through a duplication of a simple structural unit containing a single catalytic histidine prior to the last common ancestor of all life forms. Initially, this domain appears to have been involved in RNA processing and it appears to have been recruited to perform various other functions in later stages of evolution.","publish_time":"2002-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mazumder, Raja; Iyer, Lakshminarayan M.; Vasudevan, Sona; Aravind, L.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC137960/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs1ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UBA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H phosphoesterases","RNA processing","H phosphoesterase superfamily","enzymes","H domain","different families","multiple families","present evidence","ancient families","new families","evolutionary analysis","function analysis","large superfamily of predicted phosphoesterases","conserved histidines","RNA substrates","eukaryotes","structure","processing of viral RNAs","processing of small molecules","Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases","common ancestor","phosphoesterase modules","sensitive sequence profile analysis methods","transcriptional co-activation","splicing of tRNA introns","complete evolutionary classification","common active site","cyclic phosphoester linkages","post-transcriptional gene silencing","bacterial tRNA-ligating enzyme LigT","single catalytic histidine","diverse interactions","simple structural unit","polyproteins of certain retroviruses","insects","role","SH3 domains","UBA","yeast","duplication","distinct steps","functions","vertebrates","rotaviruses","vertebrate myelin","later stages of evolution","signal transduction","protein partners","plant Arabidopsis thaliana","eukaryotic family","coronaviruses","life forms","capping","biochemistry"],"language":"en"},

The present study aimed to review published literature in this regard. METHODS: In this narrative review, were searched for all articles published in various databases including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Science Direct, and Web of Science using MeSH-compliant keywords including COVID-19, Pregnancy, Vertical transmission, Coronavirus 2019, SARS-CoV-2 and 2019-nCoV from December 2019 to March 18, 2020 and reviewed them. All type of articles published about COVID-19 and vertical transmission in pregnancy were included. RESULTS: A review of 13 final articles published in this area revealed that COVID-19 can cause fetal distress, miscarriage, respiratory distress and preterm delivery in pregnant women but does not infect newborns. There has been no report of vertical transmission in pregnancy, and it has been found that clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in pregnant women are not different from those of non-pregnant women. CONCLUSION: Overall, due to lack of appropriate data about the effect of COVID-19 on pregnancy, it is necessary to monitor suspected pregnant women before and after delivery. For confirmed cases both the mother and the newborn child should be followed up comprehensively.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Panahi, Latif; Amiri, Marzieh; Pouy, Somaye","journal":"Arch Acad Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0212e200dc708984bda32b474aa6a1437c6a3c3d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092922.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7092922/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs2MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Pregnancy","effect of COVID","suspected pregnant women","possibility of vertical transmission","non-pregnant women","report of vertical transmission","published literature","clinical symptoms of COVID","mother","final articles","type of articles","narrative review","respiratory distress","Web of Science","fetal distress","Science Direct","preterm delivery","new Coronavirus","various databases","various countries","Embase","Scopus","miscarriage","PubMed","concerns","MeSH-compliant keywords","outbreak","world","lack of appropriate data","SARS-CoV","China","present study","area","confirmed cases","newborn child","INTRODUCTION","fetus","METHODS","RESULTS","regard","newborns","nCoV","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

This has led us to adopt a systematic approach to handling this emergency, not only in managing inpatients, but also in researching the new disease. Our approach is mirrored in the guidelines attached to this article, originally intended for internal use only but potentially very useful to our colleagues, as they face the same exact problems. We have also started collecting data on our positive patients with the aim of understanding better the functioning of this disease and how best to manage it. If anyone is interested, we ask you to please get in touch with us, so we can coordinate our efforts.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alberici, Federico; Del Barba, Elisa; Manenti, Chiara; Econimo, Laura; Valerio, Francesca; Pola, Alessandra; Maffei, Camilla; Possenti, Stefano; Gaggia, Paola; Movilli, Ezio; Bove, Sergio; Malberti, Fabio; Farina, Marco; Bracchi, Martina; Costantino, Ester Maria; Bossini, Nicola; Gaggiotti, Mario; Scolari, Francesco","journal":"Giornale italiano di nefrologia : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di nefrologia","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32281754/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs2NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["positive patients","nephropathic patients","transplanted patients","hemodialysis","new disease","health emergency","systematic approach","Nephrology Unit","active cluster of infections","great deal of reshuffling","kidney transplant recipients","article","internal use","moment","cases","aim","Brescia","guidelines","functioning","midst","data","concerted effort","way","structure","exact problems","colleagues","inpatients","Bergamo","touch","efforts"],"language":"en"},

Since its emergence in Wuhan City, China, the virus has rapidly spread across the globe causing calamitous health, economic and societal consequences. It causes disproportionately severe disease in the elderly and those with co-morbidities, such as hypertension and diabetes. There is currently no proven treatment for COVID-19 and a safe and effective vaccine is at least a year away. The virus gains access to the respiratory epithelium through cell surface angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the virus is unlikely to mutate without loss of pathogenicity and thus represents an attractive target for antiviral treatment. Inhaled modified recombinant human ACE2, may bind SARS-CoV-2 and mitigate lung damage. This decoy strategy is unlikely to provoke an adverse immune response and may reduce morbidity and mortality in high-risk groups.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ameratunga, Rohan; Lehnert, Klaus; Leung, Euphemia; Comoletti, Davide; Snell, Russell; Woon, See-Tarn; Abbott, William; Mears, Emily; Steele, Richard; McKee, Jeff; Muscroft-Taylor, Andrew; Ameratunga, Shanthi; Medlicott, Natalie; Das, Shyamal; Rolleston, William; Qui\u00F1ones-Mateu, Miguel; Petousis-Harris, Helen; Jordan, Anthony","journal":"The New Zealand medical journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32438383/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs2NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan City","China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","virus gains access","COVID","antiviral treatment","severe disease","proven treatment","new zoonotic disease","Inhaled modified recombinant human ACE2","respiratory epithelium","morbidity","cell surface angiotensin","calamitous health","enzyme","RBD","adverse immune response","mortality","societal consequences","attractive target","Wuhan City","China","globe","co-morbidities","loss of pathogenicity","receptor binding domain","effective vaccine","hypertension","high-risk groups","emergence","decoy strategy","year","diabetes","lung damage"],"language":"en"},

A total of 180 patients receiving laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomly divided into sevoflurane \u002B high-dose remifentanil (SH) group, sevoflurane \u002B low-dose remifentanil (SL) group and propofol \u002B high-dose remifentanil group (PH) group (n=60). After intravenous administration of midazolam, SH and SL groups were induced with sevoflurane and remifentanil, and PH group was induced with propofol and remifentanil. During anesthesia maintenance, SH and SL groups were given 0.3 microg/kg/min and 0.1 microg/kg/min sevoflurane and remifentanil respectively, and PH group was given 0.3 microg/kg/min propofol and remifentanil. The three groups had significantly different awakening time, extubation time and total dose of remifentanil (P\u003C0.001).

According to the latest 2019-nCoV national management plan and the actual situation, the Working Group for the Prevention and Control of Neonatal 2019-nCoV Infection in the Perinatal Period of the Editorial Committee of Chinese Journal of Contemporary Pediatrics puts forward recommendations for the prevention and control of 2019-nCoV infection in neonates.","publish_time":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32051071/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs4MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["nCoV infection","nCoV national management plan","Control of Neonatal","Prevention","neonates","perinatal-neonatal departments","emergency plan","optimal management","neonatal intensive care unit","Perinatal Period","possibility of mother","actual situation","Editorial Committee of Chinese Journal of Contemporary Pediatrics","fetal vertical transmission","recommendations","Working Group","treatment of potential victims","integrated approaches","immaturity of immune function","novel coronavirus","China"],"language":"en"},

METHODS COVID-19 SEIR transmission dynamics model was established, which took transmission ability in latent period and tracking quarantine interventions into consideration. Based on the epidemic data of Hubei province from January 23, 2020 to February 24, 2020, the parameters of the newly established modified SEIR model were fitted. By using Euler integral algorithm to solve the modified SEIR dynamics model, the epidemic situation in Hubei province was analyzed, and the impact of prevention and control measures such as quarantine and centralized treatment on the epidemic development was discussed. RESULTS The theoretical estimation of the epidemic situation by the modified SEIR epidemic dynamics model is in good agreement with the actual situation in Hubei province. Theoretical analysis showed that prevention and control quarantine and medical follow-up quarantine played an important inhibitory effect on the outbreak of the epidemic.The centralized treatment played a key role in the rapid decline in the number of infected people. In addition, it is suggested that individuals should improve their prevention awareness and take strict self-protection measures to curb the increase in infected people. CONCLUSIONS The modified SEIR model is reliable in the evaluation of COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei province, which provides a theoretical reference for the decision-making of epidemic interventions.","publish_time":"2020-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cao, Shengli; Feng, Peihua; Shi, Pengpeng","journal":"Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

There is limited information on current practices in pediatric cardiac catheterization laboratories in the United States (US). OBJECTIVES To describe current practice patterns and make recommendations regarding potential resource allocation for congenital cardiac catheterization during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A web-based survey was distributed regarding case candidacy and catheterization laboratory preparedness. Centers were categorized based on the current degree of disease burden in that community (as of April 1, 2020). Data and consensus opinion were utilized to develop recommendations. RESULTS Respondents belonged to 56 unique US centers, with 27 (48.2%) located in counties with a high number of COVID-19 cases. All centers have canceled elective procedures. There was relative uniformity (\u003E88% agreement) among centers as to which procedures were considered elective. To date, only three centers have performed a catheterization on a confirmed COVID-19 positive patient. Centers located in areas with a higher number of COVID-9 cases have been more involved in a simulation of donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE) than low-prevalence centers (46.7% vs 10.3%, respectively; P\u003C.001). Currently, only a small fraction of operators has been reassigned to provide clinical services outside their scope of practice.

METHODS: The clinical data of 164 COVID-19 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms were extracted and analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: In total, 505 COVID-19 patients were divided into two groups: those with gastrointestinal symptoms (G group) and those without gastrointestinal symptoms (NG group). Common gastrointestinal symptoms included inappetence, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Significantly higher proportions of patients with fever, dizziness, myalgia, and fatigue were noted in group G than in group NG. Compared with patients without fever, there was a significant difference between G group and NG group in moderate fever or above, while there was no significant difference between the two groups in low fever. The laboratory results showed that patients in the G group had significantly higher C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and \u03B1-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase levels than those in the NG group. Moreover, the proportion of patients with severe pneumonia was significantly higher in the G group than in the NG group. CONCLUSION: In Wuhan, the proportion of COVID-19 patients who experience gastrointestinal symptoms is relatively high. Patients who experience gastrointestinal symptoms are more likely to suffer from severe pneumonia, which may help clinicians identify patients at high risk of COVID-19 and thus reduce the incidence of this condition.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Hu; Liao, Yu-Sheng; Gong, Jing; Liu, Jing; Xia, Xi; Zhang, Heng","journal":"Dig Liver Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e3fb47b53690d912c46406193452baa372e48d86.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7205655.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1590865820301894?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1590865820301894","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs5NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["group G","NG group","group NG","proportion of patients","Common gastrointestinal symptoms","higher proportions of patients","proportion of COVID","high risk of COVID","moderate fever","low fever","significant difference","severe pneumonia","groups","lactate dehydrogenase","higher C-reactive protein","clinical data","laboratory results","\u03B1-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase levels","clinical characteristics of Coronavirus Disease","diarrhoea","nausea","inappetence","dizziness","clinicians","abdominal pain","myalgia","fatigue","vomiting","Wuhan","total","CONCLUSION","METHODS","OBJECTIVE","incidence","condition"],"language":"en"},

ADP-ribosylation is a posttranslational modification catalyzed primarily by ARTD (aka PARP) enzymes in cells. ARTDs transfer either single or multiple ADP-ribose units to substrates, resulting in mono- or poly-ADP-ribosylation. TARG1/C6orf130 is a macrodomain protein that hydrolyzes mono-ADP-ribosylation and interacts with poly-ADP-ribose chains. Interactome analyses revealed that TARG1 binds strongly to ribosomes and proteins associated with rRNA processing and ribosomal assembly factors. TARG1 localized to transcriptionally active nucleoli, which occurred independently of ADP-ribose binding. TARG1 shuttled continuously between nucleoli and nucleoplasm. In response to DNA damage, which activates ARTD1/2 (PARP1/2) and promotes synthesis of poly-ADP-ribose chains, TARG1 re-localized to the nucleoplasm. This was dependent on the ability of TARG1 to bind to poly-ADP-ribose. These findings are consistent with the observed ability of TARG1 to competitively interact with RNA and PAR chains.

Objectives This study was designed to explore the genetic etiology of deafness in a large Chinese family with autosomal dominant, nonsyndromic, progressive sensorineural hearing loss (ADNSHL). Methods Whole exome sequencing and linkage analysis were performed to identify pathogenic mutation. Inner ear expression of Ifnlr1 was investigated by immunostaining in mice. ifnlr1 Morpholino knockdown Zebrafish were constructed to explore the deafness mechanism. Results We identified a cosegregating heterozygous missense mutation, c.296G\u003EA (p.Arg99His) in the gene encoding interferon lambda receptor 1 (IFNLR1) \u2013 a protein that functions in the Jak/ STAT pathway\u2013 are associated with ADNSHL. Morpholino knockdown of ifnlr1 leads to a significant decrease in hair cells and non-inflation of the swim bladder in late-stage zebrafish, which can be reversed by injection with normal Zebrafish ifnlr1 mRNA.

Understanding this relationship is also critical for identifying species that are more sensitive to warming climates. Here, we study North American plethodontid salamanders to investigate whether acclimation ability is associated with species\u2019 latitudinal extents and the thermal range of the environments they inhabit. We quantified variation in thermal physiology by measuring standard metabolic rate (SMR) at different test and acclimation temperatures for 16 species of salamanders with varying latitudinal extents. A phylogenetically\u2010controlled Markov chain Monte Carlo generalized linear mixed model (MCMCglmm) was then employed to determine whether there are differences in SMR between wide\u2010 and narrow\u2010ranging species at different acclimation temperatures. In addition, we tested for a relationship between the acclimation ability of species and the environmental temperature ranges they inhabit. Further, we investigated if there is a trade\u2010off between critical thermal maximum (CTMax) and thermal acclimation ability. MCMCglmm results show a significant difference in acclimation ability between wide and narrow\u2010ranging temperate salamanders. Salamanders with wide latitudinal distributions maintain or slightly increase SMR when subjected to higher test and acclimation temperatures, whereas several narrow\u2010ranging species show significant metabolic depression. We also found significant, positive relationships between acclimation ability and environmental thermal range, and between acclimation ability and CTMax. Wide\u2010ranging salamander species exhibit a greater capacity for thermal acclimation than narrow\u2010ranging species, suggesting that selection for acclimation ability may have been a key factor enabling geographic expansion into areas with greater thermal variability. Further, given that narrow\u2010ranging salamanders are found to have both poor acclimation ability and lower tolerance to warm temperatures, they are likely to be more susceptible to environmental warming associated with anthropogenic climate change.","publish_time":"2018-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Markle, Tricia M.; Kozak, Kenneth H.","journal":"Ecol Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b7428f7747f41809e8bc162af44d918351bd957.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5938462.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5938462/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzIy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SMR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["thermal acclimation ability","acclimation ability of species","poor acclimation ability","species of salamanders","different acclimation temperatures","environmental thermal range","related species","thermal physiology","greater thermal variability","critical thermal maximum","Wide\u2010ranging salamander species","SMR","temperate salamanders","warm temperatures","environmental warming","wide latitudinal distributions","geographic range size","environmental temperature","significant difference","different test","species\u2019 latitudinal extents","significant metabolic depression","varying latitudinal extents","CTMax","North American plethodontid salamanders","greater capacity","geographic expansion","higher test","MCMCglmm results","standard metabolic rate","linear mixed model","areas","controlled Markov chain Monte Carlo","lower tolerance","key factor","positive relationships","disparities","seasonal habitats","anthropogenic climate change","trade\u2010off","selective advantage","similar ecologies","variation","selection","differences","environments","climates","addition"],"language":"en"},

In particular, many of the RNA viruses, including among others the Dengue and Zika, are widespread pathogens of significant importance to human health. The ability to design and synthesize such viruses may contribute to exploring novel approaches for developing vaccines and virus based therapies. RESULTS: Here we develop a full multidisciplinary pipeline for generation and analysis of synthetic RNA viruses and specifically apply it to Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2). The major steps of the pipeline include comparative genomics of endogenous and synthetic viral strains. Specifically, we show that although the synthetic DENV-2 viruses were found to have lower nucleotide variability, their phenotype, as reflected in the study of the AG129 mouse model morbidity, RNA levels, and neutralization antibodies, is similar or even more pathogenic in comparison to the wildtype master strain. Additionally, the highly variable positions, identified in the analyzed DENV-2 population, were found to overlap with less conserved homologous positions in Zika virus and other Dengue serotypes. These results may suggest that synthetic DENV-2 could enhance virulence if the correct sequence is selected. CONCLUSIONS: The approach reported in this study can be used to generate and analyze synthetic RNA viruses both on genotypic and on phenotypic level. It could be applied for understanding the functionality and the fitness effects of any set of mutations in viral RNA and for editing RNA viruses for various target applications.

Mouse B-1a cells are a phenotypically and functionally unique sub-population of B cells, providing immediate protection against infection by releasing natural antibodies and immunomodulatory molecules. We hypothesize that B-1a cells ameliorate sepsis-induced ALI. METHODS: Sepsis was induced in C57BL/6 mice by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). PBS or B-1a cells were adoptively transferred into the septic mice intraperitoneally. After 20 h of CLP, lungs were harvested and assessed by PCR and ELISA for pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1\u03B2) and chemokine (MIP-2) expression, by histology for injury, by TUNEL and cleaved caspase-3 for apoptosis, and by myeloperoxidase (MPO) assay for neutrophil infiltration. RESULTS: We found that septic mice adoptively transferred with B-1a cells significantly decreased the mRNA and protein levels of IL-6, IL-1\u03B2 and MIP-2 in the lungs compared to PBS-treated mice. Mice treated with B-1a cells showed dramatic improvement in lung injury compared to PBS-treated mice after sepsis. We found apoptosis in the lungs was significantly inhibited in B-1a cell injected mice compared to PBS-treated mice after sepsis.

The protective outcomes of B-1a cells in ALI was further confirmed by using B-1a cell deficient CD19(\u2212/\u2212) mice, which showed significant increase in the lung injury scores following sepsis as compared to WT mice.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate possible associations between social support, number of comorbidities, and pain interference on HRQOL in ICU survivors. METHODS: ICU survivors responded to a survey 3 months (n = 118) and 1 year (n = 89) after ICU discharge. HRQOL was measured using the Short Form Health Survey-12 (v1), social support using the revised Social Provision Scale, pain interference using the Brief Pain Inventory\u2013Short Form, and comorbidities using the Self-Administered Comorbidity Questionnaire. RESULTS: Physical and mental HRQOL were reduced at both 3 months and 1 year in ICU survivors compared with the general population. This reduction was more pronounced at 3 months for physical HRQOL, while a small reduction in mental HRQOL was not clinically relevant. Social support was statistical significantly positively associated with mental HRQOL at 3 months, while number of comorbidities was statistical significantly associated with a reduction in physical HRQOL at 3 months and 1 year and mental HRQOL at 1 year. Lastly pain interference was significantly associated with a reduction in physical HRQOL at 3 months and 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: ICU survivors primarily report reduced physical HRQOL.

Clinicians are encouraged to avoid FO; however, strategies to avoid FO are not well-described in pediatrics. Our aim was to implement a bundle strategy to prevent FO in children with sepsis and pARDS and to compare the outcomes with a historical cohort. METHODS: A quality improvement initiative, known as preemptive fluid strategy (PFS) was implemented to prevent early FO, in a 12-bed general PICU. Infants on mechanical ventilation (MV) fulfilling pARDS and sepsis criteria were prospectively recruited. For comparison, data from a historical cohort from 2015, with the same inclusion and exclusion criteria, was retrospectively reviewed. The PFS bundle consisted of 1. maintenance of intravenous fluids (MIVF) at 50% of requirements; 2. drug volume reduction; 3. dynamic monitoring of preload markers to determine the need for fluid bolus administration; 4. early use of diuretics; and 5. early initiation of enteral feeds. The historical cohort treatment, the standard fluid strategy (SFS), were based on physician preferences. Peak fluid overload (PFO) was the primary outcome. PFO was defined as the highest FO during the first 72 h. FO was calculated as (cumulative fluid input \u2013 cumulative output)/kg*100. Fluid input/output were registered every 12 h for 72 h. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were included in the PFS group (54% male, 6 mo (IQR 2,11)) and 39 with SFS (64%male, 3 mo (IQR1,7)). PFO was lower in PFS (6.31% [IQR4.4\u201310]) compared to SFS (12% [IQR8.4\u201315.8]). FO was lower in PFS compared to CFS as early as 12 h after admission [2.4(1.4,3.7) v/s 4.3(1.5,5.5), p \u003C 0.01] and maintained during the study. These differences were due to less fluid input (MIVF and fluid boluses). There were no differences in the renal function test. PRBC requirements were lower during the first 24 h in the PFS (5%) compared to SFS (28%, p \u003C 0.05). MV duration was 81 h (58,98) in PFS and 118 h (85154) in SFS(p \u003C 0.05). PICU LOS in PFS was 5 (4, 7) and in SFS was 8 (6, 10) days. CONCLUSION: Implementation of a bundle to prevent FO in children on MV with pARDS and sepsis resulted in less PFO. We observed a decrease in MV duration and PICU LOS. Future studies are needed to address if PFS might have a positive impact on health outcomes.

Although TB pneumonia is one of the causes of disease and death among children worldwide, the literature on TB pneumonia-induced ARDS is limited. We report herein on the successful treatment of a two-year-old female child with TB pneumonia-induced severe ARDS complicated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). CASE PRESENTATION: A two-year-old Vietnamese female child with sustained fever and cough for 20 days was transferred to our hospital. She had severe dyspnea and a chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltration without findings of heart failure. After tracheal intubation, her oxygenation index (OI) and PaO(2)/FiO(2) (PF) ratio were 29 and 60 mmHg, respectively. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (rPCR) assay of tracheal lavage fluid. She was diagnosed as having severe ARDS that developed from TB pneumonia. Anti-tuberculous therapy and cardiopulmonary support were started. However, her respiratory condition deteriorated despite treatment with high-frequency oscillating ventilation (HFO), vasopressor support, and 1 g/kg of immunoglobulin. On the third day after admission, her International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis DIC score had increased to 5. Recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rTM) was administered to treat the DIC. After the administration of rTM was completed, OI gradually decreased, after which the mechanical ventilation mode was changed from HFO to synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation. The DIC score also gradually decreased. Plasma levels of soluble receptor for advanced glycan end products (sRAGE) and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1), which are reported to be associated with ARDS severity, also decreased. In addition, inflammatory biomarkers, including interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03B3) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), decreased after the administration of rTM. Although severe ARDS (P/F ratio \u2266 100 mmHg) continued for 19 days, the patient\u2019s OI and P/F ratio improved gradually, and she was extubated on the 27th day after admission. The severe ARDS with DIC was successfully treated, and she was discharged from hospital on day 33 post-admission. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully treated a female child suffering from TB pneumonia-induced severe ARDS complicated with DIC using multimodal interventions.

Therefore, a better understanding of the signals controlling migration of neutrophils as well as evaluating the role of these cells in demyelination is important to define cellular components that contribute to disease in MS patients. In this study, we examined the functional role of the chemokine CXCL1 in contributing to neuroinflammation and demyelination in EAE. Using transgenic mice in which expression of CXCL1 is under the control of a tetracycline\u2010inducible promoter active within glial fibrillary acidic protein\u2010positive cells, we have shown that sustained CXCL1 expression within the CNS increased the severity of clinical and histologic disease that was independent of an increase in the frequency of encephalitogenic Th1 and Th17 cells. Rather, disease was associated with enhanced recruitment of CD11b(\u002B)Ly6G(\u002B) neutrophils into the spinal cord. Targeting neutrophils resulted in a reduction in demyelination arguing for a role for these cells in myelin damage.

Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of genetic variants involved in the susceptibility and outcomes of this syndrome. We aimed to identify novel genes implicated in sepsis-induced ARDS susceptibility. METHODS: We first performed a prioritization of candidate genes by integrating our own genomic data from a transcriptomic study in an animal model of ARDS and from the only published genome-wide association study of ARDS study in humans. Then, we selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from prioritized genes to conduct a case-control discovery association study in patients with sepsis-induced ARDS (n = 225) and population-based controls (n = 899). Finally, we validated our findings in an independent sample of 661 sepsis-induced ARDS cases and 234 at-risk controls. RESULTS: Three candidate genes were prioritized: dynein cytoplasmic-2 heavy chain-1, fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT1), and integrin alpha-1. Of those, a SNP from FLT1 gene (rs9513106) was associated with ARDS in the discovery study, with an odds ratio (OR) for the C allele of 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58\u20130.98 (p = 0.037). This result was replicated in an independent study (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.62\u20130.98, p = 0.039), showing consistent direction of effects in a meta-analysis (OR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.65\u20130.92, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: We identified FLT1 as a novel ARDS susceptibility gene and demonstrated that integration of genomic data can be a valid procedure to identify novel susceptibility genes.

Pathological and neuroimaging studies have confirmed that brain atrophy in alcoholics is mainly due to widespread white matter (WM) loss with neuronal loss restricted to specific regions, such as the prefrontal cortex. Neuroimaging studies of cigarette smokers also suggest that chronic inhalation of tobacco smoke leads to brain atrophy, although the neurotoxic component is unknown. As a high proportion of chronic alcoholics also smoke cigarettes it has been hypothesized that at least some alcohol-related brain damage is due to tobacco smoke exposure. METHODS: 39 Long Evans rats were subjected to 8 weeks exposure to alcohol and/or 5 weeks co-exposure to nicotine-specific nitrosamine ketone (NNK), a proxy for tobacco smoke. Their frontal WM was then assayed with transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: NNK and ethanol co-exposure had a synergistic effect in decreasing myelinated fibre density. Furthermore, NNK treatment led to a greater reduction in myelin sheath thickness than ethanol whereas only the ethanol-treated animals showed a decrease in unmyelinated fibre density. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that NNK causes WM degeneration, an effect that is exacerbated by alcohol, but unlike alcohol, it has little impact on the neuronal components of the brain.","publish_time":"2016-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Papp-Peka, A.; Tong, M.; Kril, J.J.; De La Monte, S.M.; Sutherland, G.T.","journal":"Alcohol and Alcoholism","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/80a673a3533fc472c4f825e2a810fb35e0b540b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6075461.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/alcalc/article-pdf/52/2/165/25415992/agw067.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzE0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Evans"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tobacco smoke exposure","ethanol co-exposure","weeks exposure","brain atrophy","chronic consumption of alcohol","alcohol-related brain damage","chronic inhalation of tobacco smoke","weeks co-exposure","NNK treatment","neuronal loss","WM degeneration","frontal WM","high proportion of chronic alcoholics","ethanol-treated animals","unmyelinated fibre density","synergistic effect","specific regions","neuronal components","Neuroimaging studies of cigarette smokers","nicotine-specific nitrosamine ketone","greater reduction","decrease","myelin sheath thickness","widespread white matter","Long Evans rats","neurodegeneration","neurotoxic component","little impact","data","proxy","RESULTS","impairment of cognitive function","METHODS","transmission electron microscopy","cigarettes","prefrontal cortex","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that both autophagy and apoptosis are important cellular mechanisms for maintaining homeostasis, and they participate in the host response to pathogens. However, the crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy in host cells during PPRV infection has not been clarified. In this study, autophagy was induced upon virus infection in caprine endometrial epithelial cells (EECs), as determined by the appearance of double- and single-membrane autophagy-like vesicles, LC3-I/LC3-II conversion, and p62 degradation. We also found that PPRV infection triggered a complete autophagic response, most likely mediated by the non-structural protein C and nucleoprotein N. Moreover, our results suggest that autophagy not only promotes the replication of PPRV in EECs but also provides a potential mechanism for inhibiting PPRV-induced apoptosis. Inhibiting autophagosome formation by wortmannin and knocking down the essential autophagic proteins Beclin-1 and ATG7 induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in EECs in PPRV infection. However, inhibiting autophagosome and lysosome fusion by NH(4)Cl and chloroquine did not increase the number of apoptotic cells. Collectively, these data are the first to indicate that PPRV-induced autophagy inhibits caspase-dependent apoptosis and thus contributes to the enhancement of viral replication and maturity in host cells.","publish_time":"2018-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Bo; Xue, Qinghong; Qi, Xuefeng; Wang, Xueping; Jia, Peilong; Chen, Shuying; Wang, Ting; Xue, Tianxia; Wang, Jingyu","journal":"Virulence","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3133b38c4350e52953e57b9fc8f0290ab133cc0a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6086290.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6086290/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzE1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PPRV infection","PPRV-induced autophagy","inhibiting PPRV-induced apoptosis","replication of PPRV","host cells","caspase-dependent apoptosis","EECs","single-membrane autophagy","virus infection","host response","number of apoptotic cells","LC3","caprine endometrial epithelial cells","complete autophagic response","small ruminants","petits ruminants","autophagosome formation","enhancement of viral replication","increasing number of studies","essential autophagic proteins Beclin","significant economic losses","ATG7","potential mechanism","vesicles","important cellular mechanisms","maturity","contagious disease","nucleoprotein","developing countries","wortmannin","non-structural protein C","homeostasis","lysosome fusion","conversion","Peste","appearance of double","crosstalk","p62 degradation","chloroquine","results","study","pathogens","data"],"language":"en"},

Several Ministries of Health requested clinical management guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO), which had not previously developed guidance regarding critically ill patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess the acceptability and impact on knowledge of a short course about the management of critically ill patients with acute respiratory infections complicated by sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome delivered to clinicians in resource\u2010limited ICUs. METHODS: Over 4 years (2009\u20102013), WHO led the development, piloting, implementation and preliminary evaluation of a 3\u2010day course that emphasized patient management based on evidence\u2010based guidelines and used interactive adult\u2010learner teaching methodology. International content experts (n = 35) and instructional designers contributed to development. We assessed participants\u2019 satisfaction and content knowledge before and after the course. RESULTS: The course was piloted among clinicians in Trinidad and Tobago (n = 29), Indonesia (n = 38) and Vietnam (n = 86); feedback from these courses contributed to the final version. In 2013, inaugural national courses were delivered in Tajikistan (n = 28), Uzbekistan (n = 39) and Azerbaijan (n = 30). Participants rated the course highly and demonstrated increased immediate content knowledge after (vs before) course completion (P \u003C .001). CONCLUSIONS: We found that it was feasible to create and deliver a focused critical care short course to clinicians in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries. Collaboration between WHO, clinical experts, instructional designers, Ministries of Health and local clinician\u2010leaders facilitated course delivery.

Furthermore, the evidence of immunological memory has been established for NK cells. NK cells can respond to haptens or viruses, which results in generation of antigen-specific memory cells.

The characteristics of disease propagation evolve with time, as a result of a multitude of environmental and anthropic factors, this non-stationarity is a key factor in this huge complexity. In the absence of appropriate external data sources, to correctly describe the disease propagation, we explore a flexible approach, based on stochastic models for the disease dynamics, and on diffusion processes for the parameter dynamics. Using such a diffusion process has the advantage of not requiring a specific mathematical function for the parameter dynamics. Coupled with particle MCMC, this approach allows us to reconstruct the time evolution of some key parameters (average transmission rate for instance). Thus, by capturing the time-varying nature of the different mechanisms involved in disease propagation, the epidemic can be described. Firstly we demonstrate the efficiency of this methodology on a toy model, where the parameters and the observation process are known. Applied then to real datasets, our methodology is able, based solely on simple stochastic models, to reconstruct complex epidemics, such as flu or dengue, over long time periods. Hence we demonstrate that time-varying parameters can improve the accuracy of model performances, and we suggest that our methodology can be used as a first step towards a better understanding of a complex epidemic, in situation where data is limited and/or uncertain.","publish_time":"2018-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cazelles, Bernard; Champagne, Clara; Dureau, Joseph","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4836e3bd00d59bf1af3b4f5000cf917c71655658.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6110518.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6110518/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzE4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease dynamics","time-varying parameters","spread of disease","characteristics of disease propagation","time evolution","methodology","time-varying nature","key parameters","parameter dynamics","long time periods","complex epidemics","simple stochastic models","key factor","flexible approach","diffusion processes","toy model","observation process","accuracy of model performances","absence of appropriate external data sources","non-stationarity","different mechanisms","average transmission rate","anthropic factors","dengue","flu","specific mathematical function","multitude of environmental","instance","advantage","better understanding","human populations","huge complexity","real datasets","result","situation","step","particle MCMC","efficiency"],"language":"en"},

However, the efficacy of DAAs can be attenuated by the presence of resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) before and after treatment. Indeed, RASs detected in DAA treatment-na\u00EFve HCV-infected patients could be useful for clinical management and outcome prediction. Although the frequency of naturally occurring HCV NS5A and NS5B RASs has been addressed in many countries, there are only a few reports on their prevalence in the South American region. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of RASs to NS5A and NS5B inhibitors in a DAA treatment na\u00EFve cohort of Uruguayan patients infected with chronic hepatitis C and compare them with reports from other South American countries. Here, we found that naturally occurring substitutions conferring resistance to NS5A and NS5B inhibitors were present in 8% and 19.2%, respectively, of treatment-na\u00EFve HCV genotype 1 infected patients.

Porcine circovirus (PCV)-2, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and pseudorabies virus, all commonly associated with PRDC, were identified in the two pooled samples by metagenomics, but most viruses comprised small linear and circular DNAs (e.g. parvoviruses, bocaviruses and circoviruses). PCR was used to compare the detection rates of each virus in the serum samples from 36 PRDC-affected piglets versus 38 location-matched clinically healthy controls. The average virus category per sample was 6.81 for the PRDC-affected piglets and 4.09 for the controls. Single or co-infections with PCV-2 or PRRSV had very high detection rates in the PRDC-affected piglets.

In the present study, a novel nano-size contrast agent, a chitosan/Fe(3)O(4)-enclosed albumin (CFEA), was introduced that was used to quantify blood volume and permeability in the infarcted myocardium. A total of 68 patients with suspected myocardial infarction were recruited to analyze the efficacy of MRI combined with CFEA (MRI-CFEA). All patients received diagnosis by MRI and MRI-CFEA. It was revealed that MRI-CFEA provided a higher signal intensity than MRI in the same patients.

Estimating the transmissibility, which is usually characterized by the basic reproductive number R(0), the mean number of secondary infectious cases generated by a single primary infectious case introduced into a totally susceptible population, provides crucial information for the effort required to stop infection spreading. Hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted indirectly through contaminated food and environment. An outbreak from March to June 2011 was reported to have occurred at an elementary school of 698 pupils in China and it was found that the outbreak was due to direct transmission between school children. Based on the symptom onset date and the social contact network of the children, in this study we estimate the serial interval (i.e. the gap in symptom onset between an infectee and its infector) and use different statistical methods to estimate R(0). Combining with the positivity of IgG antibodies tests, we develop a compartmental transmission dynamics model which includes both asymptomatic and symptomatic infections to estimate the overall R(0). Our analysis suggests a serial interval of mean = 23.9 days and standard deviation = 20.9 days. The different statistical methods suggest estimates for R(0) in the outbreak varying from 2.1 to 2.8, and the estimates from the transmission dynamics model are consistent with this range. Our estimates are in agreement with that from one study in England but are higher than that from one study in the United States. Our transmission dynamics model suggests that the proportion of symptomatic infections is about 9%, implying that there were about 344 asymptomatic infections along with the 32 observed symptomatic cases. Furthermore, it is shown that the inclusion of asymptomatic infection in the epidemic process increases the estimate of R(0) but does not do so greatly provided that the proportion of symptomatic infections is constant over the outbreak and there is no difference in transmissibility between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections.","publish_time":"2018-09-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Xu-Sheng; Iacono, Giovanni Lo","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4bc6d312effedb4dafb7bca22236c006ad1f7136.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6152969.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6152969/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzIzMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","England","United States"],"keyphrases":["asymptomatic infections","estimate of R","proportion of symptomatic infections","outbreak","symptomatic cases","overall R","study","estimates","Hepatitis","compartmental transmission dynamics model","direct transmission","inclusion of asymptomatic infection","basic reproductive number R","days","serial interval of mean","different statistical methods","school children","transmissibility","virus","mean number of secondary infectious cases","symptom onset date","elementary school","single primary infectious case","social contact network","epidemic process","gap","infector","susceptible population","crucial information","infectee","standard deviation","positivity of IgG antibodies tests","difference","pupils","China","effort","analysis","range","contaminated food","environment","United States","England","agreement"],"language":"en"},

CEACAM1 is a differentiation antigen involved in the maintenance of epithelial polarity that is induced during hepatocyte differentiation and liver regeneration. CEACAM1 regulates insulin sensitivity by promoting hepatic insulin clearance, and controls liver tolerance and mucosal immunity. Obese insulin-resistant humans with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease manifest loss of hepatic CEACAM1. In mice, deletion or functional inactivation of CEACAM1 impairs insulin clearance and compromises metabolic homeostasis which initiates the development of obesity and hepatic steatosis and fibrosis with other features of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and adipogenesis in white adipose depot. This is followed by inflammation and endothelial and cardiovascular dysfunctions. In obstructive and inflammatory liver diseases, soluble CEACAM1 is shed into human bile where it can serve as an indicator of liver disease. On immune cells, CEACAM1 acts as an immune checkpoint regulator, and deletion of Ceacam1 gene in mice causes exacerbation of inflammation and hyperactivation of myeloid cells and lymphocytes. Hence, hepatic CEACAM1 resides at the central hub of immune and metabolic homeostasis in both humans and mice. This review focuses on the regulatory role of CEACAM1 in liver and biliary tract architecture in health and disease, and on its metabolic role and function as an immune checkpoint regulator of hepatic inflammation.","publish_time":"2018-10-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Horst, Andrea Kristina; Najjar, Sonia M.; Wagener, Christoph; Tiegs, Gisa","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/84bafc34e5e1118ed2da16a02c87e472e0dd0d4c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6213298.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6213298/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzI5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["soluble CEACAM1","CEACAM1 acts","deletion of Ceacam1 gene","regulatory role of CEACAM1","functional inactivation of CEACAM1","immune cells","hepatic insulin clearance","non-alcoholic fatty liver disease manifest loss of hepatic CEACAM1","liver regeneration","immune checkpoint regulator of hepatic inflammation","indicator of liver disease","hepatic steatosis","mice","controls liver tolerance","inflammatory liver diseases","insulin sensitivity","metabolic homeostasis","metabolic role","central hub of immune","Obese insulin-resistant humans","exacerbation of inflammation","differentiation antigen","hyperactivation of myeloid cells","hepatocyte differentiation","features of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis","maintenance of epithelial polarity","Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule","biliary tract architecture","adipogenesis","fibrosis","development of obesity","health","white adipose depot","mucosal immunity","lymphocytes","cardiovascular dysfunctions","human bile","transmembrane glycoprotein","review"],"language":"en"},

The patients had a higher prevalence of anemia (50%) and preeclampsia (25%) than ordinary pregnant women. Delayed diagnoses were not uncommon. Two mothers died in our series, resulting in a mortality rate of 17%. Two intrauterine deaths were observed. Elective delivery was not performed in any of the four patients in their second trimester. Six of the seven patients who presented after 28 weeks of gestation and had live fetuses underwent emergency deliveries. Preterm births (6/7) and cesarean sections (5/7) were the two leading adverse outcomes in newborns. CONCLUSIONS: Anemia, advanced gestational age, and preeclampsia might be associated with the severity of pneumonia. Chest radiographs should be taken as soon as pneumonia is highly suspected to facilitate an early diagnosis. High incidences of adverse fetal outcomes were observed; thus, termination of the pregnancy is recommended for patients in their third trimester when respiratory function deteriorates progressively. However, it might be reasonable to continue pregnancy for those in their first or second trimester.","publish_time":"2018-11-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Pingping; Wang, Jiangshan; Song, Yingna","journal":"BMC Pregnancy Childbirth","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/709049266c92c8f5ff4ca844d295475989f3ed6d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6215647.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6215647/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzMwMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Peking Union Medical College Hospital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe pneumonia patients","pregnancy outcomes","gravid patients","severity of pneumonia","trimester","management of severe pneumonia","leading adverse outcomes","High incidences of adverse fetal outcomes","preeclampsia","predictive factors","medical records","fetal morbidity","mortality rate","Elective delivery","probable risk factors","appropriate timing of delivery","higher prevalence of anemia","Peking Union Medical College Hospital","live fetuses","advanced gestational age","treatment strategies","CONCLUSIONS","weeks of gestation","retrospective cohort study","emergency deliveries","clinical features","METHODS","series","telephone calls","newborns","characteristics","Preterm births","cesarean sections","respiratory function","ordinary pregnant women","Delayed diagnoses","early diagnosis","termination","BACKGROUND","intrauterine deaths","Chest radiographs","mothers","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Their therapeutic potential appears promising as evident from their efficacy in several animal models of pulmonary disorders as well as early-phase clinical trials of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Such therapeutic efficacy might be attributed to MSC-derived products (the \u201Csecretome\u201D), namely conditioned media (CM) and extracellular vesicles (EVs), which have been shown to play pivotal roles in the regenerative function of MSCs. Importantly, the EVs secreted by MSCs can transfer a variety of bioactive factors to modulate the function of recipient cells via various mechanisms, including ligand-receptor interactions, direct membrane fusion, endocytosis, or phagocytosis. Herein, we review the current state-of-the-science of MSC-derived CM and EVs as potential therapeutic agents in lung diseases. We suggest that the MSC-derived secretome might be an appropriate therapeutic agent for treating aggressive pulmonary disorders because of biological and logistical advantages over live cell therapy. Nonetheless, further studies are warranted to elucidate the safety and efficacy of these components in combating pulmonary diseases.","publish_time":"2018-11-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mohammadipoor, Arezoo; Antebi, Ben; Batchinsky, Andriy I.; Cancio, Leopoldo C.","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6438fe70f683013f330a68de46f570a2e4408859.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6234778.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6234778/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzMxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["therapeutic efficacy","therapeutic potential","pulmonary diseases","EVs","MSC-derived secretome","aggressive pulmonary disorders","potential therapeutic agents","MSC-derived products","stromal cells","animal models of pulmonary disorders","appropriate therapeutic agent","function of recipient cells","regenerative function of MSCs","science of MSC","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","tissue-specific cells","lung diseases","ARDS","logistical advantages","ligand-receptor interactions","phase clinical trials of acute respiratory distress syndrome","various mechanisms","direct membrane fusion","ability","robust self-renewal characteristics","endocytosis","live cell therapy","Multipotent mesenchymal stem","COPD","components","variety of bioactive factors","conditioned media","extracellular vesicles","pivotal roles","phagocytosis","safety","current state","studies"],"language":"en"},

Given the widespread importance of RS in avian viral diseases, oxidative stress pathways are of utmost importance for targeted therapeutics. Therefore, a special focus is provided on avian virus-mediated oxidative stresses. Finally, future research perspectives are discussed on the exploitation of these pathways to treat viral diseases of poultry.","publish_time":"2018-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rehman, Zaib Ur; Meng, Chunchun; Sun, Yingjie; Safdar, Anum; Pasha, Riaz Hussain; Munir, Muhammad; Ding, Chan","journal":"Oxid Med Cell Longev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/22b2cb7ff5ea6e57e41098d8cf66aa69a5d04bc4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6311761.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6311761/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reactive nitrogen species","reactive oxygen species","production of RS","Uncontrolled production of reactive species results","oxidative stress pathways","widespread importance of RS","avian viral diseases","oxidative stresses","lipids","ROS","proteins","cellular processes","cellular structures","DNA","damage","RNS","viral diseases of poultry","cellular antioxidant system","avian virus","utmost importance","clearance of viruses","pathogenic viruses","immunomodulation","cytokine transcription","ion transport","detoxification","dual roles","exploitation","targeted therapeutics","apoptosis","pathological implications","special focus","host","future research perspectives","regular metabolism","review"],"language":"en"},

The arenavirus matrix protein Z has several functions during the virus life cycle, including coordinating viral assembly, driving the release of new virus particles, regulating viral polymerase activity, and antagonizing the host antiviral response. There is limited knowledge regarding how the various functions of Z are regulated. To investigate possible means of regulation, mass spectrometry was used to identify potential sites of phosphorylation in the LASV Z protein. This analysis revealed that two serines (S18, S98) and one tyrosine (Y97) are phosphorylated in the flexible N- and C-terminal regions of the protein. Notably, two of these sites, Y97 and S98, are located in (Y97) or directly adjacent to (S98) the PPXY late domain, an important motif for virus release. Studies with non-phosphorylatable and phosphomimetic Z proteins revealed that these sites are important regulators of the release of LASV particles and that host-driven, reversible phosphorylation may play an important role in the regulation of LASV Z protein function.","publish_time":"2018-12-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ziegler, Christopher M.; Eisenhauer, Philip; Manuelyan, Inessa; Weir, Marion E.; Bruce, Emily A.; Ballif, Bryan A.; Botten, Jason","journal":"Pathogens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1341e9e33488d304353f31081a8422ed8715b5b6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6313517.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6313517/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lassa"],"organizations":["LASV Z","PPXY"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus release","regulation of LASV Z protein function","release of LASV particles","S98","Y97","arenavirus matrix protein Z","various functions of Z","release of new virus particles","phosphomimetic Z proteins","Lassa fever","virus life cycle","important motif","important role","important regulators","enveloped RNA virus","potential sites of phosphorylation","reversible phosphorylation","Lassa mammarenavirus","coordinating viral assembly","viral polymerase activity","C-terminal regions","possible means of regulation","host antiviral response","acute hemorrhagic fever syndrome","endemic regions of western Africa","significant morbidity","high rates of fatality","PPXY late domain","mass spectrometry","flexible N","S18","Studies","limited knowledge","serines","tyrosine","analysis"],"language":"en"},

Only two clinical trials out of 58 on interventions for WHO priority pathogens provided any link in their registry entry to the background data. Interviews with researchers revealed a reluctance to share data included a lack of confidence in the utility of the data; an absence of academic-incentives for rapid dissemination that prevents subsequent publication and a disconnect between those who are collecting the data and those who wish to use it quickly. The role of the funders of research needs to change to address this. Funders need to engage early with the researchers and related stakeholders to understand their concerns and work harder to define the more explicitly the benefits to all stakeholders. Secondly, there needs to be a direct benefit to sharing data that is directly relevant to those people that collect and curate the data. Thirdly more work needs to be done to realise the intent of making data sharing resources more equitable, ethical and efficient. Finally, a checklist of the issues that need to be addressed when designing new or revising existing data sharing resources should be created.

Viruses have been increasingly identified that contain proteases possessing deubiquitinase (DUB) and/or deISGylase functions. This includes viruses in the Nairoviridae family that encode a viral homologue of the ovarian tumor protease (vOTU). vOTU activity was recently demonstrated to be critical for replication of the often-fatal Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, with DUB activity suppressing the type I interferon responses and deISGylase activity broadly removing ISG15 conjugated proteins. There are currently about 40 known nairoviruses classified into fourteen species. Recent genomic characterization has revealed a high degree of diversity, with vOTUs showing less than 25% amino acids identities within the family. Previous investigations have been limited to only a few closely related nairoviruses, leaving it unclear what impact this diversity has on vOTU function. To probe the effects of vOTU diversity on enzyme activity and specificity, we assessed representative vOTUs spanning the Nairoviridae family towards Ub and ISG15 fluorogenic substrates. This revealed great variation in enzymatic activity and specific substrate preferences. A subset of the vOTUs were further assayed against eight biologically relevant di-Ub substrates, uncovering both common trends and distinct preferences of poly-Ub linkages by vOTUs. Four novel X-ray crystal structures were obtained that provide a biochemical rationale for vOTU substrate preferences and elucidate structural features that distinguish the vOTUs, including a motif in the Hughes orthonairovirus species that has not been previously observed in OTU domains. Additionally, structure-informed mutagenesis provided the first direct evidence of a second site involved in di-Ub binding for vOTUs. These results provide new insight into nairovirus evolution and pathogenesis, and further enhances the development of tools for therapeutic purposes.","publish_time":"2019-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dzimianski, John V.; Beldon, Brianna S.; Daczkowski, Courtney M.; Goodwin, Octavia Y.; Scholte, Florine E.

In order to investigate the in vivo potential of chicken IFN-\u03BB (chIFN-\u03BB) as a regulator of innate immunity, and potential antiviral therapeutics, we profiled the transcriptome of chIFN-\u03BB-stimulated chicken immune organs (in vivo) and compared it with primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (in vitro). Employing the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS), recombinant chIFN-\u03BB3 (rchIFN-\u03BB3) was produced and its biological activities were demonstrated. The rchIFN\u03BB3 induced a great array of IFN-regulated genes in primary chicken fibroblast cells. The transcriptional profiling using RNA-seq and subsequent bioinformatics analysis (gene ontology, differential expressed genes, and KEGGs analysis) of the bursa of Fabricious and the thymus demonstrated an upregulation of crucial immune genes (viperin, IKKB, CCL5, IL1\u03B2, and AP1) as well as the antiviral signaling pathways. Interestingly, this experimental approach revealed contrasting evidence of the antiviral potential of chIFN-\u03BB in both in vivo and in vitro models.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 10 CIC-dependent children were included in the mass spectrometry analysis (UTI = 5, UTC = 5). Quantitative profiling of urine proteins with isobaric protein labeling was performed using tandem mass spectrometry. Candidate markers were normalized using a collective mixture of proteins from all samples. Relative quantitative abundance of proteins across all samples were compared. Proteins with \u003E50% change in the average abundance were identified as proteins of interest, which were then measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in an additional 40 samples (no growth = 10, UTC = 15, UTI = 15). RESULTS: Mass spectrometry revealed 8 differentially expressed proteins. Of these, apolipoprotein D, alpha-amylase 2B, non-secretory ribonuclease, CD44 antigen, and prosaposin were measurable by ELISA. Concentrations of both CD44 and prosaposin were significantly higher in UTI, with area under the curves (AUCs) of 0.72 and 0.78, respectively.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the most challenging threat to the swine industry worldwide. Currently, commercially available vaccines are ineffective for controlling porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in pigs. Therefore, a pharmacological intervention may represent an alternative control measure for PRRSV infection. Hence, the present study evaluated the effects of DiNap on the replication of VR2332 (a prototype strain of type 2 PRRSV). Initially, in vitro antiviral assays against VR2332 were performed in MARC-145 cells and porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs). Following this, a pilot study was conducted in a pig model to demonstrate the effects of DiNap following VR2332 infection. DiNap inhibited VR2332 replication in both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, and viral growth was completely suppressed at concentrations \u22650.06 mM, without significant cytotoxicity. Consistent with these findings, in the pig study, DiNap also reduced viral loads in the serum and lungs and enhanced the weight gain of pigs following VR2332 infection, as indicated by comparison of the DiNap-treated groups to the untreated control (NC) group. In addition, DiNap-treated pigs had fewer gross and microscopic lesions in their lungs than NC pigs. Notably, virus transmission was also delayed by approximately 1 week in uninfected contact pigs within the same group after treatment with DiNap. Taken together, these results suggest that DiNap has potential anti-PRRSV activity and could be useful as a prophylactic or post-exposure treatment drug to control PRRSV infection in pigs.","publish_time":"2019-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khatun, Amina; Park, Sun You; Shabir, Nadeem; Nazki, Salik; Kang, A-Rum; Jeong, Chang-Gi; Seo, Byoung-Joo; Yang, Myeon-Sik; Kim, Bumseok; Seo, Young Ho; Kim, Won-Il","journal":"Molecules","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e283c964691d950836fd62790ff4c032b8b1a56a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6429065.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6429065/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzU1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["DiNap"],"organizations":["DiNap"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DiNap-treated pigs","effects of DiNap","PRRSV infection","VR2332 infection","DiNap inhibited VR2332 replication","DiNap-treated groups","NC pigs","replication of VR2332","pig study","weight gain of pigs","uninfected contact pigs","present study","pilot study","lungs","potential anti-PRRSV activity","respiratory syndrome virus","untreated control","porcine alveolar macrophages","alternative control measure","viral loads","viral growth","pig model","virus transmission","post-exposure treatment drug","cell lines","microscopic lesions","fewer gross","dose-dependent manner","cells","MARC","comparison","prototype strain of type","analog","natural product","PAMs","challenging threat","serum","pharmacological intervention","available vaccines","naphthalen","prop","chalcone flavokawain","swine industry","concentrations","week","results","findings","addition","antiviral assays","dimethoxyphenyl","significant cytotoxicity"],"language":"en"},

Their genome is segmented into two or more parts, and encapsidated in separate particles that appear to propagate independently. Completing the replication cycle, however, requires the full genome, so that a systemic infection of a host requires the concurrent presence of several particles. This represents an apparent evolutionary drawback of multipartitism, while its advantages remain unclear. A transition from monopartite to multipartite viral forms has been described in vitro under conditions of high multiplicity of infection, suggesting that cooperation between defective mutants is a plausible evolutionary pathway towards multipartitism. However, it is unknown how the putative advantages that multipartitism might enjoy at the microscopic level affect its epidemiology, or if an explicit advantange is needed to explain its ecological persistence. In order to disentangle which mechanisms might contribute to the rise and fixation of multipartitism, we here investigate the interaction between viral spreading dynamics and host population structure. We set up a compartmental model of the spread of a virus in its different forms and explore its epidemiology using both analytical and numerical techniques. We uncover that the impact of host contact structure on spreading dynamics entails a rich phenomenology of ecological relationships that includes cooperation, competition, and commensality. Furthermore, we find out that multipartitism might rise to fixation even in the absence of explicit microscopic advantages. Multipartitism allows the virus to colonize environments that could not be invaded by the monopartite form, while homogeneous contacts between hosts facilitate its spread. We conjecture that these features might have led to an increase in the diversity and prevalence of multipartite viral forms concomitantly with the expansion of agricultural practices.","publish_time":"2019-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Valdano, Eugenio; Manrubia, Susanna; G\u00F3mez, Sergio; Arenas, Alex","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5d295bdf0e26bc9492f3fb1580833419f26b4e7c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d43a73492744f56383a502fdd4fdc36eb160e09e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6438571.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6438571/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzU2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fixation of multipartitism","apparent evolutionary drawback of multipartitism","prevalence of multipartite viral forms","viral spreading dynamics","cooperation","host population structure","epidemiology","different forms","Multipartite viruses","absence of explicit microscopic advantages","putative advantages","rise","genome","impact of host contact structure","plausible evolutionary pathway","puzzling evolutionary strategy","systemic infection","monopartite form","ecological persistence","explicit advantange","microscopic level","separate particles","rich phenomenology of ecological relationships","conditions of high multiplicity of infection","defective mutants","homogeneous contacts","diversity","interaction","hosts","competition","transition","concurrent presence","expansion of agricultural practices","increase","numerical techniques","compartmental model","mechanisms","parts","commensality","environments","replication cycle","order","features"],"language":"en"},

However, many proteins/peptides have the disadvantage of poor stability, short half-life, and uncertain targeting ability. Chemical modification can be used to overcome these disadvantages; many polyethylene glycol-modified proteins/peptides have been approved by US FDA. The purpose of this study was to obtain a novel anti-angiogenic chondroitin sulfate (CS)-peptide nanoparticle conjugate with efficient anti-neovascularization and tumor targeting ability and an acceptable half-life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CS-ES2-AF nanoparticle conjugate was synthesized and characterized using (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and particle size and zeta potential analyzer. The anti-angiogenic ability was studied using MTT, migration, tube formation, and chick chorioallantoic membrane assays. The targeting ability of CS-ES2-AF was studied by ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, and bioimaging. The pharmacokinetics was also studied. RESULTS: The CS-ES2-AF could self-assemble into stable nanoparticles in aqueous solution, which significantly enhances its anti-neovascularization activity, tumor targeting more explicit, and prolongs its half-life. CONCLUSION: CS is an effective protein/peptide modifier, and CS-ES2-AF displayed good potential in tumor targeting therapy.","publish_time":"2019-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xing, Liang; Sun, Feng; Wang, Zhendong; Li, Yan; Yang, Zhifang; Wang, Fengshan; Zhai, Guangxi; Tan, Haining","journal":"Int J Nanomedicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b625ef49ed4b9e6f2d32150303199ca3fca8bddb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6462165.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6462165/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzU4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Chemical","CS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CS-ES2","targeting ability of CS","ES2-AF","tumor site","uncertain targeting ability","inhibiting tumor growth","anti-angiogenic ability","AF nanoparticle conjugate","inhibiting neovascularization","peptide nanoparticle conjugate","efficient anti-neovascularization","peptides","anti-neovascularization activity","short half-life","acceptable half-life","peptide modifier","good potential","surface plasmon resonance","zeta potential analyzer","novel anti-angiogenic chondroitin sulfate","polyethylene glycol-modified proteins","H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy","transmission electron microscopy","particle size","tube formation","disadvantage of poor stability","effective protein","chick chorioallantoic membrane assays","stable nanoparticles","migration","MTT","ELISA","significant progress","past","years","aqueous solution","nutrient supply","disadvantages","study","bioimaging","CONCLUSION","metastasis","therapy","METHODS","BACKGROUND","US FDA","MATERIALS","RESULTS","Chemical modification","purpose","pharmacokinetics"],"language":"en"},

Building upon this platform, this study reports that enzyme-mediated modification of the muscle tissue extracellular matrix structure at the site of pDNA delivery operates in a synergistic manner with EP to enhance both local and systemic gene expression further. Specifically, administration of chondroitinase ABC (Cho ABC) to the site of intramuscular delivery of pDNA led to transient disruption of chondroitin sulfate scaffolding barrier, permitting enhanced gene distribution and expression across the tissue. The employment of Cho ABC in combination with CELLECTRA(\u00AE) intramuscular EP resulted in increased gene expression by 5.5-fold in mice and 17.98-fold in rabbits. The study demonstrates how this protocol can be universally applied to an active prophylaxis platform to increase the in vivo production of functional immunoglobulin G, and to DNA vaccine protocols to permit drug dose sparing. The data indicate the Cho ABC formulation to be of significant value upon combination with EP to drive enhanced gene expression levels in pDNA delivery protocols.","publish_time":"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schommer, Nina N.; Nguyen, Jacklyn; Yung, Bryan S.; Schultheis, Katherine; Muthumani, Kar; Weiner, David B.; Humeau, Laurent; Broderick, Kate E.; Smith, Trevor R.F.","journal":"Hum Gene Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e8dcb73fafb728fc6297e33e0374b7ef8016e1ef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6479233.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6479233/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzYyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ABC","Cho ABC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gene delivery","increased gene expression","pDNA delivery protocols","site of pDNA delivery","systemic gene expression","enhanced gene expression levels","site of intramuscular delivery of pDNA","enhanced gene distribution","intramuscular EP","employment of Cho ABC","Cho ABC formulation","combination","administration of chondroitinase ABC","DNA vaccine protocols","active prophylaxis platform","Plasmid DNA","study reports","muscle tissue extracellular matrix structure","transient disruption of chondroitin sulfate scaffolding barrier","enzyme-mediated modification","recent demonstration of clinical efficacy","significant value","production of functional immunoglobulin G","CELLECTRA","drug dose sparing","synergistic manner","potential","mice","versatile technology","multitude of unmet medical needs","data","electroporation","Advances","rabbits"],"language":"en"},

We will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the prevalence and factors associated with respiratory viral infection in people of all ages with ARTI residing in Africa. METHODS: This work will include cross-sectional studies published between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2017, without any language restriction, on populations residing in African countries. We will consider studies that reported the prevalence of respiratory viruses in people with ARTI confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction technique. We will be searching PubMed, Embase, African Journals Online, Web of Science, and Global Index Medicus. The selection of relevant studies, extraction of data, and evaluation of the quality of the articles will be carried out independently by two review authors, and the discrepancies will be resolved by consensus or intervention of a third author. The heterogeneity of the studies will be assessed using the \u03C7(2) test on Cochrane\u2019s Q statistic. Publication bias will be assessed by the Egger test. Studies will be pooled using a random-effect meta-analysis model. Results will be presented by age group and sub-region of Africa. Using meta-regression models, we will identify factors associated with viral infections in people with ARTI. DISCUSSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis is based on published data and therefore does not require ethical approval. This work will serve as a basis for the development of strategies for prevention and control ARTI in Africa and will also serve to identify data gaps and guide future investigations. The final report will be published in peer-reviewed journals as a scientific article and presented in workshops, conferences, and scientific conferences.

The key to better understanding the mechanisms that control this process is to identify the specific substrates that each protease targets. To address this, we have developed iProt-Sub, a powerful bioinformatics tool for the accurate prediction of protease-specific substrates and their cleavage sites. Importantly, iProt-Sub represents a significantly advanced version of its successful predecessor, PROSPER. It provides optimized cleavage site prediction models with better prediction performance and coverage for more species-specific proteases (4 major protease families and 38 different proteases). iProt-Sub integrates heterogeneous sequence and structural features and uses a two-step feature selection procedure to further remove redundant and irrelevant features in an effort to improve the cleavage site prediction accuracy. Features used by iProt-Sub are encoded by 11 different sequence encoding schemes, including local amino acid sequence profile, secondary structure, solvent accessibility and native disorder, which will allow a more accurate representation of the protease specificity of approximately 38 proteases and training of the prediction models. Benchmarking experiments using cross-validation and independent tests showed that iProt-Sub is able to achieve a better performance than several existing generic tools. We anticipate that iProt-Sub will be a powerful tool for proteome-wide prediction of protease-specific substrates and their cleavage sites, and will facilitate hypothesis-driven functional interrogation of protease-specific substrate cleavage and proteolytic events.","publish_time":"2018-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Jiangning; Wang, Yanan; Li, Fuyi; Akutsu, Tatsuya; Rawlings, Neil D; Webb, Geoffrey I; Chou, Kuo-Chen","journal":"Brief Bioinform","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9187e3a34dfe7e63989291c32b4f8254de5e6a0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6556904.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6556904/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzcwMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["iProt-Sub","accurate prediction of protease","better prediction performance","proteome-wide prediction of protease","specific substrates","cleavage site prediction accuracy","protease specificity","protease targets","cleavage sites","specific substrate cleavage","optimized cleavage site prediction models","major protease families","functional interrogation of protease","better performance","different sequence","different proteases","heterogeneous sequence","powerful tool","species-specific proteases","structural features","irrelevant features","powerful bioinformatics tool","accurate representation","local amino acid sequence profile","secondary structure","solvent accessibility","schemes","effort","coverage","critical role","cross-validation","independent tests","two-step feature selection procedure","hypothesis","native disorder","advanced version","proteolytic events","myriad of important cellular processes","existing generic tools","training","Benchmarking experiments","successful predecessor","Regulation of proteolysis","mechanisms","key"],"language":"en"},

Various enzymes, specifically microbial proteases, are the most essentially used in different corporate sectors, such as textile, detergent, leather, feed, waste, and others. Proteases with respect to physiological and commercial roles hold a pivotal position. As they are performing synthetic and degradative functions, proteases are found ubiquitously, such as in plants, animals, and microbes. Among different producers of proteases, Bacillus sp. are mostly commercially exploited microbes for proteases. Proteases are successfully considered as an alternative to chemicals and an eco-friendly indicator for nature or the surroundings. The evolutionary relationship among acidic, neutral, and alkaline proteases has been analyzed based on their protein sequences, but there remains a lack of information that regulates the diversity in their specificity. Researchers are looking for microbial proteases as they can tolerate harsh conditions, ways to prevent autoproteolytic activity, stability in optimum pH, and substrate specificity.

Although the isozymes KAT1\u20134 have been identified, KYNA is mainly produced by KAT2 in brain tissues. KNYA is an antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate and \u03B1-7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and accumulation of KYNA in the brain has been associated with the pathology of schizophrenia. Therefore, KAT2 could be exploited as a therapeutic target for the management of schizophrenia. Although currently available KAT2 inhibitors irreversibly bind to pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate (PLP), inhibition via this mechanism may cause adverse side effects because of the presence of other PLP-dependent enzymes. Therefore, we identified novel selective KAT2 inhibitors by screening approximately 13,000 molecules. Among these, glycyrrhizic acid (GL) and its analogues, glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) and carbenoxolone (CBX), were identified as KAT2 inhibitors. These compounds were highly selective for KAT2 and competed with its substrate KYN, but had no effects on the other 3 KAT isozymes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that in complex structures that were predicted in docking calculations, GL, GA and CBX were located on the same surface as the aromatic ring of KYN. These results indicate that GL and its analogues are highly selective and competitive inhibitors of KAT2.","publish_time":"2019-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yoshida, Yukihiro; Fujigaki, Hidetsugu; Kato, Koichi; Yamazaki, Kyoka; Fujigaki, Suwako; Kunisawa, Kazuo; Yamamoto, Yasuko; Mouri, Akihiro; Oda, Akifumi; Nabeshima, Toshitaka; Saito, Kuniaki","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5080b4cb5df826f641dc6602e27dcca510ccada8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6629613.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6629613/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozc3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["KYNA","KNYA","KYN","GL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["competitive inhibitors of KAT2","available KAT2 inhibitors","novel selective KAT2 inhibitors","analogues","GA","effects","glycyrrhetinic acid","kynurenic acid","substrate KYN","CBX","accumulation of KYNA","glycyrrhizic acid","KAT isozymes","aromatic ring of KYN","conversion of kynurenine","management of schizophrenia","brain tissues","pathology of schizophrenia","isozymes KAT1","enzyme kynurenine aminotransferase","PLP-dependent enzymes","methyl-D","aspartate","nicotinic acetylcholine receptors","presence","docking calculations","pyridoxal","screening","antagonist of N","inhibition","mechanism","surface","carbenoxolone","therapeutic target","phosphate","molecules","complex structures","KNYA","results","compounds"],"language":"en"},

Infection of rats results in an asymptomatic but persistent infection. Little is known about the cell tropism of SEOV in its reservoir and most available data is based on experimental infection studies in which rats were inoculated via a route which does not recapitulate virus transmission in nature. Here we report the histopathological analysis of SEOV cell tropism in key target organs following natural infection of a cohort of feeder rats, comprising 19 adults and 11 juveniles. All adult rats in this study were positive for SEOV specific antibodies and viral RNA in their tissues. One juvenile rat was seropositive, but negative in the rRT-PCR. Of the 19 adult rats of which subsequently additional organs were tested, SEOV RNA was detected in all lungs, followed by kidney (79%) and liver (74%). Histopathologic changes associated with SEOV infection were primarily found in the liver, consistent with a pathological diagnosis of a mild hepatitis.

Zn(2\u002B) is a natural inhibitor of proteases with CysHis dyads or CysHis(Xaa) triads. Biguanide forms bidentate metal complexes through the two imino nitrogens. Here, it is discussed that phenformin (phenylethyl biguanide) is a model for recruitment of endogenous Zn(2\u002B) to inhibit CysHis/CysHis(X) peptidolysis. Phenformin is a Zn(2\u002B)-interactive, anti-proteolytic agent in bioassay of living tissue. Benzoyl-l-arginine amide (BAA) is a classical substrate of papain-like proteases; the amide bond is scissile. In this review, the structures of BAA and the phenformin-Zn(2\u002B) complex were compared in silico. Their chemistry and dimensions are discussed in light of the active sites of papain-like proteases. The phenyl moieties of both structures bind to the \u201CS2\u201D substrate-binding site that is typical of many proteases. When the phenyl moiety of BAA binds to S2, then the scissile amide bond is directed to the position of the thiolate-imidazolium ion pair, and is then hydrolyzed. However, when the phenyl moiety of phenformin binds to S2, then the coordinated Zn(2\u002B) is directed to the identical position; and catalysis is inhibited. Phenformin stabilizes a \u201CZn(2\u002B) sandwich\u201D between the drug and protease active site. Hundreds of biguanide derivatives have been synthesized at the 1 and 5 nitrogen positions; many more are conceivable. Various substituent moieties can register with various arrays of substrate-binding sites so as to align coordinated Zn(2\u002B) with catalytic partners of diverse proteases. Biguanide is identified here as a modifiable pharmacophore for synthesis of therapeutic CysCt inhibitors with a wide range of potencies and specificities.

Recent studies indicated that Cxc chemokine ligand 5 (CXCL5), an inflammatory chemokine, was associated with tumorigenesis. The present study investigated the role of the CXCL5/Cxc chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) bio-axis in ARDS, and explored the underlying molecular mechanism. MATERIAL/METHODS: The pathological morphology of lung tissue and degree of pulmonary edema were assessed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and pulmonary edema score, respectively. Real-time PCR and Western blot analysis were performed to detect the expression levels of CXCL5, CXCR2, Matrix metalloproteinases 2 (MMP2), and Matrix metalloproteinases 9 (MMP9) in lung tissues. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to determine the expression levels of CXCL5 and inflammatory factors (IL-1\u03B2, IL-6, TNF-\u03B1, and IL-10) in serum. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that diffuse alveolar damage and pulmonary edema appeared in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ARDS and were positively correlated with the severity of ARDS. In addition, CXCL5 and its receptor CXCR2 were overexpressed by upregulation of MMP2 and MMP9 in lung tissues of ARDS. In addition, CXCL5 neutralizing antibody effectively alleviated inflammatory response, diffuse alveolar damage, and pulmonary edema, and decreased the expression levels of MMP2 and MMP9 compared to LPS-induced ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: We found that CXCL5/CXCR2 accelerated the progression of ARDS, partly by upregulation of MMP2 and MMP9 in lung tissues with the release of inflammatory factors.","publish_time":"2019-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Chang-yong; Shang, Min; Zhou, Chen-liang; Feng, Li-zhi; Zhou, Qing-shan; Hu, Ke","journal":"Med Sci Monit","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/725f0a6590f20c15be0ae719463c0624a34ee1af.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6659456.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6659456/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzgxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung tissues of ARDS","expression levels of CXCL5","MMP9","progression of ARDS","severity of ARDS","LPS-induced ARDS","inflammatory chemokine","expression levels of MMP2","degree of pulmonary edema","pulmonary edema score","receptor CXCR2","upregulation of MMP2","IL","release of inflammatory factors","Cxc chemokine receptor","diffuse alveolar damage","alleviated inflammatory response","Cxc chemokine ligand","Matrix metalloproteinases","RESULTS","addition","pathological morphology of lung tissue","Acute respiratory distress syndrome","antibody","lipopolysaccharide","hematoxylin-eosin staining","role","Western blot analysis","Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","ELISA","Real-time PCR","severe disease","clinic","BACKGROUND","METHODS","Recent studies","bio-axis","TNF-\u03B1","MATERIAL","underlying molecular mechanism","present study","tumorigenesis","serum","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

In this review, we describe the physiological and pathophysiological substrates of furin and discuss how dysregulation of a simple proteolytic cleavage event may promote infectious diseases and cancer. One major focus is the role of furin in viral glycoprotein maturation and pathogenicity. We also outline cellular mechanisms regulating the expression and activation of furin and summarise current approaches that target this protease for therapeutic intervention.","publish_time":"2019-08-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Braun, Elisabeth; Sauter, Daniel","journal":"Clin Transl Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94f679e7bf40010e41952e26e8953a5703be64c0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6682551.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682551/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzgzNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["activation of furin","role of furin","serine protease furin","pathophysiological substrates of furin","Mammalian substrates of furin","aberrant furin activity","enzymatic activity of furin","cancer","simple proteolytic cleavage event","numerous processes","viral glycoprotein maturation","hormones","cytokines","dysregulation","infectious diseases","plethora of proteins","health","growth factors","current approaches","polybasic recognition motifs","bacterial pathogens","expression","pathogenicity","cellular mechanisms","receptors","major focus","variety of disorders","key player","therapeutic intervention","virulence","review"],"language":"en"},

Following a viral infection, the host may initiate complex antiviral immune responses to antagonize viral invasion and replication.

Interleukin (IL)-17 is a pleiotropic cytokine participating in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological conditions, including tissue integrity maintenance, cancer progression, autoimmune disease development and, more intriguingly, infectious diseases. Abundant evidence suggests that while IL-17 plays a crucial role in enhancing effective antiviral immune responses, it may also promote and exacerbate virus-induced illnesses. Accumulated experimental and clinical evidence has broadened our understanding of the seemingly paradoxical role of IL-17 in viral infections and suggests that IL-17-targeted immunotherapy may be a promising therapeutic option. Herein, we summarize current knowledge regarding the protective and pathogenic roles of IL-17 in viral infections, with emphasis on underlying mechanisms. The various and critical roles of IL-17 in viral infections necessitate the development of therapeutic strategies that are uniquely tailored to both the infectious agent and the infection environment.","publish_time":"2019-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Wen-Tao; Yao, Xiao-Ting; Peng, Qun; Chen, De-Kun","journal":"Open Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d43461482967a7b000596e2ebbf465b075dd4d1d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6685926.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6685926/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzgzOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Viral infections","viral invasion","pathogenic roles of IL","paradoxical role of IL","critical roles of IL","complex antiviral immune responses","effective antiviral immune responses","proinflammatory antiviral immune responses","host","development of therapeutic strategies","crucial role","clinical evidence","infection environment","infectious agent","Abundant evidence","infectious diseases","autoimmune disease development","promising therapeutic option","tissue integrity maintenance","cancer progression","pathophysiological conditions","mortality","great threat","variety of physiological","substantial human morbidity","targeted immunotherapy","understanding","emphasis","current knowledge","underlying mechanisms","pleiotropic cytokine","replication","significant health burden","virus-induced illnesses","check","Interleukin"],"language":"en"},

Disease-modifying treatments (including immunosuppressive treatments) have shown positive effects on the disease course, but are associated with systemic consequences on the immune system and may increase the risk of infections and alter vaccine efficiency. Therefore, vaccination of MS patients is of major interest. Over the last years, vaccine hesitancy has steadily grown especially in Western countries, partly due to fear of sequelae arising from vaccination, especially neurological disorders. The interaction of vaccination and MS has been discussed for decades. In this review, we highlight the immunology of vaccination, provide a review of literature and discuss the clinical consideration of MS, vaccination and immunosuppression. In conclusion, there is consensus that MS cannot be caused by vaccines, neither by inactivated nor by live vaccines. However, particular attention should be paid to two aspects: First, in immunocompromised patients, live vaccines may lead to a stronger immune reaction with signs of the disease against which the patients have been vaccinated, albeit in weakened form. Second, protection provided by vaccination should be controlled in patients who have been vaccinated while receiving immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive treatment. In conclusion, there is evidence that systemic infections can worsen MS, thus vaccination will lower the risk of relapses by reducing the risk of infections. Therefore, vaccination should be in general recommended to MS patients.","publish_time":"2019-08-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zrzavy, Tobias; Kollaritsch, Herwig; Rommer, Paulus S.; Boxberger, Nina; Loebermann, Micha; Wimmer, Isabella; Winkelmann, Alexander; Zettl, Uwe K.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac03f138574464ac7c9bfbeee803ebcf3db5e26c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6693409.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6693409/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozg0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccination of MS patients","immunology of vaccination","interaction of vaccination","clinical consideration of MS","risk of infections","immunocompromised patients","debilitating disease","disease course","systemic infections","live vaccines","risk of relapses","immunosuppressive treatments","conclusion","immune system","systemic consequences","review of literature","vaccine hesitancy","vaccine efficiency","stronger immune reaction","central nervous systems","positive effects","signs","evidence","fear of sequelae","CNS","aspects","immunosuppression","Western countries","Multiple sclerosis","neurological disorders","years","consensus","particular attention","weakened form","decades","protection"],"language":"en"},

Over the last 15 years, the number of its recognized species has grown from 77 to 106, but knowledge of their interrelationships has not kept pace. Species limits and phylogenetic relationships of this morphologically conservative group remain problematic due both to poor sampling across the Afrotropics and to repeated instances of mitochondrial-nuclear discordance. Recent intensive surveys in East Africa and neighboring regions, coupled with parallel studies by others in West Africa and in Southern Africa, offer a new basis for understanding its evolutionary history. RESULTS: We investigated phylogenetic relationships and intraspecific genetic variation in the Afro-Palearctic clade of Rhinolophidae using broad sampling. We sequenced mitochondrial cytochrome-b (1140 bp) and four independent and informative nuclear introns (2611 bp) for 213 individuals and incorporated sequence data from 210 additional individuals on GenBank that together represent 24 of the 33 currently recognized Afrotropical Rhinolophus species. We addressed the widespread occurrence of mito-nuclear discordance in Rhinolophus by inferring concatenated and species tree phylogenies using only the nuclear data. Well resolved mitochondrial, concatenated nuclear, and species trees revealed phylogenetic relationships and population structure of the Afrotropical species and species groups. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple well-supported and deeply divergent lineages were resolved in each of the six African Rhinolophus species groups analyzed, suggesting as many as 12 undescribed cryptic species; these include several instances of sympatry among close relatives. Coalescent lineage delimitation offered support for new undescribed lineages in four of the six African groups in this study. On the other hand, two to five currently recognized species may be invalid based on combined mitochondrial and/or nuclear phylogenetic analyses. Validation of these cryptic lineages as species and formal relegation of current names to synonymy will require integrative taxonomic assessments involving morphology, ecology, acoustics, distribution, and behavior. The resulting phylogenetic framework offers a powerful basis for addressing questions regarding their ecology and evolution.

Using real-time multiplex PCR and antigen detection, Streptococcus pneumoniae was the main agent identified in 76% of the cases by molecular tests and BinaxNOW\u00AE in pleural fluid. A total of 8% of pleural fluid samples remained undiagnosed. In nasopharyngeal aspirates, rhinovirus, parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus were detected in both CAP and CAP \u002B PPE populations; however, the percentage of viral co-detection was significantly higher in nasopharyngeal aspirates from CAP \u002B PPE patients (35%) compared with CAP patients (5%). In conclusion, viral co-detection was observed mainly in patients with more severe pneumonia. Molecular biology assays improved the pathogens detection in pneumonia and confirmed the S. pneumoniae detection by BinaxNOW\u00AE in pleural effusion samples.

This project aimed at improving adherence to lung cancer guidelines at our institution. METHOD: The records of patients with lung cancer were evaluated for adherence to guidelines by using an auditing tool that was developed to capture pertinent information. The study team collected data about the following variables: compliance with documentation of pathological diagnosis, documentation of disease stage prior to treatment initiation, presentation at thoracic tumour board within 30 days of diagnosis, management course, and management of end of life in terms of early \u2018no code\u2019 initiation, stopping chemotherapy and referral to palliative care prior to 2 weeks of death. Annual audits were performed from 2012 to 2015. Education and discussion with team members to address the deviations were the main interventions to improve adherence. RESULTS: The baseline measurements were taken in 2012 (49 patients). Histological subtype identification improved from 94% to 100%. Presentation of new cases at the tumour board improved from 35% to 82%. Testing for epidermal growth factor receptor mutation for non-squamous cell lung cancer improved from 77% to 100%.

However, the efficacy is hampered by the fast clearance of activated macrophage from the blood circulation system. In this study, glycyrrhizin (GL) was introduced into alginate (ALG) nanogel particles (NGPs) to construct multifunctional delivery vehicle to decrease the fast clearance of activated macrophage and enhance the anticancer efficacy with the combination therapy of GL and doxorubicin (DOX). Methods: We firstly synthesized the GL-ALG NGPs with intermolecular hydrogen bond and ionic bond as the multifunctional delivery vehicle. The immune response and phagocytosis of macrophage on GL-ALG NGPs were investigated on RAW 264.7 macrophages. The pharmacokinetic study of DOX loaded in GL-ALG NGPs was performed in rats. The active targeting effects of GL-ALG NGPs were further studied on hepatocellular carcinoma cell (HepG2) and H22 tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, the anticancer molecular mechanism of DOX/GL-ALG NGPs was investigated on HepG2 cells in vitro and tumor-bearing mice in vivo. Results: GL-ALG NGPs could not only avoid triggering the immuno-inflammatory responses of macrophages but also decreasing the phagocytosis of macrophage. The bioavailability of DOX was increased about 13.2 times by DOX/GL-ALG NGPs than free DOX in blood. The mice with normal immune functions used in constructing the tumor-bearing mice instead of the nude mouse also indicated the good biocompatibility of NGPs. GL-mediated ALG NGPs exhibited excellent hepatocellular carcinoma targeting effect in vitro and in vivo. The results suggested that the anticancer molecular mechanism of the combination therapy of glycyrrhizin and doxorubicin in ALG NGPs was performed via regulating apoptosis pathway of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 activity, which was also verified in H22 tumor-bearing mice. Conclusion: DOX/GL-ALG NGPs could attenuate the activation of macrophage and enhance the therapeutic efficacy for hepatocellular carcinoma.

FasL signaling plays a critical role in models of acute lung injury, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and silicosis; blockade of Fas\u2010FasL interactions either prevents or attenuates pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis.

The use of combination antifungal therapy in cases with a severe clinical course is increasing, although information on the efficacy and safety of this approach is limited. METHODS: We present a case series of 13 children affected by hemato-oncological disorders who received combination antifungal therapy for invasive mold infections at our center (Pediatric Hematology, San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy) from 2011 to 2016, with the aim of describing their clinical characteristics, types of infections, treatment regimens, clinical outcomes, and treatment safety. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed in order to describe patients\u0027 characteristics. RESULTS: Combination antifungal therapy included liposomal amphotericin associated with caspofungin (5/13, 38.4%), voriconazole (5/13, 38.4%), or posaconazole (3/13, 23.1%). The 12-week treatment response rate was 69.2% (6/13 patients showed complete response, 3/13 partial response). The crude mortality was 30.7% (4/13): half was related to invasive mold infections (2/13, 15.38%) and half to disease progression (2/13, 15.38%). Overall, treatment was well tolerated, and we did not observe any permanent discontinuation of antifungals due to related side effects. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, combination antifungal therapy seems to be a safe option in immunocompromised children with invasive mold infections. Well-designed studies are needed to confirm the safety of this approach and to better understand its efficacy in the pediatric setting.","publish_time":"2019-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peri, Anna Maria; Verna, Marta; Biffi, Stefano; Alagna, Laura; Longhi, Benedetta; Migliorino, Guglielmo Marco; Foresti, Sergio; Bandera, Alessandra; Rovelli, Attilio; Rizzari, Carmelo; Gori, Andrea; Colombini, Antonella","journal":"Pathog Immun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5688f38645b50f19f5b36727b64e89bf73ad453c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6742350.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6742350/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzkwNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Invasive mold infections","treatment safety","use of combination antifungal therapy","types of infections","clinical characteristics","treatment regimens","week treatment response rate","immunocompromised children","clinical outcomes","complete response","partial response","efficacy","half","approach","severe clinical course","Pediatric Hematology","pediatric setting","patients\u0027 characteristics","crude mortality","high mortality rates","center","cases","hematological malignancies","San Gerardo Hospital","safe option","hemato-oncological disorders","liposomal amphotericin","Monza","Italy","information","experience","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","case series","permanent discontinuation of antifungals","caspofungin","Medical records","METHODS","disease progression","effects","CONCLUSIONS","aim","Well-designed studies","voriconazole","posaconazole"],"language":"en"},

However, previous reports suggest a reduced efficacy of ethanol disinfection against pathogens in mucus. We aimed to elucidate the situations and mechanisms underlying the reduced efficacy of EBDs against IAV in infectious mucus. We evaluated IAV inactivation and ethanol concentration change using IAV-infected patients\u2019 mucus (sputum). Additionally, AHR and AHW effectiveness against infectious mucus adhering to the hands and fingers was evaluated in 10 volunteers. Our clinical study showed that EBD effectiveness against IAV in mucus was extremely reduced compared to IAV in saline. IAV in mucus remained active despite 120 s of AHR; however, IAV in saline was completely inactivated within 30 s. Due to the low rate of diffusion/convection because of the physical properties of mucus as a hydrogel, the time required for the ethanol concentration to reach an IAV inactivation level and thus for EBDs to completely inactivate IAV was approximately eight times longer in mucus than in saline. On the other hand, AHR inactivated IAV in mucus within 30 s when the mucus dried completely because the hydrogel characteristics were lost. Additionally, AHW rapidly inactivated IAV. Until infectious mucus has completely dried, infectious IAV can remain on the hands and fingers, even after appropriate AHR using EBD, thereby increasing the risk of IAV transmission. We clarified the ineffectiveness of EBD use against IAV in infectious mucus. IMPORTANCE Antiseptic hand rubbing (AHR) and antiseptic hand washing (AHW) are important to prevent the spread of influenza A virus (IAV). This study elucidated the situations/mechanisms underlying the reduced efficacy of AHR against infectious mucus derived from IAV-infected individuals and indicated the weaknesses of the current hand hygiene regimens. Due to the low rate of diffusion/convection because of the physical properties of mucus as a hydrogel, the efficacy of AHR using ethanol-based disinfectant against mucus is greatly reduced until infectious mucus adhering to the hands/fingers has completely dried. If there is insufficient time before treating the next patient (i.e., if the infectious mucus is not completely dry), medical staff should be aware that effectiveness of AHR is reduced. Since AHW is effective against both dry and nondry infectious mucus, AHW should be adopted to compensate for these weaknesses of AHR.","publish_time":"2019-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hirose, Ryohei; Nakaya, Takaaki; Naito, Yuji; Daidoji, Tomo; Bandou, Risa; Inoue, Ken; Dohi, Osamu; Yoshida, Naohisa; Konishi, Hideyuki; Itoh, Yoshito","journal":"mSphere","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1dd7096290bcbcc5aa830706c5396155ef51bd39.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6751490.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6751490/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzkxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AHR","AHW","IAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious IAV","AHR inactivated IAV","IAV-infected patients\u2019 mucus","nondry infectious mucus","physical properties of mucus","IAV-infected individuals","reduced efficacy of AHR","IAV inactivation level","effectiveness of AHR","risk of IAV transmission","weaknesses of AHR","appropriate AHR","AHW effectiveness","reduced efficacy of EBDs","antiseptic hand washing","reduced efficacy of ethanol disinfection","IMPORTANCE Antiseptic hand rubbing","EBD effectiveness","hands","fingers","saline","ethanol concentration change","ethanol-based disinfectants","current hand hygiene regimens","convection","mechanisms","virus","low rate of diffusion","situations","hydrogel characteristics","ineffectiveness of EBD use","seasonal influenza","spread of influenza","clinical study","insufficient time","important means of infection control","pathogens","medical staff","sputum","previous reports","outbreaks","times","volunteers"],"language":"en"},

Cases will be defined based on an individual\u2019s first positive influenza test during the season, and potential controls will be defined based on an individual\u2019s first negative influenza test during the season. One control for each case will be randomly selected based on the week the specimen was collected. We will estimate VE using multivariable logistic regression.

Antiviral drugs able to completely suppress virus replication are indeed available but they are, by and large, unable to eradicate the virus. Several alternative new treatment approaches are currently being developed but none have so far captured the interest of clinicians for possible clinical development. A constant feature of chronic HBV infection is T-cell exhaustion resulting from persistent exposure to high antigen concentrations as shown by the high expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) by HBV-specific CD8 T cells. One way of tackling this problem is to develop HBV-specific neutralizing antibodies that would clear excess envelope proteins from the circulation, allowing for nucleos(t)ide analogs or other antiviral drugs now in preclinical and early clinical development to take advantage of a reconstituted adaptive immunity. Several fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have been developed from HBV-vaccinated and subjects convalescent from acute hepatitis B that show different properties and specificities. It is envisaged that such neutralizing mAb may be used as adjuvant treatment to reduce viral protein load, thus rescuing adaptive immunity in an effort to optimize the effect of antiviral drugs.","publish_time":"2019-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cerino, Antonella; Mantovani, Stefania; Mele, Dalila; Oliviero, Barbara; Varchetta, Stefania; Mondelli, Mario U.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11bf75e973011d86b1039b707ed086b98deb5642.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6773823.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6773823/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzkyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HBV-specific neutralizing antibodies","HBV-specific CD8 T cells","hepatitis B virus","Antiviral drugs able","effect of antiviral drugs","T-cell exhaustion","sterilizing immunity","constant feature of chronic HBV infection","reconstituted adaptive immunity","virus replication","neutralizing mAb","acute hepatitis B","early clinical development","possible clinical development","high expression of programmed cell death protein","adjuvant treatment","high antigen concentrations","viral protein load","chronic liver disease","human monoclonal antibodies","alternative new treatment approaches","persistent exposure","advantage","effective prophylactic vaccine","circulation","excess envelope proteins","different properties","subjects convalescent","PD","ide analogs","nucleos","effort","cirrhosis","availability","specificities","clinicians","problem","hepatocellular carcinoma","individuals","way"],"language":"en"},

Clinical signs occurred shortly after birth or started at an age of under 4 weeks and included apathy, dysphoric vocalization, hypermetric ataxia, intension tremor, head tilt, circling, proprioceptive deficits, seizures and ventral strabismus consistent with a diffuse intracranial lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a diffuse white matter disease without mass effect. Macroscopically, the cerebral white matter showed a gelatinous texture in the centrum semiovale. A mild hydrocephalus internus was noted. Histopathologically, a severe multifocal reduction of myelin formation and moderate diffuse edema without inflammation was detected leading to the diagnosis of leukodystrophy. Combined linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping in two related families delineated critical intervals of approximately 29 Mb. The comparison of whole genome sequence data of one affected Standard Schnauzer to 221 control genomes revealed a single private homozygous protein changing variant in the critical intervals, TSEN54:c.371G\u003EA or p.(Gly124Asp). TSEN54 encodes the tRNA splicing endonuclease subunit 54. In humans, several variants in TSEN54 were reported to cause different types of pontocerebellar hypoplasia. The genotypes at the c.371G\u003EA variant were perfectly associated with the leukodystrophy phenotype in 12 affected Standard Schnauzers and almost 1000 control dogs from different breeds. These results suggest that TSEN54:c.371G\u003EA causes the leukodystrophy. The identification of a candidate causative variant enables genetic testing so that the unintentional breeding of affected Standard Schnauzers can be avoided in the future.

Glass wool filtration is a cost-effective method for concentrating several waterborne pathogens of bovine origin simultaneously, although recovery may be low for some specific taxa such as bovine viral diarrhea virus 1.","publish_time":"2014-07-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abd-Elmaksoud, Sherif; Spencer, Susan K.; Gerba, Charles P.; Tamimi, Akrum H.; Jokela, William E.; Borchardt, Mark A.","journal":"Food Environ Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f92be2aecf981993b29cd04b3e25a6fdef1ed4d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091103.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12560-014-9159-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25059211/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sabin III"],"organizations":["NTU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bovine coronavirus","bacteria of bovine origin","Mean recovery efficiencies","bovine viral diarrhea virus types","waterborne pathogens of bovine origin","bovine rotavirus group","Glass wool filtration","effectiveness of glass wool filters","pH","pathogen types","Campylobacter jejuni","lowest turbidity levels","different turbidity levels","test organisms","given pathogen type turbidity","livestock pathogens","enteric viruses","liters of dechlorinated tap water","flow rate","sample flow","poliovirus Sabin","peristaltic pump","toxigenic Escherichia coli","cost-effective method","specific taxa","manured agricultural fields","Analysis of Variance","beef extract-glycine buffer","Infiltration","runoff","groundwater","surface waters","bootstrapping techniques","direction","qPCR","NTU","culture"],"language":"en"},

Interleukin (IL)-6 acts as a mediator between pro- and anti-inflammatory reactivity by initiating trans- and classical-signaling, respectively. Hence, IL-6 is assumed to provide a target for a broad range of antiviral agents. Available immunosuppressive antivirals are directed to control an often exaggerated pro-inflammatory response that gives rise to complex clinical conditions such as lymphocytopenia. It is known that IL-6, via its soluble receptor (sIL-6R), initiates a pro-inflammatory response while an anti-inflammatory response is triggered by the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (IL-6R). Future antivirals should thus aim to target the mechanism that regulates switching between IL-6 trans- and classical-signaling. In this review, we propose that the tumour necrosis factor-\u03B1 converting enzyme ADAM-17 could be the master molecule involved in regulating IL-6 class switching and through this in controlling pro- and anti-inflammatory responses to viral antigenic stimuli. Therefore, ADAM-17 should be considered as a potential target molecule for novel antiviral drug discovery that would regulate host reactivity to infection and thereby limit or prevent fatal outcomes.","publish_time":"2019-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mahmud-Al-Rafat, Abdullah; Majumder, Apurba; Taufiqur Rahman, K.

The airborne carrier for the COVID-19 can be tiny droplets and particulates from infected person, fine suspended mists (humidity) in air, or ambient aerosols in air. To-date, unfortunately there are no test standards for nano-aerosols (\u2264100 nm). A goal in our study is to develop air filters (e.g. respirator, facemask, ventilator, medical breathing filter/system) with 90% capture on 100-nm airborne COVID-19 with pressure drop of less than 30 Pa (3.1 mm water). There are two challenges. First, this airborne bio-nanoaerosol (combined virus and carrier) is amorphous unlike cubic NaCl crystals. Second, unlike standard laboratory tests on NaCl and test oil (DOP) droplets, these polydispersed aerosols all challenge the filter simultaneously and they are of different sizes and can interact among themselves complicating the filtration process. For the first time, we have studied these two effects using ambient aerosols (simulating the bio-nanoaerosols of coronavirus plus carrier of different shapes and sizes) to challenge electrostatically charged multilayer/multimodule nanofiber filters. This problem is fundamentally complicated due to mechanical and electrostatic interactions among aerosols of different sizes with induced charges of different magnitudes. The test filters were arranged in 2, 4, and 6 multiple-modules stack-up with each module having 0.765 g/m(2) of charged PVDF nanofibers (mean diameter 525 \u00B1 191 nm). This configuration minimized electrical interference among neighboring charged nanofibers and reduced flow resistance in the filter. For ambient aerosol size\u003E80 nm (applicable to the smallest COVID-19), the electrostatic effect contributes 100\u2013180% more efficiency to the existing mechanical efficiency (due to diffusion and interception) depending on the number of modules in the filter. By stacking-up modules to increase fiber basis weight in the filter, a 6-layer charged nanofiber filter achieved 88%, 88% and 96% filtration efficiency for, respectively, 55-nm, 100-nm and 300-nm ambient aerosol. This is very close to attaining our set goal of 90%-efficiency on the 100-nm ambient aerosol. The pressure drop for the 6-layer nanofiber filter was only 26 Pa (2.65 mm water column) which was below our limit of 30 Pa (3.1 mm water). For the test multi-module filters, a high \u2018quality factor\u2019 (efficiency-to-pressure-drop ratio) of about 0.1 to 0.13 Pa(\u22121) can be consistently maintained, which was far better than conventional filters. Using the same PVDF 6-layer charged nanofiber filter, laboratory tests results using monodispersed NaCl aerosols of 50, 100, and 300 nm yielded filtration efficiency, respectively, 92%, 94% and 98% (qualified for \u0027N98 standard\u0027) with same pressure drop of 26 Pa. The 2\u20136% discrepancy in efficiency for the NaCl aerosols was primarily attributed to the absence of interaction among aerosols of different sizes using monodispersed NaCl aerosols in the laboratory. This discrepancy can be further reduced with increasing number of modules in the filter and for larger 300-nm aerosol. The 6-layer charged nanofiber filter was qualified as a \u0027N98 respirator\u0027 (98% capture efficiency for 300-nm NaCl aerosols) but with pressure drop of only 2.65-mm water which was 1/10 below conventional N95 with 25-mm (exhaling) to 35-mm (inhaling) water column! The 6-layer charged PVDF nanofiber filter provides good personal protection against airborne COVID-19 virus and nano-aerosols from pollution based on the N98 standard, yet it is at least 10X more breathable than a conventional N95 respirator.","publish_time":"2020-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leung, Wallace Woon-Fong; Sun, Qiangqiang","journal":"Sep Purif Technol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/85d302e1bc154a763980d7c906679313f412185c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194611.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1383586620313617; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116887; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32372877/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383586620313617","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs1MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nm NaCl aerosols","ambient aerosols","nm aerosol","layer nanofiber filter","nm airborne COVID","nm ambient aerosol","aerosols of different sizes","PVDF nanofiber filter","nano-aerosols","monodispersed NaCl aerosols","polydispersed aerosols","filtration efficiency","capture efficiency","pressure","test filters","medical breathing filter","air filters","multimodule nanofiber filters","charged PVDF nanofibers","conventional filters","existing mechanical efficiency","ambient aerosol size","airborne carrier","water column","neighboring charged nanofibers","carrier of different shapes","smallest COVID","test multi-module filters","N98 respirator","N98 standard","standard laboratory tests","cubic NaCl crystals","conventional N95 respirator","test oil","test standards","airborne bio-nanoaerosol","increasing number of modules","laboratory tests results","induced charges of different magnitudes","multiple-modules stack","discrepancy","filtration process","combined virus","tiny droplets","bio-nanoaerosols","electrostatic interactions","average size","novel coronavirus","electrostatic effect","set goal","breath of infected persons","reduced flow resistance","good personal protection","facemask","fine suspended mists","particulates","humidity","ventilator","DOP","electrical interference","speech","system","pollution","mean diameter","quality factor","fiber basis weight","sneeze","configuration","cough","diffusion","absence of interaction","interception","study","problem","stacking","limit","inhaling","effects","exhaling","date","challenges","time"],"language":"en"},

Results Daily inactivation rate constants differ by several orders of magnitude: on inanimate surfaces and in aerosols daily inactivation rates are in the order of 1\u2013102, on hands in the order of 103. Influenza virus can survive in aerosols for several hours, on hands for a few minutes. Nasal infectious dose of influenza A is several orders of magnitude larger than airborne infectious dose. Conclusions The airborne route is a potentially important transmission pathway for influenza in indoor environments. The importance of droplet transmission has to be reassessed. Contact transmission can be limited by fast inactivation of influenza virus on hands and is more so than airborne transmission dependent on behavioral parameters. However, the potentially large inocula deposited in the environment through sneezing and the protective effect of nasal mucus on virus survival could make contact transmission a key transmission mode.","publish_time":"2008-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weber, Thomas P.; Stilianakis, Nikolaos I.","journal":"Journal of Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/421a78ff03281110dff0fc7f41aeac1a9cf94950.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112701.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445308002922; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2008.08.013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445308002922; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18848358/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["contact transmission of influenza","transmission modes","airborne transmission dependent","environmental inactivation of influenza","fast inactivation of influenza virus","importance of droplet transmission","inactivation of viruses","Nasal infectious dose of influenza","airborne infectious dose","important transmission pathway","key transmission mode","hands","airborne route","virus survival","aerosols daily inactivation rates","relative importance of airborne","Daily inactivation rate constants","results","orders of magnitude larger","available information","different environmental media","protective effect of nasal mucus","inanimate surfaces","mathematical models","sneezing","indoor environments","efficiency of control measures","Summary Objectives","factors","behavioral parameters","hours","large inocula","Methods","minutes","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Diarrheal fecal samples were collected from 951 young calves (\u003C3 months) on 425 farms. Cryptosporidium prevalence was assessed by PCR and ELISA, and molecular characterization was performed by targeting the 18S rRNA, heat-shock protein 70 (hsp70), and glycoprotein 60 (gp60) genes. Data were analyzed according to the sex, type of cattle, region, season, and type of diarrhea. PCR analysis revealed Cryptosporidium spp. in 9.9% (94/951) of diarrheal fecal samples. C. parvum and C. bovis/ryanae were present in 6.1% (58/951) and 4.1% (39/951) of diarrheal fecal samples, respectively. In addition, ELISA showed positive results for C. parvum in 9.7% (92/951) samples. Statistical analysis of the PCR and ELISA results revealed a lower prevalence of C. parvum in the hemorrhagic diarrheal samples (P \u003C 0.05). For C. bovis/ryanae, seasonality and high prevalence in hemorrhagic diarrhea were observed (P \u003C 0.05). Of the 951 samples tested for C. parvum, 903 samples showed agreement with a \u03BA value of 0.65, indicating good agreement between the two tests. Although C. bovis and C. ryanae share highly similar 18S rRNA sequences, PCR based on hsp70 successfully distinguished C. bovis from C. ryanae. Sequence analysis of gp60 revealed that C. parvum belonged to the IIa families and was further subtyped as IIaA18G3R1 and IIaA16G3R1, which have not been previously reported in Asia. These findings indicate that Cryptosporidium spp. play an important role in diarrhea in young calves in Korea. Considering the zoonotic significance of C. parvum IIa subtype and dense rearing system of cattle in Korea, prevention and continuous monitoring of Cryptosporidium are required.","publish_time":"2016-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Seung-Hun; VanBik, Dorene; Kim, Ha-Young; Lee, Yu-Ran; Kim, Jong Wan; Chae, Myeongju; Oh, Sang-Ik; Goo, Youn-Kyoung; Kwon, Oh-Deog; Kwak, Dongmi","journal":"Vet Parasitol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8143c624d28df7b1014cbfc211109f0a0fbb5688.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185498.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2016.09.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401716303934; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401716303934; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27809984/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":["Asia","Korea"],"keyphrases":["Diarrheal fecal samples","hemorrhagic diarrheal samples","Cryptosporidium prevalence","PCR analysis","ryanae","bovis","molecular analysis of Cryptosporidium","parvum IIa subtype","Korea","diarrheal feces of calves","ELISA results","high prevalence","young calves","lower prevalence of","type of diarrhea","Statistical analysis","continuous monitoring of Cryptosporidium","Sequence analysis of gp60","type of cattle","hsp70","S rRNA sequences","positive results","IIa families","good agreement","molecular characterization","dense rearing system of cattle","prevention","seasonality","region","heat-shock protein","important role","\u03BA value","sex","zoonotic significance of","glycoprotein","months","addition","IIaA18G3R1","genes","tests","IIaA16G3R1","farms","Data","findings","Asia"],"language":"en"},

We wished to determine if respiratory viral infection of children in the community was associated with hospital admissions of patients with exacerbations of COPD. Methods We collected data over a 45-month period from the Northern Ireland Regional Virus Laboratory and from a general hospital in the same locality. We studied the relationship between upper respiratory infections in children and COPD admissions. We also examined the role of school holidays. Results Correlations were seen between the frequency of all viral infections in children and the number of adult COPD hospitalizations ( P \u003C 0.0 0 5 ) . Subgroup analysis showed distinct relationships with epidemics of; influenza A ( P \u003C 0.0 0 1 ) , influenza B ( P \u003C 0.0 5 ) , adenovirus ( P = 0.0 5 ) , respiratory syncytial virus ( P \u003C 0.0 0 5 ) and hospital admissions of patients with COPD. There were significantly fewer COPD admissions in the week after the start of a school holiday period ( P \u003C 0.0 5 ) . Conclusions When children are hospitalized with viral respiratory infection there is an associated rise in adult COPD admissions. This suggests exacerbations of COPD are associated with epidemics of respiratory viruses. When children are on school holidays there is a reduction in COPD admissions in the community. This provides further support for respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of COPD exacerbations.","publish_time":"2006-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"McManus, T. E.; Coyle, P. V.; Kidney, J.

They have been shown to be produced and released by many different types of healthy and diseased cells. Exosomes are secreted by all types of cells in culture, and are also found in various body fluids including blood, saliva, urine, and breast milk. Exosomes are essential for healthy physiological as well as pathological processes. In addition to their normal function, exosomes are involved in the development and progression of various diseases, potentiating cellular stress and damage. Pathogens take advantage of exosome release from infected host cells by manipulating host-derived exosomes to evade the immune system responses. Exosomes are involved in other pathological conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases, liver diseases, heart failure, cancer, diabetes, kidney diseases, osteoporosis and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Hence, we can exploit exosomes as biomarkers and vaccines and modify them rationally for therapeutic interventions including tissue engineering. Further studies on exosomes will explore their potential and provide new methodology for effective clinical diagnostics and therapeutic strategies: such uses can be called exosome theragnostics.

Yet globally, ISGs as a class have broad functions and impede both pathogenesis and viral replication. Therefore, highly successful respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV and Influenza A virus (IAV), likely attempt to short-circuit global ISG induction, potentially through diverse mechanisms. Methods In this work, global RNA (microarray) and proteomics data (mass spectrometry) are utilized to compare and contrast ISG control strategies employed by IAV H5N1, H1N1 2009, and SARS-CoV. Calu-3 cells, a human lung epithelial cell line, are treated with type I IFN to define a consensus list of IFN responsive genes. These genes are then examined in the context of virus infections to evaluate the global ISG response. Results SARS-CoV and IAV H5N1 utilize contrasting approaches to interfere with the global host ISG response. Whereas IAV H5N1 actively manipulates the ISG response with up and down regulation of ISG transcripts, SARS-CoV successfully limits ISG induction until late times during infection. Global proteomic analysis confirms the absence of ISG proteins following H5N1 infection; in contrast, SARS-CoV induces increased abundance of several ISG proteins, but not until after peak viral titers have been achieved. Together, the data illustrate that these two virulent respiratory viruses control the global ISG response. Further examination reveals ISG manipulation is absent in a less virulent IAV strain. H1N1 2009 infection results in robust ISG transcript expression with minimal down regulation. Similarly, proteomics analysis finds increased abundance of ISG proteins absent in H5N1 infection. Transcriptional factor analysis found no direct antagonism; however, truncation of the C-terminal portion of NS1 ablated ISG down regulation in H5N1 infections. Meta-analysis finds a similar ablation is observed in A549 cells infected H1N1 1918 when NS1 is manipulated. Together, the data strongly implicate a role for NS1 in mediating control of the entire global ISG response following virulent IAV infections. For SARS-CoV, the delayed ISG induction is maintained in both mutant and precursor viruses. DORF6, a SARS-CoV mutant lacking a major IFN antagonist, fails to induce ISG induction any earlier. Similarly, Bat-SRBD, a synthetic precursor virus, maintains the ability control the global ISG response, suggesting this trait is maintained in pre-cursors of the epidemic SARS-CoV. Additional work examines the ability of the SARS-CoV to camouflage its viral intermediates as well as replication within double membrane vesicles as mechanisms mediating delayed ISG induction. Conclusion Together, the work highlights the contrasting approaches used by SARS-CoV and IAV strains to limit global ISG induction. In addition, the results imply an important role for controlling ISG response in the context of virulent respiratory virus infection. Further examination of these results will likely produce novel approaches to treat important respiratory virus infection.","publish_time":"2012-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Menachery, V. D.; Sims, A.

Major advances have been made primarily by the availability of rapid diagnostic tests and the introduction of potent antiviral compounds into clinical practice.","publish_time":"2012-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Busca, A","journal":"Leukemia Supplements","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e535982343bc90908be661c5c85bfef873c3a162.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4851196.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27175238/; https://www.nature.com/articles/leusup201215.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1038/leusup.2012.15","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Viral infections","respiratory viruses","herpes viruses","Epstein-Barr virus","hepatitis B virus","reactivation of latent infection","acquisition of new infection","introduction of potent antiviral compounds","high morbidity","cytomegalovirus","availability of rapid diagnostic tests","clinical practice","frequent complications","patients","hematological malignancies","mortality","immunocompromised host","allogeneic stem cell transplantation","Major advances"],"language":"en"},

These bacterial infections are extremely severe conditions due to the production of necrotizing toxins. Histological findings are distinctive, showing extensive hemorrhagic necrosis, widespread layers of bacteria, and very few or no inflammatory cell components. These dramatic infections are extremely rare, occuring with no apparent underlying disease, both in immunodeficient and immunocompetent patients. The main differential diagnosis is a viral infection, difficult to diagnose on histological examination alone.

Elderly adults experience the most severe morbidity from influenza-associated diseases, and have the highest rates of seasonal migration within the U.S. compared to other subpopulations. The objective of this study is to assess spatiotemporal patterns in influenza-associated hospitalizations in the elderly, by time, geography, and intensity of P\u0026I. Given the high seasonal migration of individuals to Florida, this state was examined more closely using harmonic regression to assess spatial and temporal patterns of P\u0026I hospitalizations by state of residence. METHODS: Data containing all Medicare-eligible hospitalizations in the United States for 1991-2006 with P\u0026I (ICD-9-CM codes 480-487) were abstracted for the 65\u002B population. Hospitalizations were classified by state of residence, provider state, and date of admissions, specifically comparing those admitted between October and March to those admitted between April and September. We then compared the hospitalization profile data of Florida residents with that of out-of-state residents by state of primary residence and time of year (in-season or out-of-season). RESULTS: We observed distinct seasonal patterns of nonresident P\u0026I hospitalizations, especially comparing typical winter destination states, such as California, Arizona, Texas, and Florida, to other states. Although most other states generally experienced a higher proportion of non-resident P\u0026I during the summer months (April-September), these states had higher nonresident P\u0026I during the traditional peak influenza season (October-March). CONCLUSIONS: This study is among the first to quantify spatiotemporal P\u0026I hospitalization patterns in the elderly, focusing on the change of patterns that are possibly due to seasonal population migration. Understanding migration and influenza-associated disease patterns in this vulnerable population is critical to prepare for and potentially prevent influenza outbreaks in this vulnerable population.","publish_time":"2011-06-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chui, Kenneth KH; Cohen, Steven A; Naumova, Elena N","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b514652703a631715ca85e65499c66016fb994d4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3128025.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-11-444; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21649919/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs4MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["U.S.","United States","Arizona"],"keyphrases":["temporal patterns of P","influenza-associated hospitalizations","intensity of P","distinct seasonal patterns of nonresident P","influenza-associated disease patterns","hospitalization patterns","spatiotemporal patterns","state of residence","higher nonresident P","United States","seasonal population migration","change of patterns","influenza outbreaks","influenza-associated diseases","state of primary residence","provider state","higher proportion of non-resident P","vulnerable population","traditional peak influenza season","high seasonal migration of individuals","highest rates of seasonal migration","Medicare-eligible hospitalizations","typical winter destination states","hospitalization profile data of Florida residents","Elderly adults","study","out-of-state residents","time of year","severe morbidity","surveillance","California","prevention","pneumonia","advances","harmonic regression","Arizona","geography","leading causes of mortality","date of admissions","Texas","RESULTS","summer months","BACKGROUND","METHODS","ICD","codes","CONCLUSIONS","objective","subpopulations"],"language":"en"},

The gut microbiome has a profound impact on gastrointestinal tract development, maintenance of mucosal surface integrity, and contributes to the nutritional status of the host and thus plays a pivotal role in health and disease. New technologies have enabled the detailed characterization of normal microbial symbionts and dysbiosis\u2013disease associations. This review summarizes the stepwise establishment of the intestinal microbiota, influential environmental factors, and how this may be perturbed in preterm very-low-birth-weight infants. The contribution of the microbiota to provision of energy and nutrients for intestinal development and the nutritional status of the host are reviewed. In addition, the crucial role of the gut microbiota in maintaining mucosal integrity is explored along with how its breakdown can lead to sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

The distinction between exhaled breaths of infected and healthy individuals should facilitate an understanding of the airborne transmission of infections.

A setup composed of a modified hood connected to an electrical low pressure impactor, which allows for the study of a wide range of particle sizes (from 7 nm to 10 \u03BCm), has been developed in order to collect exhaled breaths. This setup has been used with seventy eight volunteers. The results obtained using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that exhaled breaths of individuals without symptoms have statistical similarities and are different from those of individuals with symptoms.

The expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and the production of prostaglandin E2 were also measured. Relative to control, exposure to MFS was associated with lower Poly(I:C)-induced mRNA expression of various cytokines and chemokines, and lower COX-2 production. The MFS inhibited the production of some cytokines (IL-1\u03B1, IL-1\u03B2, TNF\u03B1, and IL-6), chemokines (CCL5, CCL22, CXCL1, CXCL5 and CXCL8) and prostaglandin E2 but did not alter the production of IL-12/25, CCL2 and CCL20.

Various studies have investigated bat viruses in tropical regions, but to date there are no data regarding viruses with zoonotic potential that circulate in bat and rat populations in Viet Nam. To address this paucity of data, we sampled three bat farms and three wet markets trading in rat meat in the Mekong Delta region of southern Viet Nam. Faecal and urine samples were screened for the presence of RNA from paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses and filoviruses. Paramyxovirus RNA was detected in 4 of 248 (1%) and 11 of 222 (4.9%) bat faecal and urine samples, respectively. Coronavirus RNA was detected in 55 of 248 (22%) of bat faecal samples; filovirus RNA was not detected in any of the bat samples. Further, coronavirus RNA was detected in 12 of 270 (4.4%) of rat faecal samples; all samples tested negative for paramyxovirus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the bat paramyxoviruses and bat and rat coronaviruses were related to viruses circulating in bat and rodent populations globally, but showed no cross\u2010species mixing of viruses between bat and rat populations within Viet Nam. Our study shows that potentially novel variants of paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses commonly circulate in bat and rat populations in Viet Nam. Further characterization of the viruses and additional human and animal surveillance is required to evaluate the likelihood of viral spillover and to assess whether these viruses pose a risk to human health.","publish_time":"2017-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berto, A.; Anh, P.

Meteorological parameters are among the crucial factors affecting infectious diseases. The present study examines the correlation between weather and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by considering nine cities in Turkey. In this regard, temperature (\u00B0C), dew point (\u00B0C), humidity (%), and wind speed (mph) are considered as parameters of weather. Research states that the incubation period of COVID-19 varies from 1 day to 14 days. Therefore, the effects of each parameter within 1, 3, 7, and 14 days are examined. In addition, the population is included as an effective parameter for evaluation. The analyses are conducted based on Spearman\u0027s correlation coefficients. The results showed that the highest correlations were observed for population, wind speed 14 days ago, and temperature on the day, respectively.

A total of 75 (41.2%) of these patients had positive viral infection. MERS-CoV was not detected in any of the samples. Human rhinovirus (hRV) was the most detected pathogen (40.9%) followed by non-MERS-CoV human coronaviruses (19.3%), influenza (Flu) viruses (15.9%), and human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) (13.6%). Viruses differed markedly depending on age in which hRV, Flu A, and hCoV-OC43 were more prevalent in adults and RSV, hCoV-HKU1, and hCoV-NL63 were mostly restricted to children under the age of 15. Moreover, coinfection was not uncommon in this study, in which 17.3% of the infected patients had dual infections due to several combinations of viruses. Dual infections decreased with age and completely disappeared in people older than 45 years. Our study confirms that MERS-CoV is not common in the southwestern region of Saudi Arabia and shows high diversity and prevalence of other common respiratory viruses. This study also highlights the importance and contribution of enhanced surveillance systems for better infection control.","publish_time":"2017-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abdulhaq, Ahmed A.; Basode, Vinod Kumar; Hashem, Anwar M.; Alshrari, Ahmed S.; Badroon, Nassrin A.; Hassan, Ahmed M.; Alsubhi, Tagreed L.; Solan, Yahia; Ejeeli, Saleh; Azhar, Esam I.","journal":"Adv Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97ab5bad794553f1af287d9ee88c0113e1ba80ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5350310.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/4247853; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28348590/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs5OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["common respiratory viruses","combinations of viruses","age","study","non-MERS-CoV human coronaviruses","respiratory symptoms","human respiratory syncytial virus","hCoV-HKU1","hCoV-OC43","hCoV-NL63","hRV","infected patients","dual infections","Human rhinovirus","contribution of enhanced surveillance systems","detected pathogen","better infection control","positive viral infection","high diversity","prevalence","southwestern region of Saudi Arabia","adults","healthcare centers","importance","RT-PCR","hRSV","multiplex microarray","symptomatic outpatients","people older","influenza","years","coinfection","Nasal swabs","children","winter time","total","samples"],"language":"en"},

DATA SOURCES: We did a comprehensive literature review with the keywords \u201Czika\u201D and/or \u201Cmicrocephaly\u201D from inception to May 27, 2016, with PubMed. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included and analyzed if they met all of the following criteria: \u201Cprobable or confirmed infant microcephaly\u201D and \u201Cprobable or confirmed ZIKV infection among mothers or infants\u201D. RESULTS: We emphasize the diagnosis of ZIKV infection, including maternal clinical manifestations, maternal and fetal laboratory confirmation, and possible autopsy if need. Other confounders that may lead to microcephaly should be excluded from the study. We presented the results from clinical manifestations of ZIKV infection, testing methods evolving but the mechanism of microcephaly uncertain, flexible definition challenging the diagnosis of microcephaly, and limited causal reference on pregnant women. We made analog comparison of severe acute respiratory syndrome and chikungunya virus in terms of DNA mutation and global movement to provide further research recommendation. The chance of catch-up growth may decrease the number of pervious \u201Cdiagnosed\u201D microcephaly.

This virus is a species that belongs to the family Coronaviridae and the genus Coronavirus. The virus causes severe fatal diarrhea in young piglets and usually a mild disease in adult pigs. Pigs, foxes, dogs, and cats are the hosts to the virus. TGE was first described in 1946 in the United States. Subsequently, it was found to be in many other countries. Live vaccines have been used for porcine transmissible gastroenteritis. Epizootiological studies that have been made on the disease reveal that it is possible that birds are involved as carriers of the disease. A profusion of methods of diagnosis has been reported in the literature for the disease. Agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID), virus neutralisation (VN), indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA), complement fixation (CF), microneutralization, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are some diagnostic techniques for the disease.","publish_time":"1983-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"ODEND\u0027HAL, STEWART","journal":"The Geographical Distribution of Animal Viral Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d678ce5b0b21cca48a07226a97055eb96733352.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149672.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780125241809500893; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780125241809500893","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsxMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Agar"],"organizations":["TGE"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["virus neutralisation","mild disease","overview of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus","TGE","adult pigs","indirect immunofluorescent assay","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","young piglets","ELISA","AGID","VN","microneutralization","IFA","chapter","severe fatal diarrhea","family Coronaviridae","CF","dogs","fixation","Agar gel immunodiffusion","cats","diagnostic techniques","diagnosis","genus Coronavirus","Publisher Summary","foxes","carriers","species","hosts","Live vaccines","profusion of methods","birds","literature","United States","Epizootiological studies","countries"],"language":"en"},

We take the view that the complexity of the immune system is an inevitable consequence of its evolution, and this complexity has frustrated reductionist efforts to develop host-directed therapies for infection. However, since hosts vary widely in susceptibility and tolerance to infection, host-directed therapies are likely to be effective, by altering the biology of a susceptible host to induce a response more similar to a host who survives. Such therapies should exert minimal selection pressure on organisms, thus greatly decreasing the probability of pathogen resistance developing. A systems medicine approach to infection has the potential to provide new solutions to old problems: to identify host traits that are potentially amenable to therapeutic intervention, and the host immune factors that could be targeted by host-directed therapies. Furthermore, undiscovered sub-groups with different responses to treatment are almost certain to exist among patients presenting with life-threatening infection, since this population is markedly clinically heterogeneous. A major driving force behind high-throughput clinical phenotyping studies is the aspiration that these subgroups, hitherto opaque to observation, may be observed in the data generated by new technologies. Subgroups of patients are unlikely to be static \u2013 serial clinical and biological phenotyping may reveal different trajectories through the pathophysiology of disease, in which different therapeutic approaches are required. We suggest there are two major goals for systems biology in infection medicine: (1) to identify subgroups of patients that share treatable features; and, (2) to integrate high-throughput data from clinical and in vitro sources in order to predict tractable therapeutic targets with the potential to alter disease trajectories for individual patients.","publish_time":"2017-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Russell, Clark D.; Baillie, J.

Interestingly, mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) was found to translocate to the nucleus during PEDV infection, and AIF relocalization was completely abrogated by the presence of cyclosporin A (CsA), an inhibitor of cyclophilin D (CypD) that is an essential component of the mitochondrial permeabilization transition pore (mPTP) complex. CsA treatment resulted in significant inhibition of PEDV-triggered apoptosis and suppressed PEDV replication. Furthermore, direct inhibition of AIF strongly impaired PEDV infection and virus-induced apoptosis.

A solid communication strategy is needed to increase the reach of valid information to health professionals, reduce misinformation, and efficiently implement recommended measures. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to describe the utilization of a dedicated mobile health (mHealth) platform to disseminate up-to-date and validated information about SARS-CoV-2 to all medical staff of the Children\u2019s Hospital at the University Hospitals of Geneva. METHODS: Three documents containing institutional information concerning screening, local containment procedures, and frequently asked questions and answers for parents were made available to the staff through a mobile app developed in the University of Geneva, Switzerland. Using a third-party statistics tool, we anonymously monitored user activity as well as content utilization patterns since the diagnosis of the first case of SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland on February 25, 2020. RESULTS: From February 25, 2020, to March 13, 2020 (18 days), information documents on SARS-CoV-2 were viewed 859 times, which accounted for 35.6% of the total content views (total views=332). User activity increased significantly with 50.8 (SD 14.4) users per day in this period as compared to the previous weeks (mean 26.4, SD 9.8; P\u003C.001). In addition, session numbers per day more than doubled during the aforementioned period (P\u003C.001). In a survey, medical staff found the information easy to find within the app. On a 10-point Likert scale, the ability of the app to reassure staff in clinical practice was rated as 7.6 (SD 2.1), time-saving ability was rated as 8.5 (SD 2.1), and the need to look for information from other sources was rated as 5.9 (SD 3.3). CONCLUSIONS: The use of an mHealth solution to disseminate novel coronavirus\u2013related information seemed to be an effective and time-saving communication channel within our institution during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Medical staff felt reassured and informed in daily practice. More research should be done on the clinical impact and outcomes of the integration of mHealth solutions as a communication channel of validated information within health institutions.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zamberg, Ido; Manzano, Sergio; Posfay-Barbe, Klara; Windisch, Olivier; Agoritsas, Thomas; Schiffer, Eduardo","journal":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159056.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32250958/; https://doi.org/10.2196/18668","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsxNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["the University Hospitals"],"locations":["Geneva","Switzerland"],"keyphrases":["information documents","SARS-CoV","institutional information","related information","information easy","medical staff","communication channel of validated information","reach of valid information","case of SARS","health professionals","dedicated mobile health","health institutions","mobile app","total content views","containment measures","total views","University of Geneva","user activity","clinical practice","ability","Switzerland","integration of mHealth solutions","content utilization patterns","University Hospitals of Geneva","solid communication strategy","novel coronavirus","clinical impact","aforementioned period","daily practice","recommended measures","local containment procedures","current outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","platform","screening","asked questions","Children\u2019s Hospital","parents","outcomes","diagnosis","misinformation","answers","response plans","transmission","paper","effort","addition","session numbers","third-party statistics tool","jurisdictions","previous weeks","METHODS","users","authorities","days","survey","Likert scale","infection rate","OBJECTIVE","aim","CONCLUSIONS","need","sources","BACKGROUND","research","times","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Contrary to previous findings with neural cells from the rat (S. Beushausen and S.

Effects of the differentiation inducer dbcAMP on levels of the myelin-specific enzyme 2\u2032:3\u2032-cyclic nucleotide-3\u2032-phosphohydrolase (CNPase) activity and virus replication were determined. In the mouse system there was a gradual, continuous elevation of CNPase beyond 30 days whereas in comparable rat cell cultures maximum CNPase enhancement is elicited within 21 days (F. A. McMorris,1983, J. Neurochem. 41, 506\u2013515). After dbcAMP treatment replication of both coronaviruses was profoundly suppressed in murine oligodendrocytes, consistent with our findings on JHMV replication in treated rat oligodendrocytes. By contrast the replication of JHMV and MHV3 in dbcAMP-treated murine astrocytes was influenced only marginally. These findings provide further support for the hypothesis that susceptibility of rodents to CNS infection by coronaviruses is determined, in part, by the age-related maturation process of oligodendrocytes.","publish_time":"1986-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilson, Greame A.R.; Beushausen, Sven; Dales, Samuel","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d306cef17796171045cacc28fa124b2a4e0fdf3f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682286900474; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682286900474","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsyMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S.

This tool is useful as it clearly illustrates the evolutionary patterns of different markets, and allows us to identify close relationships with economic fluctuations. We found that German tourism plays a leading role, since its movements are followed with delays by tourism flows from other countries, and exhibits higher resilience to shocks. Also, domestic and Spanish tourism have both displayed less irregular behaviors than tourism from other source markets. On the contrary, tourism from the Netherlands and the UK, have displayed irregular patterns, which demonstrates the urgency to diversify tourism source markets to reduce the country\u0027s vulnerability to external shocks and economic cycles.","publish_time":"2016-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Andraz, Jorge M.; Rodrigues, Paulo M.M.","journal":"Tourism Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/56d1156b4d84641de09ff9d8195ecc38c1355cb9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115555.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287746/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261517716300346; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0261517716300346; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2016.03.019","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsyODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Portugal","Netherlands"],"keyphrases":["German tourism","tourism flows","Spanish tourism","cyclical evolution of tourism source markets","economic cycles","economic fluctuations","evolutionary patterns of different markets","irregular patterns","Portugal","economic climate tracer","tool","irregular behaviors","external shocks","country\u0027s vulnerability","countries","urgency","leading role","delays","movements","UK","higher resilience","close relationships","Netherlands","use","period"],"language":"en"},

A multiplex nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (multiplex nested RT-PCR) was developed for the detection of these viruses in field samples from piglets with diarrhea. A mixture of (1) three external pairs of primers, yielding in the amplification step two different amplicons with sizes of 950bp and 317bp and (2) three pairs of internal primers in a second round of PCR (nested PCR), yielding two different amplicons with sizes of 792bp and 208bp for TGEV and porcine PRV-A, respectively. The genome of PEDV was not detected after the amplification step but it was detected in the second round of PCR, yielding amplicon with size of 291bp. Multiplex nested RT-PCR can detect TGEV, PRV-A, and PEDV up to concentration 102 TCID50/mL, 101 TCID50/mL, and 27.2\u03BCg/\u03BCl of RNA, respectively.

To protect chickens against ILTV infection, chicken-embryo origin (CEO) and tissue-culture origin (TCO) vaccines have been used. However, the transmission of vaccine ILTV from vaccinated- to unvaccinated chickens can cause severe respiratory disease. Previously, host cell responses against virulent ILTV infections were determined by microarray analysis. In this study, a microarray analysis was performed to understand host-vaccine ILTV interactions at the host gene transcription level. RESULTS: The 44 K chicken oligo microarrays were used, and the results were compared to those found in virulent ILTV infection. Total RNAs extracted from vaccine ILTV infected chicken embryo lung cells at 1, 2, 3 and 4 days post infection (dpi), compared to 0 dpi, were subjected to microarray assay using the two color hybridization method. Data analysis using JMP Genomics 5.0 and the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) program showed that 213 differentially expressed genes could be grouped into a number of functional categories including tissue development, cellular growth and proliferation, cellular movement, and inflammatory responses. Moreover, 10 possible gene networks were created by the IPA program to show intermolecular connections. Interestingly, of 213 differentially expressed genes, BMP2, C8orf79, F10, and NPY were expressed distinctly in vaccine ILTV infection when compared to virulent ILTV infection. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive knowledge of gene expression and biological functionalities of host factors during vaccine ILTV infection can provide insight into host cellular defense mechanisms compared to those of virulent ILTV.","publish_time":"2012-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Jeongyoon; Bottje, Walter G; Kong, Byung-Whi","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3e85a35ab89c9a55eeb83c6e17f881d5c497d82.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3353197.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22530940/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-13-143","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILTV","JMP Genomics","Ingenuity Pathway Analysis"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccine ILTV infection","transmission of vaccine ILTV","host-vaccine ILTV interactions","virulent ILTV infections","vaccine ILTV infected chicken embryo lung cells","microarray analysis","days post infection","host cell responses","host cellular defense mechanisms","host gene transcription level","Data analysis","chicken-embryo origin","cellular growth","biological functionalities of host factors","cellular movement","IPA program","Ingenuity Pathway Analysis","microarray assay","genes","RESULTS","tissue-culture origin","possible gene networks","chicken oligo microarrays","tissue development","Comprehensive knowledge of gene expression","unvaccinated chickens","inflammatory responses","proliferation","gallid herpesvirus","huge economic losses","insight","high mortality","CEO","Infectious laryngotracheitis virus","JMP Genomics","number of functional categories","Total RNAs","poultry industry","C8orf79","F10","severe respiratory disease","CONCLUSIONS","TCO","BACKGROUND","NPY","color hybridization method","BMP2","vaccines","intermolecular connections","study"],"language":"en"},

We reason that variations in the DC-SIGN gene might have a broad influence on viral replication and host immune responses. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We studied whether the rs4804803 SNP was associated with a susceptibility to dengue fever (DF) and/or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) through genotyping analysis in a Taiwanese cohort. We generated monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) from individuals with AA or AG genotype of rs4804803 to study the viral replication and immune responses for functional validation. A total of 574 DNA samples were genotyped, including 176 DF, 135 DHF, 143 other non-dengue febrile illnesses (OFI) and 120 population controls. A strong association between GG/AG genotypes of rs4804803 and risk of DHF was found when compared among DF, OFI and controls (p = 0.004, 3\u00D710(\u22125) and 0.001, respectively).

Moreover, MDDCs from individuals with AG genotype with a higher cell surface DC-SIGN expression had a significantly higher TNF\u03B1, IL-12p40, and IP-10 production than those with AA genotype in response to dengue infection. However, the viral replication in MDDCs with AG genotype was significantly lower than those with AA genotype. With both genotypes, MDDCs revealed an increase in viral replication following the addition of anti-IP-10 neutralizing antibody. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The rs4804803 SNP in the CD209 promoter contributed to susceptibility to dengue infection and complication of DHF. This SNP with AG genotype affects the cell surface DC-SIGN expression related to immune augmentation and less viral replication.","publish_time":"2011-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Lin; Chen, Rong-Fu; Liu, Jien-Wei; Lee, Ing-Kit; Lee, Chiu-Ping; Kuo, Ho-Chang; Huang, Shau-Ku; Yang, Kuender D.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac8f8e404ca0e3a052340bf089d90474b38d2b2b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3014977.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21245921/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0000934","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SNP","AG","GG/AG","DHF","OFI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AG genotype of rs4804803","AA genotype","viral replication","dengue infection","dengue fever","rs4804803 SNP","AG genotypes of rs4804803","MDDCs","dengue hemorrhagic fever","DC-SIGN gene","major dengue receptor","OFI","DF","higher cell surface DC-SIGN expression","non-dengue febrile illnesses","CD209 promoter","complication of DHF","risk of DHF","C-type lectin DC-SIGN","immune augmentation","host immune responses","susceptibility","individuals","promoter region of CD209","population controls","human dendritic cells","higher TNF\u03B1","monocyte-derived dendritic cells","addition of anti-IP","broad influence","genotyping analysis","single nucleotide polymorphism","GG","increase","protection","IL-12p40","functional validation","strong association","production","neutralizing antibody","Taiwanese cohort","BACKGROUND","variations","CONCLUSIONS","SIGNIFICANCE","DNA samples","infectious diseases","total","FINDINGS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Our analysis of the risks associated with this treatment suggested that the potential risk of serious, or even lethal, anaphylaxis should preclude its use in treating common colds and URTIs. In light of our findings herein, we propose the following five suggestions for improving the clinical safety of delivering Chinese herbal injections as medical treatments. First, Chinese herbal injections should not be delivered in the clinic to treat patients in accordance with Bian zheng lun zhi (broad-spectrum application based on holistic Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory and methodology), but rather they should be administered to target specific indicated disease processes. Second, Chinese herbal injection indications should be based on the results of double-blind randomized controlled clinical trials. Third, Chinese herbal injections should be used only in cases involving severe disease or to rescue patients in critical condition; they should not be used to treat mild, relatively innocuous diseases, such as common colds and upper respiratory tract infections, given the risk of doing harm. Fourth, Chinese herbal injection formulas should include materials from only a single or a small number of plant sources in known quantities. Fifth, more studies examining the toxicology and allergenic potential of Chinese herbal injections are needed.","publish_time":"2009-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ji, Kunmei; Chen, Jiajie; Li, Meng; Liu, Zhigang; Xia, Lixin; Wang, Chunbo; Zhan, Zhengke; Wu, Xuli","journal":"Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2839162dbdb476151966147ee7919af34fa0f94e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117048.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19559066/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yrtph.2009.06.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0273230009001226; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230009001226","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bian"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Chinese herbal injection indications","Chinese herbal injection formulas","allergenic potential of Chinese herbal injections","holistic Traditional Chinese Medicine","common colds","patients","severe disease","upper respiratory tract infections","potential risk of serious","clinical safety","severe allergic shock","specific indicated disease processes","results of double-blind randomized controlled clinical trials","broad-spectrum application","Bian zheng lun zhi","fatality","accordance","TCM","small number of plant sources","use","theory","toxicology","materials","known quantities","Abstract Reports","innocuous diseases","medical treatments","anaphylaxis","methodology","studies","suggestions","URTIs","cases","critical condition","findings","risks","light","analysis","harm"],"language":"en"},

We report the 3.0 \u00C5-resolution crystal structure of MERS-CoV RBD bound to the extracellular domain of human DPP4. Our results show that MERS-CoV RBD consists of a core and a receptor-binding subdomain. The receptor-binding subdomain interacts with DPP4 \u03B2-propeller but not its intrinsic hydrolase domain. MERS-CoV RBD and related SARS-CoV RBD share a high degree of structural similarity in their core subdomains, but are notably divergent in the receptor-binding subdomain. Mutagenesis studies have identified several key residues in the receptor-binding subdomain that are critical for viral binding to DPP4 and entry into the target cell.

As of October 2016, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database contained \u003E2 million viral genome sequences and a reference set of ~4000 viral genome sequences that cover a wide range of known viral families. Whole-genome sequences can be used to improve viral classification and provide insight into the viral \u201Ctree of life\u201D. However, due to the lack of evolutionary conservation amongst diverse viruses, it is not feasible to build a viral tree of life using traditional phylogenetic methods based on conserved proteins. In this study, we used an alignment-free method that uses k-mers as genomic features for a large-scale comparison of complete viral genomes available in RefSeq. To determine the optimal feature length, k (an essential step in constructing a meaningful dendrogram), we designed a comprehensive strategy that combines three approaches: (1) cumulative relative entropy, (2) average number of common features among genomes, and (3) the Shannon diversity index. This strategy was used to determine k for all 3,905 complete viral genomes in RefSeq. The resulting dendrogram shows consistency with the viral taxonomy of the ICTV and the Baltimore classification of viruses.","publish_time":"2017-01-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Qian; Jun, Se-Ran; Leuze, Michael; Ussery, David; Nookaew, Intawat","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f92a01ead66646392c85f3abe57d3ea5ef8125a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5244389.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep40712; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28102365/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs0MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Shannon"],"organizations":["National Center for Biotechnology Information","ICTV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral classification","viral genome sequences","viral taxonomy","viral families","viral tree of life","large-scale comparison of complete viral genomes available","Baltimore classification of viruses","economical genome sequencing","diverse viruses","RefSeq","genomic features","meaningful dendrogram","resulting dendrogram","comprehensive strategy","average number of common features","traditional phylogenetic methods","reference set","new light","wide range","Biotechnology Information","NCBI","mers","database","ICTV","essential step","National Center","conserved proteins","approaches","lack of evolutionary conservation","development of rapid","consistency","cumulative relative entropy","insight","alignment-free method","optimal feature length","Shannon diversity index","study"],"language":"en"},

The continuous emergence and re-emergence of pathogenic viruses has become a major threat to public health. Whenever pathogenic viruses emerge, their rapid detection is critical to enable implementation of specific control measures and the limitation of virus spread. Further molecular characterization to better understand these viruses is required for the development of diagnostic tests and countermeasures. Advances in molecular biology techniques have revolutionized the procedures for detection and characterization of pathogenic viruses. The development of PCR-based techniques together with DNA sequencing technology, have provided highly sensitive and specific methods to determine virus circulation. Pathogenic viruses potentially having global catastrophic consequences may emerge in regions where capacity for their detection and characterization is limited. Development of a local capacity to rapidly identify new viruses is therefore critical. This article reviews the molecular biology of pathogenic viruses and the basic principles of molecular techniques commonly used for their detection and characterization. The principles of good laboratory practices for handling pathogenic viruses are also discussed.

A serologic study was conducted to determine the asymptomatic MERS infection rate in healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers by exposure status. METHODS: Study participants were selected from contacts of MERS patients based on a priority system in 4 regions strongly affected by the 2015 MERS outbreak. A sero-epidemiological survey was performed in 1,610 contacts (average duration from exposure to test, 4.8 months), and the collected sera were tested using an enzyme-linked immunespecific assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and plaque reduction neutralization antibody test (PRNT). Among the 1,610 contacts, there were 7 ELISA-positive cases, of which 1 exhibited positive IFA and PRNT results. RESULTS: The asymptomatic infection rate was 0.060% (95% confidence interval, 0.002 to 0.346). The asymptomatic MERS case was a patient who had been hospitalized with patient zero on the same floor of the hospital at the same time. The case was quarantined at home for 2 weeks after discharge, and had underlying diseases, including hypertension, angina, and degenerative arthritis. CONCLUSIONS: The asymptomatic infection was acquired via healthcare-associated transmission. Thus, it is necessary to extend serologic studies to include inpatient contacts who have no symptoms.","publish_time":"2018-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Yeong-jun; Yang, Jeong-Sun; Yoon, Hee Jung; Nam, Hae-Sung; Lee, Soon Young; Cheong, Hae-Kwan; Park, Woo-Jung; Park, Sung Han; Choi, Bo Youl; Kim, Sung Soon; Ki, Moran","journal":"Epidemiol Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa2ed61346b7c005b96d661476a671b555b2a93a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5968208.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29656631/; https://doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2018014","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs0Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFA"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["asymptomatic MERS infection rate","asymptomatic MERS case","asymptomatic infection rate","rates of asymptomatic infection","contacts of MERS patients","MERS outbreak","inpatient contacts","non-healthcare workers","positive IFA","PRNT results","serologic study","healthcare-associated transmission","ELISA-positive cases","immunofluorescence assay","exposure status","serologic studies","Study participants","enzyme-linked immunespecific assay","plaque reduction neutralization antibody test","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","hypertension","angina","underlying diseases","discharge","months","priority system","coronavirus","average duration","weeks","degenerative arthritis","collected sera","home","regions","OBJECTIVES","sero-epidemiological survey","hospital","floor","METHODS","symptoms","CONCLUSIONS","confidence interval","time"],"language":"en"},

Contact precautions are necessary to reduce the transmission of MDR pathogens. However, the importance of the surrounding environment is not well known. We studied the effects of ICU relocation on MDR respiratory pathogen detection rates and patient outcomes. METHODS: Patients admitted to the ICU before and after the relocation were retrospectively analyzed. Baseline patient characteristics, types of respiratory pathogens detected, antibiotics used, and patient outcomes were measured. RESULTS: A total of 463 adult patients admitted to the ICU, 4 months before and after the relocation, were included. Of them, 234 were admitted to the ICU before the relocation and 229 afterward. Baseline characteristics, including age, sex, and underlying comorbidities, did not differ between the two groups. After the relocation, the incidence rate of MDR respiratory pathogen detection decreased from 90.0 to 68.8 cases per 1,000 patient-days, but that difference was statistically insignificant. The use of colistin was significantly reduced from 53.5 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 20.3 to 86.7 days) to 18.7 days (95% CI, 5.6 to 31.7 days). Furthermore, the duration of hospital stay was significantly reduced from a median of 29 days (interquartile range [IQR], 14 to 50 days) to 21 days (IQR, 11 to 39 days). CONCLUSIONS: Incidence rates of MDR respiratory pathogen detection were not significantly different before and after ICU relocation. However, ICU relocation could be helpful in reducing the use of antibiotics against MDR pathogens and improving patient outcomes.","publish_time":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Hyung-Jun; Jeong, EuiSeok; Choe, Pyoeng Gyun; Lee, Sang-Min; Lee, Jinwoo","journal":"Acute Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51d37c55030f7c7570f83c8a75f5e6a97209a6c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6849029.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6849029/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozk5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDR","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patient-days","effects of ICU relocation","transmission of MDR pathogens","MDR respiratory pathogen detection rates","poor patient outcomes","Incidence rates of MDR respiratory pathogen detection","Baseline patient characteristics","incidence rate of MDR respiratory pathogen detection","types of respiratory pathogens","Baseline characteristics","use of antibiotics","IQR","adult patients","use of colistin","intensive care units","age","sex","multidrug-resistant","ICUs","Infection","median","interquartile range","CONCLUSIONS","underlying comorbidities","BACKGROUND","total","confidence interval","difference","cases","Contact precautions","duration of hospital stay","importance","surrounding environment","RESULTS","METHODS","months","groups"],"language":"en"},

Thus far, only five variants of porcine torovirus (PToV) have been identified. In this report we describe the identification and partial characterization of a new strain of porcine torovirus (PToV-BRES) that was detected by RT-PCR in a swine faecal specimen from a farm in Brescia (Italy). The complete genes coding for the nucleocapsid (N), hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) and membrane (M) proteins were amplified, and sequence analysis showed that PToV-BRES is a new PToV strain that, based on the HE gene sequence, is phylogenetically related to P4 strain, that was up to now the only member of a distinct PToV lineage. The nucleocapsid protein from PToV-BRES was expressed in insect cells as a his-tagged protein, purified by affinity chromatography and used to develop an ELISA method to detect antibodies against PToV. This assay was evaluated using a serum collection including 45 samples from three commercial farms from Spain. High antibody prevalence against PToV was observed in the three farms, both in adult animals and in piglets, which could suggest that PToV might be endemic in Spanish porcine population. The ELISA method developed in this work could be useful in future epidemiological surveys about toroviruses.","publish_time":"2009-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pignatelli, J.; Jimenez, M.; Luque, J.; Rejas, M.

Methods Ethnographic interviews were first conducted to identify the common psychological and behavioral responses to the outbreak. This was followed by a case-control study of 235 consecutive pregnant women recruited during the SARS epidemic, and a historical cohort of 939 pregnant women recruited a year before the outbreak. Both cohorts completed standardized rating scales on depression, anxiety, and social support. Results Women in the SARS cohort adopted behavioral strategies to mitigate their risk of contracting infection. However, pregnant women tended to overestimate the risk of contracting SARS and nearly a third of the women were homebound. The anxiety level of the SARS cohort was slightly higher than that of the pre-SARS control. No statistical difference was found between the depression levels of the two cohorts. Conclusion The improved social support experienced by pregnant women during SARS might have buffered the stress associated with an outbreak. However, clinicians should monitor for overestimation of infectious risk among pregnant women.","publish_time":"2006-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Dominic T.S.; Sahota, Daljit; Leung, Tse N.; Yip, Alexander S.K.; Lee, Fiona F.Y.; Chung, Tony K.H.","journal":"Journal of Psychosomatic Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e07648e31fe217c16728603599f115467adcb987.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094779.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022399906003990; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022399906003990","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["SARS cohort","consecutive pregnant women","psychological responses of pregnant women","Results Women","SARS epidemic","risk of contracting SARS","outbreak","pre-SARS control","behavioral responses","behavioral strategies","historical cohort","risk of contracting infection","cohorts","improved social support","overestimation of infectious risk","case-control study","depression levels","present study","anxiety level","severe acute respiratory syndrome","standardized rating scales","aim","Abstract Objective","Hong Kong","Conclusion","year","statistical difference","Methods Ethnographic interviews","clinicians","stress"],"language":"en"},

Here we report the first detailed ultrastructural analyses of the SCV and SIF by electron microscopy (EM), EM tomography and live cell correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM). We found that a subset of SIF is composed of double membranes that enclose portions of host cell cytosol and cytoskeletal filaments within its inner lumen. Despite some morphological similarities, we found that the formation of SIF double membranes is independent from autophagy and requires the function of the effector proteins SseF and SseG. The lumen of SIF network is accessible to various types of endocytosed material and our CLEM analysis of double membrane SIF demonstrated that fluid phase markers accumulate only between the inner and outer membrane of these structures, a space continual with endosomal lumen.

MERS-CoV is prone to cause endemic disease in the Middle East, with several dozen spillover infections to other continents. It is hypothesized that MERS-CoV originated from bat coronaviruses and that dromedary camels are its natural reservoir. Although gene segments identical to MERS-CoV were sequenced from certain species of bats and one species experimentally shed the virus, it is still unknown whether other bats can transmit the virus. Here, at the molecular level, we found that all purified bat CD26s (bCD26s) from a diverse range of species interact with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV, with equilibrium dissociation constant values ranging from several to hundreds at the micromolar level. Moreover, all bCD26s expressed in this study mediated the entry of pseudotyped MERS-CoV to receptor-expressing cells, indicating the broad potential engagement of bCD26s as MERS-CoV receptors. Further structural analysis indicated that in the bat receptor, compared to the human receptor, substitutions of key residues and their adjacent amino acids leads to decreased binding affinity to the MERS-RBD. These results add more evidence to the existing belief that bats are the original source of MERS-CoV and suggest that bCD26s in many species can mediate the entry of the virus, which has significant implications for the surveillance and control of MERS-CoV infection. IMPORTANCE In this study, we found that bat CD26s (bCD26s) from different species exhibit large diversities, especially in the region responsible for binding to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). However, they maintain the interaction with MERS-RBD at varied affinities and support the entry of pseudotyped MERS-CoV. These bat receptors polymorphisms seem to confer evolutionary pressure for the adaptation of CD26-binding virus, such as the ancestor of MERS-CoV, and led to the generation of diversified CD26-engaging CoV strains. Thus, our data add more evidence to support that bats are the reservoir of MERS-CoV and similar viruses, as well as further emphasize the necessity to survey MERS-CoV and other CoVs among bats.","publish_time":"2020-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuan, Yuan; Qi, Jianxun; Peng, Ruchao; Li, Chunrui; Lu, Guangwen; Yan, Jinghua; Wang, Qihui; Gao, George Fu","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/183198c7676634008382c37c641eb28ffa5e6a55.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a368405ea4cdb6211512c36d12f211e24dcdbbd7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7022362.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01387-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31776269/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV receptors","survey MERS-CoV","MERS-RBD","entry of pseudotyped MERS-CoV","reservoir of MERS","control of MERS","ancestor of MERS","CoV infection","original source of MERS","binding virus","receptor binding domain","certain species of bats","generation of diversified CD26-engaging CoV strains","binding affinity","human receptor","different species","bat coronaviruses","purified bat CD26s","bat receptors polymorphisms","diverse range of species","Continued reports of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","broad potential engagement of bCD26s","study","evidence","adaptation of CD26","natural reservoir","micromolar level","molecular level","substitutions of key residues","adjacent amino acids","evolutionary pressure","dromedary camels","existing belief","large diversities","equilibrium dissociation constant values","cells","region responsible","surveillance","endemic disease","varied affinities","dozen spillover infections","infecting humans","hundreds","significant implications","gene segments identical","CoVs","similar viruses","continents","identification","interaction","necessity","structural analysis","results","data","IMPORTANCE"],"language":"en"},

We sought to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients being treated inside and outside Hubei province, and explore the factors underlying these differences. METHODS: Collaborating with the National Health Commission, we established a retrospective cohort to study hospitalised COVID-19 cases in China. Clinical characteristics, the rate of severe events and deaths, and the time to critical illness (invasive ventilation or intensive care unit admission or death) were compared between patients in and outside of Hubei. The impact of Wuhan-related exposure (a presumed key factor that drove the severe situation in Hubei, as Wuhan is the epicenter as well the administrative center of Hubei province) and the duration between symptom onset and admission on prognosis were also determined. RESULTS: Upon data cut-off (Jan 31st, 2020), 1590 cases from 575 hospitals in 31 provincial administrative regions were collected (core cohort). The overall rate of severe cases and mortality was 16.0% and 3.2%, respectively. Patients in Hubei (predominantly with Wuhan-related exposure, 597/647, 92.3%) were older (mean: 49.7 versus 44.9 years), had more cases with comorbidity (32.9% versus 19.7%), higher symptomatic burden, abnormal radiologic manifestations, and, especially, a longer waiting time between symptom onset and admission (5.7 versus 4.5 days) compared with patients outside Hubei. Patients in Hubei [severe event rate 23.0% versus 11.1%, death rate 7.3% versus 0.3%, hazards ratio (HR) for critical illness 1.59, 95%CI 1.05\u20132.41] have a poorer prognosis compared with patients outside of Hubei after adjusting for age and comorbidity. However, among patients outside of Hubei, the duration from symptom onset to hospitalisation (mean: 4.4 versus 4.7 days) and prognosis (HR 0.84, 95%CI 0.40\u20131.80) were similar between patients with or without Wuhan-related exposure. In the overall population, the waiting time, but neither treated in Hubei nor Wuhan-related exposure, remained an independent prognostic factor (HR 1.05, 1.01\u20131.08). CONCLUSION: There were more severe cases and poorer outcomes for COVID-19 patients treated in Hubei, which might be attributed to the prolonged duration of symptom onset to hospitalisation in the epicenter. Future studies to determine the reason for delaying hospitalisation are warranted.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liang, Wen-hua; Guan, Wei-jie; Li, Cai-chen; Li, Yi-min; Liang, Heng-rui; Zhao, Yi; Liu, Xiao-qing; Sang, Ling; Chen, Ru-chong; Tang, Chun-li; Wang, Tao; Wang, Wei; He, Qi-hua; Chen, Zi-sheng; Wong, Sook-San; Zanin, Mark; Liu, Jun; Xu, Xin; Huang, Jun; Li, Jian-fu; Ou, Li-min; Cheng, Bo; Xiong, Shan; Xie, Zhan-hong; Ni, Zheng-yi; Hu, Yu; Liu, Lei; Shan, Hong; Lei, Chun-liang; Peng, Yi-xiang; Wei, Li; Liu, Yong; Hu, Ya-hua; Peng, Peng; Wang, Jian-ming; Liu, Ji-yang; Chen, Zhong; Li, Gang; Zheng, Zhi-jian; Qiu, Shao-qin; Luo, Jie; Ye, Chang-jiang; Zhu, Shao-yong; Cheng, Lin-ling; Ye, Feng; Li, Shi-yue; Zheng, Jin-ping; Zhang, Nuo-fu; Zhong, Nan-shan; He, Jian-xing","journal":"Eur Respir J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e1fcac30ea689f72eb8503f1f74b695d4a72757.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7144336.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32269086/; https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00562-2020","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Health Commission"],"locations":["Hubei","China"],"keyphrases":["outside Hubei province","outcomes of patients","mortality rate of patients","administrative center of Hubei province","Wuhan-related exposure","overall rate of severe cases","rate of severe events","severe event rate","death rate","severe situation","prolonged duration of symptom onset","impact of Wuhan","HR","waiting time","poorer prognosis","critical illness","hospitalised COVID","poorer outcomes","delaying hospitalisation","epicenter","clinical characteristics","mean","days","comorbidity","intensive care unit admission","disease severity","retrospective cohort","considerable differences","core cohort","overall population","parts of China","presumed key factor","independent prognostic factor","provincial administrative regions","outbreak of coronavirus disease","invasive ventilation","higher symptomatic burden","abnormal radiologic manifestations","deaths","reason","hospitals","National Health Commission","hazards ratio","factors","Future studies","RESULTS","data cut-off","METHODS","BACKGROUND","years","age","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

It has been used for the prevention and treatment of virus-related respiratory diseases such as influenza virus infection. BLG contains some antiviral compounds, but few evidence-based clinical studies have been conducted to assess its efficacy against influenza. We assessed the effects of BLG (including efficacy and safety) on the treatment of seasonal influenza in an evidence-based clinical trial. METHODS/DESIGN: We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, oseltamivir- and placebo-controlled, parallel-design clinical trial. A total of 177 subjects are going to be recruited after satisfying the criteria: (i) 18 to 65 years of age; (ii) illness onset within 36 h; (3) axillary temperature \u226538.0\u00B0C; and (iv) positive influenza (type A/B) virus test. Subjects will be assigned randomly into three groups in equal proportions: oseltamivir treatment, BLG granule treatment, and placebo treatment. Each group receives 5-day treatment and is followed up 1, 3, 5, 7 and 21 days later. Symptoms and patient compliance are recorded, and virus/serum viral antibodies tested. We will use the primary outcome, secondary outcome, and safety indicators to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BLG granules in the treatment of seasonal influenza. DISCUSSION: We have described the first clinical trial for treatment using a single herb against influenza A and B viruses in China. We will hold a large-scale clinical trial to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and safety of BLG against influenza infection based on the results of this pilot study. And this clinical trial will serve as an example for the study of other traditional herbal medicines in evidence-based clinical trials.

Importantly, we demonstrate that ISG20 exerts a translational control over a large panel of non-self RNA substrates including those originating from transfected DNA, while sparing endogenous transcripts. This activity correlates with the protein\u2019s ability to localize in cytoplasmic processing bodies. Finally, these functions are conserved in the ISG20 murine ortholog, whose genetic ablation results in mice with increased susceptibility to viral infection.

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is an economically important swine enteric coronavirus and causes acute diarrhea in piglets. At present, little is known about the function of IFN-\u03B3 in the control of TGEV infection. In this study, we demonstrated that IFN-\u03B3 inhibited TGEV infection directly in ST cells and intestine epithelial IPEC-J2 cells and that the anti-TGEV activity of IFN-\u03B3 was independent of IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2. Moreover, IFN-\u03B3 suppressed TGEV infection in ST cells more efficiently than did IFN-\u03B1, and the combination of IFN-\u03B3 and IFN-\u03B1 displayed a synergistic effect against TGEV. Mechanistically, using overexpression and functional knockdown experiments, we demonstrated that porcine interferon regulatory factor 1 (poIRF1) elicited by IFN-\u03B3 primarily mediated IFN-\u03B3 signaling cascades and the inhibition of TGEV infection by IFN-\u03B3. Importantly, we found that TGEV elevated the expression of poIRF1 and IFN-\u03B3 in infected small intestines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Thus, IFN-\u03B3 plays a crucial role in curtailing enteric coronavirus infection and may serve as an effective prophylactic and/or therapeutic agent against TGEV infection.","publish_time":"2019-08-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shan, Lingling; Fu, Fang; Xue, Mei; Zhu, Xiangdong; Li, Liang; Feng, Li; Liu, Pinghuang","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a22c841a95f784a81243b8ce488d79212a62338.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086799.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31385116/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-019-04362-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV","ST"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mediated IFN-\u03B3","IFN-\u03B1","IFN-\u03B3 inhibited TGEV infection","independent of IFN","combination of IFN","function of IFN","anti-TGEV activity of IFN","inhibition of TGEV infection","control of TGEV infection","ST cells","curtailing enteric coronavirus infection","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","intestine epithelial IPEC-J2 cells","important swine enteric coronavirus","expression of poIRF1","Interferon gamma","direct antiviral activity","porcine interferon regulatory factor","infected small intestines","crucial role","cascades","acute diarrhea","therapeutic agent","host immune responses","functional knockdown experiments","synergistic effect","ability","overexpression","piglets","Transmissible gastroenteritis virus","study","present"],"language":"en"},

Despite well-established guides and recommendations regarding environmental surface cleaning and disinfection, there are several challenges in resource-limited settings. This viewpoint article will discuss the practice of environmental cleaning in resource-limited settings including challenges and relationship between environment and healthcare-associated infections in this setting and outlines pre-requisites to overcome these challenges. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite several barriers and challenges, environmental cleaning is a crucial component to help reduce transmission of healthcare-associated infections and multi-drug-resistant pathogens as well as emerging infectious disease-associated pathogens in resource-limited settings. However, there is a need to develop a multi-modal strategy together with a mechanism for monitor and feedback to improve the practices of environmental cleaning in resource-limited settings. SUMMARY: Additional researches on the barriers and implementation gaps and the role of collaborative network as well as how to apply technology would provide significant insights on the practices of environmental cleaning in resource-limited settings.","publish_time":"2018-01-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Apisarnthanarak, Anucha; Weber, David J.","journal":"Curr Treat Options Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a55f80b9d93715288ebb84df874c6ae2a17f939.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7099871.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40506-018-0149-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226320/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["resource-limited settings","practices of environmental cleaning","environmental surface cleaning","practice of environmental cleaning","challenges","Environmental surfaces","healthcare-associated infections","transmission of healthcare","healthcare-associated pathogen transmission","healthcare facilities","barriers","emerging infectious disease-associated pathogens","multi-drug-resistant pathogens","critical pathway","implementation gaps","recommendations","relationship","disinfection","crucial component","Additional researches","patient room","well-established guides","significant insights","mechanism","role of collaborative network","monitor","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","feedback","multi-modal strategy","pre-requisites","SUMMARY","viewpoint article","RECENT FINDINGS","need","technology"],"language":"en"},

In spite of appropriated supplies, most hospitals are suffering from a scarcity of free beds, protective masks, sanitizing liquids and even ECMO machines for patients with severe cases. Defeating this pandemic is impossible without united and coordinated international attempts shaped by all countries of the world. We believe that an international scaled-determination is required to diminish the complex impacts of pandemic. The most important priorities are supposed to be i) The development of potential vaccine candidates to provide protection and interrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, ii) To ensure enough supplies for hospitals and their homogeneous distribution among the countries with the worst number of severe cases, iii) There is a need for more studies to identify potential treatments that are effective for the control of this viral infection and iv) It is imperative to provide easy access to diagnostic kits for all countries affected by this pandemic. In the light of these suggestions, it would be recommendable to at least temporarily abandon the political checkouts in both national and international levels; therefore, all partners will be potentially able to efficiently enforce their strategies for the elimination of this unique threat to the human populations.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perez Perez, Guillermo I.; Bezmin Abadi, Amin Talebi","journal":"Arch Med Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/639037fbf60b345842996f3a72a1368a1588702b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0188440920304574; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0188440920304574?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ECMO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["countries","recent pandemic","international levels","international attempts","hospitals","SARS-CoV","complex impacts of pandemic","potential treatments","worst number of severe cases","transmission of SARS","spite of appropriated supplies","development of potential vaccine candidates","liquids","protective masks","ECMO machines","protection","patients","scarcity of free beds","governmental authorities","unique threat","easy access","diagnostic kits","homogeneous distribution","control","political checkouts","strategies","viral infection","elimination","obstacles","human populations","studies","partners","respiratory illness","suggestions","need","determination","important priorities","light","world","deaths"],"language":"en"},

This unexpected and dramatic situation could increase the incidence of mental health problems, among them, psychotic disorders. The aim of this paper was to describe a case series of brief reactive psychosis due to the psychological distress from the current coronavirus pandemic. Materials and methods: We report on a case series including all the patients with reactive psychoses in the context of the COVID-19 crisis who were admitted to the Virgen del Roc\u00EDo and Virgen Macarena University Hospitals (Seville, Spain) during the first two weeks of compulsory nationwide quarantine. Results: In that short period, four patients met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria for a brief reactive psychotic disorder. All of the episodes were directly triggered by stress derived from the COVID-19 pandemic and half of the patients presented severe suicidal behavior at admission. Conclusions: We may now be witnessing an increasing number of brief reactive psychotic disorders as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This type of psychosis has a high risk of suicidal behavior and, although short-lived, has a high rate of psychotic recurrence and low diagnostic stability over time. Therefore, we advocate close monitoring in both the acute phase and long-term follow-up of these patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vald\u00E9s-Florido, Mar\u00EDa Jos\u00E9; L\u00F3pez-D\u00EDaz, \u00C1lvaro; Palermo-Zeballos, Fernanda Jazmin; Mart\u00EDnez-Molina, Iv\u00E1n; Mart\u00EDn-Gil, Victoria Eugenia; Crespo-Facorro, Benedicto; Ruiz-Veguilla, Miguel","journal":"Rev Psiquiatr Salud Ment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a9d69e3bc76839731195a21cf69f2c40323c8922.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32389516/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1888989120300343; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1888989120300343?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.04.009","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Virgen Macarena University Hospitals"],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["patients","COVID","increasing number of brief reactive psychotic disorders","case series of brief reactive psychosis","reactive psychoses","high rate of psychotic recurrence","current coronavirus pandemic","Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders","high risk of suicidal behavior","severe suicidal behavior","type of psychosis","low diagnostic stability","Virgen Macarena University Hospitals","incidence of mental health problems","psychological distress","criteria","acute phase","Spain","Seville","Roc\u00EDo","DSM","context","half","time","long-term follow-up","admission","dramatic situation","short period","weeks of compulsory nationwide quarantine","world","close monitoring","paper","crisis","stressful scenario","Abstract Introduction","Results","methods","Materials","episodes","aim","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Covid-19 appeared as a very dangerous virus and unfortunately caused a worldwide pandemic disease. Radiology doctors use X-ray or CT images for the diagnosis of Covid-19. It has become crucial to help diagnose such images using image processing methods. Therefore, we proposed a novel intelligent computer vision method to automatically detect the Covid-19 virus. The proposed automatic Covid-19 detection method consists of preprocessing, feature extraction and feature selection stages. Image resizing and grayscale conversion are used in the preprocessing phase. The proposed feature generation method is called as Residual Exemplar Local Binary Pattern (ResExLBP). In the feature selection phase, a novel iterative ReliefF (IRF) based feature selection is used. Decision tree (DT), linear discriminant (LD), support vector machine (SVM), k nearest neighborhood (kNN) and subspace discriminant (SD) methods are chosen as classifiers in the classification phase. Leave one out cross-validation (LOOCV) and 10-fold cross-validation are used for training and testing. In this work, SVM classifier achieved 100.0% classification accuracy by using 10-fold cross-validation. This result clearly has shown that we reached the perfect classification rate by using X-ray image for Covid-19 detection.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tuncer, Turker; Dogan, Sengul; Ozyurt, Fatih","journal":"Chemometr Intell Lab Syst","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd91d2e917ad6de1642116f65adcfe461eb366ef.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169743920301970; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32427226/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169743920301970?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemolab.2020.104054","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["feature selection phase","feature extraction","feature selection stages","proposed feature generation method","classification phase","diagnosis of Covid","proposed automatic Covid","person","fold cross-validation","detection method","X-ray image","preprocessing phase","classification accuracy","image processing methods","perfect classification rate","novel intelligent computer vision method","linear discriminant","subspace discriminant","CT images","SVM classifier","dangerous virus","novel iterative ReliefF","Residual Exemplar Local Binary Pattern","ResExLBP","DT","support vector machine","SD","IRF","kNN","neighborhood","Radiology doctors","classifiers","LOOCV","Decision tree","grayscale conversion","worldwide pandemic disease","animal","training","Abstract Coronavirus","work","testing","form","result"],"language":"en"},

For this ELISA, undiluted test sera are used to block the binding of an anti-IBRV gIII monoclonal antibody (mAbgIII)-horseradish peroxidase (HRPO) conjugate to gIII antigen. TMB substrate is used for color development. Negative S/N values (defined as the absorbance at 650 nm of test sera/absorbance at 650 nm of negative control sera) of \u003E0.80 were obtained with immune sera from gnotobiotic cattle immunized with several bovine viruses, with bovine antisera to bovine herpesvirus-2, and vesicular stomatitis virus, with porcine antisera to pseudorabies virus and parvovirus, and with normal sera from heterologous species. Negative S/N values were also obtained with sera from rabbits twice vaccinated with IBRV(NG)dltkdlgIII.

The panel of MAbs in the present study, thus, should be useful for detailed antigenic analysis of the H9 HAs for epidemiological studies, the selection of vaccine strains, and diagnosis.","publish_time":"2008-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Okamatsu, Masatoshi; Sakoda, Yoshihiro; Kishida, Noriko; Isoda, Norikazu; Kida, Hiroshi","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aae1073a281c8629809f3de023c2d6853ae5d369.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087127.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18989614/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-008-0243-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Antigenic"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["panel of MAbs","H9 influenza viruses","antigenic variation","Antigenic variants","panel of monoclonal antibodies","birds","H9N2 virus strains","H9 HA molecule","detailed antigenic analysis","reactivity patterns","non-overlapping antigenic sites","presence of monoclonal antibodies","distinct epitopes","present study","distinct groups","present findings","selection of vaccine strains","mammals of different species","epidemiological studies","mutants","swine","diagnosis","Hong Kong","duck","Hokkaido","hemagglutinins"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: This research combined two kinds of methods: a questionnaire survey and the in-depth interview to two CEOs of the sample hospitals. One hospital is not-for-profit, while the other is a public hospital and the research samples are from the hospital data from Taiwan\u0027s 2005 to 2007 Department of Health qualifying lists of hospital accreditation. The returned questionnaires were analyzed with STATISTICA(\u00AE )7.1 version software. RESULTS: The results for non-medical items showed medical waste and common trash both have the highest rate (94.6 percent) of being outsourced. The gift store (75 percent) and linen (73 percent) follow close behind, while the lowest rate of outsourcing is in utility maintenance (13.5 percent). For medical items, the highest rate of outsourcing is in the ambulance units (51.4 percent), while the hemodialysis center follows close behind with a rate of 50 percent. For departments of nutrition, pharmacy, and nursing however, the outsourcing rate is lower than 3 percent. This shows that Taiwan\u0027s hospitals are still conservative in their willingness to outsource for medical items. The results of the satisfaction paired t-test show that the non-medical items have a higher score than the medical items. The factor analysis showed the three significant factors in of non medical items\u0027 outsourcing are \u0022performance\u0022, \u0022finance\u0022, and \u0022human resource\u0022. For medical items, the two factors are \u0022operation\u0022 and satisfaction\u0022. To further exam the factor validity and reliability of the satisfaction model, a confirmative factor analysis (CFA) was conducted using structure equation modeling (SEM) method and found the model fitting well. CONCLUSION: Hospitals, especially for public hospitals, can get benefits from outsourcing to revive the full-time-equivalent and human resource limitation.","publish_time":"2009-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hsiao, Chih-Tung; Pai, Jar-Yuan; Chiu, Hero","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46ee8e5fc43eba4d4efe8979ba75a36991d9e283.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2685796.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-9-78; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19435526/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs0NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["percent","outsourcing rate","non-medical items","medical items\u0027 outsourcing","medical waste","highest rate of outsourcing","lowest rate of outsourcing","outsourcing situation","public hospitals","Taiwan\u0027s hospitals","hospital data","hospital ownership","RESULTS","Taiwanese hospitals","sample hospitals","satisfaction model","factor validity","confirmative factor analysis","Department of Health qualifying lists of hospital accreditation","human resource limitation","significant factors","satisfaction paired t-test","research samples","kinds of methods","model fitting","accreditation levels","common trash","higher score","questionnaire survey","SEM","CFA","reliability","differences","structure equation modeling","in-depth interview","time-equivalent","utility maintenance","STATISTICA","CEOs","study","nursing","performance","linen","willingness","hemodialysis center","ambulance units","pharmacy","exam","finance","benefits","departments of nutrition","gift store","returned questionnaires","version software","BACKGROUND","aim","operation","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

The S1 gene has 1,620 nucleotides and encoded a polypeptide of 540 amino acids with typical coronavirus cleavage recognition sites of HRRR. About 1-day-old specific pathogen-free White Leghorn chickens inoculated with CK/CH/JS/TAHY at 105.5 EID50 exhibited clinical signs including coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, and tracheal vocalization accompanied by depression with 84% mortality and 100% morbidity. The kidneys of dead birds were swollen and pale and exhibited severe urate deposition. Histopathological examination revealed kidney hemorrhages, multifocal necrosis of the renal tubules and trachea with cilia loss, sloughing of epithelial cells, and edema of the lamina propria. IBV-specific antibodies appeared at 10 D post-infection. Chickens vaccinated with a CK/CH/JS/TAHY oil-emulsion vaccine showed 26.7% morbidity and 3% mortality indicating a protective effect. In conclusion, the IBV strain is a virulent avian IBV and that exhibited severe pathogenicity in chickens and is a vaccine candidate to prevent infection by Chinese QX-like nephropathogenic IBV strains.","publish_time":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ren, Guangcai; Liu, Fan; Huang, Miaorong; Li, Lin; Shang, Huiqin; Liang, Meilan; Luo, Qiong; Chen, Ruiai","journal":"Poultry Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9ec51cd6ce837abb8eb9bede87b12bf6ea05ed4d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111634.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119578555; https://doi.org/10.3382/ps/pez568; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0032579119578555; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31573613/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs2NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CK/CH/JS/TAHY","HRRR","White Leghorn","IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["JS","virulent avian IBV","virulent IBV strain","IBV-specific antibodies","nephropathogenic IBV strains","kidneys of diseased chickens","TAHY oil-emulsion vaccine","S1 gene","mortality","morbidity","ABSTRACT Avian infectious bronchitis","infectious bronchitis virus","day-old specific pathogen-free White Leghorn chickens","Chinese QX","vaccine candidate","severe pathogenicity","D post-infection","severe urate deposition","kidneys of dead birds","multifocal necrosis","typical coronavirus cleavage recognition sites of HRRR","renal tubules","amino acids","cilia loss","sneezing","coughing","nasal discharge","kidney hemorrhages","clinical signs","contagious disease","EID50","tracheal vocalization","epithelial cells","Histopathological examination","edema","polypeptide","depression","Phylogenetic analysis","nucleotides","lamina propria","protective effect","conclusion","type"],"language":"en"},

However, astroviral infection of animals had been poorly studied. In the present study, 211 rectal swabs collected from cattle and water buffalo calves with mild to severe diarrhea were tested for bovine astrovirus (BAstV) by RT-PCR. Results: 92/211 (43.6%) samples were positive for BAstV, at a rate of 46.10% (71/154) in cattle and 36.84% (21/57) in water buffalo. Phylogenetic analysis based on the partial and full-length of 25 ORF2 amino acid sequences obtained in this study classified the Guangxi BAstVs isolates into five subgroups under the genus of Mamastrovirus, genotype MAstV33, which suggested that the water buffalo was a new host of this genogroup that previously included only cattle and roe deer. Despite the origin of the host, the Guangxi BAstV isolates were closely related to the BAstV Hong Kong isolates (B18/HK and B76-2/HK), but highly divergent from the BAstV NeuroS1 isolate previously associated with neurologic disease in cattle in the U.S.A. Nucleotide sequence-based characterization of the ORF1b/ORF2 junction and corresponding overlapping regions showed distinctive properties, which may be common to BAstVs. Our results suggested that cattle and water buffalo are prone to infection of closely related astroviruses, which probably evolved from the same ancestor. The current study described astroviruses in water buffalo for the first time and is thus far among the largest epidemiological investigations of BAstV infection in cattle conducted in China.","publish_time":"2015-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"ALFRED, Niyokwishimira; LIU, Huan; LI, Mu Lan; HONG, Shao Feng; TANG, Hai Bo; WEI, Zu Zhang; CHEN, Ying; LI, Fa Kai; ZHONG, Yi Zhi; HUANG, Wei Jian","journal":"J Vet Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a296d80d8a8c0408c1ea9559c0f0589fb35cb03.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4488400.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25716289/; https://doi.org/10.1292/jvms.14-0252","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs2OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["S.A.

Compared to other diseases such as AIDS or Malaria with millions of cases annually, filovirus hemorrhagic fever (FHF) is one of the neglected infectious diseases. There are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics available to treat EBOV and MARV infections; therefore, these pathogens can only be handled in maximum containment laboratories and are classified as select agents. Under these limitations, a very few laboratories worldwide conducted basic research and countermeasure development for EBOV and MARV since their respective discoveries in 1967 (MARV) and 1976 (EBOV). In this review, we discuss several vaccine platforms against EBOV and MARV, which have been assessed for their protective efficacy in animal models of FHF.

An emerging field of microfluidics also known as the lab-on-a-chip (LOC) or micro total analysis system includes a wide range of diagnostic devices. This review briefly covers both conventional and microfluidics-based techniques for rapid viral detection. We first describe conventional detection methods such as cell culturing, immunofluorescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). These methods often have limited speed, sensitivity, or specificity and are performed with typically bulky equipment. Here, we discuss some of the LOC technologies that can overcome these demerits, highlighting the latest advances in LOC devices for viral disease diagnosis. We also discuss the fabrication of LOC systems to produce devices for performing either individual steps or virus detection in samples with the sample to answer method. The complete system consists of sample preparation, and ELISA and RT-PCR for viral-antibody and nucleic acid detection, respectively.

In infected cells MHV produces a 3\u2032 coterminal nested set of subgenomic messenger RNAs. Only the genomic RNA, however, is encapsidated by the nucleocapsid protein and incorporated in infectious MHV virions. It is believed that an RNA packaging signal (Ps), present only in the genomic RNA, is responsible for this selectivity. Earlier studies mapped this signal to a 69-nt stem\u2013loop structure positioned in the 3\u2032 end of ORF1b. The selective encapsidation mechanism probably initiates by specific interaction of the packaging signal with the nucleocapsid protein. In this study we demonstrate thein vitrointeraction of the MHV-A59 nucleocapsid protein with the packaging signal of MHV using gel retardation and UV cross-linking assays. This interaction was observed not only with the nucleocapsid protein from infected cells but also with that from purified virions and from cells expressing a recombinant nucleocapsid protein. The specificity of the interaction was demonstrated by competition experiments with nonlabeled Ps containing RNAs, tRNA, and total cytoplasmic RNA. The results indicated that no virus specific modification of the N-protein or the presence of other viral proteins are required for thisin vitrointeraction. The assays described in this report provide us with a powerful tool for studying encapsidation (initiation) in more detail.","publish_time":"1997-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Molenkamp, Richard; Spaan, Willy J.M.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ed607974f6c3ea829cd36bd23d376880dcb26d2d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004268229798867X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004268229798867X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV-A59 nucleocapsid protein","packaging signal of MHV","RNA packaging signal","recombinant nucleocapsid protein","N-protein","genomic RNA","infected cells MHV","infectious MHV virions","specific interaction","total cytoplasmic RNA","enveloped positive stranded RNA virus","virus specific modification","nonlabeled Ps","coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus","thein vitrointeraction","thisin vitrointeraction","purified virions","UV cross-linking assays","selective encapsidation mechanism","coterminal nested set of subgenomic messenger RNAs","gel retardation","tRNA","competition experiments","viral proteins","powerful tool","nt stem","presence","loop structure","report","initiation","results","study","Earlier studies","selectivity","end of ORF1b","specificity"],"language":"en"},

Currently there are no vaccines approved for ZIKV, and thus, there is an urgent need to develop an effective and safe ZIKV vaccine. Domain III (DIII) of the ZIKV envelope (E) protein is an important vaccine target, and a vaccine developed using a mutant DIII of E (EDIII) protein protects adult and pregnant mice, and unborn offspring, against ZIKV infection. Here, we have used immunocompetent BALB/c mice treated with anti-interferon-\u03B1/\u03B2 receptor 1 (Ifnar1) antibodies to investigate whether three adjuvants (aluminum (Alum), monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), and MF59), either alone or in combination, could improve the efficacy of this EDIII subunit vaccine. Our data show that, although vaccine formulated with a single adjuvant induced a specific antibody and cellular immune response, and reduced viral load in mice challenged with ZIKV, the combination of Alum and MPL adjuvants led to a more robust and balanced immune response, stronger neutralizing activity against three recent ZIKV human strains, and greater protection against a high-dose ZIKV challenge. Particularly, the combination of Alum with MPL significantly reduced viral titers and viral RNA copy numbers in sera and tissues, including the male reproductive organs. Overall, this study has identified the combination of Alum and MPL as the most effective adjuvant for ZIKV EDIII subunit vaccines, and it has important implications for subunit vaccines against other enveloped viruses, including non-ZIKV flaviviruses.","publish_time":"2019-10-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xinyi; Tai, Wanbo; Zhang, Xiaolu; Zhou, Yusen; Du, Lanying; Shen, Chuanlai","journal":"Vaccines (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71e571db52c00a9c67fffc6f075580fe0732cde1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6963592.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31717890/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines7040161","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV","MPL","ZIKV EDIII"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ZIKV envelope","ZIKV infection","safe ZIKV vaccine","ZIKV EDIII subunit vaccines","non-ZIKV flaviviruses","combination of Alum","recent ZIKV human strains","high-dose ZIKV challenge","MPL adjuvants","important vaccine target","viral titers","viral load","protein","effective adjuvant","pregnant mice","c mice","balanced immune response","cellular immune response","mutant DIII of E","viral RNA copy numbers","single adjuvant","important implications","Zika virus","congenital Zika syndrome","stronger neutralizing activity","tissues","neurological diseases","greater protection","close association","anti-interferon-\u03B1","enveloped viruses","\u03B2 receptor","sera","specific antibody","adult","additional routes","unborn offspring","transmission","global attention","Ifnar1","antibodies","aluminum","monophosphoryl lipid","efficacy","immunocompetent BALB","male reproductive organs","sexual contact","mosquito","urgent need","study","Domain","MF59","data"],"language":"en"},

Advanced maternal age is more commonly seen in those with maternal disomy 15. Environmental factors (e.g., drug use, occupational chemical exposure, infectious agents, and irradiation) could account for chromosome changes. Previous evidence of differences in male and female gametogenesis could suggest an environmental role in the causation of the paternal 15q11\u2010q13 deletion seen in PWS. Certain occupations such as hydrocarbon\u2010exposing occupations (e.g., landscaping, farming, and painting) and viral exposure (e.g., human coronavirus 229E causing upper respiratory infections in adults with an incorporation site in the human genome at chromosome 15q11) can be seasonal in nature and contribute to chromosome damage. To assess, we reviewed birth seasonality data in a large cohort of individuals with PWS recruited nationally (N = 355) but no significant differences were seen by month between those with the 15q11\u2010q13 deletion compared with maternal disomy 15 when analyzing quarterly seasonal patterns.

In this study, a kind of highly biocompatible CDs (Gly\u2010CDs) is synthesized from active ingredient (glycyrrhizic acid) of Chinese herbal medicine by a hydrothermal method. Using the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) as a model, it is found that the Gly\u2010CDs inhibit PRRSV proliferation by up to 5 orders of viral titers. Detailed investigations reveal that Gly\u2010CDs can inhibit PRRSV invasion and replication, stimulate antiviral innate immune responses, and inhibit the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by PRRSV infection. Proteomics analysis demonstrates that Gly\u2010CDs can stimulate cells to regulate the expression of some host restriction factors, including DDX53 and NOS3, which are directly related to PRRSV proliferation. Moreover, it is found that Gly\u2010CDs also remarkably suppress the propagation of other viruses, such as pseudorabies virus (PRV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), suggesting the broad antiviral activity of Gly\u2010CDs. The integrated results demonstrate that Gly\u2010CDs possess extraordinary antiviral activity with multisite inhibition mechanisms, providing a promising candidate for alternative therapy for PRRSV infection.","publish_time":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tong, Ting; Hu, Hongwei; Zhou, Junwei; Deng, Shuangfei; Zhang, Xiaotong; Tang, Wantao; Fang, Liurong; Xiao, Shaobo; Liang, Jiangong","journal":"Small","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6684552e6df800e8e481903ea5c7a7980058b88.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169479.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.201906206; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32077621/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new antiviral CDs","biocompatible CDs","broad antiviral activity of Gly","PRRSV infection","PRRSV proliferation","antiviral effects","PRRSV invasion","extraordinary antiviral activity","area of antiviral research","antiviral innate immune responses","pseudorabies virus","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","respiratory syndrome virus","promising candidate","multisite inhibition mechanisms","replication","Chinese herbal medicine","glycyrrhizic acid","ROS","PRV","PEDV","high biocompatibility","accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species","alternative therapy","host restriction factors","active ingredient","gradual usage of carbon dots","DDX53","expression","hydrothermal method","kind","NOS3","viruses","attempts","cells","Detailed investigations","Proteomics analysis","integrated results","orders of viral titers","study","propagation","model"],"language":"en"},

The air velocity, particle velocity and particle deposition velocity were validated with available experimental data. Several particle deposition ratios were proposed to describe the particle accumulation due to bends. Particle deposition velocities in and behind bends were analyzed numerically. It is found that bend walls with surfaces of higher capture velocity tend to accumulate more contaminant particles as seen with an increased factor of 1.2 times on particle deposition velocity. Particle deposition reaches a maximum value near bend outlet, e.g. 15.2 times deposition ratio for particles of d p = 23 \u03BCm, and decay exponentially to a status of fully developed deposition in approximately 10D length. Compared to traditional consideration of sole deposition in bends, a new general concept of total deposition including that in bends and behind bends is proposed to better describe the particle deposition induced by bends since the enhancement deposition ratios behind bends compose 42\u201399% in the total ratios for particles of d p = 3\u201323 \u03BCm. Furthermore, models of fast power and exponential decay trend are demonstrated to uncover the relationship among enhancement factor of deposition velocity behind bend, dimensionless distance behind bends and particle Stokes number. The present study can contribute to the understanding and controlling of contaminant aerosol flow behavior in ducts, e.g. particle sampling, removal and associated epidemiologic study between particle and human health.","publish_time":"2012-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Ke; Lu, Lin; Jiang, Hai","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e4efea0f3b78b9fbff9cdfba5ed97f9b5320baa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126509.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132311004252; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.12.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132311004252; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288022/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs5MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Reynolds"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["particle deposition velocity","particle deposition ratios","particle velocity","Particle deposition velocities","developed deposition","microparticle deposition","enhancement deposition ratios","particle sampling","particle accumulation","enhancement factor of deposition velocity","times deposition ratio","particle Stokes number","traditional consideration of sole deposition","presence of duct bends","new general concept of total deposition","air velocity","particles of d p","contaminant particles","total ratios","surfaces of higher capture velocity","bend outlet","bend walls","D length","\u03BCm","epidemiologic study","increased factor","present study","exponential decay trend","contaminant aerosol flow behavior","Reynolds stress turbulent model","dimensionless distance","Eulerian approach","ducts","removal","Lagrangian trajectory method","understanding","distribution","relationship","maximum value","models of fast power","human health","available experimental data","paper","status"],"language":"en"},

From 10 infected dogs, peripheral blood leukocytes were harvested periodically, phenotyped and analyzed for CDV antigen content and apoptosis using Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide labeling.

For dogs with severe distemper, developing virus persistence in the lymphoid tissue and central nervous system, this lymphopenia lasted until the end of the experiment. Increased levels of lymphocyte apoptosis were found at 3 d.p.i., and monocyte apoptosis at 6 d.p.i. This was more prominent in the group of animals with severe distemper. At 3 d.p.i. no leukocyte infection was detectable indicating that the early lymphocyte depletion and apoptosis was not a direct consequence of virus infection.

Before the development of in vitro cell culture techniques, all viruses had to be propagated in their natural host. For bacterial viruses, this was a relatively simple process that permitted an earlier development of laboratory research methods than was possible with plant or animal viruses. For animal viruses, samples from affected animals were collected and used to infect other animals, initially of the same species. When consistent results were obtained, attempts were usually made to determine whether other species might also be susceptible. This chapter explains that the advent of in vitro animal cell culture brought research studies in line with those involving bacterial viruses, thereby reducing the risks associated with adventitious viruses in animal inoculation systems and enhancing diagnostic testing. Various in vitro cell culture systems are used since an artificial medium was developed to maintain cell viability outside the source species: organ cultures, explant cultures, primary cell cultures, and cell lines. Organ cultures maintain the three-dimensional structure of the tissue and are used for short-term experiments. A fundamental characteristic that separates viruses from other replicating entities is the manner in which new virus particles are synthesized. Viruses do not use binary fission; virus particles are assembled de novo from the various structural components synthesized as somewhat independent but synchronized events. The critical first step in the virus replication cycle is the binding of the virus particle to a host cell. This binding process may involve a series of interactions that define in part the host range of the virus and its tissue/organ specificity.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Fenner\u0027s Veterinary Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012375158400002X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B978012375158400002X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs5MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["animal viruses","host cell","bacterial viruses","animal cell culture","adventitious viruses","primary cell cultures","cell culture systems","cell viability","cell lines","cell culture techniques","organ cultures","virus replication cycle","new virus particles","explant cultures","animal inoculation systems","tissue","organ specificity","source species","binding process","chapter","host range","natural host","research studies","simple process","affected animals","earlier development of laboratory research methods","various structural components","manner","novo","risks","replicating entities","diagnostic testing","step","Publisher Summary","artificial medium","three-dimensional structure","samples","binary fission","advent of","series of interactions","synchronized events","fundamental characteristic","consistent results","attempts","short-term experiments"],"language":"en"},

The loading behavior include variations of filtration efficiency and pressure drop and distribution of deposited aerosols in the filters all having the same fiber basis weight (3.060 gsm). Through the filtration efficiency variations of uncharged/charged, single-/multi-layer filters with aerosol loading, it was observed that mechanical PVDF filters had continuously increasing filtration efficiency, while PVDF electret filters had initially decreasing and subsequently increasing filtration efficiency until reaching 100% due to diminishing electrostatic effect and enhancing mechanical effect. By combining the pressure drop evolution of different filters during aerosol loading and detailed SEM images of the loaded filters, we have demonstrated that multilayer PVDF filters, especially the electret ones, could significantly slow down the pace of filter clogging (skin effect) and increase significantly the aerosol holding capacity during depth filtration. Generally, the multilayer nanofiber filters received the most aerosol deposit during depth filtration, whereas the single-layer nanofiber filters with the same basis weight of fibers received the most deposit during cake filtration. The multilayer nanofiber filters had approximately 70% aerosol deposit in the filter during depth filtration fully utilizing the full filter thickness, especially for the electret filters that had charged fibers, and only 30% deposit in the cake. On the contrary, the single-layer uncharged/charged nanofiber filters were exactly the reverse due to persistency of the skin effect with only 30% deposit in the filter mostly located in the upstream layer, yet 70% deposit in the cake. During depth filtration, the pressure drop per added mass deposit for the multilayer electret filter was very low at 11 Pa gsm\u22121, which was at least twice below any other nanofiber filters. This was all attributed to the uniform capture of aerosols by electrostatic effect across the entire filter depth from the upstream to downstream layers of the multilayer electret filter. The above conclusion was confirmed by the detailed SEM images taken across the different filter layers for the multilayer filter configuration. The 4-layer electret nanofiber filter with a 3.060-gsm basis weight has 4 times more aerosol holding capacity than the single uncharged/charged nanofiber filter with the same fiber basis weight in depth filtration. Based on the standpoint of highest efficiency and capacity with maximum pressure drop 800 Pa imposed on the filtration operation, the 4-layer nanofiber electret was the best among all 4 filters. It had 52% more aerosol holding capacity than the single layer uncharged nanofiber filter and 38% more capacity than the charged single-layer and the uncharged multilayer nanofiber filters. The multilayer PVDF electret filters have excellent filtration performance for long-term aerosol filtration and also great potential applications in the fields of personal health care and environmental protection.","publish_time":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Qiangqiang; Leung, Wallace Woon-Fong","journal":"Separation and Purification Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dffdaf209eb2d761fa456d8a10a28d77c9980875.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108370.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288610/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116606; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1383586619359994; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383586619359994","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs5NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PVDF","SEM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["single-layer nanofiber filters","uncharged multilayer nanofiber filters","layer electret nanofiber filter","multilayer PVDF filters","multilayer PVDF electret filters","multilayer electret filter","depth filtration","layer nanofiber electret","loaded filters","behavior of PVDF nanofiber electret filters","multi-layer filters","single layer uncharged nanofiber filter","aerosol deposit","mechanical PVDF filters","cake filtration","long-term aerosol filtration","multilayer filter configuration","filtration operation","variations of filtration efficiency","increasing filtration efficiency","evolution of different filters","charged single-layer","filter thickness","aerosol loading","single-layer uncharged","entire filter depth","filtration efficiency variations of uncharged","different filter layers","excellent filtration performance","Abstract Aerosol","upstream layer","capacity","electret ones","pace of filter clogging","gsm basis weight","electrostatic effect","skin effect","mechanical effect","fiber basis weight","basis weight of fibers","added mass deposit","loading behavior","maximum pressure","Pa gsm","standpoint of highest efficiency","detailed SEM images","submicron aerosols","uniform capture of aerosols","distribution of deposited aerosols","downstream layers","great potential applications","fields of personal health care","times","environmental protection","best","persistency","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

We investigate the asymmetrical interplay between the two types of spreading dynamics, each occurring on its own layer, by focusing on the two fundamental quantities underlying any spreading process: epidemic threshold and the final infection ratio. We find that an epidemic outbreak on the contact layer can induce an outbreak on the communication layer, and information spreading can effectively raise the epidemic threshold. When structural correlation exists between the two layers, the information threshold remains unchanged but the epidemic threshold can be enhanced, making the contact layer more resilient to epidemic outbreak. We develop a physical theory to understand the intricate interplay between the two types of spreading dynamics.","publish_time":"2014-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Wei; Tang, Ming; Yang, Hui; Younghae Do; Lai, Ying-Cheng; Lee, GyuWon","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/354a4b199eb297756554a8967154ea32f07e88d1.json; document_parses/pdf_json/dc1e16996462dd1445f21c419b6e40dd0dd84c02.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4037715.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep05097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24872257/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epidemic threshold","epidemic outbreak","information threshold","contact layer","information spreading","communication layer","spread of information","spreading process","physical-contact network","communication network","spread of disease","types","dynamics","physical theory","intricate interplay","asymmetrical interplay","layers","final infection ratio","related dynamical processes","fundamental quantities","structural correlation"],"language":"en"},

We recently identified a new PK-resistant PrP species, designated PrP(*20), in uninfected human and animal brains. It was preferentially detected with the 1E4 antibody against human PrP 97-108 but not with the anti-PrP 3F4 antibody, although the 3F4 epitope is adjacent to the 1E4 epitope in the PrP(*20) molecule. The present study reveals that removal of the N-terminal amino acids up to residue 91 significantly increases accessibility of the 1E4 antibody to PrP of brains and cultured cells. In contrast to cells expressing wild-type PrP, cells expressing pathogenic mutant PrP accumulate not only PrP(*20) but also a small amount of 3F4-detected PK-resistant PrP27-30. Remarkably, during the course of human prion disease, a transition from an increase in 1E4-detected PrP(*20) to the occurrence of the 3F4-detected PrP27-30 was observed.

A large number of medical staff was sent to Wuhan city and Hubei province to aid COVID-19 control. Psychological stress, especially vicarious traumatization caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, should not be ignored. To address this concern, the study employed a total of 214 general public and 526 nurses (i.e., 234 front-line nurses and 292 non-front-line nurses) to evaluate vicarious traumatization scores via a mobile app-based questionnaire. Front-line nurses are engaged in the process of providing care for patients with COVID-19. The results showed that the vicarious traumatization scores for front-line nurses including scores for physiological and psychological responses, were significantly lower than those of non-front-line nurses (P \u003C 0.001). Interestingly, the vicarious traumatization scores of the general public were significantly higher than those of the front-line nurses (P \u003C 0.001); however, no statistical difference was observed compared to the scores of non-front-line nurses (P \u003E 0.05). Therefore, increased attention should be paid to the psychological problems of the medical staff, especially non-front-line nurses, and general public under the situation of the spread and control of COVID-19. Early strategies that aim to prevent and treat vicarious traumatization in medical staff and general public are extremely necessary.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Zhenyu; Ge, Jingwu; Yang, Meiling; Feng, Jianping; Qiao, Mei; Jiang, Riyue; Bi, Jiangjiang; Zhan, Gaofeng; Xu, Xiaolin; Wang, Long; Zhou, Qin; Zhou, Chenliang; Pan, Yinbing; Liu, Shijiang; Zhang, Haiwei; Yang, Jianjun; Zhu, Bin; Hu, Yimin; Hashimoto, Kenji; Jia, Yan; Wang, Haofei; Wang, Rong; Liu, Cunming; Yang, Chun","journal":"Brain Behav Immun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4eca1f55ea6141d3be5280fd504dbd3585d097ab.json; document_parses/pdf_json/54f77303e20263b14eee2cea6c43cac204a06cad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102670.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32169498/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0889159120303093; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159120303093","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["front-line nurses","vicarious traumatization scores","scores of non-","general public","control of COVID","large number of medical staff","psychological responses","psychological problems","Psychological stress","Wuhan city","mobile app-based questionnaire","Hubei province","infection","Corona Virus Disease","total","process","situation","spread","study","care","patients","results","concern","increased attention","statistical difference","Early strategies","people","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

The establishment of a persistent infection and the subsequent demyelinating disease triggered by the virus depend on the expression of L*, a viral accessory protein encoded by an alternative open reading frame of the virus. We discovered that L* potently inhibits the interferon-inducible OAS/RNase L pathway. The antagonism of RNase L by L* was particularly prominent in macrophages where baseline oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and RNase L expression levels are elevated, but was detectable in fibroblasts after IFN pretreatment. L* mutations significantly affected Theiler\u0027s virus replication in primary macrophages derived from wild-type but not from RNase L-deficient mice. L* counteracted the OAS/RNase L pathway through direct interaction with the ankyrin domain of RNase L, resulting in the inhibition of this enzyme. Interestingly, RNase L inhibition was species-specific as Theiler\u0027s virus L* protein blocked murine RNase L but not human RNase L or RNase L of other mammals or birds. Direct RNase L inhibition by L* and species specificity were confirmed in an in vitro assay performed with purified proteins. These results demonstrate a novel viral mechanism to elude the antiviral OAS/RNase L pathway. By targeting the effector enzyme of this antiviral pathway, L* potently inhibits RNase L, underscoring the importance of this enzyme in innate immunity against Theiler\u0027s virus.","publish_time":"2013-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sorgeloos, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric; Jha, Babal Kant; Silverman, Robert H.; Michiels, Thomas","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5908982f4dbbfde0faabcfadc0988b8a19223411.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3694852.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23825954/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003474","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs3MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OAS","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Direct RNase","murine RNase","human RNase","antagonism of RNase","ankyrin domain of RNase","Theiler\u0027s virus replication","antiviral OAS","antiviral pathway","inhibition","interferon-inducible OAS","effector enzyme","viral accessory protein","primary macrophages","direct interaction","expression levels","novel viral mechanism","chronic infections","neurotropic picornavirus responsible","baseline oligoadenylate synthetase","alternative open reading frame","persistent infection","subsequent demyelinating disease","innate immunity","central nervous system","wild-type","importance","assay","fibroblasts","IFN pretreatment","results","mutations","species specificity","purified proteins","establishment","deficient mice","mammals","birds"],"language":"en"},

Severe diseases were rare, however, until the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV in 2003. Since then, other novel CoV (NL63 and HKU1) have been described, and they have caused respiratory infections worldwide. Potentially exposed laboratory workers or animal handlers with rapidly progressive pneumonia not responding to standard antibacterial coverage must be isolated with contact and droplet, and for specific situations, airborne precautions, till rapid tests of respiratory and faecal samples are negative for SARS-CoV. Generally, the viral loads collected at different anatomical sites correlate with the severity of symptoms and mortality. Shedding of SARS-CoV peaks at day 10 after the onset of symptoms, which theoretically allows ample time for antiviral treatment. The disease is characterized by uncontrolled replication of the virus and a prominent pro-inflammatory response. No randomized controlled trials with a specific anti-coronavirus agent have been conducted with respect to therapy or prophylaxis. Reports using historical matched controls have suggested that treatment with interferon alfacon-1 (a synthetic interferon) combined with steroid, protease inhibitors together with ribavirin, or convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody, could be useful. Prophylaxis with interferon or hyperimmune globulin may be considered for unprotected exposure. The role of immunomodulators to decrease excessive inflammation remains elusive. Other non-SARS-CoV infections are generally milder in immunocompetent hosts, and scientific data on antiviral treatment of these viruses are scarce.","publish_time":"2008-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Samson S.

To understand how this occurs, we investigated the role of the receptor Tva in avian leukosis virus-A (ALV-A) infection. We find that Tva binding induced the formation of a reactive thiolate on Cys38 (Cys38-S(\u2212)) in SU. Both chemical and genetic inactivation of Cys38-S(\u2212) completely abrogated ALV fusion and infection. Remarkably, Cys38-S(\u2212) does not mediate isomerization of the SU-TM disulfide bond and is not required for Tva-induced activation of TM, including pre-hairpin association with membranes and low pH assembly of helical bundles.

Similar compounds, which are embedded to proximate points on the 2-D map, may bind the same or similar target proteins. Thus, iBioProVis can be used to easily observe the structural distribution of one or two target proteins\u0027 known ligands on the 2-D compound space, and to infer new binders to the same protein, or to infer new potential target(s) for a compound of interest, based on this distribution. Principal component analysis (PCA) projection of the input compounds is also provided, Hence the user can interactively observe the same compound or a group of selected compounds which is projected by both PCA and embedded by t-SNE. iBioProVis also provides detailed information about drugs and drug candidate compounds through cross-references to widely used and well-known databases, in the form of linked table views. Two use-case studies were demonstrated, one being on ACE2 protein which is SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor. ACE2 binding compounds and 7 antiviral drugs were closely embedded in which two of them have been under clinical trial for COVID-19.

The approach is featured with a continuity equation being explicitly solved for water vapor, which allows comprehensively considering the effects of inhomogeneous humidity field on droplets evaporation and movement. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) computations based on the approach achieved a satisfactory agreement with the theoretical models reported in the literature. The results demonstrated that the evaporation-generated vapor and super-saturated wet air exhaled from the respiratory tracks forms a \u201Cvapor plume\u201D in front of the respiratory track opening, which, despite the short life time, significantly impedes the evaporation of the droplets captured in it. The study also revealed that due to the droplet size reduction induced by evaporation, both the number density of airborne droplets and mass concentration of inhalable pathogens remarkably increased, which can result in a higher risk of infection. Parametric studies were finally conducted to evaluate the factors affecting droplet evaporation. Summary The study demonstrated the importance of considering inhomogeneous humidity field when modelling the evaporation and dispersion of cough droplets. The multi-component Eulerian-Lagrangian model presented in this study provides a comprehensive approach to address different influential factors in a wide parametric range, which will enhance the assessment of the health risks associated with droplet exposure.","publish_time":"2018-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Xiangdong; Shang, Yidan; Yan, Yihuan; Yang, Lin; Tu, Jiyuan","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/843bb93e398a21d5a2cf0121cdb846e5e372a2d4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117029.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287977/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132317305322; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2017.11.025; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132317305322","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs3Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["droplets evaporation","droplet evaporation","study","evaporation-generated vapor","dispersion of cough droplets","comprehensive approach","multi-component Eulerian-Lagrangian approach","multi-component Eulerian-Lagrangian model","number density of airborne droplets","vapor plume","water vapor","droplet exposure","effects of inhomogeneous humidity field","droplet size reduction","quiescent air","respiratory tracks","Parametric studies","wide parametric range","respiratory track opening","address different influential factors","super-saturated wet air","mass concentration of inhalable pathogens","CFD","computations","importance","theoretical models","computational fluid dynamics","health risks","satisfactory agreement","movement","continuity equation","assessment","short life time","higher risk of infection","literature","Summary","results"],"language":"en"},

We also found that PDCoV infection significantly suppresses the activation of IFN-\u03B2 promoter stimulated by IRF3 or its upstream molecules (RIG-I, MDA5, IPS-1, TBK1, IKK\u03B5) in the RIG-I signaling pathway, but does not counteract its activation by the constitutively active mutant of IRF3 (IRF3\u20135D).

However, imaging findings in ferrets with lymphoma have primarily been described in single case reports. The purpose of this retrospective study was to describe imaging findings in a group of ferrets with confirmed lymphoma. Medical records were searched between 2002 and 2012. A total of 14 ferrets were included. Radiographs (n = 12), ultrasound (n = 14), computed tomography (CT; n = 1), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; n = 1) images were available for review. Median age at the time of diagnosis was 5.2 years (range 3.25\u20137.6 years). Clinical signs were predominantly nonspecific (8/14). The time between the first imaging study and lymphoma diagnosis was 1 day or less in most ferrets (12). Imaging lesions were predominantly detected in the abdomen, and most frequently included intra\u2010abdominal lymphadenopathy (12/14), splenomegaly (8/14), and peritoneal effusion (11/14). Lymphadenopathy and mass lesions were typically hypoechoic on ultrasound. Mild peritoneal effusion was the only detected abnormality in two ferrets. Mild pleural effusion was the most common thoracic abnormality (3/12). Expansile lytic lesions were present in the vertebrae of two ferrets with T3\u2010L3 myelopathy and the femur in a ferret with lameness. Hyperattenuating, enhancing masses with secondary spinal cord compression were associated with vertebral lysis in CT images of one ferret. The MRI study in one ferret with myelopathy was inconclusive.

METHODS: A total of 52 patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to three hospitals in China from January 23, 2020 to February 1, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed using QCT. The accuracy of QCT segmentation was assessed. The relationship between the time from symptom onset to initial CT and QCT parameters acquired on the initial CT were explored. RESULTS: First, the ability of QCT to detect and segment lesions was investigated and it was unveiled that results of segmentation of the majority of cases (42/52) were satisfactory and for 8 out of 52 patients, the images depicted lesions with miss-segmentation; besides, 2 out of 52 cases had negative finding on chest CT achieved by both radiologists and QCT. QCT-related parameters showed to have a relationship with the time from symptom onset to initial CT. In the early-stage (0\u20133 days), the percentage of lung involvement was 4%, with a mean density of \u2212 462 \u00B1 99 HU. The peak density of lesions appeared at the range of \u2212 500 to \u2212 700 HU on density histogram. In the intermediate-stage (4\u20136 days), the mean percentage of lung involvement noticeably increased compared with that in early stage (7%, p \u003C 0.05). In late stage (7\u201314 days), the percentage of lung involvement decreased to 5%. The mean density of lesions was the highest (\u2212 430 \u00B1 80), and heterogeneity density distribution showed a dual-peak on density histogram. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 can be promptly detected by QCT. In addition, the QCT-related parameters can highly facilitate assessment of pulmonary involvement.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Nan; Shen, Cong; Yu, Yong; Dang, Minghai; Cai, Shubo; Guo, Youmin","journal":"Chin J Acad Radiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8214d43a86c85985f7134ac67e522f3912a5cb8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211979.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s42058-020-00034-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32395696/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs3ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["QCT","CT"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["QCT parameters","ability of QCT","QCT-related parameters","mean density of lesions","accuracy of QCT segmentation","peak density of lesions","density histogram","mean percentage of lung involvement","initial CT","days","patients","COVID","early-stage","early stage","heterogeneity density distribution","segment lesions","results of segmentation","late stage","intermediate-stage","assessment of pulmonary involvement","symptom onset","chest CT","time","relationship","miss-segmentation","HU","dual-peak","majority of cases","coronavirus disease","negative finding","images","quantitative computed tomography","total","radiologists","addition","METHODS","PURPOSE","range","hospitals","China","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Response to epidemics in complex humanitarian crises\u2014such as the recent cholera epidemic in Yemen and the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo\u2014is a global health challenge of increasing scale [2]. The thousands of Yemeni and Congolese who have died in these years-long epidemics demonstrate the difficulty of combatting even well-known pathogens in humanitarian settings. The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) may represent a still greater threat to those in complex humanitarian crises, which lack the infrastructure, support, and health systems to mount a comprehensive response. Poor governance, public distrust, and political violence may further undermine interventions in these settings. Populations affected by humanitarian crises are expected to be particularly susceptible to COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, due to displacement, crowded housing, malnutrition, inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) tools, and stigmatization. Disease outbreaks further reduce access to limited healthcare, which is increasingly disrupted by attacks on health facilities and the persistent overburdening of health systems. These situations escalate both the necessity and the difficulty of delivering accurate and actionable information to potentially affected populations [3]. As the international community responds to SARS-CoV-2, public health authorities in humanitarian crises begin at a disadvantage to enact appropriate infection control to prevent transmission in healthcare settings, identify infectious cases, administer supportive care and novel treatments for the seriously ill, and trace contacts. These standard public health measures are particularly difficult to perform in humanitarian settings. For example, limited public health, laboratory, and primary care services represent a barrier to testing. Providing the limited healthcare worker cadre with appropriate training and personal protective equipment, and ensuring a continuous supply chain for such, is a challenge in all settings, exacerbated in complex humanitarian crises. Frequent displacement and limited contact information may prevent effective contact tracing. Finally, intractable structural challenges such as overcrowding limit the implementation of both quarantine of those exposed and isolation of those who are ill. Given these increased vulnerabilities, humanitarian crises should be viewed as a priority for national and international bodies that seek to combat this unfolding pandemic. Resources must be identified to protect healthcare workers, develop and deploy rapid testing, improve surveillance, and enact quarantine and isolation of contacts and cases. To mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on crises-affected populations, governments and agencies will implement the familiar, global evidence-based approaches for combatting respiratory viruses. Respiratory hygiene is a highly effective public health intervention, supported by evidence demonstrating that the spread of respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, can be prevented by hand hygiene, safe cough practice, and social distancing [4]. Hand hygiene is a readily implemented behavior: the distribution of soap to households in humanitarian settings has been shown to increase handwashing by over 30% [5]. Furthermore, hand hygiene is an avenue of agency for protecting one\u2019s own health, consistent with the rights to dignity and to fully participate in decisions related to assistance in humanitarian crises. Widespread introduction of alcohol-based hand rubs is also possible in many resource-limited settings, with published protocols for local production [6]. The Sphere Handbook, a collection of rights-based guidelines for humanitarian response, is the foremost authority on minimum standards for humanitarian assistance [7]. However, despite the indisputable evidence for the efficacy of hand hygiene for reducing both bacterial and viral pathogen transmission, humanitarian WASH standards are based on evidence pertaining to the prevention of illnesses transmitted by the faecal-oral route, with the focus on hand hygiene proximate to latrines [5, 8]. And yet, latrines in crisis settings are often shared and distant from residential shelters, conferring a high risk of gender-based violence [9]. Gender-based violence around latrines is an important deterrent for accessing latrine-adjacent handwashing stations, particularly for hand hygiene to prevent respiratory pathogen transmission.[truncated]","publish_time":"2020-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Poole, Danielle N.; Escudero, Daniel J.; Gostin, Lawrence O.; Leblang, David; Talbot, Elizabeth A.","journal":"Int J Equity Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d013e42811c6442b184da3b9bbfd9e334031a975.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7085188.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32199457/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-020-01162-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs3ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Sphere Handbook"],"locations":["Ebola","Democratic Republic","Yemen"],"keyphrases":["humanitarian settings","complex humanitarian crises","humanitarian assistance","healthcare settings","public health authorities","health facilities","Respiratory hygiene","hand hygiene","resource-limited settings","effective public health intervention","standard public health measures","SARS-CoV","persistent overburdening of health systems","public distrust","limited contact information","global health challenge of increasing scale","affected populations","limited healthcare worker cadre","healthcare workers","based hand rubs","spread of respiratory viruses","quarantine","difficulty of combatting","isolation of contacts","global evidence-based approaches","effective contact tracing","novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","appropriate training","Ebola epidemic","actionable information","supportive care","infectious cases","novel treatments","Frequent displacement","international bodies","Disease outbreaks","comprehensive response","international community","rapid testing","trace contacts","impact of COVID","appropriate infection control","recent cholera epidemic","primary care services","years-long epidemics","overcrowding limit","malnutrition","personal protective equipment","inadequate water","safe cough practice","transmission","laboratory","published protocols","implementation","crowded housing","sanitation","Democratic Republic of Congo","disadvantage","well-known pathogens","infrastructure","Widespread introduction of alcohol","political violence","intractable structural challenges","distribution of soap","social distancing","agencies","surveillance","priority","behavior","governments","access","households","decisions","local production","Poor governance","continuous supply chain","avenue of agency","greater threat","Congolese","dignity","necessity","barrier","tools","interventions","rights","attacks","countries","example","increased vulnerabilities","thousands of Yemeni","stigmatization","unfolding pandemic","situations","people","Resources","handwashing","latrines","Gender-based violence","based guidelines","efficacy of hand hygiene","hand hygiene proximate","humanitarian response","humanitarian WASH standards","viral pathogen transmission","respiratory pathogen transmission","minimum standards","indisputable evidence","high risk of gender","foremost authority","collection of rights","important deterrent","focus","latrine-adjacent handwashing stations","residential shelters","faecal-oral route","prevention of illnesses","Sphere Handbook","crisis settings"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the causative viruses of respiratory infections and their burden among patients with pediatric cancer in Lebanon. STUDY DESIGN: Nasopharyngeal swabs along with clinical and demographic data were collected from patients with pediatric cancer presenting febrile episodes with upper respiratory tract symptoms. Total nucleic acid was extracted from specimens followed by the real\u2010time PCR analysis targeting 14 respiratory viruses to estimate the frequency of infections. RESULTS: We obtained 89 nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with pediatric cancer (mean age, 5.8 \u00B1 4.2 years). Real\u2010time PCR confirmed viral infection in 77 swabs (86.5%). Among these, 151 respiratory viruses were detected. Several viruses cocirculated within the same period; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) being the most common (45.45%), followed by parainfluenza virus (PIV; 26%), influenza type B (26%), human metapneumovirus (24.6%), and human coronavirus (HCoV; 24.6%). Coinfections were detected in 55% of the subjects, and most of them involved RSV with one or more other viruses. A strong correlation was found between PIV, Flu (influenza of any type), RSV, and HCoV with the incidence of coinfections. RSV was associated with lower respiratory tract infections, nasal congestion, bronchitis, and bacteremia. HCoV was associated with bronchiolitis; rhinovirus was associated with hospital admission. CONCLUSION: Patients with pediatric cancer have a high burden of respiratory viral infections and a high incidence of coinfections. Molecular diagnostics can improve management of febrile episodes and reduce antibiotic use.","publish_time":"2019-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Soudani, Nadia; Caniza, Miguela A.; Assaf\u2010Casals, Aia; Shaker, Rouba; Lteif, Mireille; Su, Yin; Tang, Li; Akel, Imad; Muwakkit, Samar; Chmaisse, Ahmad; Homsi, Maysam; Dbaibo, Ghassan; Zaraket, Hassan","journal":"J Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/594cd36557e675e5c0c3388b55e89c716f7538b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166696.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763464/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25432","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","RSV"],"locations":["Lebanon"],"keyphrases":["respiratory viruses","pediatric cancer","Patients","causative viruses of respiratory infections","lower respiratory tract infections","high burden of respiratory viral infections","RSV","respiratory syncytial virus","upper respiratory tract symptoms","frequency of infections","HCoV","Nasopharyngeal swabs","high incidence of coinfections","PIV","management of febrile episodes","real\u2010time PCR analysis","influenza type B","parainfluenza virus","human coronavirus","human metapneumovirus","nasal congestion","higher risk of morbidity","specimens","mortality","bronchitis","demographic data","mean age","period","rhinovirus","patient populations","Molecular diagnostics","antibiotic use","STUDY DESIGN","Total nucleic acid","bacteremia","bronchiolitis","BACKGROUND","Lebanon","CONCLUSION","hospital admission","strong correlation","years","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS","subjects"],"language":"en"},

Evolutionary theories that view depressive symptoms as adaptive fail to provide parsimonious explanations for why even mild depressive symptoms impair fitness-relevant social functioning, whereas theories that suggest that depression is maladaptive fail to account for the high prevalence of depression risk alleles in human populations. These limitations warrant novel explanations for the origin and persistence of depression risk alleles. Accordingly, studies on risk alleles for depression were identified using PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE to examine data supporting the hypothesis that risk alleles for depression originated and have been retained in the human genome because these alleles promote pathogen host defense, which includes an integrated suite of immunological and behavioral responses to infection. Depression risk alleles identified by both candidate gene and genome-wide association study (GWAS) methodologies were found to be regularly associated with immune responses to infection that were likely to enhance survival in the ancestral environment. Moreover, data support the role of specific depressive symptoms in pathogen host defense including hyperthermia, reduced bodily iron stores, conservation/withdrawal behavior, hypervigilance and anorexia. By shifting the adaptive context of depression risk alleles from relations with conspecifics to relations with the microbial world, the Pathogen Host Defense (PATHOS-D) hypothesis provides a novel explanation for how depression can be nonadaptive in the social realm, whereas its risk alleles are nonetheless represented at prevalence rates that bespeak an adaptive function.","publish_time":"2012-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Raison, C L; Miller, A H","journal":"Mol Psychiatry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/998472a6428c367f65d047147899c5583db27ea2.json; document_parses/pdf_json/60b766c8bbe49fb1702f0784263e8a258ed067f3.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8dff045ab74ab8b7fd6ef023e2ed6366bff4d204.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3532038.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/mp.2012.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22290120/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Pathogen Host Defense"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["persistence of depression risk alleles","adaptive context of depression risk alleles","high prevalence of depression risk alleles","human genome of risk alleles","pathogen host defense","mild depressive symptoms","role of specific depressive symptoms","relations","novel explanations","hypothesis","human populations","data","adaptive function","infection","genome-wide association study","fitness-relevant social functioning","Darwinian fitness","parsimonious explanations","social realm","prevalence rates","behavioral responses","maladaptive fail","Evolutionary theories","immune responses","hyperthermia","candidate gene","bodily iron stores","conspecifics","withdrawal behavior","origin","conservation","microbial world","PATHOS-D","integrated suite of immunological","GWAS","PubMed","disorder","hypervigilance","methodologies","survival","Ovid MEDLINE","manifold ways","nonadaptive","anorexia","limitations","studies","ancestral environment","debated mystery"],"language":"en"},

In August 2014, our team developed and implemented an algorithm to triage suspected cases of Ebola virus disease in a midwestern United States emergency department and outpatient clinics based on patient travel history and symptoms. Here, we present the lessons learned and modifications to update the tool. METHODS Two strategies were developed and utilized to properly identify, isolate, and inform on patients with suspected highly hazardous communicable diseases: 1) a robust electronic symptom and travel screen with decision support tools in the electronic medical record, and 2) the availability of workflow protocols for Ebola virus disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) once a person under investigation is identified. After action reports provided opportunities to modify the algorithm and improve the identification and isolation processes. RESULTS Since our screening and travel electronic medical record inception 5 years ago, modifications changed iteratively to further enhance the screening process. Since 2018, staff have identified 5 patients at risk for MERS; in all cases, identification occurred during the check-in process. Exposure investigations in the emergency department decreased significantly after algorithm implementation in January 2019, from 30 in 2018 to 0 in 2019. DISCUSSION Although highly hazardous communicable diseases like Ebola virus disease and MERS are of concern due to their mortality rates and limited treatment options, these same concepts may be applied to the early identification and isolation of patients suspected of having more common communicable diseases like measles and influenza, emphasizing the importance of protocol-based screening in the healthcare environment.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schwedhelm, Michelle M.; Herstein, Jocelyn J.; Watson, Suzanne M.; Mead, Amy L.; Maddalena, Leo; Liston, Devon D.; Hewlett, Angela L.","journal":"J Emerg Nurs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/314f2695fc87464843cd25b34f670108c2786b3c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7160057.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0099176720300878; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32340737/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0099176720300878; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jen.2020.03.006","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs0ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["isolation of patients","hazardous communicable diseases","common communicable diseases","MERS","suspected cases of Ebola virus disease","communicable diseases limits exposure","early identification","based screening","screening process","electronic medical record inception","travel screen","INTRODUCTION Efficient identification","isolation processes","algorithm implementation","modifications","robust electronic symptom","patient travel history","Exposure investigations","check-in process","midwestern United States emergency department","outpatient clinics","decision support tools","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","health care workers","influenza","availability of workflow protocols","limited treatment options","mortality rates","importance of protocol","measles","years","concern","concepts","risk","healthcare environment","opportunities","symptoms","coronavirus","DISCUSSION","action reports","person","COVID","staff","visitors","RESULTS","METHODS","strategies","lessons","team"],"language":"en"},

SVV infection can cause vesicular lesions clinically indistinguishable from those caused by other vesicular disease viruses, such as foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and vesicular exanthema of swine virus (VESV). Sensitive and specific RT-PCR assays for the SVV detection is necessary for differential diagnosis. Real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) has been used for the detection of many RNA viruses. The insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) on a portable POCKIT\u2122 device is user friendly for on-site pathogen detection. In the present study, SVV rRT-PCR and RT-iiPCR were developed and validated. RESULTS: Neither the SVV rRT-PCR nor the RT-iiPCR cross-reacted with any of the vesicular disease viruses (20 FMDV, two SVDV, six VSV, and two VESV strains), classical swine fever virus (four strains), and 15 other common swine viruses. Analytical sensitivities of the SVV rRT-PCR and RT-iiPCR were determined using serial dilutions of in vitro transcribed RNA as well as viral RNA extracted from a historical SVV isolate and a contemporary SVV isolate. Diagnostic performances were further evaluated using 125 swine samples by two approaches. First, nucleic acids were extracted from the 125 samples using the MagMAX\u2122 kit and then tested by both RT-PCR methods. One sample was negative by the rRT-PCR but positive by the RT-iiPCR, resulting in a 99.20% agreement (124/125; 95% CI: 96.59\u2013100%, \u03BA = 0.98). Second, the 125 samples were tested by the taco\u2122 mini extraction/RT-iiPCR and by the MagMAX\u2122 extraction/rRT-PCR system in parallel. Two samples were positive by the MagMAX\u2122/rRT-PCR system but negative by the taco\u2122 mini/RT-iiPCR system, resulting in a 98.40% agreement (123/125; 95% CI: 95.39\u2013100%, \u03BA = 0.97). The two samples with discrepant results had relatively high C(T) values. CONCLUSIONS: The SVV rRT-PCR and RT-iiPCR developed in this study are very sensitive and specific and have comparable diagnostic performances for SVV RNA detection. The SVV rRT-PCR can be adopted for SVV detection in laboratories. The SVV RT-iiPCR in a simple field-deployable system could serve as a tool to help diagnose vesicular diseases in swine at points of need.","publish_time":"2019-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Jianqiang; Nfon, Charles; Tsai, Chuan-Fu; Lee, Chien-Hsien; Fredericks, Lindsay; Chen, Qi; Sinha, Avanti; Bade, Sarah; Harmon, Karen; Pi\u00F1eyro, Pablo; Gauger, Phillip; Tsai, Yun-Long; Wang, Hwa-Tang Thomas; Lee, Pei-Yu Alison","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/703b5f4019a1c215901309bcabddba33738c506a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6534938.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31126297/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-1927-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs0ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VESV","SVV","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SVV rRT-PCR","SVV RT-iiPCR","SVV detection","rRT-PCR system","Real-time RT-PCR","RT-PCR methods","RT-iiPCR system","SVV RNA detection","historical SVV","SVV infection","RT-iiPCR cross","specific RT-PCR assays","swine vesicular disease virus","swine samples","contemporary SVV isolate","vesicular exanthema of swine virus","insulated isothermal PCR","vesicular disease viruses","vesicular stomatitis virus","vesicular diseases","vesicular lesions","RNA viruses","mouth disease virus","common swine viruses","classical swine fever virus","MagMAX","Seneca Valley virus","transcribed RNA","viral RNA","on-site pathogen detection","FMDV","VESV strains","SVDV","taco","VSV","mini extraction","agreement","simple field-deployable system","comparable diagnostic performances","present study","discrepant results","user friendly","device","foot","high C","portable POCKIT","serial dilutions of","multiple countries","tool","differential diagnosis","BACKGROUND","points of need","Analytical sensitivities","recent years","values","CONCLUSIONS","approaches","laboratories","nucleic acids"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Introduction Viruses are one of the most common causes of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children. Early identification of respiratory viruses could result in a decrease in the use of antibiotics. Methods Observational, retrospective study from January 2014 to June 2018, that included paediatric patients admitted with a diagnosis of CAP in a tertiary hospital, in which antigenic tests and/or viral PCR on a respiratory sample was performed. Results A total of 105 CAP episodes were included, with identification of a respiratory virus in 93 (88.6%) cases. Patients with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) detection had a lower onset of empirical antibiotic therapy (35.1% vs. 55.9%, P-value=.042). In addition, cases with RSV or influenza identification required shorter duration of antibiotic therapy (receiving 45.6% \u22652 days vs. 68.8% of those not identified, P=.017). Conclusion The use of respiratory virus diagnostic techniques in our setting can optimise antibiotic use in children admitted with CAP.","publish_time":"2019-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aguilera-Alonso, David; Ill\u00E1n-Ramos, Marta; Daoud, Zarife; Guinea, V\u00EDctor; Culebras, Esther; Ramos, Jos\u00E9 Tom\u00E1s","journal":"Enferm Infecc Microbiol Clin","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3bd99516ae5224d9e5fd59c399cbe56c8ecf01b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102621.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213005X19302332; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213005X19302332","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VRS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["with identification of a respiratory virus in","of respiratory virus diagnostic","of community","in the","total of","of antibiotics","Early identification of respiratory","In addition","virus respiratorios","in children admitted with","Patients with respiratory syncytial virus","could result in","of those not identified","one of the most common","that included paediatric patients admitted with a diagnosis of CAP in a tertiary hospital","detecci\u00F3n de virus respiratorio sincitial","cases with RSV or influenza identification required shorter duration of antibiotic therapy","in our setting can optimise antibiotic","detection had a lower onset of empirical antibiotic therapy","in which antigenic tests and","diagn\u00F3stico de NAC","episodios de NAC","p valor","PCR viral","respiratory sample was performed","Conclusion The","identificaci\u00F3n de VRS","ni\u00F1os ingresados","consumo de antibi\u00F3ticos","casos","or viral PCR on","menor duraci\u00F3n de antibioterapia","pacientes pedi\u00E1tricos ingresados","hospital terciario","were included","menor inicio de antibioterapia emp\u00EDrica","identificaci\u00F3n precoz","Abstract Introduction Viruses","June","acquired pneumonia","retrospective study from January","receiving","uso de t\u00E9cnicas diagn\u00F3sticas","Methods Observational","neumon\u00EDa adquirida","comunidad","medio","test antig\u00E9nico","muestra respiratoria","causas","days","disminuci\u00F3n","M\u00E9todos Estudio observacional","Conclusi\u00F3n","Results","Resultados","Resumen Introducci\u00F3n","value","d\u00EDas"],"language":"es"}]}

Through a combined modelling approach, we estimate the rates of generation of cases along the zoonotic and human-to-human transmission routes and assess their spatiotemporal heterogeneity. We consider all cases notified to WHO from March 2012 to mid-September 2014. We use a stochastic modelling of the time series of case incidence in the Middle East region to estimate time- and space-dependent zoonotic and human-to-human transmission parameters. The model also accounts for possible lack of identification of secondary transmissions among notified cases. This approach is combined with the analysis of imported cases out of the region to assess the rate of underreporting of cases. Out of a total of 32 possible models, based on different parameterisation and scenario considered, the best-fit model is characterised by a large heterogeneity in time and across space for both zoonotic and human-to-human transmission. The variation in time that occurred during Spring 2014 led to a 17-fold and 3-fold increase in the two transmissions, respectively, bringing the reproductive rate to values above 1 during that period for all regions under study. The model suggests that 75% of MERS-CoV cases are secondary cases (human-to-human transmission), which is substantially higher than the 34% of reported cases with an epidemiological link to another case. Overall, estimated reporting rate is 0.26. Our findings show a higher level of spatial heterogeneity in zoonotic transmission compared to human-to-human, highlighting the strong environmental component of the epidemic. Since sporadic introductions are predicted to be a small proportion of notified cases and are responsible for triggering secondary transmissions, a more comprehensive understanding of zoonotic source and path of transmission could be critical to limit the epidemic spread.","publish_time":"2016-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Poletto, Chiara; Colizza, Vittoria; Bo\u00EBlle, Pierre-Yves","journal":"Epidemics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce47e304a5785dda198150336544b300b4c91cdd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104927.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436515000961; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1755436515000961; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2015.12.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27266844/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs4OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["secondary cases","human transmission routes","human transmission parameters","zoonotic transmission","reported cases","MERS-CoV cases","analysis of imported cases","small proportion of notified cases","path of transmission","Abstract MERS coronavirus cases","secondary transmissions","space-dependent zoonotic","Middle East region","time series of case incidence","comprehensive understanding of zoonotic source","large heterogeneity","spatiotemporal heterogeneity","rate of underreporting","combined modelling approach","reproductive rate","higher level of spatial heterogeneity","possible lack of identification","best-fit model","estimated reporting rate","possible models","stochastic modelling","fold increase","epidemic spread","different parameterisation","scenario","strong environmental component","epidemiological link","rates of generation","findings","variations","period","regions","study","total","Spring","geography","sporadic introductions"],"language":"en"},

Multiple health issues are linked with the purification of drinking water supplied through different ways including bottled water, tap water, and borewells. The drinking water is most often contaminated with pathogenic microbes including bacteria, viruses, and protozoa beyond the recommended limits causing serious human health hazards. The pathogenic microbes commonly detected in water supplies include those related to dysentery, typhoid fever, vomiting, and cholera. Therefore, removal of human pathogens from drinking water is essential for health security. Numbers of physical and chemical techniques have been developed to make available the pathogen free drinking water. Techniques employing membranes for trapping hazardous biological contaminant are currently gaining momentum worldwide.

Rapid development and spread of various multi drug-resistant strains of Mtb emphasize that an effective vaccine is still the most cost-effectives and efficient way of controlling and eradicating TB. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the only licensed TB vaccine, still remains the most widely administered human vaccine, but is inefficient in protecting from pulmonary TB in adults. The protective immunity afforded by BCG is thought to wane with time and considered to last only through adolescent years. Heterologous boosting of BCG-primed immune responses using a subunit vaccine represents a promising vaccination approach to promote strong cellular responses against Mtb. In our earlier studies, we discovered lipopeptides of ESAT-6 antigen with strong potential as a subunit vaccine candidate. Here, we have investigated that potential as a booster to BCG vaccine in both a pre-exposure preventive vaccine and a post-exposure therapeutic vaccine setting. Surprisingly, our results demonstrated that boosting BCG with subunit vaccine shortly before Mtb challenge did not improve the BCG-primed immunity, whereas the subunit vaccine boost after Mtb challenge markedly improved the quantity and quality of effector T cell responses and significantly reduced Mtb load in lungs, liver and spleen in mice. These studies suggest that ESAT-6 lipopeptide-based subunit vaccine was ineffective in overcoming the apparent immunomodulation induced by BCG vaccine in Mtb uninfected mice, but upon infection, the subunit vaccine is effective in re-educating the protective immunity against Mtb infection. These important results have significant implications in the design and investigation of effective vaccine strategies and immunotherapeutic approaches for individuals who have been pre-immunized with BCG vaccine but still get infected with Mtb.","publish_time":"2018-10-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gupta, Nancy; Garg, Saurabh; Vedi, Satish; Kunimoto, Dennis Y.; Kumar, Rakesh; Agrawal, Babita","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ec733f3684d6294483b03df183878ad777a78d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6198790.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30386336/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02371","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs5MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BCG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BCG vaccine","human vaccine","subunit vaccine boost","subunit vaccine candidate","licensed TB vaccine","lipopeptide-based subunit vaccine","Mtb challenge","Mtb infection","pre-exposure preventive vaccine","investigation of effective vaccine strategies","BCG-primed immunity","post-exposure therapeutic vaccine setting","Mtb uninfected mice","reduced Mtb load","Heterologous boosting of BCG","protective immunity","pulmonary TB","eradicating TB","various multi drug-resistant strains of Mtb","strong cellular responses","primed immune responses","strong potential","lipopeptides of ESAT","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","important results","earlier studies","quality of effector T cell responses","design","promising vaccination approach","lungs","liver","quantity","individuals","immunotherapeutic approaches","significant implications","efficient way","infectious disease","antigen","apparent immunomodulation","spleen","cost-effectives","Rapid development","Bacillus Calmette-Guerin","booster","adults","people","adolescent years","day","time"],"language":"en"},

Summary The University Hospitals of Geneva is the largest hospital complex in Switzerland and is coupled to the Faculty of medicine of the University of Geneva. The division of adult intensive care is a 32-bed mixed medical and surgical ICU, made of three different units: one neurocritical care unit, one cardiovascular unit, and one polyvalent unit receiving patients that do not fit into the two previous units. More than 2200 patients are hospitalised yearly in the division of adult intensive care, staying a mean of 4 days. The ICU mortality rate is 7.5% for a mean SAPS2 of 44 points. A fourth non-geographical unit with dedicated doctors and nurses is dedicated to the specific needs of \u201Clong-stayers\u201D and their next of kin and to the organisation of post-ICU clinics, 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge. Nurses follow a special ICU training of 2 years, and obtain an ICU nurse certificate. One nurse takes care of 1.5 patients during the day and 2 patients during night shifts. The ICU division is a training centre for doctors to become intensivists and a centre for quality clinical research.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pugin, J\u00E9r\u00F4me","journal":"Anesth\u00E9sie \u0026 R\u00E9animation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2cc5edbddf62154d1e40ef0d7530ca1dbbd2ea34.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352580020300034; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352580020300034","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["Switzerland"],"keyphrases":["ICU division","journ\u00E9e et","patients annuellement","service est","surgical ICU","ICU discharge","service m\u00E9dico-chirurgical et","intensivistes suisses et","special ICU training","ICU nurse certificate","Suisse et est coupl\u00E9 \u00E0","m\u00E9decine intensive cardiovasculaire et une unit\u00E9 polyvalente s\u2019occupant","Une quatri\u00E8me unit\u00E9","neurocritical care unit","division of adult intensive care","ICU mortality rate","training centre","infirmi\u00E8res sont sp\u00E9cialis\u00E9es en soins intensifs et s\u2019occupent en moyenne","organisation of post-ICU clinics","cardiovascular unit","soins intensifs adultes est","polyvalent unit","service accueille","non-geographical unit","Gen\u00E8ve","nurses","University of Geneva","dedicated doctors","mean SAPS2","points","lits r\u00E9partis en trois unit\u00E9s","consultation post-r\u00E9animation","University Hospitals of Geneva","neuro-r\u00E9animation","long s\u00E9jour","different units","SAPS2 moyen","previous units","non-g\u00E9ographique celle-l\u00E0","n\u2019ont pas","malades","Facult\u00E9","leurs proches ainsi que","besoins sp\u00E9cifiques","sp\u00E9cificit\u00E9s","intensivists","largest hospital complex","bed mixed medical","formation","years","deux autres secteurs","recherche clinique","complexe hospitalier universitaire","Switzerland","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","l\u2019Universit\u00E9","mois apr\u00E8s l\u2019hospitalisation","months","quality clinical research","stayers","specific needs","kin","Faculty of medicine","Summary","night shifts","jours","nuit","qualit\u00E9","mortalit\u00E9","taux","days"],"language":"en"},

Early and accurate diagnosis is essential for reducing the risk of severe complications and death. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the case diagnosis situation among medical care institutions and geographical regions in China, and the results will benefit both clinical practice and the disease surveillance system. METHODS: We extracted individual scrub typhus case data 2006\u20132016 from a national disease surveillance system in China. The diagnosis category and interval time from illness onset to diagnosis were compared among three levels of medical care institutions and provinces. The descriptive analysis method was performed in our study. RESULTS: During the 11-year study period, 93 481 scrub typhus cases, including 57 deaths, were recorded in the nationwide surveillance system. The overall proportion of laboratory-confirmed cases was only 4.7%, and this proportion varied greatly among primary medical centres (2.8%), county level hospitals (4.2%), and city level hospitals (6.3%). Notably, the proportion of laboratory-confirmed cases has consistently decreased from 16.3% in 2006 to 2.6% in 2016, and the same decreasing trend was found among all three levels of medical care institutions. The interval from illness onset to case diagnosis (T(diag)) for all cases was 5 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 2\u20139 days) and decreased from 7 days (IQR: 3\u201311 days) in 2006 to 5 days (IQR: 2\u20138 days) in 2016. The risk of death for patients with a T(diag) of \u003E 7 days was 2.2 times higher (OR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.05\u20135.21) than that of patients with a T(diag) of \u003C 2 days. CONCLUSIONS: The interval time from illness onset to diagnosis for scrub typhus cases decreased greatly in China; however, the diagnosis rate of cases with laboratory-confirmed results must be increased among all levels of medical care institutions to reduce both the risk of death and the misuse of antibiotics associated with scrub typhus.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of viral co\u2010infections in dogs with BP and to assess demographic or clinical variables as well as disease severity associated with viral co\u2010infections. ANIMALS: Twenty household dogs with BP caused by opportunistic bacteria and 13 dogs with chronic (\u003E30 days) tracheobronchitis caused by Bordetella bronchiseptica (BBTB). METHODS: Prospective cross\u2010sectional observational study. Diagnosis was confirmed by clinical and laboratory findings, diagnostic imaging, and cytologic and microbiologic analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage or transtracheal wash fluid. Canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), canine adenovirus, canine herpes virus, canine influenzavirus, canine distemper virus, canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) and canine pneumovirus, as well as B. bronchiseptica and Mycoplasma spp. were analyzed in respiratory samples using PCR assays. RESULTS: CPIV was detected in 7/20 and CRCoV in 1/20 dogs with BP. Respiratory viruses were not detected in dogs with BBTB. There were no significant differences in clinical variables between BP dogs with and without a viral co\u2010infection. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Respiratory viruses were found frequently in dogs with BP and may therefore play an important role in the etiology and pathogenesis of BP.

Henipaviruses have been observed both naturally and experimentally to cause serious and often fatal disease in many different mammal species, including humans. Interestingly, infection of the flying fox with henipaviruses occurs in the absence of clinical disease. The extreme variation in the disease pattern between humans and bats has led to an investigation into the effects of henipavirus infection on the innate immune response in bat cell lines. We report that henipavirus infection does not result in the induction of interferon expression, and the viruses also inhibit interferon signaling. We also confirm that the interferon production and signaling block in bat cells is not due to differing viral protein expression levels between human and bat hosts. This information, in addition to the known lack of clinical signs in bats following henipavirus infection, suggests that bats control henipavirus infection by an as yet unidentified mechanism, not via the interferon response. This is the first report of henipavirus infection in bat cells specifically investigating aspects of the innate immune system.","publish_time":"2011-07-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Virtue, Elena R.; Marsh, Glenn A.; Baker, Michelle L.; Wang, Lin-Fa","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd9051e7bcf001955cb7625a5b2c51ddf58218dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3139658.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0022488; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21811620/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["report of henipavirus infection","bats control henipavirus infection","effects of henipavirus infection","bat cells","interferon response","bat hosts","interferon production","induction of interferon expression","innate immune response","bat cell lines","emerged henipaviruses","absence of clinical disease","fatal disease","disease pattern","humans","innate immune system","Nipah viruses","known lack of clinical signs","viral protein expression levels","spectrum of infectious zoonotic diseases","aspects","different mammal species","natural reservoirs","addition","Hendra","block","unidentified mechanism","investigation","extreme variation","flying fox","information"],"language":"en"},

Fingolimod medication was stopped. On the intensive care unit, non-invasive ventilation was used to provide oxygen and ventilation support regularly. Over the following two days, oxygenation improved, and the patient was transferred to a normal ward five days after admission. Conclusion : The implications fingolimod has on COVID-19 are complex. As an S1P analogue, fingolimod might enhance lung endothelial cell integrity. In addition, in case of a so-called cytokine storm, immunomodulation might be beneficial to reduce mortality. Future studies are needed to explore the risks and therapeutic effects of fingolimod in COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Foerch, Christian; Friedauer, Lucie; Bauer, Boris; Wolf, Timo; Adam, Elisabeth H.","journal":"Mult Scler Relat Disord","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2cf504ba3d01dd8500623b8335e1afd7d9d49953.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202802.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221103482030256X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408155/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102180; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221103482030256X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Fingolimod treatment","Fingolimod medication","implications fingolimod","therapeutic effects of fingolimod","patients","multiple sclerosis","Long-term treatment","severe COVID","days","multiple ground-glass opacities","year old female patient","non-invasive ventilation","ventilation support","relapsing","risk of herpes virus reactivation","bilateral interstitial pneumonia","chest","respiratory tract infections","total lymphocytes","immune therapy","immunomodulation","so-called cytokine storm","small increase","peripheral lymphopenia typical","lung endothelial cell integrity","case","intensive care unit","risks","normal ward","Extended Disability Status Scale","S1P analogue","admission","nL","oxygenation","coronavirus disease","Abstract Background","addition","mortality","Conclusion","Future studies","Methods","results"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, significant economic losses can result from this disease due to high mortality rates, high medical costs, and low weight gain. To avoid a fatal outcome of the disease, it is crucial that vulnerable calves are identified as early as possible. Interleukin-6 is described as an early and reliable prognostic marker in several diseases. In this study, 20 scouring calves were tested by ELISA for their IL-6 serum concentrations. Samples were collected twice, at the beginning of diarrhea and 7 to 10d later. Regarding the clinical outcome after 7 to 10d, calves were classified as recovered or nonrecovered. A receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted to determine the prognostic value of IL-6 for the progress of clinical symptoms. At the beginning of diarrhea, the IL-6 concentration was significantly higher in nonrecovering calves compared with those that recover 7 to 10d after the onset of diarrhea. Interleukin-6 proved to be a useful additional parameter in the clinical examination. High initial IL-6 values can support the decision for closer monitoring and an adapted therapeutic strategy for the respective calves.

They also used it in many associated pathological conditions such as consolidation, pleural effusion, and interstitial syndrome with some reports of more accuracy than chest X-ray. This systematic review and meta-analysis are aimed to estimate the pooled diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for the diagnosis of pneumonia versus the standard chest radiological imaging. METHODS AND MAIN RESULTS: A systematic literature search was conducted for all published studies comparing the diagnostic accuracy of LUS against a reference Chest radiological exam (C X-ray or Chest computed Tomography CT scan), combined with clinical criteria for pneumonia in all age groups. Eligible studies were required to have a Chest X-ray and/or CT scan at the time of clinical evaluation. The authors extracted qualitative and quantitative information from eligible studies, and calculated pooled sensitivity and specificity and pooled positive/negative likelihood ratios (LR). Twenty studies containing 2513 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled estimates for lung ultrasound in the diagnosis of pneumonia were, respectively, as follows: Overall pooled sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of pneumonia by lung ultrasound were 0.85 (0.84\u20130.87) and 0.93 (0.92\u20130.95), respectively. Overall pooled positive and negative LRs were 11.05 (3.76\u201332.50) and 0.08 (0.04\u20130.15), pooled diagnostic Odds ratio was 173.64 (38.79\u2013777.35), and area under the pooled ROC (AUC for SROC) was 0.978. CONCLUSION: Point of care lung ultrasound is an accurate tool for the diagnosis of pneumonia. Considering being easy, readily availability, low cost, and free from radiological hazards, it can be considered as important diagnostic strategy in this condition.","publish_time":"2017-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alzahrani, Saeed Ali; Al-Salamah, Majid Abdulatief; Al-Madani, Wedad Hussain; Elbarbary, Mahmoud A.","journal":"Crit Ultrasound J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1039a57c4d17c0c4eebcff505014cb5f11917cf1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5328906.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13089-017-0059-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28244009/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsxNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SROC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of pneumonia","pooled diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound","pooled sensitivity","pooled ROC","pooled estimates","chest X-ray","diagnosing pneumonia","pooled diagnostic Odds ratio","point of care lung ultrasound","diagnostic accuracy of LUS","Eligible studies","reference Chest radiological exam","standard chest radiological imaging","published studies","Chest computed Tomography CT scan","C X-ray","specificity","radiological hazards","important diagnostic strategy","meta-analysis","clinical criteria","accurate tool","negative LRs","systematic review","available tool","negative likelihood ratios","systematic literature search","time of clinical evaluation","consolidation","pleural effusion","low cost","interstitial syndrome","MAIN RESULTS","quantitative information","reports","associated pathological conditions","availability","AUC","critical situations","CONCLUSION","age groups","authors","METHODS","Physicians","area","SROC","subjects","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Since the declaration of victory in the war against infectious diseases in 1967, approximately 50 new disease agents have been identified. Nearly every type of etiologic agent and clinical manifestation have been involved including acute respiratory infections (e.g., H5N1 influenza A, SARS, hantaviral cardiopulmonary syndrome, and Legionnaires\u2019 disease), central nervous system involvement (e.g., West Nile encephalitis, Nipah virus encephalitis, and prion diseases), enteric infections (e.g., Helicobacter pylori gastric and duodenal diseases, cryptosporidiosis, microsporidioses, and Shiga toxin diseases), systemic bacterial diseases (e.g., Lyme disease, six new rickettsioses, three new human ehrlichioses, bartonelloses, and staphylococcal and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome), viral hemorrhagic fevers (e.g., Marburg, Ebola, Lassa, Bolivian, Argentine, and Venezuelan hemorrhagic fevers), human retroviral infections (e.g., HIV1 and 2 and HTLV-I and II), new human herpesviruses (HHV6, HHV7, and HHV8), and the viral agents of hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. There are the reciprocal threats that a bioterror agent (e.g., smallpox virus) could cause a newly emerging infectious disease (EID) and that an agent of emerging infections (e.g., SARS-coronavirus or Rift Valley fever virus) could be disseminated by terrorists. Vaccines offer a critically important potential countermeasure against the effects of these and future EIDs. An aggressive approach to developing prototype vaccines against each new class of etiologic agent must be driven by public health initiatives because commercial interests will not undertake these projects. The microbe must be completely characterized biologically, molecularly, and genetically. An accurate animal model of the human infectious disease should be developed. The mechanisms of vaccine-induced protective immunity must be elucidated and the antigens that stimulate these mechanisms of protective immune memory identified. Preclinical testing of vaccine candidates should then be completed in the animal models. It would be most effective if subunit vaccine platforms were developed in which new antigen cassettes could be inserted and FDA approval obtained using one or more prototypes. Experience in manufacturing and a track record of effectiveness and safety for vaccines against numerous emerging infectious agents could be achieved for veterinary diseases caused by organisms that also cause emerging human infections (e.g., West Nile virus and ehrlichioses). In the United States, these approaches are driven currently by individual investigator initiative in pursuing the scientific questions through grants from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Progress occurs, but not at the desired level.

Common and novel respiratory viruses can occasionally cause epidemics of viral pneumonitis with severe acute respiratory symptoms (sars). In 2003, World Health Organisation (WHO) coined the word SARS for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in patients with a relevant travel/contact history and sars. The WHO case definition of suspected SARS was fever, respiratory symptoms and close contact with SARS patients or travel history to an epidemic area. The clinical features are essentially the same as for any respiratory viral infections or pneumonitis. Since 2003, many new surveillance guidelines and confusing abbreviations appeared in the city of Hong Kong. In 2012, another outbreak of coronavirus pneumonitis occurred in the Middle-East. More case definitions such as MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and SARI (Severe Acute Respiratory Infections) were coined for the viral pneumonitis. In medicine, a definition or syndrome representing \u201Ca constellation of symptomatology seen in association\u201D should stand the trial of time after it is coined. Health organisations should provide consistent definitions for index surveillance, epidemiological and prognostication studies.

Serum procalcitonin (PCT) could be a useful tool for selecting patients with a lower probability of developing bacterial infection, but its measurement has not been investigated in this population. METHODS: We conducted a single center prospective cohort study in consecutive COPD patients admitted to the ICU for AECOPD between September 2005 and September 2006. Sputum samples or tracheal aspirates were tested for the presence of bacteria and viruses. PCT levels were measured at the time of admittance, six hours, and 24 hours using a sensitive immunoassay. RESULTS: Thirty nine AECOPD patients were included, 31 of which (79%) required a ventilator support at admission. The median [25%\u201375% interquartile range] PCT level, assessed in 35/39 patients, was: 0.096 \u03BCg/L [IQR, 0.065 to 0.178] at the time of admission, 0.113 \u03BCg/L [IQR, 0.074 to 0.548] at six hours, and 0.137 \u03BCg/L [IQR, 0.088 to 0.252] at 24 hours. The highest PCT (PCTmax) levels were less than 0.1 \u03BCg/L in 14/35 (40%) patients and more than 0.25 \u03BCg/L in 10/35 (29%) patients, suggesting low and high probability of bacterial infection, respectively. Five species of bacteria and nine species of viruses were detected in 12/39 (31%) patients. Among the four patients positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one had a PCTmax less than 0.25 \u03BCg/L and three had a PCTmax less than 0.1 \u03BCg/L. The one patient positive for Haemophilus influenzae had a PCTmax more than 0.25 \u03BCg/L. The presence or absence of viruses did not influence PCT at time of admission (0.068 vs 0.098 \u03BCg/L respectively, P = 0.80). CONCLUSION: The likelihood of bacterial infection is low among COPD patients admitted to ICU for AECOPD (40% with PCT \u003C 0.1 \u03BCg/L) suggesting a possible inappropriate use of antibiotics. Further studies are necessary to assess the impact of a procalcitonin-based therapeutic strategy in critically ill COPD patients.","publish_time":"2008-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Daubin, C\u00E9dric; Parienti, Jean-Jacques; Vabret, Astrid; Ramakers, Michel; Fradin, Sabine; Terzi, Nicolas; Freymuth, Fran\u00E7ois; Charbonneau, Pierre; du Cheyron, Damien","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de707f97b534ca340482600ed1f008b20d7b1b8e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2577677.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-8-145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18947382/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsxNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u03BCg","AECOPD patients","patients positive","consecutive COPD patients","ill COPD patients","PCT levels","PCTmax","hours","highest PCT","ICU","time of admission","IQR","species of viruses","likelihood of bacterial infection","high probability of bacterial infection","presence of bacteria","absence of viruses","time of admittance","species of bacteria","lower probability","patient positive","Serum procalcitonin","possible inappropriate use of antibiotics","severe acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","single center prospective cohort study","therapeutic strategy","intensive care units","impact","tracheal aspirates","Haemophilus influenzae","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","useful tool","Sputum samples","interquartile range","CONCLUSION","vs","studies","METHODS","BACKGROUND","ventilator support","sensitive immunoassay","measurement","RESULTS","median","population"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we investigated the symptoms, herbal formulae, herbal drugs, and their relationships in this treatise based on a multi-subnet composited complex network model (MCCN). Syndrome subnets were constructed for the symptoms and a formula subnet for herbal drugs. By subnet compounding using MCCN, a composited network was obtained that described the treatment relationships between syndromes and formulae. The results obtained by topological analysis suggested some prescription laws that could be validated in clinics. After subnet reduction using the MCCN, six channel (Tai-yang, Yang-ming, Shao-yang, Tai-yin, Shao-yin, and Jue-yin) subnets were obtained. By analyzing the strengths of the relationships among these six channel subnets, we found that the Tai-yang channel and Yang-ming channel were related most strongly with each other, and we found symptoms that implied pathogen movements and transformations among the six channels. This study could help therapists to obtain a deeper understanding of this ancient treatise.","publish_time":"2016-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shao, Feng-jing; Sui, Yi; Zhou, Yong-hong; Sun, Ren-cheng","journal":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8baeff5aad4833fcc6df2ff34ae870f5c8b50b12.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126833.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437116301133; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2016.03.115; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378437116301133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288101/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Tai-yang channel","Yang-ming channel","Shao-yang","channel subnets","symptoms","Tai-yin","MCCN","Shao-yin","herbal drugs","multi-subnet","herbal formulae","subnet compounding","formula subnet","subnet reduction","Jue-yin","ancient treatise","composited network","treatment relationships","Syndrome subnets","study","complex network model","Cold Damage Disorder","transformations","underlying principles","implied pathogen movements","topological analysis","deeper understanding","prescription laws","therapists","syndromes","results","Abstract","channels","clinics","strengths"],"language":"en"},

Human AstVs were regarded the causative agent of viral diarrhea in children. In dogs, little is known about the epidemiology and clinical significance of AstV infection. FINDINGS: In this study, we collected and tested 253 rectal swabs from pet dogs; of which 64 samples (25.3%) tested positive for AstVs with diarrhea and 15 more samples (5.9%) also was identified as AstVs, however without any clinical signs. Phylogenetic analysis of 39 partial ORF1b sequences from these samples revealed that they are similar to AstVs, which can be subdivided into three lineages. Interestingly, out of the 39 isolates sequenced, 16 isolates are shown to be in the Mamastrovirus 5/canine astrovirus (CAstV) lineage and the remaining 23 isolates displayed higher similarities with known porcine astrovirus (PoAstV) 5 and 2. Further, analysis of 13 capsid sequences from these isolates showed that they are closely clustered with Chinese or Italy CAstV isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that CAstVs commonly circulate in pet dogs, and our sequencing results have shown the genomic diversity of CAstVs leading to increasing number of clusters.","publish_time":"2017-08-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Huabo; Liu, Lin; Li, Ruikai; Qin, Yifeng; Fang, Qingli; Balasubramaniam, Vinod RMT; Wang, Guojun; Wei, Zuzhang; Ouyang, Kang; Huang, Weijian; Chen, Ying","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8badcfcd8aba68dceea84099e3d0f733e050109f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5559842.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28814340/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-017-0823-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["samples","Human AstVs","Italy CAstV isolates","pet dogs","FINDINGS","known porcine astrovirus","canine astrovirus","capsid sequences","Phylogenetic analysis","clinical signs","genomic diversity of CAstVs","partial ORF1b sequences","causative agent of viral diarrhea","clinical significance of AstV infection","higher similarities","sequencing results","epidemiology","increasing number of clusters","children","PoAstV","cause gastroenteritis","animal species","Mamastrovirus","rectal swabs","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","Astroviruses","study","lineages"],"language":"en"},

Clinical knowledge of severe CAP and acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by HAdV-55 is still limited, though the pathogen has been fully characterized by whole-genome sequencing. METHODS: We conducted a multicentre retrospective review of all consecutive patients with severe CAP caused by HAdV in immunocompetent adults admitted to the Emergency Department Intensive Care Unit of two hospitals in Northern China between February 2012 and April 2014. Clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics, treatments and outcomes of these patients were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 15 consecutive severe CAP patients with laboratory-confirmed adenovirus infections were included. The median age was 30 years and all cases were identified during the winter and spring seasons. HAdV-55 was the most frequently (11/15) detected HAdV type. Persistent high fever, cough and rapid progression of dyspnea were typically reported in these patients. Significantly increased pneumonia severity index (PSI), respiratory rate, and lower PaO(2)/FiO(2), hypersensitive CRP were reported in non-survivors compared to survivors (P = 0.013, 0.022, 0.019 and 0.026, respectively). The rapid development of bilateral consolidations within 10 days after illness onset were the most common radiographic finding, usually accompanied by adjacent ground glass opacities and pleural effusions. Total mortality was 26.7% in this study. Corticosteroids were prescribed to 14 patients in this report, but the utilization rate between survivors and non-survivors was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: HAdV and the HAdV-55 sub-type play an important role among viral pneumonia pathogens in hospitalized immunocompetent adults in Northern China. HAdV should be tested in severe CAP patients with negative bacterial cultures and a lack of response to antibiotic treatment, even if radiologic imaging and clinical presentation initially suggest bacterial pneumonia.","publish_time":"2016-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Dingyu; Zhu, Huadong; Fu, Yangyang; Tong, Fei; Yao, Dongqi; Walline, Joseph; Xu, Jun; Yu, Xuezhong","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3bd56ae4a76caf910da9be6266e18b74308364b6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4788423.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26967644/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0151199","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Emergency Department Intensive Care"],"locations":["Northern China"],"keyphrases":["HAdV type","consecutive severe CAP patients","consecutive patients","Clinical knowledge of severe CAP","Severe community","bacterial pneumonia","non-survivors","hospitalized immunocompetent adults","viral pneumonia pathogens","respiratory rate","laboratory","clinical presentation","Northern China","sub-type","increased pneumonia severity index","utilization rate","human adenovirus","adenovirus infections","Total mortality","negative bacterial cultures","rapid progression of dyspnea","acute respiratory distress syndrome","rapid development of bilateral consolidations","important role","Emergency Department Intensive Care Unit","illness onset","cough","hospitals","PSI","adjacent ground glass opacities","lack of response","radiologic imaging","days","pleural effusions","antibiotic treatment","radiological characteristics","treatments","multicentre retrospective review","common radiographic finding","Persistent high fever","FiO","lower PaO","outcomes","hypersensitive CRP","winter","years","cases","increasing concerns","report","BACKGROUND","median age","spring seasons","METHODS","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","genome sequencing","study","Corticosteroids"],"language":"en"},

Comparative analysis of these strategies provides insight into mechanisms of action and suggests aspects of cGAS\u2013STING regulation and immune evasion that remain to be discovered.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eaglesham, James B; Kranzusch, Philip J","journal":"Curr Opin Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/87362d455a7ad464a5a4f16679e29d2e9c5e9093.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ebb03b46a514176b9082a97579c1761ba5077f7e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7158794.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32339908/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0952791520300406; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952791520300406?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coi.2020.04.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsyOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Interferon Genes"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["STING sensing","steps of cGAS","cellular cGAS","aspects of cGAS","STING regulation","STING activation","STING signal transduction","post-translational modification of cGAS","diverse pathogens","pathway of cytosolic DNA sensing","masking of cytosolic DNA ligands","mechanisms of action","convergent mechanisms","discovered regulatory features","context","Stimulator of Interferon Genes","strategies","insight","AMP synthase","mammalian cells","pathogen inhibitors of innate immunity","numerous factors","cyclic GMP","cGAMP","degradation","immune evasion","messenger","Comparative analysis","infection"],"language":"en"},

The aims of our study were to assess left ventricular (LV) dynamic myocardial deformation and diastolic reserve at rest and upon exercise, along with OB determination in this patients subset. METHODS: Conventional echocardiography, Doppler myocardial imaging and LV 2D speckle tracking echocardiography were performed in 55 OSA patients with preserved LV ejection fraction (EF) and 35 age and sex-comparable healthy controls. Peripheral OB levels were evaluated by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Despite comparable LVEF, LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) was significantly reduced in OSA at rest (\u2212 13.4 \u00B1 3.8 vs \u2212 18.4 \u00B1 3.3 in controls, P \u003C 0.001) and at peak exercise (\u2212 15.8 \u00B1 2.6 vs \u2212 23.4 \u00B1 4.3, P \u003C 0.001). Systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) and E/E\u2032 ratios increase during effort were higher in OSA than in controls (\u0394sPAP 44.3% \u00B1 6.4 vs 32.3% \u00B1 5.5, P \u003C 0.0001, and \u0394E/E\u2019 87.5% \u00B1 3.5 vs 25.4% \u00B1 3.3, P \u003C 0.0001, respectively). The best correlate of E/E\u2032 at peak stress was peak exertion capacity (r = \u2212 0.50, P \u003C 0.001). OB was also increased in OSA patients (P = 0.001) but, unlike OSA severity, was not associated with LV diastolic dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of diastolic function and myocardial deformation during exercise is feasible through stress echocardiography. OSA patients with preserved LVEF show subclinical LV systolic dysfunction, impaired LV systolic and diastolic reserve, reduced exercise tolerance, and increased peripheral levels of OB. Therapy aimed at increasing LV diastolic function reserve might improve the quality of life and exercise tolerability in OSA patients.","publish_time":"2020-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"D\u2019Andrea, Antonello; Canora, Angelo; Sperlongano, Simona; Galati, Domenico; Zanotta, Serena; Polistina, Giorgio Emanuele; Nicoletta, Carmine; Ghinassi, Giacomo; Galderisi, Maurizio; Zamparelli, Alessandro Sanduzzi; Lancellotti, Patrizio; Bocchino, Marialuisa","journal":"BMC Pulm Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c7ada8bfcdce6b47c8ad3fa6cdc22dcf0d1fe0c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103071.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32223761/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12890-020-1099-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjszMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OB","LV","OSA","LVEF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["OSA patients","LV diastolic dysfunction","OSA severity","subclinical LV systolic dysfunction","impaired LV systolic","diastolic reserve","peak exercise","vs","increasing LV diastolic function reserve","patients subset","preserved LV ejection fraction","exercise tolerability","LV global longitudinal strain","Evaluation of diastolic function","reduced exercise tolerance","Peripheral OB levels","stress echocardiography","peak stress","OB determination","dynamic myocardial deformation","increased peripheral levels of","best correlate of E","subclinical cardiac dysfunction","Doppler myocardial imaging","myocardial oxygen supply","preserved LVEF","comparable LVEF","Conventional echocardiography","rest","sex-comparable healthy controls","peak exertion capacity","increased oxidative burst","Systolic pulmonary artery pressure","D speckle tracking echocardiography","obstructive sleep apnea","Therapy","age","quality of life","cardiovascular complications","GLS","BACKGROUND","Hypoxia","METHODS","ratios","effort","flow cytometry","study","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","\u0394sPAP","\u0394E","aims"],"language":"en"},

There appears to be two features involved in this activity situated at opposite surfaces of the molecule: a positively charged patch and a hydrophobic pocket with an exposed tryptophan side-chain. Other previously published work suggests a conformational change in P when it binds to N-RNA, which may imply the repositioning of two helices that would expose a hydrophobic groove for interaction with N. This domain of rabies virus P is structurally unrelated to the N-RNA binding domains of the phosphoproteins of Sendai and measles virus that are members of the same order of viruses, the non-segmented negative strand RNA viruses.

However, the prevalence of subtler forms of neurocognitive dysfunction, which together with HAD are termed HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), continues to escalate in the post-cART era. The microgliosis, astrogliosis, dendritic damage, and synaptic and neuronal loss observed in autopsy cases suggest an underlying neuroinflammatory process, due to the neurotoxic factors released by HIV-infected/activated macrophages/ microglia in the brain, might underlie the pathogenesis of HAND in the post-cART era. These factors are known to induce the integrated stress response (ISR) in several neurodegenerative diseases; we have previously shown that BiP, an indicator of general ISR activation, is upregulated in cortical autopsy tissue from HIV-infected patients. The ISR is composed of three pathways, each with its own initiator protein: PERK, IRE1\u03B1 and ATF6. METHODS: To further elucidate the specific ISR pathways activated in the central nervous system of HAND patients, we examined the protein levels of several ISR proteins, including ATF6, peIF2\u03B1 and ATF4, in cortical tissue from HIV-infected patients. RESULTS: The ISR does not respond in an all-or-none fashion in HAND, but rather demonstrates a nuanced activation pattern. Specifically, our studies implicate the ATF6 pathway of the ISR as a more likely candidate than the PERK pathway for increases in BiP levels in astrocytes. CONCLUSION: These findings begin to characterize the nature of the ISR response in HAND and provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention in this disease.","publish_time":"2012-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Akay, C.; Lindl, K.

The primary endpoint is the accuracy of cross-validated prediction for positive respiratory cultures in patients that are suspected of VAP, with a sensitivity of at least 99% (high negative predictive value). DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, BreathDx is the first study powered to investigate whether molecular analysis of breath can be used to classify suspected VAP patients with and without positive microbiological cultures with 99% sensitivity. TRIAL REGISTRATION: UKCRN ID number 19086, registered May 2015; as well as registration at www.trialregister.nl under the acronym \u2018BreathDx\u2019 with trial ID number NTR 6114 (retrospectively registered on 28 October 2016).","publish_time":"2017-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Oort, Pouline M.

The data of 473 patients from 11 centers in 5 different countries underwent interventions for urinary stones during the Covid-19 pandemic was collected and analyzed retrospectively. Information on the type of the stone related conditions, management strategies, anesthesiologic evaluation, anesthesia methods, and any alterations related to COVID-19 pandemic was collected. During the preoperative anesthesia evaluation thorax CT was performed in 268 (56.7%) and PCR from nasopharyngeal swab was performed in 31 (6.6%) patients. General anesthesia was applied in 337 (71.2%) patients and alteration in the method of anesthesia was recorded in 45 (9.5%) patients. A cut-off value of 21 days was detected for the hospitals to adapt changes related to COVID-19. Rate of preoperative testing, emergency procedures, conservative approaches and topical/regional anesthesia increased after 21 days. The preoperative evaluation for management of urinary stone disease is significantly affected by COVID-19 pandemic. There is significant alteration in anesthesia methods and interventions. The optimal methods for preoperative evaluation are still unknown and there is discordance between different centers. It takes 21 days for hospitals and surgeons to adapt and develop new strategies for preoperative evaluation and management of stones.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"G\u00F6kce, Mehmet \u0130lker; Yin, Shanfeng; S\u00F6nmez, Mehmet Giray; Eryildirim, Bilal; Kallidonis, Panagiotis; Petkova, Kremena; Guven, Selcuk; Kiremit, Murat Can; de Lorenzis, Elisa; Tefik, Tzevat; Villa, Luca; Zeng, Guohua; Sarica, Kemal","journal":"Urolithiasis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32436005/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00240-020-01193-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjszOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["preoperative evaluation","anesthesia methods","COVID","preoperative anesthesia evaluation thorax CT","regional anesthesia","method of anesthesia","General anesthesia","pandemic","patients","anesthesiologic evaluation","stone disease interventions","stone related conditions","management of urinary stone disease","management strategies","management of stones","days","Rate of preoperative testing","appropriate management","urinary stones","different centers","optimal methods","hospitals","new strategies","emergent conditions","different countries","significant alteration","conservative approaches","emergency procedures","long term effects","unique condition","kidney functions","up-to-date practice patterns","surgeons","type","alterations","timely manner","discordance","PCR","nasopharyngeal swab","cut-off value","Information","data","changes","study"],"language":"en"},

Recombinant hemagglutinin proteins of H7N9 viruses can be rapidly and efficiently produced with low-level biocontainment facilities. In this study, recombinant H7 antigen was obtained from engineered stable clones of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells for subsequent large-scale production. The stable CHO cell clones were also adapted to grow in serum-free suspension cultures. To improve the immunogenicity of the recombinant H7 antigens, we evaluated the use of a novel combination adjuvant of PELC and CpG (PELC/CpG) to augment the anti-H7N9 immune responses in mice. We compared the effects with other adjuvants such as alum, AddaVax (MF59-like), and several Toll-like receptor ligands such as R848, CpG, and poly (I:C). With the PELC/CpG combination adjuvant, CHO cell-expressed rH7 antigens containing terminally sialylated complex type N-glycans were able to induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies in sera and conferred protection following live virus challenges. These data indicate that the CHO cell-expressed recombinant H7 antigens and a PELC/CpG combination adjuvant can be used for H7N9 subunit vaccine development.","publish_time":"2019-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Ting-Hsuan; Liu, Wen-Chun; Chen, I-Chen; Liu, Chia-Chyi; Huang, Ming-Hsi; Jan, Jia-Tsrong; Wu, Suh-Chin","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/abb3823535316f016054cdbfdcf5e47680e75d0d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115541.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X19302476; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31383491/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X19302476; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.02.040","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs0MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Recombinant","CHO","PELC","PELC/CpG"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["CpG combination adjuvant","recombinant H7 antigens","novel combination adjuvant of PELC","stable CHO cell clones","novel H7N9 avian influenza","Recombinant hemagglutinin proteins of H7N9 viruses","rH7 antigens","anti-H7N9 immune responses","pathogenic avian influenza viruses","H7N9 subunit vaccine development","human infections","wave of infections","engineered stable clones of Chinese Hamster Ovary","live virus challenges","sera","conferred protection","cells","sialylated complex type N-glycans","high titers of neutralizing antibodies","subsequent large-scale production","alum","mice","China","receptor ligands","R848","adjuvants","AddaVax","serum-free suspension cultures","isolates","poly","study","immunogenicity","low-level biocontainment facilities","effects","MF59","Toll","data"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: To investigate the RVs etiology among adolescents and adults with CAP, according to age and pneumonia severity index (PSI), a multi-center, prospective study was conducted from November 2010 to April 2012. Fifteen RVs were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Bacteria were detected by urinary antigen, conventional culture and PCR. RESULTS: Mean (SD) age and median (IQR) PSI score of 954 patients enrolled was 45.2 (19.5) years (range 14\u201394) and 42 (36). RVs were found in 262 patients (27.5%): influenza virus A (IFV A, 9.9%) comprised of pandemic H1N1 (6.7%) and seasonal H3N2 (3.5%), human rhinovirus (4.3%), adenovirus (4.2%), human metapneumovirus (1.8%), parainfluenza virus 1, 3 and 2 (1.7%, 1.5% and 1.2%). Influenza virus B, enterovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human coronavirus and parainfluenza virus 4 were rarely detected (\u003C1%).

A lack of permissive cell lines has limited investigations into WU virus pathogenesis and prevalence. METHODS: The encoding region of the capsid protein VP2 gene was amplified from a WU virus DNA-positive clinical specimen and expressed as a recombinant Histagged protein in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The expressed VP2 was identified by expected molecular weight and immunoreactivity with anti-His monoclonal antibody in Western blotting assay. Serum samples collected from 455 individuals of all ages in Beijing without symptoms of ARI were tested for IgG antibodies against the affinity-purified recombinant VP2 protein by Western blotting to investigate the prevalence of natural WU virus infection. In addition, serum samples from four ARI pediatric patients, whose nasopharyngeal aspirates were positive for WU virus DNA and negative for all other respiratory-related viruses, were tested for IgM antibody against the recombinant VP2. RESULTS: Of the 455 serum samples, 238 reacted with the recombinant VP2, yielding an overall positive rate of 52.3% for IgG against VP2 of WU virus. The positive rate was the highest in serum samples from infants and children between 1 to 4 years of age. One of four ARI pediatric patients was positive for IgM against WU virus VP2, implicating WU virus as the causative disease agent. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of IgG against WU polyomavirus in Beijing-based study population indicates that WU virus infection is common in Beijing. WU virus may be responsible for some pediatric ARI cases, and primary infection of this virus may occur mostly in childhood.","publish_time":"2013-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Ni-Na; Zhao, Lin-Qing; Qian, Yuan; Zhu, Ru-Nan; Deng, Jie; Wang, Fang; Sun, Yu; Liu, Li-Ying","journal":"World J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ead2b0538babfcaa738ba2edd4d27d958652d58.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23389332/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12519-013-0397-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["WU"],"organizations":["ARI"],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["VP2 of WU virus","WU virus VP2","implicating WU virus","WU virus pathogenesis","WU polyomavirus","prevalence of natural WU virus infection","WU virus DNA-positive clinical specimen","recombinant VP2 protein","expressed VP2","ARI pediatric patients","Serum samples","pediatric ARI cases","symptoms of ARI","capsid protein VP2 gene","specimens of pediatric patients","recombinant Histagged protein","overall positive rate","primary infection","acute respiratory infection","high prevalence of IgG","IgM antibody","IgG antibodies","novel polyomavirus","Western blotting assay","Beijing-based study population","monoclonal antibody","respiratory-related viruses","nasopharyngeal aspirates","investigations","Escherichia coli BL21","encoding region","immunoreactivity","molecular weight","affinity","lack of permissive cell lines","causative disease agent","DE3","ages","children","infants","individuals","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","addition","METHODS","RESULTS","years of age","childhood"],"language":"en"},

Significant clinical presentations of COVID-19 include respiratory symptoms and pneumonia. In a minority of patients, extrapulmonary organs (central nervous system, eyes, heart, and gut) are affected, with detection of viral RNA in bodily secretions (stool, tears, and saliva). Infection of such extrapulmonary organs may serve as a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2, representing a potential source of viral shedding after the cessation of respiratory symptoms in recovered patients or in asymptomatic individuals. It is extremely important to understand this phenomenon, as individuals with intermittent virus shedding could be falsely identified as reinfected and may benefit from ongoing antiviral treatment. The potential of SARS-CoV-2 infection to rapidly disseminate and infect extrapulmonary organs is likely mediated through the nonstructural and accessory proteins of SARS-CoV-2, which act as ligands for host cells, and through evasion of host immune responses. The focus of this perspective is the extrapulmonary tissues affected by SARS-CoV-2 and the potential implications of their involvement for disease pathogenesis and the development of medical countermeasures.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kalkeri, Raj; Goebel, Scott; Sharma, Guru Dutt","journal":"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32406369/; https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-0279","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","potential of SARS","extrapulmonary organs","extrapulmonary tissues","accessory proteins of SARS","potential source of viral shedding","potential implications","Infection","cessation of respiratory symptoms","ongoing pandemic COVID","recovered patients","minority of patients","host cells","asymptomatic individuals","detection of viral RNA","intermittent virus shedding","ongoing antiviral treatment","evasion of host immune responses","Significant clinical presentations of COVID","central nervous system","disease pathogenesis","stool","bodily secretions","eyes","heart","involvement","development of medical countermeasures","tears","phenomenon","reservoir","gut","perspective","saliva","ligands","focus","pneumonia","cases","deaths"],"language":"en"},

Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk)-coupled C-type lectins (CLECs) CLEC2 and CLEC5A are highly expressed on platelets and myeloid cells, respectively. CLEC2 has been shown to recognize snake venom aggretin and the endogenous ligand podoplanin and acts as a critical regulator in the development and immunothrombosis. Although CLEC2 has been reported to interact with type I immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), its role in viral infections is still unclear. CLEC5A binds to fucose and mannose moieties of dengue virus membrane glycans, as well as to N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)/N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) disaccharides that form the backbone of L. monocytogenes peptidoglycans. Recently, we demonstrated that both CLEC2 and CLEC5A are critical in microbe-induced \u201Cneutrophil extracellular trap\u201D (NET) formation and proinflammatory cytokine production. Moreover, activation of CLEC2 by dengue virus (DV) and H5N1 influenza virus (IAV) induces the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which further enhance NETosis and proinflammatory cytokine production via CLEC5A and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). These findings not only illustrate the immunomodulatory effects of EVs during platelet-leukocyte interactions, but also demonstrate the critical roles of CLEC2 and CLEC5A in acute viral infections.","publish_time":"2019-12-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sung, Pei-Shan; Hsieh, Shie-Liang","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9e953d462385492fa9cc2ada05c1fd357de8afed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6909378.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31867016/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.02867","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CLEC5A","critical roles of CLEC2","activation of CLEC2","immunodeficiency virus","acute viral infections","H5N1 influenza virus","critical regulator","proinflammatory cytokine production","mannose moieties of dengue virus membrane glycans","N-acetylmuramic acid","protective roles of endosomal toll","N-acetylglucosamine","neutrophil extracellular trap","immunomodulatory effects of EVs","C-type lectins","release of extracellular vesicles","cytosolic nucleic acid sensors","TLRs","endogenous ligand podoplanin","receptors","formation","microbe","DV","pathogenic host factors","snake venom aggretin","Syk","acts","MurNAc","IAV","GlcNAc","fucose","CLECs","NETosis","platelet-leukocyte interactions","backbone of","disaccharides","HIV","Spleen tyrosine kinase","development","immunothrombosis","platelets","myeloid cells","monocytogenes peptidoglycans","findings","TLR2"],"language":"en"},

To date, eleven RNAs and five viral proteins of PCV2 have been detected. Here, we identified a novel viral gene within the PCV2 genome, termed ORF5, that exists at both the transcriptional and translational level during productive infection of PCV2 in porcine alveolar macrophages 3D4/2 (PAMs). Northern blot analysis was used to demonstrate that the ORF5 gene measures 180 bp in length and overlaps completely with ORF1 when read in the same direction. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to show that the ORF5 protein is not essential for PCV2 replication. To investigate the biological functions of the novel protein, we constructed a recombinant eukaryotic expression plasmid capable of expressing PCV2 ORF5. The results show that the GFP-tagged PCV2 ORF5 protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is degraded via the proteasome, inhibits PAM growth and prolongs the S-phase of the cell cycle. Further studies show that the GFP-tagged PCV2 ORF5 protein induces ER stress and activates NF-\u03BAB, which was further confirmed by a significant upregulation in IL-6, IL-8 and COX-2 expression. In addition, five cellular proteins (GPNMB, CYP1A1, YWHAB, ZNF511 and SRSF3) were found to interact with ORF5 via yeast two-hybrid assay. These findings provide novel information on the identification and functional analysis of the PCV2 ORF5 protein and are likely to be of benefit in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of PCV2 pathogenicity. However, additional experiments are needed to validate the expression and function of the ORF5 protein during PCV2 infection in vitro before any definitive conclusion can be drawn.","publish_time":"2015-06-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lv, Qizhuang; Guo, Kangkang; Xu, Han; Wang, Tao; Zhang, Yanming","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11f8eeb589bf8737b2805b3bb50ca12b73884c64.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4452787.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26035722/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0127859","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["PAM"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCV2 ORF5 protein","PCV2 infection","PCV2 genome","PCV2 replication","viral proteins of PCV2","termed ORF5","productive infection of PCV2","novel protein","ORF5 gene measures","molecular mechanisms of PCV2 pathogenicity","novel viral gene","Porcine circovirus type","novel information","GFP","IL","porcine circovirus-associated diseases","porcine alveolar macrophages 3D4","functional analysis","ER stress","cellular proteins","recombinant eukaryotic expression plasmid capable","Northern blot analysis","essential infectious agent responsible","CYP1A1","GPNMB","identification","YWHAB","length","translational level","S-phase","endoplasmic reticulum","ZNF511","pigs","bp","RNAs","PAM growth","NF-\u03BAB","cell cycle","benefit","SRSF3","PAMs","findings","yeast","hybrid assay","definitive conclusion","biological functions","significant upregulation","ORF1","proteasome","date","COX","additional experiments","Site","mutagenesis","direction","results","studies"],"language":"en"},

The objectives of the current study were to (i) determine the molecular prevalence of FeMV in Malaysia; (ii) identify risk factors associated with FeMV infection; and (iii) characterise any FeMV isolates by phylogenetic analyses. Molecular analysis utilising nested RT-PCR assay targeting the L gene of FeMV performed on either urine, blood and/or kidney samples collected from 208 cats in this study revealed 82 (39.4%) positive cats. FeMV-positive samples were obtained from 63/124 (50.8%) urine and 20/25 (80.0%) kidneys while all blood samples were negative for FeMV. In addition, from the 35 cats that had more than one type of samples collected (blood and urine; blood and kidney; blood, urine and kidney), only one cat had FeMV RNA in the urine and kidney samples. Risk factors such as gender, presence of kidney-associated symptoms and cat source were also investigated. Male cats had a higher risk (p = 0.031) of FeMV infection than females. In addition, no significant association (p = 0.083) was observed between the presence of kidney-associated symptoms with FeMV status. From the 82 positive samples, FeMV RNA was detected from 48/82 (58.5%) pet cats and 34/126 (27.0%) shelter cats (p \u003C 0.0001). Partial L and N gene sequencing of the RT-PCR-positive samples showed 85\u201399% identity to the published FeMV sequences and it was significantly different from all other morbilliviruses. A phylogenetic analysis of the identified Malaysian FeMVs was performed with isolates from Japan, Thailand and China. Molecular characterisation revealed high relatedness of the Malaysian isolates with other Asian FeMVs, indicating that the virus had been circulating only within the region. Therefore, this study confirmed the existence of FeMV among domestic cats in Malaysia. The findings suggest further characterisation of the local isolates, including the whole genome sequencing and that studies at determining the direct consequences of FeMV infection in domestic cats are needed.","publish_time":"2019-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mohd Isa, Nur Hidayah; Selvarajah, Gayathri Thevi; Khor, Kuan Hua; Tan, Sheau Wei; Manoraj, Hemadevy; Omar, Nurul Husna; Omar, Abdul Rahman; Mustaffa-Kamal, Farina","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ed7aaaa3c76a89ccb76c68472f9a3103580efc0c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117105.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113519304717; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113519304717; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.08.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31500720/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Partial L"],"locations":["Japan","Thailand","China","Malaysia"],"keyphrases":["FeMV isolates","FeMV-positive samples","gene of FeMV","FeMV RNA","FeMV status","existence of FeMV","kidney samples","molecular prevalence of FeMV","blood samples","positive cats","published FeMV sequences","urine","domestic cats","direct consequences of FeMV infection","Male cats","shelter cats","pet cats","presence of kidney","type of samples","Malaysian isolates","local isolates","associated symptoms","Molecular analysis","Molecular characterisation","risk factors","identified Malaysian FeMVs","phylogenetic analysis","higher risk","cat source","addition","current study","N gene sequencing","stray cat populations","nested RT-PCR assay","Asian FeMVs","genome sequencing","novel virus","phylogenetic analyses","high relatedness","gender","studies","Japan","identity","family of Paramyxoviridae","Abstract Feline morbillivirus","Thailand","China","significant association","findings","objectives","females","kidneys","morbilliviruses","region"],"language":"en"},

Recent infectious disease threats, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza (H5N1) and pandemic influenza (H1N1), have all highlighted the need for countries to be rapidly aware of the spread of infectious diseases within a region and across the globe. The International Health Regulations (IHR) obligation to report public health emergencies of international concern has raised the importance of early outbreak detection and response. The emphasis in syndromic surveillance is changing from automated, early alert and detection, to situational awareness and response.

Recent AIB outbreaks in India have been associated with poor growth in broilers, drop in egg production, and thin egg shells in layers. The complete spike gene of Indian AIB vaccine strain was amplified and sequenced using a conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and is submitted to the GenBank (accession no KF188436). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the vaccine strain currently used belongs to H120 genotype, an attenuated strain of Massachusetts (Mass) serotype.

The study identifies live attenuated IBV vaccine strain, which is routinely used for vaccination, for the first time. Based on nucleotide and amino acid relatedness studies of the vaccine strain with reported IBV sequences from India, it is shown that the current vaccine strain is efficient in controlling the IBV infection. Continuous monitoring of IBV outbreaks by sequencing for genotyping and in vivo cross protection studies for serotyping is not only important for epidemiological investigation but also for evaluation of efficacy of the current vaccine.","publish_time":"2016-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kamble, Nitin Machindra; Pillai, Aravind S.; Gaikwad, Satish S.; Shukla, Sanjeev Kumar; Khulape, Sagar Aashok; Dey, Sohini; Mohan, C.

They can be colonized with the Staphylococcus aureus complex, which includes Staphylococcus schweitzeri and Staphylococcus argenteus. Fecal carriage of S. aureus complex in the straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) has been described. However, data on their transmission and adaptation in animals and humans are limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the population structure of the S. aureus complex in E. helvum and to assess the geographical spread of S. aureus complex among other animals and humans. Fecal samples were collected from E. helvum in Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. The isolates were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, spa typing and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Isolates were screened for the presence of lukS/lukF-PV and the immune evasion cluster (scn, sak, chp) which is frequently found in isolates adapted to the human host. A Neighbor-Joining tree was constructed using the concatenated sequences of the seven MLST genes. A total of 250 fecal samples were collected and 53 isolates were included in the final analysis. They were identified as S. aureus (n = 28), S. schweitzeri (n = 11) and S. argenteus (n = 14). Only one S. aureus was resistant to penicillin and another isolate was intermediately susceptible to tetracycline. The scn, sak, and chp gene were not detected. Species-specific MLST clonal complexes (CC) were detected for S. aureus (CC1725), S. argenteus (CC3960, CC3961), and S. schweitzeri (CC2463). STs of S. schweitzeri from this study were similar to STs from bats in Nigeria (ST2464) and Gabon (ST1700) or from monkey in C\u00F4te d\u0027Ivoire (ST2058, ST2072). This suggests host adaptation of certain clones to wildlife mammals with a wide geographical spread in Africa. In conclusion, there is evidence of fecal carriage of members of S. aureus complex in E. helvum. S. schweitzeri from bats in Nigeria are closely related to those from bats and monkeys in West and Central Africa suggesting a cross-species transmission and wide geographical distribution. The low antimicrobial resistance rates and the absence of the immune evasion cluster suggests a limited exposure of these isolates to humans.","publish_time":"2018-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Olatimehin, Ayodele; Shittu, Adebayo O.; Onwugamba, Francis C.; Mellmann, Alexander; Becker, Karsten; Schaumburg, Frieder","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af475b1445628312443de29d85bff40825d411e0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5816944.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.00162; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29487577/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. aureus","S. argenteus","S. schweitzeri"],"organizations":["Obafemi Awolowo University","MLST"],"locations":["Africa","Nigeria","C\u00F4te d\u0027Ivoire"],"keyphrases":["Staphylococcus aureus complex","isolates","Staphylococcus schweitzeri","Bats","Staphylococcus argenteus","Nigeria","Fecal samples","humans","Eidolon helvum","wide geographical spread","immune evasion cluster","wide geographical distribution","study","scn","sak","evidence of fecal carriage of members","important animals","STs","MLST genes","Central Africa","host adaptation of certain clones","limited exposure","Species-specific MLST clonal complexes","chp gene","human host","cross-species transmission","antimicrobial susceptibility testing","low antimicrobial resistance rates","wildlife mammals","absence","straw-colored fruit bat","lukF-PV","Ile-Ife","Obafemi Awolowo University","spa","food sources","West","ST2464","C\u00F4te d\u0027Ivoire","multilocus sequence","ST2058","ST1700","concatenated sequences","Gabon","penicillin","monkeys","population structure","presence of lukS","tree","ST2072","African regions","CC3960","CC3961","CC1725","tetracycline","conclusion","data","final analysis","total","Neighbor","aim","CC2463"],"language":"en"},

Understanding how hospitals can continue providing services in an effective manner under these circumstances is thus important. In this study, we investigate how information technology (IT) helped hospitals in mainland China better respond to the outbreak of the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a content analysis of pages published on the websites of the Top 50 hospitals in mainland China between January 22, 2020 and February 21, 2020. In total, we analyzed 368 pages that the hospitals published during the initial days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose was to identify common themes related to the utilization of IT by these hospitals in response to the pandemic\u2019s outbreak. RESULTS: We identified five focal themes across the webpages published by the hospitals during our study period including (1) popular medical science education, (2) digitalized hospital processes, (3) knowledge management for medical professionals, (4) telemedicine, and (5) new IT initiatives for healthcare services. Our analysis revealed that Chinese hospitals spent greater effort in promoting popular medical science education in the initial stages of our study period and more on telemedicine in the latter stages.

Bat and MERS corona-viruses are structurally related. Therefore, it is of interest to estimate the degree of conserved antigenic sites among them. It is of importance to elucidate the shared antigenic-sites and extent of conservation between them to understand the evolutionary dynamics of MERS-CoV. RESULTS: Multiple sequence alignment of the spike (S), membrane (M), enveloped (E) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins was employed to identify the sequence conservation among MERS and Bat (HKU4, HKU5) coronaviruses. We used various in silico tools to predict the conserved antigenic sites. We found that MERS-CoV shared 30 % of its S protein antigenic sites with HKU4 and 70 % with HKU5 bat-CoV. Whereas 100 % of its E, M and N protein\u2019s antigenic sites are found to be conserved with those in HKU4 and HKU5. CONCLUSION: This sharing suggests that in case of pathogenicity MERS-CoV is more closely related to HKU5 bat-CoV than HKU4 bat-CoV. The conserved epitopes indicates their evolutionary relationship and ancestry of pathogenicity.

Stability is an important factor when it comes to practical applications of enzymes. Compared to trypsin I, trypsin ZT shows differences in pH and heat stability, sensitivity to inhibitors and sub-site substrate specificity as shown by multiplex substrate profiling analysis. Based on the analysis, trypsin ZT cleaved at arginine and lysine as other trypsins. Furthermore, trypsin ZT is better than trypsin I in cleaving peptides containing several consecutive positively charged residues. Lysine- and arginine-rich amino acid sequences are frequently found in human viral proteins.

Most clinical isolates of T. vaginalis are persistently infected with one or more double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses from the genus Trichomonasvirus, family Totiviridae, which appear to influence not only protozoan biology but also human disease. Here we describe the three-dimensional structure of Trichomonas vaginalis virus 1 (TVV1) virions, as determined by electron cryomicroscopy and icosahedral image reconstruction. The structure reveals a T = 1 capsid comprising 120 subunits, 60 in each of two nonequivalent positions, designated A and B, as previously observed for fungal Totiviridae family members. The putative protomer is identified as an asymmetric AB dimer consistent with either decamer or tetramer assembly intermediates. The capsid surface is notable for raised plateaus around the icosahedral 5-fold axes, with canyons connecting the 2- and 3-fold axes. Capsid-spanning channels at the 5-fold axes are unusually wide and may facilitate release of the viral genome, promoting dsRNA-dependent immunoinflammatory responses, as recently shown upon the exposure of human cervicovaginal epithelial cells to either TVV-infected T. vaginalis or purified TVV1 virions. Despite extensive sequence divergence, conservative features of the capsid reveal a helix-rich fold probably derived from an ancestor shared with fungal Totiviridae family members. Also notable are mass spectrometry results assessing the virion proteins as a complement to structure determination, which suggest that translation of the TVV1 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in fusion with its capsid protein involves \u22122, and not \u002B1, ribosomal frameshifting, an uncommonly found mechanism to date.","publish_time":"2013-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parent, Kristin N.; Takagi, Yuko; Cardone, Giovanni; Olson, Norman H.; Ericsson, Maria; Yang, May; Lee, Yujin; Asara, John M.; Fichorova, Raina N.; Baker, Timothy S.; Nibert, Max L.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf603ce616f92337f3b19b27b97b6bdbe5c1f21b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3622925.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23549915/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00056-13","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsxOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fold axes","family Totiviridae","capsid protein","capsid surface","human disease","fungal Totiviridae family members","TVV1 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","flagellated protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis","three-dimensional structure of Trichomonas vaginalis virus","purified TVV1 virions","structure determination","helix-rich fold","double-stranded RNA","obligate human genitourinary parasite","dsRNA-dependent immunoinflammatory responses","TVV-infected","protozoan biology","transmitted disease","exposure of human cervicovaginal epithelial cells","icosahedral image reconstruction","decamer","virion proteins","viruses","fusion","ancestor","asymmetric AB dimer consistent","frequent cause","conservative features","mass spectrometry results","electron cryomicroscopy","genus Trichomonasvirus","translation","plateaus","viral genome","extensive sequence divergence","tetramer assembly intermediates","complement","mechanism","nonequivalent positions","release","channels","putative protomer","ribosomal frameshifting","clinical isolates","subunits","canyons","date"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We searched the Scopus database for all literature on economic evaluation of mask or respirator use to control respiratory infection transmission. Reference lists from the identified studies were also manually searched. Seven studies met our inclusion criteria from the initial 806 studies identified by the search strategy and our manual search. RESULTS: Five studies considered interventions for seasonal and/or pandemic influenza, with one also considering SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). The other two studies focussed on tuberculosis transmission control interventions. The settings and methodologies of the studies varied greatly. No low-middle income settings were identified. Only one of the reviewed studies cited clinical evidence to inform their mask/respirator intervention effectiveness parameters. Mask and respirator interventions were generally reported by the study authors to be cost saving or cost-effective when compared to no intervention or other control measures, however the evaluations had important limitations. CONCLUSIONS: Given the large cost differential between masks and respirators, there is a need for more comprehensive economic evaluations to compare the relative costs and benefits of these interventions in situations and settings where alternative options are potentially applicable. There are at present insufficient well conducted cost-effectiveness studies to inform decision-makers on the value for money of alternative mask/respirator options.","publish_time":"2015-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mukerji, Shohini; MacIntyre, C.

Viral respiratory infections, such as rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus are likely to be important in the development and exacerbation of asthma. In this study, we investigated the nasopharyngeal colonization in children with asthma to determine the prevalence of pathogens and their contribution to respiratory symptoms and airway resistance during winter. METHODS: From December 2016 to March 2017, 50 nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from 18 patients (age, 5.0\u00B11.1 years) with asthma and 9 specimens from 9 control children (age, 4.9\u00B11.0 years). Samples were tested for 19 viruses and 7 bacteria, using multiplex real-time PCR. Respiratory disease markers included the Global Asthma Network Questionnaire, the Common-Cold Questionnaire, the Global Initiative for Asthma assessment of asthma control, and the airway resistance at 5 Hz by forced-oscillation technique. RESULTS: The most commonly isolated organisms in both groups (patients and controls) were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and rhinovirus. Most patients had multiple isolates (median, 3.5; range, 1\u20135), which changed during the study period. Types of isolates were 4 bacteria (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, Bordetella pertussis, and Bordetella parapertussis) and 6 viruses (rhinovirus, enterovirus, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, coronaviruses, and parainfluenza viruses). Similar isolates, including influenza A-H3 virus and bocavirus, were detected in the controls. Of the 9 patients with \u201Cwheezing disturbing sleep \u22651 per week\u201D, 6 had rhinovirus, 2 coronaviruses, and 1 no detectable viruses. Patients with mild common cold symptoms had significantly higher airway resistance at 5 Hz z-score (P=0.025). CONCLUSION: Multiple respiratory pathogens were isolated from many patients with asthma, which appeared to contribute to disease symptoms and airway resistance. Minimizing children\u2019s exposure to respiratory pathogens might be beneficial, especially during winter.","publish_time":"2018-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alsuwaidi, Ahmed R; Alkalbani, Alia M; Alblooshi, Afaf; George, Junu; Albadi, Ghaya; Kamal, Salwa M; Narchi, Hassib; Souid, Abdul-Kader","journal":"J Asthma Allergy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/425e0ee111062385cb630f0ea0659608d5fbec5c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6140756.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2147/jaa.s169966; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30254474/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bordetella"],"organizations":["Global Asthma Network Questionnaire"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","respiratory symptoms","Asthma assessment of asthma control","childhood asthma","exacerbation of asthma","rhinovirus","Multiple respiratory pathogens","Respiratory disease markers","respiratory syncytial virus","Viral respiratory infections","Global Asthma Network Questionnaire","higher airway resistance","disease symptoms","parainfluenza viruses","multiple isolates","detectable viruses","Common-Cold Questionnaire","mild common cold symptoms","prevalence of pathogens","control children","bacteria","coronaviruses","nasopharyngeal specimens","Similar isolates","Types of isolates","controls","age","winter","years","Global Initiative","Streptococcus pneumoniae","Bordetella pertussis","Bordetella parapertussis","Haemophilus influenzae","H3 virus","nasopharyngeal colonization","isolated organisms","study period","Hz z-score","adenovirus","significant effects","contribution","enterovirus","metapneumovirus","bocavirus","development","INTRODUCTION","groups","median","children\u2019s exposure","multiplex real-time PCR","week","disturbing sleep","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","oscillation technique","range","Samples","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

However, one of the biggest challenges of transplantation is determining how to achieve the long-term survival of the allogeneic or xenogeneic transplant by, for example, preventing transplant rejection. In the current study, CD26 gene-knockout mice were used to investigate the potential role of CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPPIV) in allogeneic skin graft rejection by tail-skin transplantation. Compared with wild-type (CD26(\u002B/\u002B)) counterparts, CD26(\u2013/\u2013) mice showed reduced necrosis of grafts and delayed graft rejection after skin transplantation. Concentrations of serum IgG, including its subclasses IgG1 and IgG2a, were significantly reduced in CD26(\u2013/\u2013) mice during graft rejection. Moreover, after allogeneic skin transplantation, the secretion levels of the cytokines IFN-\u03B3, IL-2, IL-6, IL-4, and IL-13 were significantly reduced, whereas the level of the cytokine IL-10 was increased in the serum of CD26(\u2013/\u2013) mice compared with that in the serum of CD26(\u002B/\u002B) mice. Additionally, the concentration of IL-17 in serum and the percentage of cells secreting IL-17 in mouse peripheral blood lymphocytes (MPBLs) were both significantly lower, while the percentage of regulatory T cells (Tregs) was significantly higher in MPBLs of CD26(\u2013/\u2013) mice than in those of CD26(\u002B/\u002B) mice. Furthermore, a lower percentage of CD8(\u002B) T cells in MPBLs and fewer infiltrated macrophages and T cells in graft tissues of CD26(\u2013/\u2013) mice were detected during graft rejection. These results indicate that CD26 is involved in allogeneic skin graft rejection and provides another hint that CD26 deficiency leads to less rejection due to lower activation and proliferation of host immune cells.","publish_time":"2018-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Xiangli; Zhang, Kai; Daniel, Peter; Wisbrun, Natali; Fuchs, Hendrik; Fan, Hua","journal":"Cell Mol Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c40ed044f3a5f2f1cb5a706ce375e5132287150.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6804736.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29572550/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41423-018-0009-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["serum of CD26","MPBLs of CD26","CD26 deficiency","graft tissues of CD26","allogeneic skin graft rejection","CD26 gene-knockout mice","delayed graft rejection","allogeneic skin transplantation","potential role of CD26","transplant rejection","percentage of cells","cytokine IL","concentration of IL","tail-skin transplantation","percentage of regulatory T cells","Organ transplantation","lower percentage of CD8","biggest challenges of transplantation","proliferation of host immune cells","lower activation","Concentrations of serum IgG","reduced necrosis of grafts","xenogeneic transplant","fewer infiltrated macrophages","secretion levels","Tregs","DPPIV","effective therapeutic tool","dipeptidyl peptidase","cytokines IFN-\u03B3","mouse peripheral blood lymphocytes","hint","current study","subclasses IgG1","example","terminal diseases","long-term survival","IgG2a","wild-type","counterparts","results"],"language":"en"},

The progress still continues on these biosensors for accurate, rapid, reliable sensors in future.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kaya, Sariye Irem; Karadurmus, Leyla; Ozcelikay, Goksu; Bakirhan, Nurgul K.; Ozkan, Sibel A.","journal":"Nanosensors for Smart Cities","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb6aad787f32fe521ff7ab6a80f6c832521bad35.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7155165.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128198704000177; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128198704000177","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogens","proposed biosensors","reliable sensors","diagnosing diseases","Recent progress","Abstract Infectious diseases","affinity","antibody","virus detection","electrochemical studies","researchers","antigen","time","centralized laboratories","body fluids","expert personnel","future","working principle","field","fast diagnosis","clinical levels"],"language":"en"},

The defensive response strictly linking innate to acquired immunity, works continuously to limit pathogen invasion and damage. The efficiency of the innate response is crucial for survival and for an optimum priming of acquired immunity. During infection, the immune response is modulated by an integrated neuro-immune network which potentiates innate immunity, controls potential harmful effects and also addresses metabolic and nutritional modifications supporting immune function. In the last decade much knowledge has been gained on the molecular signals that orchestrate this integrated adaptive response, with focus on the systemic mediators which have a crucial role in driving and controlling an efficient protective response. These mediators are also able to signal alterations and control pathway dysfunctions which may be involved in the persistence and/or overexpression of inflammation that may lead to tissue damage and to a negative metabolic impact, causing retarded growth. This review aims to describe some important signalling pathways which drive bidirectional communication between the Immune and Nervous Systems during infection. Particular emphasis is placed on pro-inflammatory cytokines, immunomodulator hormones such as Glucocorticoids (GCs), Growth hormone (GH), Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1), and Leptin, as well as nutritional factors such as Zinc (Zn). Finally, the review includes up-to-date information on this neuroimmune cross-talk in domestic animals. Data in domestic animal species are still limited, but there are several exciting areas of research, like the potential interaction pathways between mediators (i.e. cytokine-HPA regulation, IL-6-GCS-Zn, cytokines-GH/IGF-1, IL-6-GH-Leptin and thymus activity) that are or could be promising topics of future research in veterinary medicine.","publish_time":"2009-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Borghetti, Paolo; Saleri, Roberta; Mocchegiani, Eugenio; Corradi, Attilio; Martelli, Paolo","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ccaab1c4a83073aa39dbd5de9e0156db8730fb2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112574.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242709000300; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242709000300; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19261335/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2009.01.013","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune response","innate response","Immune Systems","immune function","innate immunity","integrated adaptive response","defensive response","cytokines-GH","GH-Leptin","Nervous Systems","efficient protective response","integrated neuro-immune network","GCS-Zn","Growth hormone","IL","systemic mediators","retarded growth","Growth Factor","major adaptive systems","IGF","review","infection","potential interaction pathways","crucial role","nutritional factors","nutritional modifications","tissue damage","domestic animals","negative metabolic impact","pro-inflammatory cytokines","potential harmful effects","important signalling pathways","exciting areas of research","domestic animal species","promising topics of future research","bidirectional communication","immunomodulator hormones","Glucocorticoids","neuroimmune cross","alterations","driving","cytokine-HPA regulation","Insulin","survival","focus","veterinary medicine","up-to-date information","numerous challenges","molecular signals","CNS","control pathway dysfunctions","Particular emphasis","optimum priming","overexpression of inflammation","Data","Zinc","thymus activity","efficiency","pathogen invasion","knowledge","persistence","health","decade"],"language":"en"},

In vivo susceptibility of the reproductive tract for LPAIV infection was reported for turkeys and chickens, but virus-interaction with epithelial cells of the oviduct and possible stimulation of the local antiviral immune responses have not been characterized. In this study, we wanted to investigate the suitability of magnum organ cultures (MOC) as an in vitro model to study virus-host interactions. We compared the susceptibility of duck (Du), chicken (Ch), and turkey (Tu) MOC for three different influenza A viruses (IAV). Overall, the course of infection and the antiviral immune response varied between strains as well as host cell origin, but MOC gave reproducible results for all investigated parameters within each species. While pandemic (p) H1N1 and H9N2 efficiently replicated in MOC-Ch and MOC-Tu, MOC-Du were significantly less susceptible to infection as indicated by a reduced replication level for both viruses (p \u003C 0.05). Overall, virus replication levels did not correlate with interferon\u03B1 (IFN\u03B1) mRNA-expression levels in neither species. H9N2-infection led to a significant upregulation of interferon\u03BB (IFN\u03BB) mRNA expression in MOC of all species compared to the non-infected controls (p \u003C 0.05), while a correlation with replication levels was only seen for MOC-Tu. pH1N1-infection induced only significant upregulation of IFN\u03BB mRNA expression in MOC-Tu at 48 hours post infection (p \u003C 0.05), but the expression pattern did not correlate with replication levels. Our results show that MOC are a suitable model to study IAV-interaction with the mucosal surface of the avian reproductive tract. The data suggest that the reproductive tract may play a role in the pathobiology of IAV in poultry.","publish_time":"2017-07-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sid, Hicham; Hartmann, Sandra; Winter, Christine; Rautenschlein, Silke","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e40f15493a3858973a18ef28a6f533926167e81.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5518544.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01338; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28775714/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjszMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MOC","IAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MOC-Tu","MOC-Ch","LPAIV infection","Infection of poultry","H9N2-infection","pH1N1-infection","course of infection","mRNA-expression levels","virus replication levels","species","study IAV-interaction","avian reproductive tract","significant upregulation of IFN\u03BB mRNA expression","virus-interaction","expression pattern","study virus-host interactions","pathobiology of IAV","reduced replication level","low pathogenic avian influenza viruses","significant upregulation of interferon\u03BB","different influenza","suitable model","local antiviral immune responses","reproducible results","susceptibility of duck","host cell origin","possible stimulation","mucosal surface","oviduct","strains","epithelial cells","loss","interferon\u03B1","investigated parameters","egg production","laying birds","suitability of magnum organ cultures","non-infected controls","role","chickens","turkeys","IFN\u03B1","hours","pandemic","mild respiratory symptoms","data","correlation"],"language":"en"},

Growth of CSFV in such siRNA stably expressing cell clones resulted in a 186-fold reduction in viral genome copies and, at 72h post-infection, only a small % of cells showed infection by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, and effective inhibition of virus replication persisted for up to 120h.

However, after nine months cases resurged with re-establishment of endemic rabies transmission to pre-intervention levels. Previous analyses investigated district level spatial heterogeneity of vaccination coverage, and dog density; and importation, identifying the latter as the primary factor for rabies resurgence. Here we assess the impact of individual level heterogeneity on outbreak probability, effectiveness of vaccination campaigns and likely time to resurgence after a campaign. Geo-located contact sensors recorded the location and contacts of 237 domestic dogs in N\u2019Djam\u00E9na over a period of 3.5 days. The contact network data showed that urban dogs are socially related to larger communities and constrained by the urban architecture. We developed a network generation algorithm that extrapolates this empirical contact network to networks of large dog populations and applied it to simulate rabies transmission in N\u2019Djam\u00E9na. The model predictions aligned well with the rabies incidence data. Using the model we demonstrated, that major outbreaks are prevented when at least 70% of dogs are vaccinated. The probability of a minor outbreak also decreased with increasing vaccination coverage, but reached zero only when coverage was near total. Our results suggest that endemic rabies in N\u2019Djam\u00E9na may be explained by a series of importations with subsequent minor outbreaks.

It is therefore important to establish a novel, effective therapeutic strategy that is effective irrespective of viral subtype. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we identify the Ras\u2013phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway as a host-cell regulatory mechanism for influenza virus entry. The binding of Ras to PI3K is specifically involved in clathrin-independent endocytosis, endosomal maturation, and intracellular transport of viruses, which result in decreased infectious efficacy of different subtypes of influenza viruses in cells lacking the Ras\u2013PI3K interaction. Moreover, influenza virus infection indeed triggered Ras activation and subsequent PI3K activation in early endosomes. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, these results demonstrate that the Ras\u2013PI3K signaling axis acts as a host-oriented mechanism for viral internalization. Given that virus incorporation is a process conserved among virus subtypes and species, this signaling pathway may provide a target for potent, well-tolerated prophylactics and therapeutics against a broad range of viruses.","publish_time":"2011-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fujioka, Yoichiro; Tsuda, Masumi; Hattori, Tomoe; Sasaki, Junko; Sasaki, Takehiko; Miyazaki, Tadaaki; Ohba, Yusuke","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1763110ecc1742f6158f410a0c4f0b923118fd79.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3024431.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21283725/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0016324","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjszNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Influenza virus infection","virus subtypes","influenza virus entry","virus incorporation","PI3K interaction","binding of Ras","subsequent PI3K activation","triggered Ras activation","infectious efficacy of different subtypes of influenza viruses","pathway","host-oriented mechanism","intracellular transport of viruses","broad range of viruses","host-cell regulatory mechanism","viral internalization","viral subtype","effective therapeutic strategy","therapeutics","cells","endosomal maturation","rise","well-tolerated prophylactics","severe respiratory disorders","axis acts","vaccines","approved defense strategies","target","process","clathrin-independent endocytosis","early endosomes","thousands of deaths","novel","year","neuraminidase inhibitors","resistance","antigen drift","species","kinase","reassortment","results","phosphoinositide","BACKGROUND","METHODOLOGY","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","SIGNIFICANCE","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Such a strategy allows viruses to evade immune surveillance and maximize their replication. Using an unbiased RNA-seq based approach to measure gene expression induced by transfected viral genomic RNA (vgRNA) and reovirus infection, we discovered that mammalian reovirus inhibits host cell innate immune signaling. We found that while vgRNA and reovirus infection both induce a similar IRF dependent gene expression program, gene expression driven by the NF-\u03BAB family of transcription factors is lower in infected cells. Potent agonists of NF-\u03BAB, such as Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF\u03B1) and vgRNA, failed to induce NF-\u03BAB dependent gene expression in infected cells. We demonstrate that NF-\u03BAB signaling is blocked due to loss of critical members of the Inhibitor of KappaB Kinase (IKK) complex, NF-\u03BAB Essential MOdifier (NEMO) and IKK\u03B2. The loss of the IKK complex components prevents nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of NF-\u03BAB, thereby preventing gene expression. Our studies demonstrate that reovirus infection selectively blocks NF-\u03BAB, likely to counteract its antiviral effects and promote efficient viral replication. Host cells mount a response to curb virus replication in infected cells and prevent infection of neighboring, as yet uninfected cells. The NF-\u03BAB family of proteins is important for the cell to mediate this response. In this study, we show that in cells infected with mammalian reovirus, NF-\u03BAB is inactive. Further, we demonstrate that NF-\u03BAB is rendered inactive because virus infection results in reduced levels of upstream intermediaries (called IKKs) that are needed for NF-\u03BAB function. Based on previous evidence that active NF-\u03BAB limits reovirus infection, we conclude that inactivating NF-\u03BAB is a viral strategy to produce a cellular environment that is favorable for virus replication.","publish_time":"2019-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"McNamara, Andrew J.; Danthi, Pranav","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/54122e9771f67d234bdcc67172a788bc96eec34e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/00948a1ab93a9bf30eee4b58ee32ed73c24a7e17.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/843680","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjszNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Interferon Regulatory Factor","Signal Transducer","IRF","IKK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inactivating NF-\u03BAB","NF-\u03BAB function","NF-\u03BAB family of proteins","NF-\u03BAB dependent gene expression","NF-\u03BAB Essential MOdifier","phosphorylation of NF","NF-\u03BAB family of transcription factors","active NF-\u03BAB limits reovirus infection","Nuclear Factor-\u03BAB","Potent agonists of NF","mammalian reovirus","Host cells","measure gene expression","infection of neighboring","uninfected cells","virus infection results","vgRNA","similar IRF dependent gene expression program","curb virus replication","efficient viral replication","viral strategy","Activator of Transcription","viral genomic RNA","immune surveillance","response","Viruses","innate immune pathways","IKK complex components","Interferon Regulatory Factor","nuclear translocation","Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha","unbiased RNA-seq","loss of critical members","reduced levels of upstream intermediaries","Inhibitor of KappaB Kinase","Signal Transducer","approach","STAT","antiviral effects","cellular environment","TNF\u03B1","NEMO","previous evidence","IKKs","IKK\u03B2","studies","study"],"language":"en"},

Using a selection-informed method, we dated the origin of the Orthohepevirus genus at least 21 million years ago, whereas the Orthohepevirus A species originated in Asia, most likely from a human-infecting ancestor that existed ~4500 to 6800 years ago. In this period, the appearance of large human settlements probably facilitated HEV emergence and spread. The earliest events in Orthohepevirus A evolutionary history involved the separation of the enzootic and human-restricted genotypes, as well as the split of the camel-infecting genotypes, which occurred during the time-frame of camel domestication. The place and timing of HEV-3ra divergence also correspond to the circumstances of rabbit domestication.

This narrative review focuses on recently published results from RCTs investigating the clinical efficacy and safety of EPs 7630 in children and adolescents with different manifestations of aRTI, in order to present a broader overview and to provide an update on the state of knowledge regarding the use of EPs 7630 in this age-group. METHODS: The Cochrane review on P. sidoides extract for aRTI published by the Cochrane Collaboration was searched for cited RCTs with EPs 7630 in children and adolescents suffering from aRTI. A PubMed and SCOPUS literature search was performed for publications issued before June 13, 2017 (search terms: children, Pelargonium sidoides, EPs 7630, respiratory). Reference lists of publications found were searched for relevant citations. RESULTS: Eight RCTs investigating the application of EPs 7630 in acute bronchitis, acute tonsil-lopharyngitis, and aRTI in the context of chronic preconditions were identified. Results showed a statistically significant improvement of aRTI symptom severity for EPs 7630 as compared to controls. The investigation of EPs 7630 in asthmatic children and adolescents with aRTI demonstrated a significant symptom-alleviating effect and a possibly associated reduction of asthma attacks. In immunocompromised children with acute upper RTI, an alleviating effect of EPs 7630 was shown. All RCTs reviewed reported good safety and tolerability of EPs 7630. CONCLUSION: The P. sidoides extract EPs 7630 is effective and safe for those of pediatric age and may be regarded as an alternative option for the management of aRTI.","publish_time":"2018-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Careddu, Domenico; Pettenazzo, Andrea","journal":"Int J Gen Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6f1d9c717a530587c2805bf89be10af931ba763.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5849386.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29563828/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ijgm.s154198","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs0MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["safety of EPs","tolerability of EPs","application of EPs","use of EPs","investigation of EPs","alleviating effect of EPs","Pelargonium sidoides extract EPs","management of aRTI","different manifestations of aRTI","asthmatic children","cited RCTs","immunocompromised children","adolescents","published results","significant improvement of aRTI symptom severity","acute bronchitis","Cochrane Collaboration","Cochrane review","acute upper RTI","acute tonsil-lopharyngitis","acute respiratory tract infections","significant symptom-alleviating effect","pediatric age","investigated age-groups","search terms","narrative review","reported good safety","SCOPUS literature search","Reference lists of publications","numerous randomized controlled trials","clinical efficacy","order","update","BACKGROUND","associated reduction of asthma attacks","state of knowledge","systematic reviews","context of chronic preconditions","broader overview","PubMed","alternative option","CONCLUSION","relevant citations","METHODS","controls"],"language":"en"},

However, in vulnerable populations, such as newborns, infants, the elderly and immune-compromised individuals, these opportunistic pathogens can also affect the lower respiratory tract, causing a more severe disease (e.g., pneumonia). Respiratory viruses can also exacerbate asthma and lead to various types of respiratory distress syndromes. Furthermore, as they can adapt fast and cross the species barrier, some of these pathogens, like influenza A and SARS-CoV, have occasionally caused epidemics or pandemics, and were associated with more serious clinical diseases and even mortality. For a few decades now, data reported in the scientific literature has also demonstrated that several respiratory viruses have neuroinvasive capacities, since they can spread from the respiratory tract to the central nervous system (CNS). Viruses infecting human CNS cells could then cause different types of encephalopathy, including encephalitis, and long-term neurological diseases. Like other well-recognized neuroinvasive human viruses, respiratory viruses may damage the CNS as a result of misdirected host immune responses that could be associated with autoimmunity in susceptible individuals (virus-induced neuro-immunopathology) and/or viral replication, which directly causes damage to CNS cells (virus-induced neuropathology). The etiological agent of several neurological disorders remains unidentified. Opportunistic human respiratory pathogens could be associated with the triggering or the exacerbation of these disorders whose etiology remains poorly understood. Herein, we present a global portrait of some of the most prevalent or emerging human respiratory viruses that have been associated with possible pathogenic processes in CNS infection, with a special emphasis on human coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2019-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Desforges, Marc; Le Coupanec, Alain; Dubeau, Philippe; Bourgouin, Andr\u00E9anne; Lajoie, Louise; Dub\u00E9, Mathieu; Talbot, Pierre J.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b788a8861367f5eefe81794e3c77c4a15a872b03.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7020001.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v12010014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31861926/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs1MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emerging human respiratory viruses","Opportunistic human respiratory pathogens","human upper respiratory tract","lower respiratory tract","human CNS cells","human coronaviruses","well-recognized neuroinvasive human viruses","CNS infection","various types of respiratory distress syndromes","opportunistic pathogens","neurological disorders","long-term neurological diseases","mild diseases","damage","immune-compromised individuals","virus-induced neuropathology","serious clinical diseases","susceptible individuals","virus-induced neuro-immunopathology","neuroinvasive capacities","different types of encephalopathy","result of misdirected host immune responses","encephalitis","lead","special emphasis","asthma","central nervous system","possible pathogenic processes","newborns","infants","autoimmunity","etiological agent","severe disease","data","SARS-CoV","exacerbation","viral replication","mortality","species barrier","influenza","triggering","vulnerable populations","scientific literature","epidemics","pneumonia","etiology","global portrait","pandemics","decades"],"language":"en"},

However, despite they represent the largest class of protein drug targets, a relatively small number high-resolution 3D structures have been obtained yet. Membrane protein biogenesis is more complex than that of the soluble proteins and its recombinant biosynthesis has been a major drawback, thus delaying their further structural characterization. Indeed, the major limitation in structure determination of MP is the low yield achieved in recombinant expression, usually coupled to low functionality, pinpointing the optimization target in recombinant MP research. Recently, the growing attention that have been dedicated to the upstream stage of MP bioprocesses allowed great advances, permitting the evolution of the number of MP solved structures. In this review, we analyse and discuss effective solutions and technical advances at the level of the upstream stage using prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms foreseeing an increase in expression yields of correctly folded MP and that may facilitate the determination of their three-dimensional structure. A section on techniques used to protein quality control and further structure determination of MP is also included. Lastly, a critical assessment of major factors contributing for a good decision-making process related to the upstream stage of MP is presented.

A large\u2010scale outbreak of PED occurred in China in 2010, with PEDV emerging in the United States in 2013 and spreading rapidly, posing significant economic and public health concerns. In this study, LC\u2013MS/MS coupled to iTRAQ labeling was used to quantitatively identify differentially expressed cellular proteins in PEDV\u2010infected Vero cells. We identified 49 differentially expressed cellular proteins, of which 8 were upregulated and 41 downregulated.

Based on these differentially expressed proteins, we propose that PEDV might utilize apoptosis and extracellular signal regulated kinases pathways for maximum viral replication.

Since the exhaled flow is transient and periodic, the phase-averaged method was used to analyze the flow characteristics. The results showed that the velocity profile of the flow exiting the mouth was bell-shaped for exhalation and flat for inhalation. The exhaled flow showed different characteristics during each stage of the exhalation process. In the initial phase, a mushroom-shaped flow arose, while some jet characteristics appeared in the middle phase. The effect of thermal buoyancy and thermal plume on the exhaled flow was analyzed. Clear turbulence characteristics were found in the exhaled flow, and the turbulence fluctuation was very strong in the transition stage between exhalation and inhalation. The last finding was that the distribution and value of vorticity were different in each phase.

Rudolph Virchow proposed a \u201Cone medicine\u201D discipline and emphasized the importance of cooperation 150 years ago. In the face of emerging threats from unpredictable zoonoses, human medicine and veterinary medicine should not be separate and independent sciences. Anatomic pathologists who are capable of analyzing and interpreting anatomical manifestations of diseases to obtain a definite diagnosis or exclude a wide variety of diseases play an important role in the diagnostic team. Although disease-associated microbes are numerous, morphologic patterns of tissue reaction caused by microbes are limited. Therefore, the interactions between microbes and host determine the histological changes in the target tissues. The contributions of anatomic pathology, with its use of morphologic similarities and special techniques, are important in zoonosis diagnosis. This can be seen in retrospective case studies of recent zoonoses such as multinucleated syncytial giant cells in severe acute respiratory syndrome and mouse hepatitis virus infection, syncytial cells in Henipahvirus infection and paramyxovirus, neuronal vacuolation in bovine spongiform encephalopathy and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and Streptococcus suis type 2 meningitis. In Taiwan, the Chinese Society for Comparative Pathology, which was established in 1994, provides for this interaction.

RESULTS: Median follow\u2010up was 198 days (interquartile range 64\u2010518 days). The overall visual success rate of the cats with a 12\u2010month follow\u2010up was 92.6% (25/27 eyes). POH occurred in 35/82 (42.6%) eyes. Immediately postoperatively, uveitis was the most common complication in 28/82 eyes (34.1%) followed by corneal ulceration in 22/82 eyes (26.8%).

As of August 28, 2014, concerns have been raised that control efforts, particularly in Liberia, have been ineffective, as reported case counts continue to increase. Limited data are available on the epidemiology of the outbreak. However, reported cumulative incidence data as well as death counts are available for Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. We utilized a simple, two parameter mathematical model of epidemic growth and control, to characterize epidemic growth patterns in West Africa, to evaluate the degree to which the epidemic is being controlled, and to assess the potential implications of growth patterns for epidemic size. Models demonstrated good fits to data. Overall basic reproductive number (R0) for the epidemic was estimated to be between 1.6 and 2.0, consistent with prior outbreaks. However, we identified only weak evidence for the occurrence of epidemic control in West Africa as a whole, and essentially no evidence for control in Liberia (though slowing of growth was seen in Guinea and Sierra Leone). It is projected that small reductions in transmission would prevent tens of thousands of future infections. These findings suggest that there is an extraordinary need for improved control measures for the 2014 Ebola epidemic, especially in Liberia, if catastrophe is to be averted.","publish_time":"2014-09-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fisman, David; Khoo, Edwin; Tuite, Ashleigh","journal":"PLoS Curr","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4169344.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25642358/; https://doi.org/10.1371/currents.outbreaks.89c0d3783f36958d96ebbae97348d571","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs2OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["West Africa","Guinea","Nigeria","Liberia"],"keyphrases":["Ebola epidemic","occurrence of epidemic control","epidemic growth patterns","epidemic size","Liberia","parameter mathematical model of epidemic growth","control efforts","improved control measures","potential implications of growth patterns","Guinea","Sierra Leone","Limited data","West African Ebola virus outbreak","cumulative incidence data","reported case counts","death counts","weak evidence","tens of thousands","extraordinary need","transmission","R0","epidemiology","basic reproductive number","small reductions","future infections","Models","good fits","Nigeria","degree","prior outbreaks","concerns","findings","catastrophe"],"language":"en"},

Adoptive transfer of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) specific for Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and adenoviral antigens can treat infections that are impervious to conventional therapies, but broader implementation and extension to additional viruses is limited by competition between virus-derived antigens and time-consuming and laborious manufacturing procedures. We now describe a system that rapidly generates a single preparation of polyclonal (CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B)) CTLs that is consistently specific for 15 immunodominant and subdominant antigens derived from 7 viruses (EBV, CMV, Adenovirus (Adv), BK, human herpes virus (HHV)-6, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and Influenza) that commonly cause post-transplant morbidity and mortality. CTLs can be rapidly produced (10 days) by a single stimulation of donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with a peptide mixture spanning the target antigens in the presence of the potent prosurvival cytokines interleukin-4 (IL4) and IL7. This approach reduces the impact of antigenic competition with a consequent increase in the antigenic repertoire and frequency of virus-specific T cells. Our approach can be readily introduced into clinical practice and should be a cost-effective alternative to common antiviral prophylactic agents for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients.","publish_time":"2012-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gerdemann, Ulrike; Keirnan, Jacqueline M; Katari, Usha L; Yanagisawa, Ryu; Christin, Anne S; Huye, Leslie E; Perna, Serena K; Ennamuri, Sravya; Gottschalk, Stephen; Brenner, Malcolm K; Heslop, Helen E; Rooney, Cliona M; Leen, Ann M","journal":"Molecular Therapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b405187c5535f2aed7f463cc88a13cc8a85c81a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/136a7182afa52314cd3faf8ec98c7e4179450374.json; document_parses/pdf_json/efdcad3aade1b1bcb2150a2c805235be5bd5eaf7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3412490.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525001616325977; https://doi.org/10.1038/mt.2012.130; http://www.cell.com/article/S1525001616325977/pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22801446/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525001616325977","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs2OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus-derived antigens","frequency of virus","Barr virus","CTLs","target antigens","adenoviral antigens","subdominant antigens","specific T cells","human herpes virus","respiratory syncytial virus","EBV","CMV","approach","allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant","hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","impact of antigenic competition","antigenic repertoire","additional viruses","fatal viral infections","post-transplant morbidity","single preparation of polyclonal","single stimulation of donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells","common antiviral prophylactic agents","Adoptive transfer of cytotoxic T lymphocytes","PBMCs","broader implementation","cost-effective alternative","presence","Adv","HHV","BK","consequent increase","HSCT","Epstein","conventional therapies","potent prosurvival cytokines interleukin","extension","Adenovirus","cytomegalovirus","laborious manufacturing procedures","peptide mixture","IL4","CD4","RSV","Influenza","recipients","clinical practice","mortality","immunodominant","system","days"],"language":"en"},

Because of the complexity of the IBV life cycle and the small number of viral structural proteins, important virus-host relationships likely remain to be discovered. Toward this goal, we performed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis fractionation coupled to mass spectrometry identification approaches to perform a comprehensive proteomic analysis of purified IBV particles. RESULTS: Apart from the virus-encoded structural proteins, we detected 60 host proteins in the purified virions which can be grouped into several functional categories including intracellular trafficking proteins (20%), molecular chaperone (18%), macromolcular biosynthesis proteins (17%), cytoskeletal proteins (15%), signal transport proteins (15%), protein degradation (8%), chromosome associated proteins (2%), ribosomal proteins (2%), and other function proteins (3%). Interestingly, 21 of the total host proteins have not been reported to be present in virions of other virus families, such as major vault protein, TENP protein, ovalbumin, and scavenger receptor protein. Following identification of the host proteins by proteomic methods, the presence of 4 proteins in the purified IBV preparation was verified by western blotting and immunogold labeling detection. CONCLUSIONS: The results present the first standard proteomic profile of IBV and may facilitate the understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms.","publish_time":"2010-06-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kong, Qingming; Xue, Chunyi; Ren, Xiangpeng; Zhang, Chengwen; Li, Linlin; Shu, Dingming; Bi, Yingzuo; Cao, Yongchang","journal":"Proteome Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8d1543ffb6bf876bc0a8fb927068f6f3c6938497.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2909931.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20534109/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1477-5956-8-29","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cytoskeletal proteins","ribosomal proteins","function proteins","total host proteins","intracellular trafficking proteins","macromolcular biosynthesis proteins","signal transport proteins","small number of viral structural proteins","purified IBV preparation","virus families","TENP protein","standard proteomic profile of IBV","important virus-host relationships","protein degradation","purified virions","major vault protein","IBV life cycle","comprehensive proteomic analysis of purified IBV particles","proteomic methods","scavenger receptor protein","Infectious bronchitis virus","RESULTS","major economic losses","mass spectrometry identification","ovalbumin","western blotting","two-dimensional gel electrophoresis fractionation","coronavirus of domestic chickens","presence","immunogold labeling detection","poultry industry","functional categories","BACKGROUND","goal","understanding","complexity","pathogenic mechanisms","molecular chaperone","chromosome","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The objective of the current study was to determine the effectiveness of simple primary respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette maneuvers in blocking droplets expelled as aerosol during coughing. METHOD: In this study, 31 healthy non-smokers performed cough etiquette maneuvers in an effort to cover their voluntarily elicited best effort coughs in an open bench format. A laser diffraction system was used to obtain accurate, non-invasive, quantitative, real time measurements of the size and number of droplets emitted during the assessed cough etiquette maneuvers. RESULTS: Recommended cough etiquette maneuvers did not block the release and dispersion of a variety of different diameter droplets to the surrounding environment. Droplets smaller than one-micron size dominate the total number of droplets leaked when practicing assessed maneuvers. CONCLUSIONS: All the assessed cough etiquette maneuvers, performed as recommended, do not block droplets expelled as aerosol when coughing. This aerosol can penetrate profound levels of the respiratory system. Practicing these assessed primary respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette maneuvers would still permit direct, indirect, and/or airborne transmission and spread of IRD, such as influenza and Tuberculosis. All the assessed cough etiquette maneuvers, as recommended, do not fully interrupt the chain of transmission of IRD. This knowledge urges us all to critically review recommended CE and to search for new evidence-based procedures that effectively disrupt the transmission of respiratory pathogens. Interrupting the chain of transmission of IRD will optimize the protection of first responders, paramedics, nurses, and doctors working in triage sites, emergency rooms, intensive care units, and the general public against cough-droplet-spread diseases.","publish_time":"2013-09-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zayas, Gustavo; Chiang, Ming C; Wong, Eric; MacDonald, Fred; Lange, Carlos F; Senthilselvan, Ambikaipakan; King, Malcolm","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/70542f1f1a2ced1e26658f62372e882da4c2b366.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3846148.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-13-811; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24010919/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IRD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["assessed cough etiquette maneuvers","Recommended cough etiquette maneuvers","assessed maneuvers","cough-droplet","IRD","chain of transmission","transmission of respiratory pathogens","assessed primary respiratory hygiene","blocking droplets","Droplets smaller","respiratory system","total number of droplets","airborne transmission","recommended CE","aerosol","coughing","infectious respiratory diseases","effectiveness of recommended measures","effectiveness of simple primary respiratory hygiene","variety of different diameter droplets","micron size","current study","best effort coughs","laser diffraction system","intensive care units","emergency rooms","triage sites","real time measurements","general public","doctors","open bench format","healthy non-smokers","new evidence-based procedures","paramedics","nurses","dispersion","surrounding environment","protection","profound levels","release","RESULTS","responders","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","objective","influenza","Tuberculosis","METHOD","mouth","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

This review explores some major evolutionary aspects arising from the discovery of these endogenous viral elements (EVEs). In particular, the reasons for the bias toward EVEs derived from negative-sense RNA viruses are considered, as well as what they tell us about the long-term \u201Carms races\u201D between hosts and viruses, characterized by episodes of selection and counter-selection. Most dramatically, the presence of orthologous EVEs in divergent hosts demonstrates that some viral families have ancestries dating back almost 100 million years, and hence are far older than expected from the phylogenetic analysis of their exogenous relatives.","publish_time":"2011-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Holmes, Edward C.","journal":"Cell Host Microbe","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3a19f1c464d27e80b8fdafaeb736148dca574c8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172163.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2011.09.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S193131281100285X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22018237/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S193131281100285X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["eukaryotic genomes","negative-sense RNA viruses","single-stranded DNA viruses","presence of orthologous EVEs","endogenous viral elements","divergent hosts","recent discovery","DNA stage","host genomes","viral families","episodes of selection","Endogenous retroviruses","counter-selection","integrated copies","sequences","common component","phylogenetic analysis","major evolutionary aspects","bias","arms races","potential function","exogenous relatives","review","ancestries","life cycle","reasons","years"],"language":"en"},

We investigated possible animal reservoirs of MERS-CoV by assessing specific serum antibodies in livestock. Methods We took sera from animals in the Middle East (Oman) and from elsewhere (Spain, Netherlands, Chile). Cattle (n=80), sheep (n=40), goats (n=40), dromedary camels (n=155), and various other camelid species (n=34) were tested for specific serum IgG by protein microarray using the receptor-binding S1 subunits of spike proteins of MERS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and human coronavirus OC43. Results were confirmed by virus neutralisation tests for MERS-CoV and bovine coronavirus. Findings 50 of 50 (100%) sera from Omani camels and 15 of 105 (14%) from Spanish camels had protein-specific antibodies against MERS-CoV spike. Sera from European sheep, goats, cattle, and other camelids had no such antibodies. MERS-CoV neutralising antibody titres varied between 1/320 and 1/2560 for the Omani camel sera and between 1/20 and 1/320 for the Spanish camel sera. There was no evidence for cross-neutralisation by bovine coronavirus antibodies. Interpretation MERS-CoV or a related virus has infected camel populations. Both titres and seroprevalences in sera from different locations in Oman suggest widespread infection.

Accordingly, this leukotriene is involved in innate defense actions. Objective To examine if nasal LTB4 can produce neutrophil activity and to explore whether or not LTB4 can condition neutrophils to exert virucidal effects in vitro and in vivo. Methods 1. Twenty-three healthy subjects received nasal LTB4 in a randomized and sham-controlled design. Symptoms were scored and nasal lavages carried out. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and \u03B1-defensins were monitored as indices of neutrophil activity. IL-8, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and \u03B12-macroglobulin were measured as indices of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, eosinophil activity, and plasma exudation. 2. Supernatants from neutrophils activated by LTB4 in vitro were assayed for virucidal activity against respiratory viruses. 3. In 38 healthy individuals, nasal inoculation with human rhinovirus-16 (HRV-16) was performed. In a preliminary study, intervention with LTB4 was given in a randomized and controlled design. Symptoms, virus replication, and antibody-titres were monitored. Results 1. LTB4 produced statistically significant increases in MPO and \u03B1-defensins, whereas IL-8, ECP, and \u03B12-macroglobulin were unaffected. 2. The supernatants efficiently killed human coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza B virus. 3. HRV-16 replication was lower in subjects receiving LTB4, but this difference failed to reach statistical significance. Common cold symptoms and incidence of seroconversion were unaffected. Conclusion Nasal LTB4 induces a selective recruitment/activation of neutrophils. LTB4 can condition neutrophils to exert virucidal effects in vitro and may reduce virus replication in vivo. We suggest that the condition induced by LTB4 reflects an enhanced state of innate defense.","publish_time":"2011-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Widegren, Henrik; Andersson, Morgan; Borgeat, Pierre; Flamand, Louis; Johnston, Sebastian; Greiff, Lennart","journal":"Respiratory Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0412a2755f49a3f0f7d7d13297b852b356a846d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127613.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21251805/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954611110005664; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0954611110005664; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2010.12.021","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs4MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MPO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Conclusion Nasal LTB4","virus replication","virucidal activity","eosinophil activity","nasal inoculation","nasal lavages","activation of neutrophils","condition","indices of neutrophil activity","virucidal effects","respiratory syncytial virus","influenza B virus","\u03B1-defensins","ECP","MPO","\u03B12-macroglobulin","healthy subjects","Supernatants","HRV","Common cold symptoms","innate defense actions","sham-controlled design","human rhinovirus","human coronavirus","respiratory viruses","healthy individuals","enhanced state of innate defense","eosinophil cationic protein","Summary Background Leukotriene B4","indices of pro-inflammatory cytokine production","selective recruitment","incidence of seroconversion","recruits","significant increases","difference","plasma exudation","antibody-titres","preliminary study","intervention","statistical significance","Myeloperoxidase","Objective","Methods","Results"],"language":"en"},

Many cities have established designated fever clinics to triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms. However, given the limited availability of the nucleic acid test as well as long waiting time for both the test and radiographic examination, the quarantine or therapeutic decisions for a large number of mixed patients were often not made in time. We aimed to identify simple and quickly available laboratory biomarkers to facilitate effective triage at the fever clinics for sorting suspected COVID-19 patients from those with COVID-19-like symptoms. Methods We collected clinical, etiological, and laboratory data of 989 patients who visited the Fever Clinic at Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from Jan 31 to Feb 21. Based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, they were divided into two groups: SARS-CoV-2-positive patients as cases and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients as controls. We compared the clinical features and laboratory findings of the two groups, and analyzed the diagnostic performance of several laboratory parameters in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection and made relevant comparisons to the China diagnosis guideline of having a normal or decreased number of leukocytes (\u22649\u20225 109/L) or lymphopenia (\u003C1\u20221 109/L). Findings Normal or decreased number of leukocytes (\u22649\u20225 109/L), lymphopenia (\u003C1\u20221 109/L), eosinopenia (\u003C0\u202202 109/L), and elevated hs-CRP (\u22654 mg/L) were presented in 95\u20220%, 52\u20222%, 74\u20227% and 86\u20227% of COVID-19 patients, much higher than 87\u20222%, 28\u20228%, 31\u20223% and 45\u20222% of the controls, respectively. The eosinopenia produced a sensitivity of 74\u20227% and specificity of 68\u20227% for separating the two groups with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0\u2022717. The combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP yielded a sensitivity of 67\u20229% and specificity of 78\u20222% (AUC=0\u2022730). The addition of eosinopenia alone or the combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP into the guideline-recommended diagnostic parameters for COVID-19 improved the predictive capacity with higher than zero of both net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Interpretation The combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP can effectively triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients attending the fever clinic with COVID-19-like initial symptoms. This finding would be particularly useful for designing triage strategies in an epidemic region having a large number of patients with COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases while limited medical resources for nucleic acid tests and radiographic examination.

Multiplex nucleic acid tests (NATs) have begun to replace conventional methods as gold standards for respiratory virus detection. Objective To compare the performance of two large multiplex NATS, ResPlex II (RPII) and Respiratory Virus Surveillance kit with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (RVS/MS) using nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from hospitalized children who had been tested previously with conventional methods. Study design Stored residual NPAs (N =306) were tested concomitantly by RPII and RVS/MS. Alternate NATs were used to adjudicate discordant results. Results More viruses were detected with multiplex NATs (RPII, 110; RVS/MS, 109) than conventional assays (86); diagnostic gain was primarily for fastidious viruses (coronaviruses and enteroviruses [EVs]/human rhinoviruses [HRVs]). Total positive and negative agreement between the multiplex NATs for all viruses detected was quite high (86% positive agreement, 99% negative agreement). Most individual viruses were detected with fairly equivalent accuracy by the multiplex NATs, except for adenoviruses (RPII sensitivity 40%) and human metapneumovirus (RVS/MS sensitivity 42%). RPII had the advantage of detecting EVs and HRVs, however, it demonstrated considerable EV/HRV cross-reactivity (29 HRV-positive specimens by real-time PCR were positive for EV by RPII and 21 specimens positive for HRV only by RT-PCR were dual positive for EV/HRV by RPII). RPII also had reduced sensitivity for HRV detection (in 36 specimens, HRV was detected by RT-PCR but not by RPII). Conclusions Both multiplex NATs were promising, but had notable limitations.","publish_time":"2012-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Forman, Michael S.; Advani, Sonali; Newman, Christina; Gaydos, Charlotte A.; Milstone, Aaron M.; Valsamakis, Alexandra","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9be84e01a32ee5dbe44a6f2f93ee3b4933a495a3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3586269.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2012.06.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653212002478; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22832060/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653212002478","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs4Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ResPlex II","RPII","HRV","EV/HRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RPII sensitivity","HRV-positive specimens","large multiplex NATS","specimens positive","HRV detection","positive agreement","Alternate NATs","MS sensitivity","fastidious viruses","individual viruses","respiratory virus detection","HRV cross-reactivity","RT-PCR","negative agreement","conventional methods","Abstract Background Rapid detection of respiratory viruses","real-time PCR","considerable EV","EVs","reduced sensitivity","conventional assays","HRVs","Respiratory Virus Surveillance kit","human metapneumovirus","human rhinoviruses","residual NPAs","hospitalized patients","hospitalized children","discordant results","electrospray ionization mass spectrometry","management","enteroviruses","gold standards","infection control","nasopharyngeal aspirates","ResPlex","diagnostic gain","equivalent accuracy","Study design","coronaviruses","performance","adenoviruses","nucleic acid tests","advantage","Conclusions","notable limitations","Objective"],"language":"en"},

Direct bronchial infection, exposure of nerves with resulting neurogenic inflammation and a deviated host immune response are among the mechanisms underlying these functional disorders.

The routes of immunization were intramuscular (IM), oral (O) or intradermal in the mammary region (IMam). Following immunization, serum antibody responses were monitored by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Following whelping, the mice were allowed to stay with their mother until sacrificed on alternate days post-parturition from day 1\u201311. Milk from their stomach was collected for antibody titration by ELISA and virus neutralization test. Regardless of the routes of immunization, a rapid increase in serum anti-rotavirus antibody titers was observed for the first 5 wk after immunization followed by a gradual decline. After parturition, the mean antibody titer of lacteal secretions, as determined by ELISA, increased gradually for 7 days with the greatest increase on day 9, followed by a decrease in anti-rotavirus antibody. These titers also correlated with antibody titers in milk as measured by virus neutralization test. The best lactogenic antibody response was observed when IMam \u00D7 IM \u00D7 2 route of immunization was used with live BRV as the antigen. Interestingly, immunization via the oral route with killed BRV also resulted in good antibody responses. In contrast, in the group where killed BRV was used, animals receiving 3\u00D7 orally had the highest antibody titer. The distribution of different antibody subtypes in milk samples revealed IgG to be the predominant antibody followed by IgM and IgA.

The estimates of effect in clinical research depends on the underlying research methodology. COVID-19 disease is presenting global health systems, clinicians, and patients grave challenges. No treatment or prophylaxis currently exists for COVID-19. The overall body of COVID-19 research is very flawed methodologically. An examination of hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin research findings due to the recent media focus revealed very low-quality methodology underpins the research. Vast amounts of time and resources are being allocated to COVID-19 research, and being potentially squandered. WHAT THIS ADDS TO WHAT WAS KNOWN: Flawed methodology and sub-optimal reporting of research findings could lead to biased estimates of effect. This could lead to treatment decisions that are not optimal based on biased estimates which could harm the patient. This article provides specific suggestions for improving on the COVID-19 methods and reporting with a focus on the issues that researchers must consider in their methodology and reporting if we are to have confidence in the estimates of effect. Failure to consider harms in research could be detrimental to the patient. This article focuses on the potential harms when therapeutic agents such as hydroxychloroquine, are being considered. WHAT IS THE IMPLICATION AND WHAT SHOULD CHANGE NOW: Research thus far on finding an optimal therapeutic agent (s) for COVID-19 could be hampered by methodologically flawed research. COVID-19 researchers must immediately and acutely focus on improving their methodology and reporting.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alexander, Paul Elias; Debono, Victoria Borg; Mammen, Manoj J.; Iorio, Alfonso; Aryal, Komal; Deng, Dianna; Brocard, Eva; Alhazzani, Waleed","journal":"J Clin Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be374570d873ccb1df82a9b0922d7f1c1ab6e4bc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0895435620303711; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895435620303711?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.04.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32330521/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs4NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["flawed research","clinical research","underlying research methodology","azithromycin research findings","sub-optimal reporting of research findings","Flawed methodology","low-quality methodology","biased estimates of effect","overall body of COVID","KEY FINDINGS","optimal therapeutic agent","article","researchers","confidence","recent media focus","potential harms","therapeutic agents","examination of hydroxychloroquine","treatment decisions","Clinical decision-makers","clinicians","global health systems","highest-quality","patients grave challenges","resources","disease","robust evidence","Vast amounts of time","best","specific suggestions","issues","methods","prophylaxis","Failure","decision-making","IMPLICATION"],"language":"en"},

It can affect all age groups of birds. The toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a major class of innate immune pattern recognition receptors that have a key role in immune response and defense against various infections.The TLRs are essential for initiation of innate immune responses and in the development of adaptive immune responses. An in ovo model was employed to study the antiviral activity of TLR ligands (Pam3CSK4, LPS and CpG ODN) on replication of IBV. It was hypothesized that optimum dose and specific timing of TLR ligands may reduce viral load of IBV in specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs). Further, the mechanism involved in the TLR-mediated antiviral response in chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of ECEs was investigated. The ECEs of 9\u201311 days old were treated with different doses (high, intermediate and low) of TLR-2 (Pam3CSK4), TLR-4 (LPS) and TLR-21 (CpG ODN) ligands. In addition, to know the timing of TLR ligand treatment, six time intervals were analyzed viz. 36, 24 and 12 h prior to infection, time of infection (co-administration of TLR ligands and avian IBV) and 12 and 24 h post-IBV infection. For studying the relative expression of immuno-stimulatory genes (IFN-\u03B1, IFN-\u03B2, IFN-\u03B3, IL-1\u03B2, iNOS and OAS) in CAM, TLR ligands were administered through intra-allantoicroute and CAM were collected at 4, 8 and 16 h post treatment. The results demonstrated that intermediate dose of all the three TLR ligands significantly reduced virus titers and used in the present study. However, the LPS reduced virus titer pre- and post-IBV infection but Pam3CSK4 and CpG ODN reduced only pre-IBV infection. Further analysis showed that TLR ligands induced IFN-\u03B3, IL-1\u03B2 and IFN stimulated genes viz. iNOS and OAS genes in CAM. The present study pointed towards the novel opportunities for rational design of LPS as immuno-stimulatory agent in chickens with reference to IBV. It may be speculated that in ovo administration of these TLR ligands may enhance resistance against viral infection in neonatal chicken and may contribute towards the development of more effective and safer vaccines including in ovo vaccines.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sharma, Bal Krishan; Kakker, Naresh Kumar; Bhadouriya, Sakshi; Chhabra, Rajesh","journal":"Molecular Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/355c5a162c9805ae95ba97ff982f9e9777122309.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112572.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32065987/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161589019306418; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2020.02.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161589019306418","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TLR","CpG ODN","IBV","CAM","IFN","OAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specific timing of TLR ligands","co-administration of TLR ligands","antiviral activity of TLR ligands","avian IBV","pre-IBV infection","h post-IBV infection","viral infection","replication of IBV","timing of TLR ligand treatment","IFN-\u03B2","viral load of IBV","time of infection","CAM","IFN-\u03B3","IFN stimulated genes","IFN-\u03B1","Pam3CSK4","CpG ODN","ECEs","avian infectious bronchitis virus","OAS genes","ovo administration","ovo vaccines","present study","reduced virus titers","initiation of innate immune responses","Abstract Avian infectious bronchitis","development of adaptive immune responses","rational design of LPS","virus titer pre-","iNOS","antiviral response","TLRs","intermediate dose","h post treatment","ovo model","relative expression of immuno-stimulatory genes","contagious viral disease of chickens","major class of innate immune pattern recognition receptors","immuno-stimulatory agent","neonatal chicken","safer vaccines","time intervals","optimum dose","specific pathogen free","embryonated chicken eggs","SPF","defense","key role","various infections","novel opportunities","resistance","different doses","chorioallantoic membrane","reference","days old","genus Coronavirus","intra-allantoicroute","family Coronaviridae","analysis","age groups of birds","toll","results","addition","mechanism"],"language":"en"},

We also compared ORFan genes to another class of acquired genes (HOPs), which have homologs in other bacteria. A total of 54 ORFan and HOP genes selected from different phylogenetic depths in the Escherichia coli lineage were cloned, expressed, purified and subjected to CD spectroscopy. A majority of genes could be expressed, but only 18 yielded sufficient soluble protein for spectral analysis. Of these, half were significantly \u03B1-helical, three were predominantly \u03B2-sheet, and six were of intermediate or indeterminate structure. Although a higher proportion of HOPs yielded soluble proteins with resolvable secondary structures, ORFans resembled HOPs with regard to most of the other features tested.

To examine the prevalence of CCoV infection among Vietnamese dogs, 201 serum samples were analyzed by virus-neutralization (VN) test. The results showed that antibody against CCoV-II was present in 87 dogs (43.3%). To detect genes of CCoV, fecal samples collected from 30 diarrheic and 50 healthy dogs were examinated by RT-PCR, confirming that 2 diarrheic dogs and 5 healthy dogs were positive for CCoV. Nucleotide sequences of N-terminal region of spike (S) gene indicated that CCoV strains were divided into two subgenotypes, CCoV-IIa and -IIb, respectively. Furthemore, we succeeded in isolating CCoV/dog/HCM47/2015, the isolate was plaque-purified three times, and 3\u2019-terminal one-third of the genome was analyzed. Interestingly, the plaque-purified virus had a large deletion in ORF3abc and E genes (1,165 nt), and a short deletion in ORF7b gene (60 nt), suggesting that these regions are not necessary for in vitro replication of CCoV. Next, the antigenicity between the isolated CCoV-IIb and the other CCoV-IIa was compared by VN test, revealing that antigenicty of the isolated CCoV is equal or higher than that of the other CCoV. In summary, two subgenotypes of CCoV-II are spreading among Vietnamese dogs. The isolated virus with a large deletion after in vitro passage may be useful for the development of vaccine, owing to its antigenicity and efficient viral growth in vitro.","publish_time":"2016-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"van NGUYEN, Dung; TERADA, Yukata; MINAMI, Shohei; YONEMITSU, Kenzo; NAGATA, Nao; LE, Thanh Dinh Ha; KUWATA, Ryusei; SHIMODA, Hiroshi; MAEDA, Ken","journal":"J Vet Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0875b937adb61d120554efed78760b89fda64b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5326940.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27840394/; https://doi.org/10.1292/jvms.16-0538","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VN"],"locations":["Vietnam"],"keyphrases":["genes of CCoV","CCoV-IIa","subgenotypes of CCoV","isolating CCoV","CCoV strains","replication of CCoV","isolated CCoV-IIb","prevalence of CCoV infection","diarrheic dogs","healthy dogs","Vietnamese dogs","isolated virus","large deletion","short deletion","virus-neutralization","antigenicity","VN test","plaque","serum samples","ORF7b gene","E genes","fecal samples","terminal region of spike","ORF3abc","antigenicty","Nucleotide sequences of N","important pathogen","passage","HCM47","information","RT-PCR","development of vaccine","efficient viral growth","regions","times","enteritis","antibody","Canine coronavirus","results","Furthemore","summary","genome"],"language":"en"},

In patients who experience severe disease, acute respiratory distress is often accompanied by a pathological immune reaction, sometimes referred to as \u2018cytokine storm\u2019. One hallmark feature of the profound inflammatory state seen in patients with COVID-19 who succumb to pneumonia and hypoxia is marked elevation of serum cytokines, especially interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 17 (IL-17), interleukin 8 (IL-8) and interleukin 6 (IL-6).

For influenza and other viruses there is evidence that viral load and persistence are associated with certain clinical outcomes but it is not known if there is an association between viral load and hospital length of stay. Methods 306 adults hospitalised with viral acute respiratory illness were studied. Associations between viral load and length of stay were examined. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to control for age, comorbidity, influenza vaccine status, duration of illness prior to hospitalisation, bacterial co-infection, clinical group and virus subtype. Results High viral load was associated with a longer duration of hospitalisation for all patients (p \u003C 0.0001). This remained significant across all virus types and clinical groups and when adjusted for age, comorbidity, duration of illness prior to hospitalisation, bacterial co-infection and other factors. Conclusions High viral loads are associated with prolonged hospital length of stay in adults with viral acute respiratory illness.

Previous studies have revealed that the coronaviruses develop various strategies to evade the host innate immunity through the inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03BAB) signaling pathway. However, the ability of TGEV to inhibit the host innate immune response by modulating the NF-\u03BAB signaling pathway is not clear. METHODS: In this study, a dual luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm the inhibition of NF-\u03BAB by TGEV infection and to identify the major viral proteins involved in the inhibition of NF-\u03BAB signaling. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to quantify the mRNA expression of inflammatory factors. The deubiquitination of Nsp3 domains and its effect on I\u03BAB\u03B1 and p65 were analyzed by western blotting. The ubiquitination level of I\u03BAB\u03B1 was analyzed by immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: In ST and IPEC-J2 cells, TGEV exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of NF-\u03BAB activity. Individual TGEV protein screening revealed the high potential of non-structural protein 3 (Nsp3) to inhibit NF-\u03BAB signaling, and leading to the downregulation of the NF-\u03BAB-induced cytokine production. We demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of Nsp3 was mainly mediated through the suppression of I\u03BAB\u03B1 degradation as well as the inhibition of p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Furthermore, the amino acid residues at positions 590\u20131,215 in Nsp3 were demonstrated to inhibit the degradation of I\u03BAB\u03B1 by inhibiting the I\u03BAB\u03B1 ubiquitination. CONCLUSION: TGEV infection can inhibit the activation of the NF-\u03BAB signaling pathway, which is mainly mediated by Nsp3 through the canonical pathway. The amino acid residues at positions 590\u20131,215 in Nsp3 compose the critical domain that mediates NF-\u03BAB inhibition. We speculate that this inhibitory effect is likely to be related to the structure of PLP2 with deubiquitinating enzyme activity of the amino acid residues at positions 590\u20131,215 in Nsp3. Our study provides a better understanding of the TGEV-mediated innate immune modulation and lays the basis for studies on the pathogenesis of coronavirus.","publish_time":"2019-08-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yanan; Sun, Aoying; Sun, Yu; Zhang, Sijia; Xia, Tian; Guo, Tiantian; Hao, Zhenye; Sun, Li; Jiang, Yanping; Qiao, Xinyuan; Cui, Wen; Tang, Lijie; Xu, Yigang; Li, Yijing; Wang, Li","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62a510dfb56136e79dbfcb424fae13b47c476635.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6683377.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-019-1206-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31382996/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs1NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NF-\u03BAB inhibition","\u03BAB activity","TGEV infection","dose-dependent inhibition of NF","ability of TGEV","inhibitory effect of Nsp3","degradation of I\u03BAB\u03B1","I\u03BAB\u03B1 ubiquitination","inhibition of p65 phosphorylation","positions","amino acid residues","deubiquitination of Nsp3 domains","Individual TGEV protein screening","suppression of I\u03BAB\u03B1 degradation","ubiquitination level of I\u03BAB\u03B1","canonical pathway","inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B","host innate immunity","innate immune modulation","study","nuclear translocation","immune response","Previous studies","deubiquitinating enzyme activity","high potential of non-structural protein","lethal watery diarrhea","family Coronaviridae","IPEC-J2 cells","basis","structure of PLP2","various strategies","Transmissible gastroenteritis virus","dual luciferase reporter assay","major viral proteins","critical domain","coronaviruses","BACKGROUND","member","induced cytokine production","activation","better understanding","mRNA expression of inflammatory factors","piglets","pathogenesis of coronavirus","western blotting","Real-time quantitative PCR","RESULTS","immunoprecipitation","CONCLUSION","downregulation","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Many HIV clinics share staff and logistics with infectious disease facilities, which are now on the frontline of COVID-19. Therefore, we investigated the impact of current pandemic situation on HIV care and continuity of antiretroviral treatment (ART) supplies in CEE countries. Methods Euroguidelines in Central and Eastern Europe (ECEE) Network Group was established in February 2016 to review standards of care for HIV in the region. The group consists of professionals actively involved in HIV care. On 19th March we decided to review the status of HIV care sustainability in the face of emerging SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe. For this purpose, we constructed an on-line survey consisting of 23 questions. Respondents were recruited from the ECEE members in 22 countries, based on their involvement in HIV care and contacted through e-mails. Results In total 19 countries responded: Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Macedonia, Poland, Republic of Moldova, Russia, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine. Most of the respondents were infectious disease physicians directly involved in HIV care (17/19). No country reported HIV clinic closure. HIV clinics were operating normally in only six countries (31.6%). In 11 (57.9%) countries physicians were sharing HIV care and COVID-19 care duties. None of the countries expect shortage of ART in the next two weeks; however five physicians expressed uncertainty about the next two months. At the time of providing responses ten (52.6%) countries had HIV-positive persons under quarantine. Conclusions The shortage of resources is evident and the impact on HIV care inevitable. We need to prepare for operating under minimal medical resources with the aim to secure retention on ART. Non-governmental organizations should re-validate their earlier objectives and second medical efforts to ascertain the continuity of ART deliverance.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kowalska, J.

Since the late 1990\u2019s, live vaccines based on genogroup 1 virus have been used in Japan, and a significant amount of the vaccine has been used even after new genogroups invaded in 2013. In this study, we evaluated the effect of a conventional PED live vaccine on a newly prevalent genogroup 2 field strain in experimental and field situations. METHODS: Two pregnant sows were administered twice the live vaccine before farrowing. A pregnant sow was served as a negative control. All newborn piglets were challenged with the genogroup 2 virus, and clinical signs were monitored for 7 days post challenge. PEDV-specific immune responses in serum and milk of the sows were assayed by virus neutralization assay. The efficacy of PED live vaccine in vaccinated or non-vaccinated farms was evaluated by comparing the mortality rate of suckling piglets after the onset of PED. RESULTS: The challenged piglets exhibited watery diarrhea with or without vaccination. However, the clinical score of piglets born from vaccinated sows significantly improved after the 4th day of the challenge. The survival rate of piglets in the vaccinated group at the end of the experimental period was 80%, whereas in the control group was 0%. Neutralizing antibody titers in serum and milk of control sow was negative throughout the experimental period, whereas high titers were observed in the vaccinated sows. The vaccinated farms significantly reduced the mortality rate of suckling piglets after the onset of PED, compared to farms not vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: The conventional PED live vaccine induced the lactogenic immunity to vaccinated sows and showed partial protection against the genogroup 2 virus both under the experimental and field conditions.

In group A, total, CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cells increased within days after M. haemofelis exposure. At times of maximal bacteremia, macrocytic hypochromic anemia, neutropenia, monocytosis and a decrease in leukocyte, eosinophil, and lymphocyte counts and subsets thereof (B- and T-cells, CD4\u002B, CD8\u002B and CD4\u002BCD25\u002B cells) were particularly significant in group A.

METHODS: We performed a prospective study of acute bronchitis at 31 hospitals and clinics in Korea from July 2011 to June 2012. Sputum specimens were collected for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and culture of microorganisms. RESULTS: Of the 811 enrolled patients, 291 had acceptable sputum specimens that were included for analysis of the etiologic distribution. With multiplex PCR testing, viruses were identified in 36.1% (105/291), most commonly rhinovirus (25.8%) and coronavirus (3.8%). Typical bacteria were isolated in 126/291 (43.3%) patients. Among these patients Haemophilus influenzae (n = 39) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 30) were isolated most commonly; atypical bacteria were identified in 44 (15.1%) patients. Bacteria-only, virus-only, and mixed infections (bacteria plus virus) accounted for 36.7% (98/291), 17.2% (50/291), and 18.9% (55/291) of infections, respectively. In particular, 52.4% of patients with viral infection had a concurrent bacterial infection, and rhinovirus was the most common virus in mixed infections (40/55). Additionally, infections with typical bacteria were more common in patients with chronic lung disease (p = 0.029), and typical bacterial infections showed a trend towards a higher prevalence with older age (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria were associated with almost half of community-acquired acute bronchitis cases. Additional studies are required to further illuminate the role of bacteria and to identify patient groups most likely to benefit from antibiotic treatment.","publish_time":"2016-10-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Ji Young; Park, Sunghoon; Lee, Sun Hwa; Lee, Myung Goo; Park, Yong Bum; Oh, Kil Chan; Lee, Jae-Myung; Kim, Do Il; Seo, Ki-Hyun; Shin, Kyeong-Cheol; Yoo, Kwang Ha; Ko, Yongchun; Jang, Seung Hun; Jung, Ki-Suck; Hwang, Yong Il","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a382a62bbd387279327333abd96be2aa76445ace.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5082923.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27788254/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165553","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs2MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Korea"],"keyphrases":["role of bacteria","atypical bacteria","enrolled patients","mixed infections","typical bacterial infections","common virus","patients Haemophilus influenzae","acute bronchitis cases","prospective study of acute bronchitis","rhinovirus","concurrent bacterial infection","acceptable sputum specimens","viral infection","culture of microorganisms","multiplex PCR testing","trend","higher prevalence","polymerase chain reaction","hospitals","chronic lung disease","older age","analysis","patient groups","clinics","half of community","viruses","Streptococcus pneumoniae","limited information","antibiotic treatment","etiologic distribution","Korea","METHODS","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","Additional studies","illness","coronavirus","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

There are five ebolavirus species; although much is known about Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) and its neutralization by antibodies, little is known about Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV), which is emerging with increasing frequency. Here we describe monoclonal antibodies containing a human framework that potently inhibit infection by SUDV and protect mice from lethal challenge. The murine antibody 16F6, which binds the SUDV envelope glycoprotein (GP), served as the starting point for design. Sequence and structural alignment revealed similarities between 16F6 and YADS1, a synthetic antibody with a humanized scaffold. A focused phage library was constructed and screened to impart 16F6-like recognition properties onto the YADS1 scaffold. A panel of 17 antibodies were characterized and found to have a range of neutralization potentials against a pseudotype virus infection model. Neutralization correlated with GP binding as determined by ELISA. Two of these clones, E10 and F4, potently inhibited authentic SUDV and conferred protection and memory immunity in mice from lethal SUDV challenge. E10 and F4 were further shown to bind to the same epitope on GP as 16F6 with comparable affinities. These antibodies represent strong immunotherapeutic candidates for treatment of SUDV infection.","publish_time":"2014-08-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Gang; Koellhoffer, Jayne F.; Zak, Samantha E.; Frei, Julia C.; Liu, Nina; Long, Hua; Ye, Wei; Nagar, Kaajal; Pan, Guohua; Chandran, Kartik; Dye, John M.; Sidhu, Sachdev S.; Lai, Jonathan R.","journal":"ACS Chem Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c35f1a6432bd9d7f5bce38e59661f93b1aa13060.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4201348.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25140871/; https://doi.org/10.1021/cb5006454","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs2NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SUDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["authentic SUDV","treatment of SUDV infection","lethal SUDV challenge","SUDV envelope glycoprotein","monoclonal antibodies","murine antibody 16F6","mice","lethal challenge","YADS1 scaffold","GP binding","F4","Sudan ebolavirus","E10","Zaire ebolavirus","ebolavirus species","range of neutralization potentials","pseudotype virus infection model","synthetic antibody","humanized scaffold","memory immunity","conferred protection","strong immunotherapeutic candidates","similarities","structural alignment","human framework","ebolaviruses","recognition properties","EBOV","comparable affinities","text","Sequence","epitope","hemorrhagic fever","starting point","focused phage library","design","Image","ELISA","clones","increasing frequency","panel"],"language":"en"},

PROCEDURE: Normal Harderian glands were evaluated ultrasonographically in 20 rabbits, 10 guinea pigs, and eight chinchillas. The Harderian gland was measured ultrasonographically in horizontal and vertical planes. Normal Harderian gland sizes were then compared with sizes in 27 rabbits, 13 guinea pigs, and three chinchillas that had exophthalmos. RESULTS: Harderian glands in normal rabbits were 0.69 \u00B1 0.07 cm (mean value \u00B1 SD) horizontally and 1.33 \u00B1 0.14 cm vertically. Harderian glands in normal guinea pigs were 0.58 \u00B1 0.05 cm horizontally and 0.61 \u00B1 0.10 vertically. In normal chinchillas, the Harderian glands were 0.53 \u00B1 0.04 cm horizontally and 0.53 \u00B1 0.03 cm vertically. Harderian glands were significantly larger in the vertical plane in rabbits with exophthalmos (P = 0.001) and in the horizontal plane in guinea pigs with exophthalmos (P = 0.018). Harderian glands of rabbits with exophthalmos were significantly larger in both diseased and healthy glands in both planes compared with those of normal rabbits. Guinea pigs and chinchillas with exophthalmos had larger Harderian glands bilaterally in only the vertical plane. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasonography is a valuable diagnostic imaging technique to evaluate the Harderian gland in the rabbit, guinea pig, and chinchilla.

These proteins also exist in fish, however, their roles in the innate immune response remain unknown. Here, we report a characterization of teleost IFITM1 from flounder Paralichthys olivaceus (PoIFITM1), which exhibits conserved structure characteristic of the IFITM family but comprises a relatively longer N-terminal region. The expression and promoter activity of PoIFITM1 are markedly induced by aquatic animal viruses: Rana grylio virus (RGV) and Scophthalmus maximus rhabdovirus (SMRV). Overexpression and siRNA-mediated knockdown demonstrate that PoIFITM1 exhibits strong antiviral effects against both DNA virus (RGV) and RNA virus (SMRV), expanding the spectrum of viruses inhibited by IFITM proteins. Further analysis shows that PoIFITM1 suppresses viral entry into host cells, confirming that the IFITM-mediated restriction is conserved from lower vertebrates to mammals. Deletion mutagenesis reveals that PoIFITM1 exerts antiviral activity by targeting to Golgi complex and the N-terminal region is required for its subcellular localization, which is not observed in other known IFITM family members. Our current data provide the first evidence that IFITM1 functions as a key effector of the innate immune to restrict virus replication in lower vertebrates, through the action of impeding viral entry.","publish_time":"2013-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Rong; Wang, Jun; Lei, Xiao-Ying; Gui, Jian-Fang; Zhang, Qi-Ya","journal":"Fish \u0026 Shellfish Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27d61483dc96d2fb841300b975d2dc4a849a1a5a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128638.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1050464813006384; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1050464813006384; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23850425/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2013.07.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs3MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFITM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFITM proteins","IFITM-mediated restriction","promoter activity of PoIFITM1","DNA virus","RNA virus","virus replication","known IFITM family members","RGV","protein family","Rana grylio virus","antiviral activity","lower vertebrates","SMRV","novel viral restriction factors","action of impeding viral entry","longer N-terminal region","representative transmembrane structure","innate immune response","conserved structure characteristic","IFITM1 functions","spectrum of viruses","strong antiviral effects","aquatic animal viruses","characterization of teleost IFITM1","siRNA-mediated knockdown","Abstract Interferon-inducible transmembrane","flounder Paralichthys olivaceus","key effector","Golgi complex","evidence","Scophthalmus maximus rhabdovirus","host cells","roles","Deletion mutagenesis","Overexpression","analysis","current data","subcellular localization","fish","mammals"],"language":"en"},

A general consensus is that all sources of data should be embraced to improve epidemic preparedness. As a disease transmission is inherently governed by individual-level responses, pathogen dynamics within infected hosts posit high potentials to inform population-level phenomena. We propose a multiscale approach showing that individual dynamics were able to reproduce population-level observations. METHODS: Using experimental data, we formulated mathematical models of pathogen infection dynamics from which we simulated mechanistically its transmission parameters. The models were then embedded in our implementation of an age-specific contact network that allows to express individual differences relevant to the transmission processes. This approach is illustrated with an example of Ebola virus (EBOV). RESULTS: The results showed that a within-host infection model can reproduce EBOV\u2019s transmission parameters obtained from population data. At the same time, population age-structure, contact distribution and patterns can be expressed using network generating algorithm. This framework opens a vast opportunity to investigate individual roles of factors involved in the epidemic processes. Estimating EBOV\u2019s reproduction number revealed a heterogeneous pattern among age-groups, prompting cautions on estimates unadjusted for contact pattern. Assessments of mass vaccination strategies showed that vaccination conducted in a time window from five months before to one week after the start of an epidemic appeared to strongly reduce epidemic size. Noticeably, compared to a non-intervention scenario, a low critical vaccination coverage of 33% cannot ensure epidemic extinction but could reduce the number of cases by ten to hundred times as well as lessen the case-fatality rate. CONCLUSIONS: Experimental data on the within-host infection have been able to capture upfront key transmission parameters of a pathogen; the applications of this approach will give us more time to prepare for potential epidemics. The population of interest in epidemic assessments could be modelled with an age-specific contact network without exhaustive amount of data. Further assessments and adaptations for different pathogens and scenarios to explore multilevel aspects in infectious diseases epidemics are underway.

Over the past decades, several direct-acting inhibitors have been developed, including capsid binders, which block virus entry, and inhibitors of viral enzymes required for genome replication.

As an alternative approach, host-targeting inhibitors with potential broad-spectrum activity have been identified.

Microbial forensics aims at identifying: the biological agent, its source, and the individuals responsible for a biothreat event. Analytic approaches differ when the suspected biothreat agent is encountered in a container or the environment, as opposed to a human or an animal. However, once the microbe or its toxin is in the living host, all the preceding items except the microbial nucleic acid cannot be analyzed. Nevertheless, the host response to the biological agent is available for analysis. The host response to a foreign substance is often a well orchestrated series of events designed to protect the individual from any harm. Modern techniques help to elucidate the pathways and components of the host response. Similar to a live microbe, vaccines can also provoke an antibody response. A vaccine can compose of: a live or attenuated microbe, a whole nonproliferating microbe, or an antigenic part of the microbe. Regardless, the intent of the vaccine is to produce protection, often by protective antibodies. It is likely that the future understanding of the immune system and evolving technologies; such as microarrays will enhance analytic power.","publish_time":"2005-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"SCHUTZER, STEVEN E.","journal":"Microbial Forensics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ce9a3225e5e3bb3b0c5fd62107f93e7d1be1191.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150301.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780120884834500172; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780120884834500172","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs3OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host response","live microbe","living host","antibody response","nonproliferating microbe","attenuated microbe","biological agent","suspected biothreat agent","biothreat event","Analytic approaches","analytic power","Microbial forensics","microbial nucleic acid","preceding items","immune system","pathways","elements","vaccines","future understanding","evolving technologies","foreign substance","microarrays","individuals responsible","chapter","source","orchestrated series of events","Publisher Summary","protection","container","analysis","toxin","simplified fashion","components","protective antibodies","environment","Modern techniques","animal","harm","intent"],"language":"en"},

Respiratory samples were collected from patients with ARTIs in various hospitals in Kuwait and subjected to reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) amplifying a fragment of the G gene of RSV. A total of 305 samples were collected between January and mid-December 2016, and 77 (25.2%) were positive for RSV. Group A viruses were predominant over group B viruses; the RSV-A group was detected in 52 (67.5%) of the positive samples, while the RSV-B group was detected in 25 (32.5%) of the positive samples. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all RSV-A strains grouped into eight clusters of identical sequences of untyped strains. Twelve RSV-B strains, on the other hand, belonged to the RSV-B/BA10 genotype, while the rest were untyped. These data suggest that new and untyped strains of RSV-A group likely predominated in Kuwait and that the BA10 genotype of the RSV-B group became the dominant genotype in the 2016 season.","publish_time":"2018-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Madi, Nada; Chehadeh, Wassim; Asadzadeh, Mohammed; Al-Turab, Mariam; Al-Adwani, Anfal","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aea1136bae15d1d3b628f228145f6853578f2b55.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087269.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-018-3881-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29777370/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":["Kuwait"],"keyphrases":["RSV-B group","RSV-B strains","untyped strains of RSV","RSV strains prevalent","G gene of RSV","group B viruses","Kuwait","Respiratory samples","positive samples","BA10 genotype","clusters of identical sequences of untyped strains","ARTIs","dominant genotype","G protein gene","Respiratory syncytial virus","RT-PCR","acute respiratory tract infections","reverse transcription PCR","elderly people","children","infants","genetic variability","patients","fragment","various hospitals","purpose","viral agent","data","hand","season","kind","rest","Phylogenetic analysis","total","study"],"language":"en"},

The protein could hydrolyze all NTPs except dTTP and showed better efficiency for ATP, dATP, GTP and dGTP hydrolysis. ATP was the most preferred substrate by the enzyme. CHIKV-nsP2T also showed 5\u2032-triphosphatase (RTPase) activity that specifically removes the \u03B3-phosphate from the 5\u2032 end of RNA. Both NTPase and RTPase activities of the protein were completely dependent on Mg(2\u002B) ions. RTPase activity was inhibited by ATP showing sharing of the binding motif by NTP and RNA.

Persistence and spread of resistant strains within a population contribute to the maintenance of a reservoir and lead to treatment failure. An experimental trial was carried out to study the horizontal transmission of a fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli strain from inoculated to na\u00EFve pigs. All na\u00EFve contact pigs had positive counts of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli after only two days of contact. Moreover, re-infections of inoculated pigs caused by newly contaminated animals were suspected. A maximum likelihood method, based on a susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model, was used to determine the transmission parameters. Two transmission levels were identified depending on the quantity of bacteria shed by infected individuals: (i) low-shedders with bacterial counts of resistant E. coli in the faeces between 5*10(3 )and 10(6 )CFU/g (\u03B2(L )= 0.41 [0.27; 0.62]), (ii) high shedders with bacterial counts above 10(6 )CFU/g (\u03B2(H )= 0.98 [0.59; 1.62]).

Using cutaneous DENV infection in immunocompetent mice we previously showed the generation of PNA\u002B germinal centers (GCs), now we assessed the activation and proliferation of B and T cells in draining lymph nodes (DLNs). We found a drastic remodelling of DLN compartments from 7 to 14 days post-infection (dpi) with greatly enlarged B cell follicles, occupying almost half of the DLN area compared to ~24% in na\u00EFve conditions. Enormous clusters of proliferating (Ki-67\u002B) cells inside B follicles were found 14 dpi, representing ~33% of B cells in DLNs but only ~2% in non-infected mice. Inside GCs, we noticed an important recruitment of tingle body macrophages removing apoptotic cells.

Scattered randomly distributed Ki-67\u002B T cells were found, similar to non-infected mice. CD69 expression by CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cells was minor, while it was remarkable in B cells, representing 1764.7% of change from basal levels 3 dpi. The apparent lack of T cell responses cannot be attributed to apoptosis since no significant differences were observed compared to non-infected mice.

Methods 307 patients infected SARS-CoV-2 classified as common type were enrolled in the study. 628 chest CT scans were divided into three groups based on the time interval between symptoms and chest CT scan. The clinical characteristics were descriptively analyzed.The chest CT features were quantitatively evaluated. Mann-Whitney U test was used to test the differences in three groups and between men and women. Spearman rank correlation was used to test the association between the arterial blood gas(ABG) analysis results and chest CT scores. Results Fever (69.1%) and cough (62.8%) were common symptoms. 111(36.2%) patients were anorexia. GGO was the most common manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia, which could be followed by consolidation and fibrosis. Lower lobe or subpleural region was the most common distribution form of lesion. More lung lobes involved in the third week. Total chest CT scores in the second week were higher than the first week. Fibrosis Scores increased in the second and third week. Total CT score, GGO score and fibrosis score of male patients were significantly higher than female in the second week. Male patients had higher consolidation score and fibrosis score than female in the third week. Total CT score and GGO score had weak to moderate correlation with arterial blood gas indices. Conclusion Changes in chest CT were difficult to assess quantitatively in the first third weeks. Male patients recovered slower than female in the second week. Although CT score had correlations with arterial blood gas indices, long-term follow-up of pulmonary function test is needed to determine the recovery of lung.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shang, Yalei; Xu, Chuanjun; Jiang, Fengli; Huang, Renjun; Li, Yonggang; Zhou, Ying; Xu, Feng; Dai, Hui","journal":"Int J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/99fdc3ffa49adf79a083f37c5c27228165141f9f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.05.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S120197122030312X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32423888/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S120197122030312X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs5OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Spearman"],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Total CT score","chest CT scans","Total chest CT scores","GGO score","fibrosis score of male patients","dynamic changes of chest CT features","higher consolidation score","common symptoms","Fibrosis Scores","female","arterial blood gas indices","common manifestation of COVID","common type fo COVID","patients infected SARS-CoV","common distribution form of lesion","groups","study","clinical characteristics","Mann-Whitney U test","long-term follow-up of pulmonary function test","moderate correlation","analysis results","Conclusion Changes","Results Fever","recovery of lung","lung lobes","Spearman rank correlation","pneumonia patientsin Jiangsu Province","ABG","correlations","subpleural region","time interval","Methods","association","Lower lobe","differences","Abstract Objective","women","cough","anorexia","weeks"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this study was to analyze descriptive epidemiological characteristics of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) cases imported to Korea. METHODS: We collected two sets of data. The first set, comprised daily reported cases of H1N1 obtained from local cities in accordance with government policy about mandatory reporting of all H1N1 cases during May 1 to August 19, 2009. The second set, including 372 confirmed imported H1N1 cases, identified from 13 National Quarantine Stations in the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from May 24 to December 31, 2009. However, given the lack of information on the nature of the imported H1N1 cases from the two data sets during the over lapping period from May 24 to August 19, we express the number of imported cases as a range for this period. RESULTS: We estimated that the number of imported H1N1 cases from May 1 to August 19, 2009, was between 1,098 and 1,291 and the total number of cases was 2,409 to 2,580. We found the number of imported cases was beginning to diminish as of August. A analysis of the second data set showed that the distribution of sex was similar (males 50.7%, females 49.3%) and the age distribution from 20 to 59 was 61.5% and that of 60 and over was 0.8% of the 372 cases. We identified 25 countries where people infected with H1N1 traveled and 67.5% were in Asia. But the proportion of cases (/1,000) by region shows Oceania (0.199), South America (0.118), Southeast Asia (0.071), North America (0.049), Europe (0.035), and Northeast Asia (0.016) in that order. The order of H1N1 peaking was the Southern Hemisphere, Tropics, and the Nothern Hemisphere.

Virus-encoded subunits of the replication complex mediate its interaction with membranes. As replication platforms, RNA viruses use the cytoplasmic surfaces of different membrane compartments, e.g., endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, endo/lysosomes, mitochondria, chloroplasts, and peroxisomes. Closterovirus infections are accompanied by formation of multivesicular complexes from cell membranes of ER or mitochondrial origin. So far the mechanisms for vesicles formation have been obscure. In the replication-associated 1a polyprotein of Beet yellows virus (BYV) and other closteroviruses, the region between the methyltransferase and helicase domains (1a central region (CR), 1a CR) is marginally conserved. Computer-assisted analysis predicts several putative membrane-binding domains in the BYV 1a CR. Transient expression of a hydrophobic segment (referred to here as CR-2) of the BYV 1a in Nicotiana benthamiana led to reorganization of the ER and formation of ~1-\u03BCm mobile globules. We propose that the CR-2 may be involved in the formation of multivesicular complexes in BYV-infected cells. This provides analogy with membrane-associated proteins mediating the build-up of \u201Cvirus factories\u201D in cells infected with diverse positive-strand RNA viruses (alpha-like viruses, picorna-like viruses, flaviviruses, and nidoviruses) and negative-strand RNA viruses (bunyaviruses).","publish_time":"2013-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gushchin, Vladimir A.; Solovyev, Andrey G.; Erokhina, Tatyana N.; Morozov, Sergey Y.; Agranovsky, Alexey A.","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b9bd316f8dddb71be863728f6dba041b0d6d402.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3589766.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23508802/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2013.00038","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BYV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CR","negative-strand RNA viruses","formation of multivesicular complexes","BYV-infected cells","virus factories","replication complex","vesicles formation","replication platforms","diverse positive-strand RNA viruses","cell membranes of ER","Virus-encoded subunits","membrane-associated proteins","eukaryotic virus systems","putative membrane-binding domains","polyprotein of Beet yellows virus","cytoplasmic surfaces of different membrane compartments","helicase domains","central region","induction of membranous compartments","Golgi","alpha","endoplasmic reticulum","build-up","nidoviruses","chloroplasts","lysosomes","analysis","Transient expression","methyltransferase","flaviviruses","mitochondrial origin","reorganization","picorna","closteroviruses","bunyaviruses","hydrophobic segment","Nicotiana benthamiana","analogy","interaction","\u03BCm mobile globules","Closterovirus infections","peroxisomes","Computer","mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

Previous reports suggested that many important regulatory proteins in innate immune pathway may be modified by ubiquitin and that many de-ubiquitination (DUB) proteins may affect immunity. Monocyte chemotactic protein-inducing protein 1 (MCPIP1), one of the CCCH Zn finger-containing proteins, was reported to have DUB function, but its effect on IFN\u03B2 innate immune was not fully understood. In this study, we uncovered a novel mechanism that may explain how MCPIP1 efficiently inhibits IFN\u03B2 innate immune. It was found that MCPIP1 negatively regulates the IFN\u03B2 expression activated by RIG-I, STING, TBK1, IRF3. Furthermore, MCPIP1 inhibits the nuclear translocation of IRF3 upon stimulation with virus, which plays a key role in type I IFN expression. Additionally, MCPIP1 interacts with important modulators of IFN\u03B2 expression pathway including IPS1, TRAF3, TBK1 and IKK\u03B5. Meanwhile, the interaction between the components in TRAF3-TBK1-IKK\u03B5 complex was disrupted by MCPIP1. These results collectively suggest MCPIP1 as an innate immune regulator encoded by the host and point to a new mechanism through which MCPIP1 negatively regulates IRF3 activation and type I IFN\u03B2 expression.","publish_time":"2018-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Xiaojuan; Zhao, Qian; Xie, Qing; Xing, Yaling; Chen, Zhongbin","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/654c290db8070c13849ca52d90a7b7672c722050.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092953.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29920243/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X18313950; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X18313950; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.06.083","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MCPIP1","IFN\u03B2 innate immune","innate immune pathway","immune plays","innate immune regulator","antiviral immune","Abstract IFN\u03B2","important modulators of IFN\u03B2 expression pathway","TRAF3-TBK1","IFN expression","important regulatory proteins","IRF3 activation","type","nuclear translocation of IRF3","essential role","key role","IKK\u03B5 complex","DUB function","novel mechanism","new mechanism","Monocyte chemotactic protein","IPS1","virus","host","effect","stimulation","de-ubiquitination","components","RIG","Previous reports","CCCH Zn finger","STING","study","interaction","immunity","results"],"language":"en"},

Assembled contig numbers were significantly reduced (up to 99.97%) by the application of these pre-assembly filtering methods.

This cross sectional survey investigated the occurrence of Porcine Circovirus type 2 \u2013 systemic disease (PCV2-SD) among pigs and the associated level of awareness of stakeholders in Central Uganda. Data were collected using questionnaires, Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), key informant interviews and laboratory investigations. All respondents (n = 131) and farmers attending FGDs (n = 31) had never heard of PCV2-SD and only 16.7% (n = 2) of the interviewed animal health workers (n = 12) knew about the disease. Among the farms, 20 piglets presenting with a chronic wasting and a persistent diarrhea were detected and sampled for laboratory investigations. Severe lymphoid depletion with histiocytic and macrophage infiltration in lymphoid organs (n = 8), shortening of intestinal villi (n = 9), abscesses in various organs (n = 15) and granulomatous pneumonia (n = 2) were the major histopathological lesions described. Immunohistochemistry and PCR assays on organs with implicating lesions confirmed PCV2 infection in 25% (n = 5) of the 20 pigs.

The study arouses the need for systematic studies on prevalence of PCV2 infections and sensitization of stakeholders on occurrence of PCV2 infections in Uganda.","publish_time":"2018-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilfred, Eneku; Mutebi, Francis; Mwiine, Frank Norbert; James, Okwee-Acai; Lonzy, Ojok","journal":"Int J Vet Sci Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46ec3a9b64437b3a7908f0efbf575e1645ee0419.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3ac84e77e326adc28e3684a486e783f845728c25.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6286401.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2314459918300693; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30564593/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijvsm.2018.08.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2314459918300693","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Porcine Circovirus"],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":["Africa","Central Uganda","Uganda"],"keyphrases":["occurrence of PCV2 infections","PCV2-SD","prevalence of PCV2 infections","report of PCV2 infection-associated morbidity","associated level of awareness","Central Uganda","lymphoid organs","associated diseases","low level of associated knowledge","occurrence of Porcine Circovirus type","persistent diarrhea","piglets","sensitization of stakeholders","FGDs","various organs","farmers","study","laboratory investigations","pigs","implicating lesions","pig farms","systemic disease","Severe lymphoid depletion","major histopathological lesions","macrophage infiltration","key informant interviews","systematic studies","Focus Group Discussions","questionnaires","PCR assays","interviewed animal health workers","need","cross sectional survey","veterinary practitioners","chronic wasting","abscesses","Immunohistochemistry","granulomatous pneumonia","Data","intestinal villi","Africa","respondents"],"language":"en"},

In this context, we first explore how deliveries from online shopping have been changing over time. From our analysis of the 2009 and 2017 National Household Travel Surveys, we found that online shopping has been embraced by increasingly diverse households, although income, education, and some racial/ethnic differences persist. Our analysis of the 2017 American Time Use Survey shows that Americans are 24 times more likely to shop for groceries in stores than online. Moreover, in-store grocery shoppers are more likely to be female and unemployed, but less likely to belong to younger generations, to have less than a college degree, or to be African American. The gender imbalance in grocery shopping is larger online than in stores, but e-grocery shoppers do not otherwise differ from the general population. Future travel and e-shopping surveys (especially for e-grocery) should combine time use and travel questions with retrospective questions about online purchases.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saphores, Jean-Daniel; Xu, Lu","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a543c44737a8ee8def9abacd67db5b3fdfff71b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0739885920300627; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885920300627?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["online shopping","grocery shopping","e-shopping surveys","e-grocery shoppers","online purchases","popularity of e","determinants of e","groceries","store grocery shoppers","travel questions","American Time Use Survey","Future travel","stores","analysis","National Household Travel Surveys","retrospective questions","supply chain managers","grocers","Americans","education","gender imbalance","income","urban planners","times","diverse households","spite","deliveries","ethnic differences","college degree","US adults","Abstract","younger generations","general population","context","month"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data of children younger than 18 years diagnosed with pneumonia at 117 Emergency Departments in Korea between 2007 and 2014. RESULTS: Over the study period, 329,380 pediatric cases of pneumonia were identified. The most frequent age group was 1\u20133 years old (48.6%) and the next was less than 12 months of age (17.4%). Based on International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision diagnostic codes, confirmed cases of viral pneumonia comprised 8.4% of all cases, pneumonia due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae comprised 3.8% and confirmed cases of bacterial pneumonia 1.3%. The prevalence of confirmed bacterial pneumonia decreased from 3.07% in 2007 and 4.01% in 2008 to 0.65% in 2014. The yearly rate of pneumococcal pneumonia also decreased from 0.47% in 2007 to 0.08% in 2014. A periodic prevalence of M. pneumoniae pneumonia (MP) was identified. CONCLUSION: The increased number of patients with pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, pleural effusion, and empyema in 2011 and 2013\u20132014 resulted from an MP epidemic. We provide evidence that the frequency of confirmed cases of bacterial pneumonia and pneumococcal pneumonia has declined from 2007 to 2014, which can simultaneously reflect the effectiveness of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.","publish_time":"2018-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shin, Eun Ju; Kim, Yunsun; Jeong, Jin-Young; Jung, Yu Mi; Lee, Mi-Hee; Chung, Eun Hee","journal":"Korean J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/138e18baf12e4e92b67ab7dee321d2b149f236ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6172518.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3345/kjp.2017.06100; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30274507/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["M. pneumoniae"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Korea"],"keyphrases":["pneumonia prevalence","pneumoniae pneumonia","pediatric cases of pneumonia","cases of viral pneumonia","pediatric pneumonia patients","frequency of confirmed cases of bacterial pneumonia","yearly rate of pneumococcal pneumonia","periodic prevalence","pneumococcal conjugate vaccine","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","years old","months of age","MP epidemic","increased number of patients","prevention of infectious diseases","International Classification of Diseases","frequent age group","revision diagnostic codes","pathogen","pleural effusion","study period","changes","data of children younger","Emergency Departments","CONCLUSION","effectiveness","Korea","empyema","evidence","RESULTS","PURPOSE","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The viral solutions were exposed on glass samples uniformly loaded with copper and silver compounds. Exposure to solid-state cuprous oxide (Cu2O) efficiently inactivated both influenza A virus and bacteriophage Q\u03B2, whereas solid-state cupric oxide (CuO) and silver sulfide (Ag2S) showed little antiviral activity. Copper ions from copper chloride (CuCl2) had little effect on the activity of bacteriophage Q\u03B2 in spite of the fact that copper ions strongly inactivate influenza A in previous studies. Silver ions from silver nitrate (AgNO3) and silver(I) oxide (Ag2O) in solution showed strong inactivation of influenza A and weak inactivation of bacteriophage Q\u03B2. We also investigated the influence of the compounds on the function of two influenza viral proteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Silver ions from AgNO3 and Ag2O remarkably decreased enzymatic activity of neuraminidase through the breakage of disulfide (SS) bonds, corresponding to the selective inactivation of influenza A virus. By contrast, exposure to Cu2O markedly reduced the activity of hemagglutinin rather than neuraminidase. These findings suggest that solid-state Cu2O disrupts host cell recognition by denaturing protein structures on viral surfaces, leading to the inactivation of viruses regardless of the presence of a viral envelope.","publish_time":"2016-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Minoshima, Masafumi; Lu, Yue; Kimura, Takuto; Nakano, Ryuichi; Ishiguro, Hitoshi; Kubota, Yoshinobu; Hashimoto, Kazuhito; Sunada, Kayano","journal":"Journal of Hazardous Materials","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d517082c9dae1f5b30eafc462aca1b91c812203c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116991.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.03.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27015373/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389416302382; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304389416302382","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Silver ions","silver compounds","Copper ions","silver sulfide","silver nitrate","activity of bacteriophage Q\u03B2","influenza viral proteins","viral envelope","strong inactivation of influenza","selective inactivation of influenza","solid-state Cu2O","weak inactivation of bacteriophage Q\u03B2","copper chloride","viral surfaces","viral solutions","activity of hemagglutinin","solid-state cupric oxide","solid-state cuprous oxide","little antiviral activity","enzymatic activity of neuraminidase","inactivation of viruses","soluble ionic copper","Ag2O","AgNO3","Exposure","Abstract Antiviral activities of insoluble solid-state","little effect","host cell recognition","denaturing protein structures","CuO","Ag2S","CuCl2","spite","fact","bonds","breakage of disulfide","function","glass samples","H1N1","presence","PR8","findings","previous studies","influence","contrast"],"language":"en"},

The identification of Pg-activators is therefore an important step in understanding their functional mechanism and derives new therapies. METHODS: In this study, different computational methods for predicting plasminogen activator peptide sequences with high accuracy were investigated, including support vector machines (SVM) based on amino acid (AC), dipeptide composition (DC), PSSM profile and Hybrid methods used to predict different Pg-activators from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic origins. RESULTS: Overall maximum accuracy, evaluated using the five-fold cross validation technique, was 88.37%, 84.32%, 87.61%, 85.63% in 0.87, 0.83,0.86 and 0.85 MCC with amino (AC) or dipeptide composition (DC), PSSM profile and Hybrid methods respectively. Through this study, we have found that the different subfamilies of Pg-activators are quite closely correlated in terms of amino, dipeptide, PSSM and Hybrid compositions. Therefore, our prediction results show that plasminogen activators are predictable with a high accuracy from their primary sequence. Prediction performance was also cross-checked by confusion matrix and ROC (Receiver operating characteristics) analysis. A web server to facilitate the prediction of Pg-activators from primary sequence data was implemented. CONCLUSION: The results show that dipeptide, PSSM profile, and Hybrid based methods perform better than single amino acid composition (AC). Furthermore, we also have developed a web server, which predicts the Pg-activators and their classification (available online at http://mamsap.it.deakin.edu.au/plas_pred/home.html). Our experimental results show that our approaches are faster and achieve generally a good prediction performance.","publish_time":"2014-01-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muthukrishnan, Selvaraj; Puri, Munish; Lefevre, Christophe","journal":"BMC Res Notes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ff529e1f29ef13037ef1117086082db53d12691.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3924408.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-7-63; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24468032/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MCC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different Pg-activators","different plasminogen activators","prediction of Pg","tissue plasminogen activators","Hybrid methods","different subfamilies of Pg","identification of Pg","prediction results","bacterial activators streptokinase","dipeptide composition","PSSM profile","different computational methods","high accuracy","single amino acid composition","terms of amino","Hybrid compositions","experimental results","good prediction performance","plasminogen activator peptide sequences","DC","maximum accuracy","web server","study","primary sequence data","active enzyme plasmin","fibrinolytic enzyme of blood","urokinase","functional mechanism","ROC","Receiver","confusion matrix","SVM","precursor","staphylokinase","important step","support vector machines","characteristics","new therapies","analysis","approaches","eukaryotic origins","classification","cross validation technique","MCC","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","thrombolysis"],"language":"en"},

However, 80% of all cases have occurred in KSA. The largest outbreak outside KSA occurred in South Korea (SK) in 2015. In this report, we describe an epidemiological comparison of the two outbreaks. Data from 1299 cases in KSA (2012\u20132015) and 186 cases in SK (2015) were collected from publicly available resources, including FluTrackers, the World Health Organization (WHO) outbreak news and the Saudi MOH (MOH). Descriptive analysis, t-tests, Chi-square tests and binary logistic regression were conducted to compare demographic and other characteristics (comorbidity, contact history) of cases by nationality. Epidemic curves of the outbreaks were generated. The mean age of cases was 51 years in KSA and 54 years in SK. Older males (\u2A7E70 years) were more likely to be infected or to die from MERS-CoV infection, and males exhibited increased rates of comorbidity in both countries. The epidemic pattern in KSA was more complex, with animal-to-human, human-to-human, nosocomial and unknown exposure, whereas the outbreak in SK was more clearly nosocomial. Of the 1186 MERS cases in KSA with reported risk factors, 158 (13.3%) cases were hospital associated compared with 175 (94.1%) in SK, and an increased proportion of cases with unknown exposure risk was found in KSA (710, 59.9%).

New York currently represents an epicenter for COVID-19 infection in the United States, with 84,735 cases reported as of April 2, 2020. We previously presented an early experience with seven COVID-positive patients in pregnancy, including two women who were diagnosed with COVID-19 following an asymptomatic initial presentation. We now describe a series of 43 test-confirmed cases of COVID-19 presenting to a pair of affiliated New York City hospitals over two weeks from March 13 to 27, 2020. Fourteen (32.6%) patients presented without any COVID-associated viral symptoms, and were identified either after developing symptoms during admission or following the implementation of universal testing for all obstetrical admissions on March 22. Of these, 10/14 (71.4%) developed symptoms or signs of COVID-19 infection over the course of their delivery admission or early after postpartum discharge. Of the other 29 (67.4%) patients who presented with symptomatic COVID-19 infection, three women ultimately required antenatal admission for viral symptoms, and an additional patient represented six days postpartum after a successful labor induction with worsening respiratory status that required oxygen supplementation. There were no confirmed cases of COVID-19 detected in neonates upon initial testing on the first day of life. Applying COVID-19 disease severity characteristics as described by Wu et al, 37 (86%) women possessed mild disease, four (9.3%) exhibited severe disease, and two (4.7%) developed critical disease; these percentages are similar to those described for non-pregnant adults with COVID-19 infections (about 80% mild, 15% severe, and 5% critical disease).","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Breslin, Noelle; Baptiste, Caitlin; Gyamfi-Bannerman, Cynthia; Miller, Russell; Martinez, Rebecca; Bernstein, Kyra; Ring, Laurence; Landau, Ruth; Purisch, Stephanie; Friedman, Alexander M.; Fuchs, Karin; Sutton, Desmond; Andrikopoulou, Maria; Rupley, Devon; Sheen, Jean-Ju; Aubey, Janice; Zork, Noelia; Moroz, Leslie; Mourad, Mirella; Wapner, Ronald; Simpson, Lynn L.; D\u2019Alton, Mary E.; Goffman, Dena","journal":"Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ed1e8cbab4792adf1ccda99c3a2e004c7b859d0d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7144599.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292903/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589933320300483; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2020.100118; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589933320300483?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Wu"],"organizations":[],"locations":["New York","United States"],"keyphrases":["symptomatic COVID","signs of COVID","confirmed cases of COVID","COVID-positive patients","critical disease","mild disease","severe disease","women","viral symptoms","disease severity characteristics","New York metropolitan area","delivery admission","antenatal admission","initial testing","pair of affiliated New York City hospitals","days postpartum","postpartum discharge","reported case","early experience","implementation of universal testing","asymptomatic initial presentation","worsening respiratory status","successful labor induction","additional patient","presenting","non-pregnant adults","oxygen supplementation","weeks","infections","pregnancy","course","epicenter","obstetrical admissions","Wu et","United States","percentages","neonates","day of life","series","novel coronavirus"],"language":"en"},

The persistence of HRV shedding could be due to the inefficient immunological control of a single infectious episode. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical, virologic and immunologic characteristics of pediatric HSCT recipients with HRV-PI infection. STUDY DESIGN: During the period 2006\u20132012, eight hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients presented with persistent rhinovirus infection (HRV-PI, \u226530 days). Viral load and T-CD4(\u002B), T-CD8(\u002B), B and NK lymphocyte counts at the onset of infection were compared with those of fourteen HSCT recipients with acute HRV infection (HRV-AI, \u226415 days). RESULTS: The median duration of HRV positivity in patients with HRV-PI was 61 days (range 30\u2013174 days) and phylogenetic analysis showed the persistence of a single HRV type in all patients (100%). In HSCT recipients with HRV-PI, T-CD4(\u002B), T-CD8(\u002B) and NK cell counts at the onset of infection were significantly lower than those observed in recipients with HRV-AI (p \u003C 0.01), while B cell counts were similar in the two groups (p = 0.25). A decrease in HRV load was associated with a significant increase in T-CD4(\u002B), T-CD8(\u002B)and NK lymphocyte counts in HRV-PI patients (p \u003C 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a role for cellular immunity in HRV clearance and highlights the importance of its recovery for the control of HRV infection in HSCT recipients.","publish_time":"2015-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Piralla, Antonio; Zecca, Marco; Comoli, Patrizia; Girello, Alessia; Maccario, Rita; Baldanti, Fausto","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40276a234b15f83ca6f70b4956659025fd7b2ae5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172262.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653215001006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653215001006; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2015.03.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25959156/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV","HSCT","NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HRV-AI","HRV load","HRV-PI infection","HRV clearance","HRV-PI patients","control of HRV infection","acute HRV infection","single HRV type","persistence of HRV shedding","immunocompromised hosts HRV infections","median duration of HRV positivity","T-CD4","T-CD8","onset of infection","days","persistent rhinovirus infection","NK cell","B cell counts","immunologic characteristics of pediatric HSCT recipients","persistent infections","NK lymphocyte","hematopoietic stem cell transplant","Viral load","STUDY DESIGN","inefficient immunological control","single infectious episode","role","healthy subjects","severe complications","virologic","cellular immunity","significant increase","importance","recovery","phylogenetic analysis","period","RESULTS","groups","BACKGROUND","range","CONCLUSIONS","decrease","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

STUDY DESIGN: We describe our approach to surge-in-place at a children\u2019s hospital to meet the local demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead of re-deploying pediatric providers to work with internist-led teams throughout a medical center, pediatric physicians and nurses organized and staffed a 40-bed adult COVID-19 treatment unit within a children\u2019s hospital. We adapted internal medicine protocols, developed screening criteria to select appropriate patients for admission, and reorganized staffing and equipment to accommodate adult COVID-19 patients. We used patient counts and descriptive statistics to report sociodemographic, system, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The median patient age was 46 years; 69% were male. On admission, 78 (78%) required oxygen supplementation. During hospitalization, 13 (13%) eventually were intubated. Of the first 100 patients, 14 are still admitted to a medical unit, 6 are in the intensive care unit, 74 have been discharged, 4 died after transfer to the ICU, and 2 died on the unit. The median length of stay for discharged or deceased patients was 4 days (IQR 2,7). CONCLUSIONS: Our pediatric team screened, admitted, and cared for hospitalized adults by leveraging the familiarity of our system, adaptability of our staff, and high-quality infrastructure.

In particular, many viruses manipulate cellular lipids to form complex structures required for viral replication, many of which are dependent on de novo fatty acid synthesis. We found that the energy regulator AMPK, which potently inhibits fatty acid synthesis, restricts infection of the Bunyavirus, Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV), an important re-emerging arthropod-borne human pathogen for which there are no effective vaccines or therapeutics. We show restriction of RVFV both by AMPK and its upstream activator LKB1, indicating an antiviral role for this signaling pathway. Furthermore, we found that AMPK is activated during RVFV infection, leading to the phosphorylation and inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the first rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid synthesis. Activating AMPK pharmacologically both restricted infection and reduced lipid levels. This restriction could be bypassed by treatment with the fatty acid palmitate, demonstrating that AMPK restricts RVFV infection through its inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis. Lastly, we found that this pathway plays a broad role in antiviral defense since additional viruses from disparate families were also restricted by AMPK and LKB1. Therefore, AMPK is an important component of the cell intrinsic immune response that restricts infection through a novel mechanism involving the inhibition of fatty acid metabolism.","publish_time":"2012-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moser, Theresa S.; Schieffer, Daniel; Cherry, Sara","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a32218f7d0b647b6bebeb1526245a0dc8856546.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3330235.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002661; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22532801/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs5MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RVFV","AMPK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RVFV infection","viral infection","restricted infection","fatty acid palmitate","inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis","inhibition of fatty acid metabolism","novo fatty acid synthesis","restriction of RVFV","energy regulator AMPK","antiviral defense","antiviral role","inhibition of acetyl","cell intrinsic immune response","cell intrinsic innate immune responses","additional viruses","line of defense","important component","broad role","cellular lipids","viral replication","cellular pathways","important re-emerging arthropod","upstream activator LKB1","Rift Valley Fever Virus","Bunyavirus","complex structures","disparate families","phosphorylation","novel mechanism","human pathogen","CoA carboxylase","reduced lipid levels","treatment","enzyme","effective vaccines","therapeutics"],"language":"en"},

FCoV spike (S) gene mutations are considered to contribute to the change in virulence by enabling FCoV infection of and replication in macrophages. This study investigated the presence of FCoV with and without S gene mutations in cats with FIP using two different real-time RT-PCRs on different samples obtained under clinical conditions. METHODS: Fine-needle aspirates (FNAs) and incisional biopsies (IBs) of popliteal and mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, omentum and kidneys (each n = 20), EDTA blood (n = 13), buffy coat smears (n = 13), serum (n = 11), effusion (n = 14), cerebrospinal fluid (n = 16), aqueous humour (n = 20) and peritoneal lavage (n = 6) were obtained from 20 cats with FIP diagnosed by immunohistochemistry. Samples were examined by RT-PCR targeting the FCoV 7b gene, detecting all FCoV, and S gene mutation RT-PCR targeting mutations in nucleotides 23531 and 23537. The prevalence of FCoV detected in each sample type was calculated. RESULTS: In 20/20 cats, FCoV with S gene mutations was present in at least one sample, but there was variation in which sample was positive. FCoV with mutations in the S gene were most frequently found in effusion (64%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 39\u201389), followed by spleen, omentum and kidney IBs (50%, 95% CI 28\u201372), mesenteric lymph node IBs and FNAs (45%, 95% CI 23\u201367), and FNAs of spleen and liver and liver IBs (40%, 95% CI 19\u201362). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In these 20 cats with FIP, FCoVs with S gene mutations were found in every cat in at least one tissue or fluid sample. This highlights the association between mutated S gene and systemic FCoV spread. Examining a combination of different samples increased the probability of finding FCoV with the mutated S gene.","publish_time":"2019-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Emmler, Laura; Felten, Sandra; Matiasek, Kaspar; Balzer, Hans-Joerg; Pantchev, Nikola; Leutenegger, Christian; Hartmann, Katrin","journal":"J Feline Med Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4cc8f05660417afe64bbb507b292202b263328f5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206566.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31729897/; https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612x19886671","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs5Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S gene mutations","mutated S gene","FCoV infection","systemic FCoV","FCoV spike","presence of FCoV","prevalence of FCoV","b gene","S gene mutation RT-PCR","FIP","cats","liver IBs","FNAs of spleen","fluid sample","kidney IBs","sample type","combination of different samples","mesenteric lymph node IBs","different real-time RT-PCRs","omentum","FCoVs","effusion","mesenteric lymph nodes","feline coronaviruses","cerebrospinal fluid","Feline infectious peritonitis","incisional biopsies","Fine-needle aspirates","probability","immune response","virulent biotype","OBJECTIVES","association","kidneys","buffy coat smears","clinical conditions","METHODS","host","tissue","variation","change","virulence","replication","macrophages","nucleotides","EDTA blood","aqueous humour","peritoneal lavage","confidence interval","RELEVANCE","study","immunohistochemistry","RESULTS","serum","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Although many viral etiologies of neurologic infectious disease have been recently controlled through vaccination and other public health measures, the emergence of new pathogens and the re-emergence of previously controlled pathogens remain significant global public health challenges. One of the fundamental bases for understanding the dynamics of viral nervous system infections is through epidemiology \u2013 the science of assessing patterns of disease in populations and the factors that influence these patterns. Neuroepidemiology is a discipline that applies epidemiologic principles and practices to neurologic disease. There are several characteristics of neurologic illness that necessitate the subdiscipline of neuroepidemiology. This chapter reviews some of the basic terms and concepts of neuroepidemiology, including epidemiologic analysis and studies. It then applies these concepts to infections of the nervous system, including encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, acute myelitis, prion diseases, and slow virus infections. The chapter then addresses the epidemiology of emerging and re-emerging viral neurologic diseases as well as the factors driving these emergences. The epidemiology of viral nervous system diseases will undoubtedly continue to change and expand, and as we gain a better understanding of this epidemiology and the pathophysiology of viral infections, this will hopefully lead to improved surveillance, diagnostic, treatment, and prevention strategies for these illnesses.","publish_time":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sejvar, James","journal":"Handbook of Clinical Neurology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c947f98bbc971dd9f083a3e6538d781e2aeb7cd1.json; document_parses/pdf_json/fadd8938b43e97024d91a3f4d4af650252d4ab2e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4732278.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-444-53488-0.00003-1; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780444534880000031; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4732278?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25015481/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444534880000031","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs5NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral neurologic diseases","pathophysiology of viral infections","Abstract Viral infections","epidemiology of viral nervous system diseases","dynamics of viral nervous system infections","viral etiologies of neurologic infectious disease","characteristics of neurologic illness","epidemiology of emerging","concepts of neuroepidemiology","patterns of disease","slow virus infections","tremendous burden of neurologic illness","prion diseases","controlled pathogens","subdiscipline of neuroepidemiology","factors","public health measures","epidemiologic principles","epidemiologic analysis","chapter reviews","better understanding","significant global public health challenges","emergence of new pathogens","aseptic meningitis","acute myelitis","re-emergence","encephalitis","diagnostic","treatment","basic terms","practices","prevention strategies","vaccination","science","improved surveillance","studies","populations","fundamental bases","illnesses","emergences"],"language":"en"},

NiV has been placed along with Hendra virus in genus Henipavirus of family Paramyxoviridae. Fruit bats (Genus Pteropus) are known to be natural host and reservoir of NiV. During the outbreaks from Malaysia and Singapore, the roles of pigs as intermediate host were confirmed. The infection transmitted from bats to pigs and subsequently from pigs to humans. Severe encephalitis was reported in NiV infection often associated with neurological disorders. First NiV outbreak in India occurred in Siliguri district of West Bengal in 2001, where direct transmission of the NiV virus from bats\u2010to\u2010human and human\u2010to\u2010human was reported in contrast to the role of pigs in the Malaysian NiV outbreak. Regular NiV outbreaks have been reported from Bangladesh since 2001 to 2015. The latest outbreak of NiV has been recorded in May, 2018 from Kerala, India which resulted in the death of 17 individuals. Due to lack of vaccines and effective antivirals, Nipah encephalitis poses a great threat to public health. Routine surveillance studies in the infected areas can be useful in detecting early signs of infection and help in containment of these outbreaks.","publish_time":"2018-09-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sharma, Vikrant; Kaushik, Sulochana; Kumar, Ramesh; Yadav, Jaya Parkash; Kaushik, Samander","journal":"Rev Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13f5c3597bd413798c5696299c3632d3fadf6344.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169151.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30251294/; https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.2010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["India","Siliguri","West Bengal","Malaysia","Bangladesh"],"keyphrases":["NiV virus","NiV infection","reservoir of NiV","Malaysian NiV outbreak","latest outbreak of NiV","Regular NiV outbreaks","Nipah virus","human population","Hendra virus","roles of pigs","role of pigs","Nipah encephalitis","Severe encephalitis","India","Fruit bats","early signs of infection","severe infections","Genus Pteropus","natural host","intermediate host","genus Henipavirus of family Paramyxoviridae","different occasions","infected areas","great threat","effective antivirals","Siliguri district of West Bengal","direct transmission","Routine surveillance studies","lack of vaccines","high rate of mortality","Singapore","public health","containment","contrast","neurological disorders","emergence","death","Bangladesh","individuals","Kerala","humans"],"language":"en"},

One such method uses stably expressed reference genes. Since suitable reference genes appear to be unique for each tissue, we have identified an optimal set of the most stably expressed genes in human blood that can be used for normalization. METHODS: Whole-genome Affymetrix Human 2.0 Plus arrays were examined from 526 samples of males and females ages 2 to 78, including control subjects and patients with Tourette syndrome, stroke, migraine, muscular dystrophy, and autism. The top 100 most stably expressed genes with a broad range of expression levels were identified. To validate the best candidate genes, we performed quantitative RT-PCR on a subset of 10 genes (TRAP1, DECR1, FPGS, FARP1, MAPRE2, PEX16, GINS2, CRY2, CSNK1G2 and A4GALT), 4 commonly employed reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, B2M and HMBS) and PPIB, previously reported to be stably expressed in blood. Expression stability and ranking analysis were performed using GeNorm and NormFinder algorithms. RESULTS: Reference genes were ranked based on their expression stability and the minimum number of genes needed for nomalization as calculated using GeNorm showed that the fewest, most stably expressed genes needed for acurate normalization in RNA expression studies of human whole blood is a combination of TRAP1, FPGS, DECR1 and PPIB. We confirmed the ranking of the best candidate control genes by using an alternative algorithm (NormFinder). CONCLUSION: The reference genes identified in this study are stably expressed in whole blood of humans of both genders with multiple disease conditions and ages 2 to 78. Importantly, they also have different functions within cells and thus should be expressed independently of each other. These genes should be useful as normalization genes for microarray and RT-PCR whole blood studies of human physiology, metabolism and disease.","publish_time":"2009-08-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stamova, Boryana S; Apperson, Michelle; Walker, Wynn L; Tian, Yingfang; Xu, Huichun; Adamczy, Peter; Zhan, Xinhua; Liu, Da-Zhi; Ander, Bradley P; Liao, Isaac H; Gregg, Jeffrey P; Turner, Renee J; Jickling, Glen; Lit, Lisa; Sharp, Frank R","journal":"BMC Med Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d7ed140eb8fb2b02900f7ed3ad33e99dc438989.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2736983.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1755-8794-2-49; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19656400/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ACTB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["normalization genes","employed reference genes","suitable reference genes","best candidate genes","minimum number of genes","best candidate control genes","human blood","Expression stability","RNA expression studies of human","blood studies of human physiology","Gene expression studies","blood of humans","acurate normalization","appropriate normalization methods","FPGS","DECR1","broad range of expression levels","genome Affymetrix Human","GeNorm","PPIB","quantitative RT-PCR","control subjects","combination of TRAP1","ranking analysis","females ages","NormFinder algorithms","multiple disease conditions","Tourette syndrome","migraine","stroke","GINS2","PEX16","MAPRE2","FARP1","genders","GAPDH","ACTB","microarray","CRY2","patients","A4GALT","B2M","subset","metabolism","muscular dystrophy","alternative algorithm","CSNK1G2","HMBS","arrays","BACKGROUND","nomalization","samples of males","autism","RESULTS","study","different functions","cells","tissue","optimal set","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Objective To determine the relationship of virus-specific wheezing illnesses and lung function in a longitudinal cohort of children at risk for asthma. Methods Two hundred thirty-eight children were followed prospectively from birth to 8 years of age. Early life viral wheezing respiratory illnesses were assessed by using standard techniques, and lung function was assessed annually by using spirometry and impulse oscillometry. The relationships of these virus-specific wheezing illnesses and lung function were assessed by using mixed-effect linear regression. Results Children with RV wheezing illness demonstrated significantly decreased spirometry values, FEV1 (P = .001), FEV0.5 (P \u003C .001), FEF25-75 (P \u003C .001), and also had abnormal impulse oscillometry measures\u2014more negative reactance at 5 Hz (P \u003C .001)\u2014compared with those who did not wheeze with RV. Children who wheezed with respiratory syncytial virus or other viral illnesses did not have any significant differences in spirometric or impulse oscillometry indices when compared with children who did not. Children diagnosed with asthma at ages 6 or 8 years had significantly decreased FEF25-75 (P = .05) compared with children without asthma. Conclusion Among outpatient viral wheezing illnesses in early childhood, those caused by RV infections are the most significant predictors of decreased lung function up to age 8 years in a high-risk birth cohort. Whether low lung function is a cause and/or effect of RV wheezing illnesses is yet to be determined.","publish_time":"2011-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guilbert, Theresa W.; Singh, Anne Marie; Danov, Zoran; Evans, Michael D.; Jackson, Daniel J.; Burton, Ryan; Roberg, Kathy A.; Anderson, Elizabeth L.; Pappas, Tressa E.; Gangnon, Ronald; Gern, James E.; Lemanske, Robert F.","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6014bdbf564ac28219dadfc33ff5abad1bc25ee6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3233203.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674911010591; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674911010591; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21878241/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2011.06.037","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Background Preschool"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus-specific wheezing illnesses","effect of RV wheezing illnesses","specific viral illnesses","outpatient viral wheezing illnesses","Early life viral wheezing respiratory illnesses","low lung function","Results Children","longitudinal cohort of children","early childhood","significant predictors of decreased lung","RV infections","increased risk of childhood asthma","years of age","impulse oscillometry indices","respiratory syncytial virus","relationship of virus","abnormal impulse oscillometry measures","FEF25","high-risk birth cohort","significant differences","spirometry values","mixed-effect linear regression","negative reactance","spirometric","cause","standard techniques","Conclusion","Background Preschool rhinovirus","Hz","FEV1","relationships","ages","Objective","FEV0","Methods"],"language":"en"},

To address these challenges, we have previously developed and validated a pan-viral microarray platform called the Virochip with the capacity to detect all known viruses as well as novel variants on the basis of conserved sequence homology(1). Using the Virochip, we have identified the full spectrum of viruses associated with respiratory infections, including cases of unexplained critical illness in hospitalized patients, with a sensitivity equivalent to or superior to conventional clinical testing(2-5). The Virochip has also been used to identify novel viruses, including the SARS coronavirus(6,7), a novel rhinovirus clade(5), XMRV (a retrovirus linked to prostate cancer)(8), avian bornavirus (the cause of a wasting disease in parrots)(9), and a novel cardiovirus in children with respiratory and diarrheal illness(10). The current version of the Virochip has been ported to an Agilent microarray platform and consists of ~36,000 probes derived from over ~1,500 viruses in GenBank as of December of 2009.

DESIGN: Thirteen clinically moderate, severe or critical COVID-19 patients were treated with atomization inhalation of freeze-dried plasminogen. METHODS: Levels of their lung lesions, oxygen saturation and heart rates were compared before and after treatment by CT scanning images and patient monitor. RESULTS: After plasminogen inhalation, conditions of lung lesions in 5 clinically moderate patients have quickly improved, shown as the decreased range and density of \u2018ground glass\u2019 opacity. Improvements of oxygen saturation were observed in 6 clinically severe patients. In the 2 patients with critical conditions, the oxygen levels have significantly increased from 79-82% to 91% just about 1 hour after the first inhalation. In 8 of 13 patients the heart rates had slowed down. For the 5 clinically moderate patients, the difference is even statistically significant. Furthermore, a general relief of chest tightness was observed. CONCLUSION: Whereas it is reported that plasminogen is dramatically increased in adults with ARDS, this study suggests that additional plasminogen may be effective and efficient in treating lung lesions and hypoxemia during COVID-19 infections. Although further studies are needed, this study highlights a possible hope of efficiently combating this rapid epidemic emergency.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Yuanyuan; Wang, Ting; Guo, Chunying; Zhang, Dongmei; Ge, Xiaojing; Huang, Zhaoxing; Zhou, Xianshan; Li, Yinping; Peng, Qingzhen; Li, Jinan","journal":"QJM","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fbc08fad1bfcfadb9a7e0a11957f822362b6f94c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32275753/; https://doi.org/10.1093/qjmed/hcaa121","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["moderate patients","plasminogen inhalation","severe patients","additional plasminogen","conditions of lung lesions","hypoxemia of COVID","critical COVID","atomization inhalation of freeze-dried plasminogen","oxygen levels","ARDS","critical conditions","ground-glass","ground glass","Improvements of oxygen saturation","study","heart rates","opacity","fibrin degradation","typical signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome","wound healing","key regulator","CT scanning images","treatment","density","patient monitor","coronavirus disease","formation of hyaline membrane","Lungs","possible hope","decreased range","general relief of chest tightness","rapid epidemic emergency","BACKGROUND","difference","adults","RESULTS","METHODS","DESIGN","infections","studies","hour","AIM","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Dual infection with PCV2 and PRRSV is consistently to have more severe clinical presentations and pulmonary lesions than infection with PCV2 alone or PRRSV alone. However, it is not known if dual infections with PCV2 and PRRSV in different infection order may lead to different clinical symptoms in the host. To mimic the possible field conditions, swine alveolar macrophages (AMs) were inoculated with PCV2 and PRRSV in vitro simultaneously or with one virus 18 h earlier than the other. The cell viability, cytopathic effects, antigen-containing rates, phagocytotic and microbial killing capabilities, cytokine profiles (IL-8, TNF-\u03B1, and IFN-\u03B1) and FasL transcripts were determined, analyzed, and compared to prove the hypothesis. RESULTS: A marked reduction in PRRSV antigen-containing rate, cytopathic effect, and TNF-\u03B1 expression level was revealed in AMs inoculated with PCV2 and PRRSV simultaneously and in AMs inoculated with PCV2 first then PRRSV 18 h later, but not in AMs inoculated with PRRSV first then PCV2 18 h later. Transient decrease in phagocytosis but constant reduction in microbicidal capability in AMs in the group inoculated with PCV2 alone and constant decrease in phagocytosis and microbicidal capability in AMs in all PRRSV-inoculated groups were noted. The levels of IL-8, TNF-\u03B1, IFN-\u03B1, and FasL transcripts in AMs in all groups with dual inoculation of PCV2 and PRRSV were significantly increased regardless of the infection orders as compared with infection by PCV2 alone or PRRSV alone. CONCLUSIONS: Swine AMs infected with PCV2 first then PRRSV later or infected with PCV2 and PRRSV simultaneously displayed marked reduction in PRRSV antigen-containing rate, cytopathic effect, and TNF-\u03B1 expression level. The different inoculation orders of PCV2 and PRRSV in AMs leading to different results in viral antigen positivity, cytopathology, and cytokine profile may explain, at least partially, the underlying mechanism of the enhanced pulmonary lesions in PRDC exerted by dual infection with PCV2 and PRRSV and the variable clinical manifestations of PRDC-affected pigs in the field.","publish_time":"2012-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsai, Yi-Chieh; Chang, Hui-Wen; Jeng, Chian-Ren; Lin, Tsang-Long; Lin, Chun-Ming; Wan, Cho-Hua; Pang, Victor Fei","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1be8f67d3b7d2730be96799adfc38746474b0a3b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3528418.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-8-174; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23009687/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV","PRDC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRSV antigen","PRRSV-inoculated groups","dual inoculation of PCV2","different inoculation orders of PCV2","Swine AMs","infection orders","different infection order","IFN-\u03B1","Concurrent infection","TNF-\u03B1 expression level","different results","different clinical symptoms","constant reduction","marked reduction","dual infections","viral antigen positivity","phagocytosis","microbicidal capability","constant decrease","cytopathic effects","variable clinical manifestations of PRDC","FasL transcripts","porcine respiratory disease complex","porcine circovirus type","enhanced pulmonary lesions","severe clinical presentations","respiratory syndrome virus","cytokine profiles","Transient decrease","levels of IL","swine alveolar macrophages","possible field conditions","rates","microbial killing capabilities","phagocytotic","cytopathology","major causes","underlying mechanism","cell viability","pigs","BACKGROUND","host","CONCLUSIONS","hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

We previously identified albumin-associated lipid- and, more specifically, saturated fatty acid-induced transdifferentiation programs in human cancer cells (HCCLs). In this study, we further characterized the adipocyte-like cells, resulting from the transdifferentiation of human cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MALME-3M, and proposed a common mechanistic approach for these transdifferentiating programs. We showed the loss of pigmentation in MALME-3M cells treated with albumin-associated lipids, based on electron microscopic analysis, and the overexpression of perilipin 2 (PLIN2) by western blotting in MALME-3M and MCF-7 cells treated with unsaturated fatty acids. Comparing the gene expression profiles of naive melanoma MALME-3M cells and albumin-associated lipid-treated cells, based on RNA sequencing, we confirmed the transcriptional upregulation of some key adipogenic gene markers and also an alternative splicing of the adipogenic master regulator PPARG, that is probably related to the reported up regulated expression of the protein. Most importantly, these results also showed the upregulation of genes responsible for Clathrin (CLTC) and other adaptor-related proteins. An increase in CLTC expression in the transdifferentiated cells was confirmed by western blotting. Inactivation of CLTC by chlorpromazine (CHP), an inhibitor of CTLC mediated endocytosis (CME), and gene silencing by siRNAs, partially reversed the accumulation of neutral lipids observed in the transdifferentiated cells. These findings give a deeper insight into the phenotypic changes observed in HCCL to adipocyte-like transdifferentiation and point towards CME as a key pathway in distinct transdifferentiation programs.

A new class of corona virus, known as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has been found to be responsible for occurrence of this disease. As far as the history of human civilization is concerned there are instances of severe outbreaks of diseases caused by a number of viruses. According to the report of the World Health Organization (WHO as of April 18 2020), the current outbreak of COVID-19, has affected over 2164111 people and killed more than 146,198 people in more than 200 countries throughout the world. Till now there is no report of any clinically approved antiviral drugs or vaccines that are effective against COVID-19. It has rapidly spread around the world, posing enormous health, economic, environmental and social challenges to the entire human population. The coronavirus outbreak is severely disrupting the global economy.

Our aims were to determine if infants born moderately prematurely (32\u201335 weeks of gestation) who had had an RSV hospitalisation, compared to those who had not, had greater healthcare utilisation and related cost of care in the first 2 years. Two thousand and sixty-six eligible infants\u2019 records were examined to identify three groups: 20 infants admitted for an RSV lower respiratory tract infection (RSV), 30 admitted for another respiratory problem (other respiratory) and 108 admitted for a non-respiratory problem/never admitted (non-respiratory). Healthcare utilisation was assessed by examining hospital and general practitioner records and cost of care calculated using the National Scheme of Reference costs and the British National Formulary prices. The mean cost of care in the RSV group (\u00A312,505) was greater than the non-respiratory (\u00A31,178) (95% CI for difference \u00A35,015 to \u00A317,639, p = 0.002) and the other respiratory (\u00A33,356) groups (95% CI for difference \u00A32,963 to \u00A315,606, p \u003C 0.001).

Forty-two of 2,066 eligible infants had an RSV hospitalisation (2%); thus, assuming prophylaxis would reduce the hospitalisation rate by 50%, the number needed to treat was 98. In conclusion, RSV hospitalisation in moderately prematurely born infants is associated with increased health-related cost of care. Nevertheless, if RSV prophylaxis is to be cost-effective, a high risk group of moderately prematurely born infants needs to be identified.","publish_time":"2012-01-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shefali-Patel, Deena; Paris, Mireia Alcazar; Watson, Fran; Peacock, Janet L; Campbell, Morag; Greenough, Anne","journal":"Eur J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9f23cf6c888606a34c44ea1f22e50418c4f0bbc3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086998.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-012-1673-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22302458/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RSV hospitalisation","non-respiratory groups","RSV group","RSV prophylaxis","non-respiratory problem","RSV lower respiratory tract infection","chronic respiratory morbidity","Respiratory syncytial virus","mean cost of care","CI","increased health-related cost of care","hospitalisation rate","greater healthcare utilisation","eligible infants\u2019 records","general practitioner records","high risk group","adjusted mean differences","National Scheme of Reference costs","British National Formulary prices","conclusion","weeks of gestation","number","years","aims"],"language":"en"},

Previous evidence suggested that the nonstructural proteins (nsp\u2019s) 3, 4, and 6 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which contain transmembrane domains, would all be required for DMV formation. We have now expressed MERS-CoV replicase self-cleaving polyprotein fragments encompassing nsp3-4 or nsp3-6, as well as coexpressed nsp3 and nsp4 of either MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV, to characterize the membrane structures induced. Using electron tomography, we demonstrate that for both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV coexpression of nsp3 and nsp4 is required and sufficient to induce DMVs. Coexpression of MERS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4 either as individual proteins or as a self-cleaving nsp3-4 precursor resulted in very similar DMVs, and in both setups we observed proliferation of zippered ER that appeared to wrap into nascent DMVs. Moreover, when inactivating nsp3-4 polyprotein cleavage by mutagenesis, we established that cleavage of the nsp3/nsp4 junction is essential for MERS-CoV DMV formation. Addition of the third MERS-CoV transmembrane protein, nsp6, did not noticeably affect DMV formation. These findings provide important insight into the biogenesis of coronavirus DMVs, establish strong similarities with other nidoviruses (specifically, the arteriviruses), and highlight possible general principles in viral DMV formation.","publish_time":"2017-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oudshoorn, Diede; Rijs, Kevin; Limpens, Ronald W.

To date only a few compounds have been approved for prophylactic and none for therapeutic use. Nitazoxanide (NTZ) has proven its efficacy in vitro against C. parvum and is approved by FDA for the treatment of human cryptosporidiosis. In a first experimental study, 3 uninfected calves were treated with NTZ and pharmacokinetics was followed through blood samples. Serum samples of uninfected treated calves contained both NTZ metabolites (tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide) and oral administration at 12h intervals was considered as optimal. Three groups of three calves (1\u20133 days old) were then each inoculated with 1\u00D7107 oocysts of C. parvum (cattle genotype): the prophylactic group received 15mg/kg body weight NTZ twice daily orally in milk from 1 day before to 8 days postinoculation (dpi). The therapeutic group received the same dosage of NTZ for 10 days from the appearance of diarrhoea (between 1 and 5 dpi). The control group was left untreated. All calves were monitored daily from day \u22121 to 28 dpi and faecal samples were collected for evaluation of consistency and for determination of oocyst numbers per gram (OPG) of faeces. Diarrhoea was observed in all calves within the first week. Neither prophylactic nor therapeutic use of NTZ improved the clinical appearance and calves of the therapeutic showed a longer diarrheic episode (p \u003C0.05) with strong altered faecal consistence compared to the untreated control group. The number of days with oocyst excretion did not differ significantly between the groups. In 5 out of 6 infected and treated calves oocyst excretion stopped only after discontinuation of treatment. In the prophylactic and in the control group mean values of the sum of the daily OPG per calf (8.5\u00D7106 and 8.0\u00D7106, respectively) and of the mean daily number of OPG (0.3\u00D7106 and 0.3\u00D7106, respectively) were similar, while the therapeutic group showed significantly lower values (1.9\u00D7106 and 0.06\u00D7106, respectively, p \u003C0.05). However oocyst determinations in this group may have been altered by the severe diarrhoea, diluting oocyst densities in the analysed faecal samples. In conclusion, these preliminary results about the first prophylactic and therapeutic use of NTZ in calves did not show the expected positive effect on the course of the Cryptosporidium-infection, neither on reducing the clinical severity, nor on oocyst excretion.","publish_time":"2009-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schnyder, M.; Kohler, L.; Hemphill, A.; Deplazes, P.","journal":"Veterinary Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b4ffc3d0e1beef5562b4aa63ecc8f10d7780dec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117045.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030440170800616X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S030440170800616X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2008.10.094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19062195/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FDA","NTZ","OPG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["therapeutic group","prophylactic group","uninfected calves","therapeutic use of NTZ","treated calves oocyst excretion","calves younger","NTZ metabolites","dosage of NTZ","untreated control group","Serum samples of uninfected treated calves","oocyst determinations","daily OPG","body weight NTZ","appearance of diarrhoea","number of days","mean daily number of OPG","diluting oocyst densities","determination of oocyst numbers","analysed faecal samples","Cryptosporidium parvum","blood samples","severe diarrhoea","Abstract Diarrhoea","days postinoculation","days old","clinical appearance","groups","strong altered faecal consistence","tizoxanide glucuronide","clinical severity","Cryptosporidium-infection","lower values","discontinuation of treatment","treatment of human cryptosporidiosis","sum","oral administration","major problem","course","gram","cattle genotype","evaluation of consistency","h intervals","expected positive effect","FDA","pharmacokinetics","weeks of age","preliminary results","oocysts of","diarrheic episode","calf","milk","experimental study","conclusion","faeces","compounds","efficacy","date","Nitazoxanide"],"language":"en"},

Recent evidence has documented several immunometabolic pathways in patients with diabetes directly related to the COVID-19 infection. This also seems to be the case for prediabetic subjects with proinflammatory insulin resistance syndrome accompanied with prothrombotic hyperinsulinemic and dysglycemic states. Patients with frank hyperglycemia, dysglycemia and/or hyperinsulinemia develop systemic immunometabolic inflammation with higher levels of circulating cytokines. This deleterious scenario has been proposed as the underlying mechanism enhancing a cytokine storm-like hyperinflammatory state in diabetics infected with severe COVID-19 triggering multi-organ failure. Compared with moderately affected COVID-19 patients, diabetes was found to be highly prevalent among severely affected patients suggesting that this non-communicable disease should be considered as a risk factor for adverse outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic mirrors with the diabetes pandemic in many pathobiological aspects. Our interest is to emphasize the ties between the immunoinflammatory mechanisms that underlie the morbidity and lethality when COVID-19 meets diabetes. This review brings attention to two pathologies of highly complex, multifactorial, developmental and environmentally dependent manifestations of critical importance to human survival.

Regarding lipid species, following infection, levels of triglycerides, phospholipids, and several lipid derivatives undergo perturbations, some of which are associated with inflammatory responses. Also, mitochondrial fatty acid \u03B2-oxidation decreases significantly simultaneously with an increase in biosynthesis of fatty acids and membrane lipids. Moreover, essential amino acids are demonstrated to decline in infected tissues due to the production of large amounts of viral and cellular proteins. Immune responses against influenza infection, on the other hand, could significantly affect metabolic pathways.

The current mortality rate is 5.4%, with 1 056 159 people infected worldwide. The disease is reminiscent of SARS in 2002, from which the healthcare system of Singapore has garnered many lessons and applied them in the current climate. As a result of the high transmissibility of the virus, hospitals in Singapore have reduced clinic loads and elective treatments to halt propagation of the virus and also to allow redistribution of healthcare workforce to the frontline. Cancer patients, who are often immunocompromised, are at risk of contracting the disease and becoming seriously ill. At the same time, delaying treatment such as radiotherapy in cancer patients can be detrimental.

METHODS: We prospectively enrolled hospitalized children aged \u003C16 years with LRTI from 2006 to 2015. Children were clinically examined, and nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed using semi-quantitative, real-time polymerase chain reaction tests for HMPV, RSV and 17 other pathogens. HMPV-positive samples were genotyped. RESULTS: A total of 171 children had HMPV infection. HMPV-infected children with single virus (n = 106) and co-detections (n = 65) had similar clinical manifestations. No clinical differences were found between HMPV genotypes A (n = 67) and B (n = 80). The HMPV-infected children were older (median 17.2 months) than RSV-infected children (median 7.3 months, n = 859). Among single virus-infected children, no differences in age-adjusted LRTI diagnoses were found between HMPV and RSV. Age was an important factor for disease severity among single virus-infected children, where children \u003C6 months old with HMPV had a milder disease than those with RSV, while in children 12\u201323 months old, the pattern was the opposite. In multivariable logistic regression analysis for each virus type, age \u226512 months (HMPV), and age \u003C6 months (RSV), prematurity, \u22651 chronic disease and high viral loads of RSV, but not high HMPV viral loads, were risk factors for severe disease. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalized children with LRTI, HMPV manifests independently of viral co-detections and HMPV genotypes. Disease severity in HMPV- and RSV-infected children varies in relation to age. A history of prematurity and chronic disease increases the risk of severe LRTI among HMPV- and RSV-infected children.","publish_time":"2017-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moe, Nina; Krokstad, Sidsel; Stenseng, Inger Heimdal; Christensen, Andreas; Skanke, Lars H\u00F8s\u00F8ien; Risnes, Kari Ravndal; Nordb\u00F8, Svein Arne; D\u00F8llner, Henrik","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b7667a10db8449042b2fa73329cdfac5358ad34.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5240941.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0170200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28095451/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsxMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HMPV","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HMPV-infected children","HMPV genotypes","RSV-infected children","HMPV infection","HMPV manifests","single virus-infected children","HMPV-positive samples","high HMPV viral loads","enrolled hospitalized children","severe disease","high viral loads of RSV","risk of severe LRTI","chronic disease","disease severity","months old","milder disease","age-adjusted LRTI diagnoses","virus type","viral co-detections","clinical differences","respiratory syncytial virus","risk factors","clinical course","similar clinical manifestations","lower respiratory tract infection","history of prematurity","real-time polymerase chain reaction tests","human metapneumovirus","important factor","multivariable logistic regression analysis","years","total","relation","nasopharyngeal aspirates","pattern","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","opposite","RESULTS","pathogens","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Single BuCoV infections were detected in all but one cases from which two clostridia species were also isolated. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the 5\u2032 end of the spike-protein gene showed that three BuCoVs were closely related to the prototype strain 179/07-11, whereas the fourth isolate (339/08-C) displayed a higher genetic identity to recent BCoV reference strains. Three strains adapted to the in vitro grow on human rectal tumour cells were also evaluated for their ability to replicate in a bovine cell line (Madin Darby bovine kidney) and to cause haemagglutination of chicken erythrocytes and all displayed biological properties similar to those already described for the prototype BuCoV.

Together, they are responsible for billions of dollars of health care expenditures. The pathogenesis of the 2 conditions is identical. In the majority of children with each condition, a preceding viral upper respiratory tract infection predisposes to the development of the acute bacterial complication. It has been shown that viral upper respiratory tract infection predisposes to the development of acute otitis media in 37% of cases. Currently, precise microbiologic diagnosis of acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis requires performance of tympanocentesis in the former and sinus aspiration in the latter. The identification of a virus from the nasopharynx in either case does not obviate the need for antimicrobial therapy. Furthermore, nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs are not useful in predicting the results of culture of the middle ear or paranasal sinus. However, it is possible that a combination of information regarding nasopharyngeal colonization with bacteria and infection with specific viruses may inform treatment decisions in the future.","publish_time":"2011-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wald, Ellen R.","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a3f000bbca1c94ebc993d8ccf1aaae759ad61c50.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107845.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21460285/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cir042","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsxOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute bacterial sinusitis","development of acute otitis media","acute bacterial complication","precise microbiologic diagnosis of acute otitis media","preceding viral upper respiratory tract infection","nasopharyngeal colonization","nasopharyngeal swabs","antimicrobial agents","paranasal sinus","majority of children","antimicrobial therapy","sinus aspiration","specific viruses","performance of tympanocentesis","billions of dollars","middle ear","results of culture","treatment decisions","combination of information","common indications","health care expenditures","nasopharynx","need","pathogenesis","conditions","identification","future","cases"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The EQA program consisted of two phases; self-validation and blind assessment. For the first EQA phase, in vitro transcribed upstream region of the envelope gene (upE) and the open reading frame (ORF)1a RNAs were used at a concentration of 1,000 copies/\u00B5L. The test panel for the second EQA phase consisted of RNA extracts from three samples, which were obtained from two MERS-CoV positive patients and one MERS-CoV negative patient. RESULTS: The first EQA phase results for 46 participants showed a linear relationship between the threshold cycle (C(T)) values of RNA materials and the logarithmic concentrations for both upE and ORF1a gene targets (R(2)=0.73 and 0.75, respectively). The mean C(T) value for each concentration was different depending on which commercial kit was used for the assay. Among the three commonly used kits, PowerChek MERS Real-Time PCR kit (KogeneBiotech, Korea) showed the lowest C(T) values at all concentrations of upE and most concentrations of ORF1a. The second EQA phase results for 47 participants were 100% correct for all tested samples. CONCLUSIONS: This EQA survey demonstrates that the MERS-CoV molecular testing performed in Korea during the 2015 outbreak is of robust capability. However, careful establishment and validation of a cut-off value are recommended to ensure good analytical sensitivity.","publish_time":"2015-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seong, Moon-Woo; Lee, Seung Jun; Cho, Sung Im; Ko, Kyungphil; Kim, Mi-Na; Sung, Heungsub; Kim, Jae-Seok; Ahn, Ji Soo; Yu, Byung Su; Kim, Taek Soo; Kim, Eui Chong; Park, Sung Sup","journal":"Ann Lab Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/663f66630b5b3b7914dcbcaed555d5865da925dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4773263.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26915611/; https://doi.org/10.3343/alm.2016.36.3.230","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsyMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Middle East Asia","Korea"],"keyphrases":["EQA phase results","EQA program","EQA survey","MERS-CoV molecular testing","MERS-CoV positive patients","MERS-CoV negative patient","Korea","concentrations of upE","concentrations of ORF1a","used kits","PowerChek MERS Real-Time PCR kit","logarithmic concentrations","lowest C","participants","mean C","Middle East Asia","values of RNA materials","ORF1a gene targets","commercial kit","cut-off value","envelope gene","self-validation","RNA extracts","blind assessment","largest outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","tested samples","external quality assessment","KogeneBiotech","transcribed upstream region","phases","infection","linear relationship","different depending","threshold cycle","open reading frame","rapid expansion of laboratories","careful establishment","good analytical sensitivity","RNAs","BACKGROUND","test panel","copies","\u00B5L","robust capability","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","assays"],"language":"en"},

Cardiac catheterization and coil embolization of aorto\u2010pulmonary collateral vessels (APCs) is uncommon in pediatric hemoptysis patients without congenital heart disease. METHODS: We present a series of seven infants (\u226412 months of age) with hemoptysis, all of whom underwent cardiac catheterization to look for and intervene upon APCs, if found. Only those patients who underwent both bronchoscopy as well as cardiac catheterization from January 1995 to January 2015 were included in this retrospective review. RESULTS: Seven patients met inclusion criteria, and three had a history of recurrent hemoptysis. The mean age was 3 months. Four had evidence of bleeding on bronchoscopy. All seven had respiratory distress which necessitated ICU admission; five required mechanical ventilation. Cardiac catheterization showed significant APCs (\u003E2 mm) in six of the seven studied patients, all of which were coil embolized. One patient had no significant APCs and therefore, no embolization. All patients had complete resolution with no recurrences during the 10\u201020\u2010year outpatient follow\u2010up period.

Frequent mutations in the viral genome result in viruses with immune escape mutants. Irrespective of regular vaccination, control of PRRSV remains a challenge to swine farmers. In PRRSV-infected pigs, innate cytokine IFN-\u03B1 is inhibited and the adaptive arm of the immunity is delayed. To elucidate both cellular and innate cytokine responses at very early stages of PRRSV infection, seven weeks old pigs maintained on a commercial pig farm were infected and analyzed. RESULTS: One pig in a pen containing 25 pigs was PRRSV infected and responses from this pig and one penmate were assessed two days later. All the infected and a few of the contact neighbor pigs were viremic. At day 2 post-infection, approximately 50% of viremic pigs had greater than 50% reduction in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and nearly a 1-fold increase in IFN-\u03B1 production was detected in blood of a few pigs. Enhanced secretion of IL-4 (in ~90%), IL-12 (in ~40%), and IL-10 (in ~20%) (but not IFN-\u03B3) in PRRSV infected pigs was observed. In addition, reduced frequency of myeloid cells, CD4(-)CD8(\u002B )T cells, and CD4(\u002B)CD8(\u002B )T cells and upregulated frequency of lymphocytes bearing natural T regulatory cell phenotype were detected in viremic pigs. Interestingly, all viremic contact pigs also had comparable immune cell modulations. CONCLUSION: Replicating PRRSV in both infected and contact pigs was found to be responsible for rapid modulation in NK cell-meditated cytotoxicity and alteration in the production of important immune cytokines. PRRSV-induced immunological changes observed simultaneously at both cellular and cytokine levels early post-infection appear to be responsible for the delay in generation of adaptive immunity.

As a result, many researchers have studied this subject from a variety of perspectives. In this study, we propose an alternative methodology of determining the expansion of baggage carousel capacity over a series of steps that includes both a simulation and a cost-benefit analysis. The methodology consists of three stages. In the first stage, we forecast the volume of arriving passengers (excluding transfer passengers) and aircraft traffic with an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. Next, we conduct an elaborate analysis to estimate passenger delay using a discrete event simulation model in which we consider the conveyor load and the baggage carousel allocation to aircraft rates. Finally, we determine a plan to expand baggage carousel capacity that accounts for expansion costs and passenger benefits. Construction and conveyor costs were applied to expansion costs, and capacity expansion leads to passenger benefits due to reduced waiting time. Using a real case with 23 candidate baggage carousels at Incheon International Airport during 2013\u20132015, our experiments demonstrate the strength of the proposed methodology in planning appropriate capacity expansion that reflect the operational flow of passengers within the airport based on the future trend of passenger demand. In particular, our results show that carousel no. 18 should be expanded during the first quarter of 2013, carousels no. 17 and no. 19 should be expanded in 2014, and carousel no. 5 should be expanded in 2015 to obtain optimal benefit-cost ratios of 1.65, 1.79, and 1.76 for each year, respectively.","publish_time":"2015-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yoon, Sung Wook; Jeong, Suk Jae","journal":"Journal of Air Transport Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88062d20d1ba791e426c3300fa16e595410706c2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699714001227; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0969699714001227","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Incheon International Airport"],"keyphrases":["expansion of baggage carousel capacity","expansion costs","capacity expansion leads","baggage carousel allocation","planning appropriate capacity expansion","passenger benefits","infrastructure expansion capacities","transfer passengers","passenger delay","conveyor costs","candidate baggage carousels","air transportation passengers","operational flow of passengers","volume of arriving passengers","proposed methodology","alternative methodology","cost-benefit analysis","future trend of passenger demand","optimal benefit-cost ratios","aircraft traffic","discrete event simulation model","aircraft rates","optimal designs","conveyor load","elaborate analysis","Incheon International Airport","autoregressive integrated moving average","ARIMA","Abstract Intensifying competition","airports","strength","real case","series of steps","reduced waiting time","subject","terminals","researchers","variety of perspectives","experiments","study","results","Construction","quarter","stages","year"],"language":"en"},

The identification of particle sources from concentration distributions is a difficult task because particles are often released at a time-varying rate, and particle transport mechanisms are more complex than those of gas. This study proposes an improved multi-robot olfactory search method for locating two types of time-varying indoor particle sources: 1) periodic sources such as occupants\u2019 respiratory activities and 2) decaying sources such as laboratory leaky containers with hazardous chemicals. The method considers both particle concentrations and indoor air velocities by including an upwind term in the standard particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, preventing robots from becoming trapped into a local optimum, which occurs when using other algorithms. We also considered two ventilation types (mixing ventilation and displacement ventilation) when particles are emitted from different source types, comprising four scenarios. For each scenario, particle concentration and air velocity were simulated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and then fed to the PSO algorithm for source localization. In addition, we validated the CFD approach for one scenario by comparing experimental data (e.g., velocities and particle concentrations) under laboratory settings. The results showed that the proposed method can locate the two types of particle sources within approximately 55 s, and the success rates of source localization exceeding 96%, which is a much higher level than levels achieved from the standard PSO and wind utilization II algorithms.","publish_time":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, Qilin; Cai, Hao; Li, Fei; Liu, Xiaoran; Liu, Shichao; Xu, Jiheng","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c2489ba99a4247b52130bcce78ee3669a67c21c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117037.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287987/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.10.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132318306267; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132318306267","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PSO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["types of particle sources","indoor particle sources","particle concentrations","identification of particle sources","particle transport mechanisms","periodic sources","ventilation types","standard particle swarm optimization","types of time","indoor air velocities","different source types","standard PSO","PSO algorithm","indoor transmission of airborne particles","displacement ventilation","mixing ventilation","proposed method","algorithms","success rates of source localization","time-varying rate","air velocity","concentration distributions","laboratory settings","CFD approach","improved multi-robot olfactory search method","laboratory leaky containers","upwind term","effective ways","health-related","disease","computational fluid dynamics","life-threatening effects","occupants\u2019 respiratory activities","difficult task","study","hazardous chemicals","levels","robots","experimental data","wind utilization","scenarios","local optimum","higher level","addition","results","gas"],"language":"en"},

Many components of common fruits and vegetables play well-documented roles as chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic agents that suppress tumorigenesis. Anthraquinones are commonly extracted from the Polygonaceae family of plants, e.g., Rheum palmatum and Rheum officinale. Some of the major chemical components of anthraquinone and its derivatives, such as aloe-emodin, danthron, emodin, chrysophanol, physcion, and rhein, have demonstrated potential anticancer properties. This review evaluates the pharmacological effects of emodin, a major component of Aloe vera. In particular, emodin demonstrates anti-neoplastic, anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenesis, and toxicological potential for use in pharmacology, both in vitro and in vivo. Emodin demonstrates cytotoxic effects (e.g., cell death) through the arrest of the cell cycle and the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells. The overall molecular mechanisms of emodin include cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and the promotion of the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03B1, glutathione S-transferase P, N-acetyltransferase, and glutathione phase I and II detoxification enzymes while inhibiting angiogenesis, invasion, migration, chemical-induced carcinogen-DNA adduct formation, HER2/neu, CKII kinase, and p34cdc2 kinase in human cancer cells. Hopefully, this summary will provide information regarding the actions of emodin in cancer cells and broaden the application potential of chemotherapy to additional cancer patients in the future.","publish_time":"2012-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hsu, Shu-Chun; Chung, Jing-Gung","journal":"Biomedicine (Taipei)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b205f1be8d3e522288ede5b4b0846062fa3a8596.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104001.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289000/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomed.2012.03.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211802012000241; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211802012000241","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aloe-emodin","actions of emodin","pharmacological effects of emodin","human cancer cells","overall molecular mechanisms of emodin","cell cycle arrest","anti-angiogenesis","toxicological potential","additional cancer patients","cell death","low toxicity","cytotoxic effects","low number","low cost","major chemical components of anthraquinone","application potential of chemotherapy","potential anticancer properties","p34cdc2 kinase","CKII kinase","glutathione phase","induction of apoptosis","major component of Aloe vera","Rheum palmatum","Rheum officinale","components of common fruits","glutathione S-transferase P","chemical-induced carcinogen-DNA","well-documented roles","chemopreventive","vegetables","inducible factor","HER2","neu","N-acetyltransferase","invasion","anti-inflammatory","chemotherapeutic agents","rhein","detoxification enzymes","migration","chrysophanol","derivatives","danthron","expression of hypoxia","TCM","promotion","physcion","use","clinical research","Polygonaceae family of plants","Traditional Chinese Medicine","tumorigenesis","pharmacology","future","information"],"language":"en"},

This study was performed to determine the time course of recovery from lymphocytopenia and resolution of pneumonitis of critical H7N9 infection patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) for patients with H7N9 influenza. Lesion patterns, distributions, and changes at follow-up chest X-ray and/or CT were investigated. The time to progression on chest CT image, and the time to resolution of the chest CT findings were assessed. RESULTS: Lymphocytopenia was a common laboratory test abnormality. The most common CT findings were lobar consolidation with air bronchogram and ground-glass opacities. For 7 recovering patients, the time to resolution of the chest CT findings was 10\u201390 days. Fibrosis and traction bronchiectasis were the main features on the CT scans of recovering patients. Interestingly, the time to recovery from lymphopenia was highly consistent with time to resolution of the chest CT findings. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown the presence of radiographic abnormalities among H7N9 patients. Monitoring of the variation of lymphocytes for H7N9 patients has important clinical significance, especially for prediction of the resolution of pneumonitis.","publish_time":"2015-09-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Cheng; Chen, Jun; Huang, Jian-An","journal":"Jpn J Radiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8462f4a93ea5bbf56681ef597fd6a997c194c911.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088838.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11604-015-0476-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26345427/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chest CT findings","H7N9 patients","chest CT image","common CT findings","CT scans of recovering patients","resolution of pneumonitis","critical H7N9 infection patients","H7N9 influenza","chest radiographic characteristics","follow-up chest X-ray","time course of recovery","human H7N9 infections","lymphocytopenia","associated morbidity","presence of radiographic abnormalities","common laboratory test abnormality","air bronchogram","lobar consolidation","mortality","main features","emerging pathogen","changes","important clinical significance","broader understanding","distributions","prediction","variation of lymphocytes","ground-glass opacities","computed tomography","traction bronchiectasis","lymphopenia","progression","Fibrosis","Lesion patterns","RESULTS","PURPOSE","METHODS","Monitoring","MATERIALS","days","CONCLUSIONS","study"],"language":"en"},

There is a need to assess their test performance relative to one another. Objectives The aim of this study was to compare the test performance of a high complexity laboratory-developed rRT-PCR EUA from Stanford Health Care (SHC) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) gene with other tests: the Atila isothermal amplification assay targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene and open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab), the Altona E and spike (S) multiplex, real-time RT-PCR, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) N1 and N2 rRT-PCRs. Study Design A diagnostic comparison study was performed by testing nasopharyngeal samples from persons under investigation for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Assay performance was assessed by percent agreement and Cohen\u2019s kappa coefficient. Results Positive percent agreement with the SHC EUA reference assay was 82.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 65.0 to 92.9) for Atila, 86.7% (95% CI 69.7 to 95.3) for the Altona E and S targets, and 86.7% (95% CI 69.7 to 95.3) and 90.0% (95% CI 73.6 to 97.3), for the CDC N1 and N2 targets, respectively. All assays demonstrated 100% negative percent agreement. Kappa coefficients ranged from 0.86 to 0.92, indicating excellent agreement. Conclusions Performance was comparable among the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification methods tested, with a limited number of discrepancies observed in specimens with low viral loads.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bulterys, Philip L.; Garamani, Natasha; Stevens, Bryan; Sahoo, Malaya K.; Huang, ChunHong; Hogan, Catherine A.; Zehnder, James; Pinsky, Benjamin A.","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c40992590dba718babc9530b2142b8675e96428.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7207111.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301694?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301694","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs0Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cohen"],"organizations":["Stanford Health Care","US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","CDC","Study Design"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Assay performance","rRT-PCR EUA","SARS-CoV","Atila isothermal amplification assay","isothermal amplification methods","Positive percent agreement","negative percent agreement","nucleic acid amplification methods","Altona E","Conclusions Performance","excellent agreement","real-time RT-PCR","test performance relative","SHC EUA reference assay","reverse transcription PCR","gene","N2 rRT-PCRs","CDC N1","S targets","N2 targets","ABSTRACT Background Numerous nucleic acid amplification tests","diagnostic comparison study","Disease Control","coronavirus disease","Kappa coefficients","Cohen\u2019s kappa coefficient","Prevention","nucleocapsid","open reading frame","specimens","investigation","ORF1ab","multiplex","Stanford Health Care","high complexity laboratory","US Centers","persons","nasopharyngeal samples","spike","limited number of discrepancies","envelope","low viral loads","COVID","emergency use authorization","need","assays","Objectives","aim","confidence interval","RNA"],"language":"en"},

We investigated the effects of experimental human HRV serotype 16 infection on the upper respiratory tract microbiota. METHODS: Six healthy volunteers were infected with HRV16. We performed 16S ribosomal RNA-targeted pyrosequencing on throat swabs taken prior, during and after infection. We compared overall community diversity, phylogenetic structure of the ecosystem and relative abundances of the different bacteria between time points. RESULTS: During acute infection strong trends towards increases in the relative abundances of Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Neisseria subflava were observed, as well as a weaker trend towards increases of Staphylococcus aureus. No major differences were observed between day-1 and day 60, whereas differences between subjects were very high. CONCLUSIONS: HRV16 infection is associated with the increase of three genera known to be associated with secondary infections following HRV infections. The observed changes of upper respiratory tract microbiota could help explain why HRV infection predisposes to bacterial otitis media, sinusitis and pneumonia.

On March 1, a health care provider at a second long-term care skilled nursing facility (facility A) in King County, Washington, had a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, after working while symptomatic on February 26 and 28. By March 6, seven residents of this second facility were symptomatic and had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2. On March 13, CDC performed symptom assessments and SARS-CoV-2 testing for 76 (93%) of the 82 facility A residents to evaluate the utility of symptom screening for identification of COVID-19 in SNF residents. Residents were categorized as asymptomatic or symptomatic at the time of testing, based on the absence or presence of fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms on the day of testing or during the preceding 14 days. Among 23 (30%) residents with positive test results, 10 (43%) had symptoms on the date of testing, and 13 (57%) were asymptomatic. Seven days after testing, 10 of these 13 previously asymptomatic residents had developed symptoms and were recategorized as presymptomatic at the time of testing. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing cycle threshold (Ct) values indicated large quantities of viral RNA in asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic residents, suggesting the potential for transmission regardless of symptoms. Symptom-based screening in SNFs could fail to identify approximately half of residents with COVID-19. Long-term care facilities should take proactive steps to prevent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 (3). Once a confirmed case is identified in an SNF, all residents should be placed on isolation precautions if possible (3), with considerations for extended use or reuse of personal protective equipment (PPE) as needed (4).","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kimball, Anne; Hatfield, Kelly M.; Arons, Melissa; James, Allison; Taylor, Joanne; Spicer, Kevin; Bardossy, Ana C.; Oakley, Lisa P.; Tanwar, Sukarma; Chisty, Zeshan; Bell, Jeneita M.; Methner, Mark; Harney, Josh; Jacobs, Jesica R.; Carlson, Christina M.; McLaughlin, Heather P.; Stone, Nimalie; Clark, Shauna; Brostrom-Smith, Claire; Page, Libby C.; Kay, Meagan; Lewis, James; Russell, Denny; Hiatt, Brian; Gant, Jessica; Duchin, Jeffrey S.; Clark, Thomas A.; Honein, Margaret A.; Reddy, Sujan C.; Jernigan, John A.; Baer, Atar; Barnard, Leslie M.; Benoliel, Eileen; Fagalde, Meaghan S.; Ferro, Jessica; Smith, Hal Garcia; Gonzales, Elysia; Hatley, Noel; Hatt, Grace; Hope, Michaela; Huntington-Frazier, Melinda; Kawakami, Vance; Lenahan, Jennifer L.; Lukoff, Margaret D.; Maier, Emily B.; McKeirnan, Shelly; Montgomery, Patricia; Morgan, Jennifer L.; Mummert, Laura A.; Pogosjans, Sargis; Riedo, Francis X.; Schwarcz, Leilani; Smith, Daniel; Stearns, Steve; Sykes, Kaitlyn J.; Whitney, Holly; Ali, Hammad; Banks, Michelle; Balajee, Arun; Chow, Eric J.; Cooper, Barbara; Currie, Dustin W.; Dyal, Jonathan; Healy, Jessica; Hughes, Michael; McMichael, Temet M.; Nolen, Leisha; Olson, Christine; Rao, Agam K.; Schmit, Kristine; Schwartz, Noah G.; Tobolowsky, Farrell; Zacks, Rachael; Zane, Suzanne","journal":"MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f122876a8ca4f4ee0b3b77965859502dbf79e938.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119514.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32240128/; https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6913e1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC"],"locations":["Washington"],"keyphrases":["asymptomatic residents","SNF residents","half of residents","time of testing","SARS-CoV","day of testing","date of testing","symptoms","long-term care skilled nursing facility","Long-term care facilities","testing cycle threshold","identification of COVID","positive test results","introduction of SARS","health care provider","Symptom-based screening","King County","symptom assessments","utility of symptom screening","Washington","presymptomatic","potential","days","novel coronavirus","types of facilities","severe coronavirus disease","underlying health conditions","RT-PCR","values","large quantities of viral RNA","reuse of personal protective equipment","proactive steps","reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","extended use","cough","outbreak","presence of fever","Older adults","shortness of breath","considerations","PPE","cases","absence","SNFs","rapid spread","age","outcomes","isolation precautions","CDC","transmission","consequence","confirmed case"],"language":"en"},

Chronic pathogen carriage is one mechanism that allows diseases to persist in populations. We hypothesized that persistent or recurrent pneumonia in bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) populations may be caused by chronic carriers of Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae (Mo). Our experimental approach allowed us to address a conservation need while investigating the role of chronic carriage in disease persistence. 2. We tested our hypothesis in two bighorn sheep populations in South Dakota, USA. We identified and removed Mo chronic carriers from the Custer State Park (treatment) population. Simultaneously, we identified carriers but did not remove them from the Rapid City population (control). We predicted removal would result in decreased pneumonia, mortality, and Mo prevalence. Both population ranges had similar habitat and predator communities but were sufficiently isolated to preclude intermixing. 3. We classified chronic carriers as adults that consistently tested positive for Mo carriage over a 20\u2010month sampling period (n = 2 in the treatment population; n = 2 in control population). 4. We failed to detect Mo or pneumonia in the treatment population after chronic carrier removal, while both remained in the control. Mortality hazard for lambs was reduced by 72% in the treatment population relative to the control (CI = 36%, 91%). There was also a 41% reduction in adult mortality hazard attributable to the treatment, although this was not statistically significant (CI = 82% reduction, 34% increase). 5. Synthesis and Applications: These results support the hypothesis that Mo is a primary causative agent of persistent or recurrent respiratory disease in bighorn sheep populations and can be maintained by a few chronic carriers. Our findings provide direction for future research and management actions aimed at controlling pneumonia in wild sheep and may apply to other diseases.","publish_time":"2020-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garwood, Tyler J.; Lehman, Chadwick P.; Walsh, Daniel P.; Cassirer, E.

There has been active investment but earlier review of pandemic preparedness plans in the region reveals that the translation of these strategic plans into operational plans is still lacking in some countries particularly those with low resources. The objective of this study is to understand the pandemic preparedness programmes, the health systems context, and challenges and constraints specific to the six Asian countries namely Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Taiwan, Thailand, and Viet Nam in the prepandemic phase before the start of H1N1/2009. METHODS: The study relied on the Systemic Rapid Assessment (SYSRA) toolkit, which evaluates priority disease programmes by taking into account the programmes, the general health system, and the wider socio-cultural and political context. The components under review were: external context; stewardship and organisational arrangements; financing, resource generation and allocation; healthcare provision; and information systems. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected in the second half of 2008 based on a review of published data and interviews with key informants, exploring past and current patterns of health programme and pandemic response. RESULTS: The study shows that health systems in the six countries varied in regard to the epidemiological context, health care financing, and health service provision patterns. For pandemic preparation, all six countries have developed national governance on pandemic preparedness as well as national pandemic influenza preparedness plans and Avian and Human Influenza (AHI) response plans. However, the governance arrangements and the nature of the plans differed. In the five developing countries, the focus was on surveillance and rapid containment of poultry related transmission while preparation for later pandemic stages was limited. The interfaces and linkages between health system contexts and pandemic preparedness programmes in these countries were explored. CONCLUSION: Health system context influences how the six countries have been preparing themselves for a pandemic. At the same time, investment in pandemic preparation in the six Asian countries has contributed to improvement in health system surveillance, laboratory capacity, monitoring and evaluation and public communications. A number of suggestions for improvement were presented to strengthen the pandemic preparation and mitigation as well as to overcome some of the underlying health system constraints.","publish_time":"2010-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hanvoravongchai, Piya; Adisasmito, Wiku; Chau, Pham Ngoc; Conseil, Alexandra; de Sa, Joia; Krumkamp, Ralf; Mounier-Jack, Sandra; Phommasack, Bounlay; Putthasri, Weerasak; Shih, Chin-Shui; Touch, Sok; Coker, Richard","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30fc9806c9b1ba0d786a31cad4a1d98b6642462d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2896940.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-10-322; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20529345/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Viet Nam"],"organizations":["Systemic Rapid Assessment"],"locations":["Southeast Asia","Cambodia","Indonesia","Thailand"],"keyphrases":["pandemic preparation","pandemic preparedness programmes","pandemic response","health systems context","health system surveillance","national pandemic influenza preparedness plans","earlier review of pandemic preparedness plans","health system contexts","general health system","Health system context influences","Asian countries","later pandemic stages","underlying health system constraints","developing countries","health care financing","response plans","health service provision patterns","current patterns of health programme","strategic plans","operational plans","external context","epidemiological context","political context","study","priority disease programmes","review of published data","improvement","information systems","national governance","governance arrangements","Human Influenza","healthcare provision","organisational arrangements","Southeast Asia","constraints specific","Asia-Pacific","active investment","quantitative data","Systemic Rapid Assessment","rapid containment of poultry related transmission","toolkit","resource generation","key informants","Taiwan","allocation","interviews","Indonesia","stewardship","laboratory capacity","account","Lao PDR","prepandemic phase","Viet Nam","Thailand","SYSRA","Cambodia","AHI","focus","challenges","linkages","evaluation","substantial attention","translation","interfaces","CONCLUSION","region","regard","anticipation","start of H1N1","components","nature","time","public communications","number of suggestions","half","low resources","epicentre","RESULTS","mitigation","BACKGROUND","objective","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS) is an instrument that was designed to assess caregivers\u2019 perceptions of OHRQoL in preschool children. Although it has been translated into many languages, it has yet to be validated in Arabic. Therefore, this study aimed to translate this questionnaire to Arabic (A-ECOHIS) and test its psychometric properties. METHODS: Questionnaire responses from three samples of caregivers of preschool children \u2264 6 years of age were collected: (i) community-based (n = 422), from preschools selected as a stratified random sample; (ii) clinic-based, from those seeking pediatric dental care at a university clinic (n = 246); and (iii) a test-retest sample (n = 68), a clinic-based group of caregivers who completed questionnaires twice about siblings who were not receiving dental care. Children received a dental examination to assess their decayed, missed, filled teeth (dmft) scores. Convergent validity was evaluated by assessing the A-ECOHIS scores in relation to the response to a global question. Discriminant validity was evaluated by comparing the scores of children with varying levels of oral disease. Internal consistency was assessed by calculating Cronbach\u2019s alpha, and the test-retest reliability was assessed using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs). RESULTS: The A-ECOHIS scores of the questionnaire sections and the global oral health rating were significantly correlated; Spearman correlation coefficients were, r = 0.55, P \u2264 0.01 (overall score), r = 0.54, P \u2264 0.01 (child section), and r = 0.51, P \u2264 0.01 (family section). The mean A-ECOHIS scores were also statistically significantly higher in children with higher dmft scores compared with lower dmft, and in the clinic-based sample compared with the community sample. The Cronbach\u2019s alpha value of the the child, family sections and overall questionnaire were, 0.80, 0.78, and 0.85, respectively. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of A-ECOHIS was 0.86. CONCLUSION: The A-ECOHIS performed well on all psychometric tests to which it was applied. Thus, it is a valid and reliable instrument that can be used in Arabic-speaking caregivers of preschoolers aged 2 to 6 years.","publish_time":"2017-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Farsi, Nada J.; El-Housseiny, Azza A.; Farsi, Deema J.; Farsi, Najat M.","journal":"BMC Oral Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e6d560c0ed2c420b3ca34de569c8a46d3722e2da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5331632.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28245876/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12903-017-0353-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Spearman"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ECOHIS scores","scores of children","preschool children","clinic-based sample","higher dmft scores","well-being of children","global oral health rating","questionnaire sections","overall questionnaire","clinic-based group of caregivers","test-retest sample","community sample","Arabic","Questionnaire responses","university clinic","adverse effects of oral health problems","oral health-related quality of life","intra-class correlation coefficients","Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale","varying levels of oral disease","samples of caregivers","family sections","lower dmft","Spearman correlation coefficients","caregivers of preschoolers","child section","stratified random sample","pediatric dental care","test-retest reliability","dental examination","Cronbach\u2019s alpha value","global question","overall score","reliable instrument","years of age","psychometric properties","psychometric tests","Convergent validity","Discriminant validity","caregivers\u2019 perceptions of OHRQoL","Assessment","preschools","questionnaires","siblings","ICCs","BACKGROUND","METHODS","teeth","Internal consistency","RESULTS","study","CONCLUSION","languages"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, RNA in situ hybridization was used to detect the expression of HEPIS in breast cancer and cancer-adjacent normal breast tissue. HEPIS was expressed at lower levels in breast cancer compared with that in adjacent normal tissue. Subcellular localization of HEPIS was mainly found in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. Cell Counting Kit-8 and 5-ethynyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine cell proliferation assays were used to investigate the role of HEPIS in cancer cell proliferation. Ectopic expression of HEPIS in MCF-7 cells was found to significantly inhibit cell proliferation. In contrast, knockdown of HEPIS by RNA interference exhibited the opposite effect. Furthermore, a dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed and HEPIS overexpression specifically inhibited the activity of the NF-\u03BAB reporter gene. Results of the gene chip assay revealed that 2,231 genes were differentially expressed in HEPIS-overexpressing cells.

We hypothesize that the availability of rapid, multiplex PCR diagnostics will provide better clinical care and new insights into the etiology and clinical spectrum of RTIs. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the incidence of respiratory pathogens at a 500-bed adult and 154-bed pediatric hospital tertiary care center. A total of 939 specimens from patients with an age range of 5 days to 91 years (median, 2 years) were tested by a multiplex respiratory pathogen PCR from November 14, 2011 to November 13, 2012. Sixty-five percent of specimens were positive for at least one pathogen. As the age of the patient increased, the positivity rate for the PCR decreased proportionately. Rhinoviruses/enteroviruses (Rhino/Entero) were the most prevalent (34.3 %) followed by RSV (19.2 %) and hMPV (6.2 %). Twelve percent of the positive samples were positive for multiple analytes, with Rhino/Entero and RSV being the most common combination. The peak months were September and May for Rhino/Entero infections, January for RSV and February for coronavirus. hMPV peaked 2 months after RSV, as has been observed recently in other studies. Multiplex PCR provides rapid diagnostic information that can be used to make knowledgeable clinical decisions and potentially reduce the use of antibiotics. Active respiratory PCR surveillance could also predict seasonal respiratory epidemics to allow for adequate planning of additional infection control measures.","publish_time":"2013-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Litwin, Christine M.; Bosley, James G.","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1394f683b1141eb706a273a98a0fa33117c6ab07.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086932.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23881085/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-013-1794-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","Rhino/Entero","RSV","Multiplex PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RSV","multiplex respiratory pathogen PCR","Active respiratory PCR surveillance","respiratory syncytial virus","multiplex PCR diagnostics","Respiratory tract infections","hMPV","seasonal respiratory epidemics","incidence of respiratory pathogens","Entero infections","better clinical care","positive samples","clinical spectrum of RTIs","years","percent of specimens","knowledgeable clinical decisions","bed adult","influenza virus","availability of rapid","age range","peak months","bed pediatric hospital tertiary care center","rapid diagnostic information","new insights","etiology","adequate planning of additional infection control measures","multiple analytes","leading cause of mortality","patients","days","retrospective analysis","morbidity","median","positivity rate","Rhinoviruses","enteroviruses","common combination","use of antibiotics","total","human metapneumovirus","Seasonality","coronavirus","studies"],"language":"en"},

It is considered a potential causative agent of Merkel cell carcinoma, a life-threatening skin cancer. OBJECTIVES: To study the prevalence of MCPyV in a large number of clinical samples of various types. Most of the samples were examined also for the other newly found polyomaviruses KI (KIPyV) and WU (WUPyV). STUDY DESIGN: Altogether 1390 samples from immunocompetent or immunocompromised patients, including (i) tonsillar tissues and sera from tonsillectomy patients; (ii) nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) and sera from wheezing children and (iii) nasal swabs, sera and stools from febrile leukemic children were studied for MCPyV. The tonsils, nasal swabs and stools were also studied for KIPyV and WUPyV. RESULTS: MCPyV DNA was detected in 14 samples altogether; 8 of 229 (3.5%) tonsillar tissues, 3 of 140 (2.1%) NPAs, 2 of 106 (1.9%) nasal swabs and 1 of 840 (0.1%) sera. WUPyV and KIPyV were detected in 5 (2.2%) and 0 tonsils, 1 (0.9%) and 4 (3.8%) nasal swabs and 0 and 2 (2.7%) fecal samples, respectively. The patients carrying in tonsils MCPyV were of significantly higher age (median 42 years) than those carrying WUPyV (4 years, p \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: MCPyV DNA occurs in tonsils more frequently in adults than in children. By contrast, WUPyV DNA is found preferentially in children. MCPyV occurs also in nasal swabs and NPAs, in a frequency similar to that of KIPyV and WUPyV. The tonsil may be an initial site of WUPyV infection and a site of MCPyV persistence.","publish_time":"2009-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kantola, Kalle; Sadeghi, Mohammadreza; Lahtinen, Anne; Koskenvuo, Minna; Aaltonen, Leena-Maija; M\u00F6tt\u00F6nen, Merja; Rahiala, Jaana; Saarinen-Pihkala, Ulla; Riikonen, Pekka; Jartti, Tuomas; Ruuskanen, Olli; S\u00F6derlund-Venermo, Maria; Hedman, Klaus","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6aa9063a4dd55546be3aff03a19a788c7849c6f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172143.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19464943/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2009.04.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138665320900167X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S138665320900167X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Merkel","WU"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tonsils MCPyV","MCPyV DNA","nasal swabs","WUPyV DNA","prevalence of MCPyV","sera","KIPyV","site of MCPyV persistence","NPAs","fecal samples","initial site of WUPyV infection","wheezing children","stools","tonsillectomy patients","febrile leukemic children","immunocompromised patients","years","tonsillar tissues","Merkel cell polyomavirus","large number of clinical samples of various types","STUDY DESIGN","potential causative agent of Merkel cell carcinoma","higher age","life-threatening skin cancer","nasopharyngeal aspirates","BACKGROUND","frequency similar","polyomaviruses KI","CONCLUSIONS","adults","contrast","RESULTS","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

Here we present a variety of community approaches to control the spread of Nipah encephalitis, along with advantages and disadvantages of each. This information may be useful to health workers and policymakers in potential NiV outbreak areas in Southeast Asia.","publish_time":"2015-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dhillon, Jasmine; Banerjee, Arinjay","journal":"J Public Health Policy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce88cefa1151a187a961519004d34a363bf76827.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100436.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25925087/; https://doi.org/10.1057/jphp.2015.13","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Bangladesh","Southeast Asia"],"keyphrases":["Bangladesh","Nipah virus","spread of Nipah encephalitis","potential NiV outbreak areas","policymakers","health workers","contaminated date palm sap","consumption of bat","Southeast Asia","preventive strategies","notable case fatality rate","DPS","humans","cultural challenges","information","variety of community approaches","primary transmission","seasonal outbreaks","cent","efforts","disadvantages","strain","disease"],"language":"en"},

Recently, a multitude of studies have reported that viral infections may have complex interconnections with the autophagic process. These observations strongly imply that autophagy has virus-specific roles relating to viral replication, host innate and adaptive immune responses, virus-induced cell death programs, and viral pathogenesis. Autophagy can supply internal membrane structures necessary for viral replication or may prolong cell survival during viral infections and postpone cell death. It can influence the survival of both infected and bystander cells. This process has also been linked to the recognition of viral signature molecules during innate immunity and has been suggested to help rid the cell of infection. This review discusses interactions between different viruses and the autophagy pathway, and surveys the current state of knowledge and emerging themes within this field.","publish_time":"2010-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Liang-Tzung; Dawson, Paul W.H.; Richardson, Christopher D.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b2d48d860b8473121923c755d3f0f3a8be9d5b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111941.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2010.03.026; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004268221000190X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004268221000190X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20413139/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral replication","viral infections","viral pathogenesis","autophagy pathway","cell survival","Abstract Autophagy","cell of infection","recognition of viral signature molecules","virus-induced cell death programs","innate immunity","autophagic process","virus-specific roles","lysosomal degradative pathway","damaged organelles","adaptive immune responses","removal of long-lived cytoplasmic macromolecules","host","internal membrane structures necessary","current state of knowledge","conserved eukaryotic mechanism","emerging themes","different viruses","complex interconnections","interactions","field","review","bystander cells","multitude of studies","observations"],"language":"en"},

Although the Chinese Government has already carried out a series of emergency education and training programmes to improve public health staff\u0027s capability of emergency preparedness, it remains unclear if these training programmes are effective and feasible. The purpose of this research was to evaluate an emergency preparedness training programme and to develop a participatory training approach for emergency response. Methods Seventy-six public health staff completed the emergency preparedness training programme. The effectiveness of the training was evaluated by questionnaire before training, immediately after training and 12 months after training (follow-up). Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted throughout the training period. Results The emergency preparedness training improved the knowledge levels and increased attitudinal and behavioural intention scores for emergency preparedness (P\u003C0.01). The results at follow-up showed that the knowledge levels and attitudinal/behavioural intention scores of participants decreased slightly (P\u003E0.05) compared with levels immediately after training (P\u003C0.01). However, there was a significant increase compared with before training (P\u003C0.01). Moreover, more than 80% of participants reported that the training process and resources were scientific and feasible. Conclusions The emergency preparedness training programme met its aims and objectives satisfactorily, and resulted in positive shifts in knowledge and attitudinal/behavioural intentions for public health staff. This suggests that this emergency training strategy was effective and feasible in improving the capability of emergency preparedness.","publish_time":"2008-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Chongjian; Wei, Sheng; Xiang, Hao; Xu, Yihua; Han, Shenghong; Mkangara, Ommari Baaliy; Nie, Shaofa","journal":"Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6102dd48ba28756830876fe88d80c8a81bcc802e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111704.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2007.08.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350607002776; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18199462/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350607002776","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["emergency preparedness training programme","training programmes","emergency training strategy","training process","training period","participatory training approach","emergency response","public health staff\u0027s capability of emergency preparedness","series of emergency education","public health emergencies","knowledge levels","behavioural intention scores of participants","behavioural intentions","follow-up","results","severe acute respiratory syndrome","crisis","terms","Summary Background","SARS","China","aims","new urgency","positive shifts","resources","objectives","Conclusions","semi-structured interviews","research","Methods","months","questionnaire","significant increase","Chinese Government","purpose","effectiveness"],"language":"en"},

Co-morbid gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) makes asthma management more difficult due to increased symptoms. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drugs are effective at improving to GERD symptoms, however they have demonstrated only modest and variable effects on asthma control in the setting of co-morbid GERD. Importantly, PPI metabolism and efficacy depend on CYP2C19 genotype. The Genotype Tailored Treatment of Symptomatic Acid Reflux in Children with Uncontrolled Asthma (GenARA) study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine if genotype-tailored PPI dosing improves asthma symptoms among children with inadequately controlled asthma and GERD symptoms. This study has an innovative design to both assess the efficacy of genotype-tailored PPI dosing and perform pharmacokinetic modeling of the oral PPI Lansoprazole. Children ages 6\u201317 years old with clinician-diagnosed asthma and mild GERD symptoms will submit a saliva sample for CYP2C19 genotyping. Participants will undergo a two-step randomization to: (1) genotype-tailored versus conventional dosing of open-label oral lansoprazole for pharmacokinetic modeling, and (2) genotype-tailored lansoprazole daily versus placebo for 24 weeks to determine the effect of genotype-tailored PPI dosing on asthma control.

It is unclear whether this dose and time can be reduced further. We compared the efficacy and safety of 20, 000 U/kg for 2 hours (UK-2 h) with the UK-12 h regime in selected PE patients. METHODS: A randomized trial involving 129 patients was conducted. Patients with acute PE were randomly assigned to receive either UK-12 h (n = 70), or UK-2 h (n = 59). The efficacy was determined by the improvement of right heart dysfunction and perfusion defect at 24 h and 14 d post UK treatment. The bleeding incidence, death rate and PE recurrence were also evaluated. RESULTS: Similarly significant improvements in right heart dysfunction and lung perfusion defects were observed in both groups. Overall bleeding incidents were low in both groups. Major bleeding directly associated with UK infusion occurred in one patient in the UK-2 h group and one in the UK-12 h group. Mortality rates were low, with one reported fatal recurrent in the UK-12 h group and none in the UK-2 h group. When the rate of bleeding, death and PE recurrence were compared separately in the hemodynamic instability and the massive anatomic obstruction subgroups, no significant difference was found. CONCLUSIONS: The UK-2 h regimen exhibits similar efficacy and safety as the UK-12 h regimen for acute PE.

A history of prematurity (odds ratio (OR) 2.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24\u20135.04), of fever (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.32\u20133.83), living in a house with smokers (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.18\u20132.72), impaired consciousness (OR 10.96, 95% CI 2.88\u201341.73), cyanosis (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.05\u20134.15), pallor (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.34\u20133.84), having rhonchi on auscultation (OR 2.45, 95% CI 1.58\u20133.79), and human metapneumovirus infection (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.13\u20134.02) were all independent risk factors for an adverse outcome, whereas a history of asthma (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.25\u20130.84) was the only independent risk factor for a positive outcome. Conclusions The early identification of factors associated with a poor prognosis could improve management strategies and the likelihood of survival of Moroccan children with severe pneumonia.","publish_time":"2014-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jroundi, Imane; Mahraoui, Chafiq; Benmessaoud, Rachid; Moraleda, Cinta; Tligui, Houssain; Seffar, Myriam; Kettani, Salma Ech-Cherif El; Benjelloun, Badr Sououd; Chaacho, Saad; Mu\u00F1oz-Almagro, Carmen; Ruiz, Joaquim; Alonso, Pedro L.; Bassat, Quique","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7574e8c8c1e0e6df24e6ef15177e2eff23262511.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129557.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25305555/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971214016129; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2014.07.027; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971214016129","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs3ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CSP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["poor prognosis","Moroccan children","Methods Children","prognostic factors","independent risk factors","severe pneumonia","independent predictive factors","good prognosis","adverse outcome","early identification of factors","positive outcome","intensive care","history of prematurity","history of asthma","CSP definition","Rabat","Morocco","World Health Organization","likelihood of survival","Respiratory Index of Severity","H\u00F4pital d\u2019Enfants","management strategies","death","Summary Objectives Data","RISC","middle-income countries","odds ratio","hospital","Multivariate logistic regression","need","Conclusions","months","score","human metapneumovirus infection","confidence interval","impaired consciousness","month prospective study","smokers","auscultation","cyanosis","pallor","house","rhonchi","Results","analysis","fever"],"language":"en"},

Due to the absence of highly effective antiviral therapies and vaccine, as well as the constant threat of an emerging pandemic strain, there is considerable need to better understand the host\u2013pathogen interactions and the factors that dictate a protective versus detrimental immune response to IAV. Even though evidence of IAV-induced cell death in human pulmonary epithelial and immune cells has been observed for almost a century, very little is known about the consequences of cell death on viral pathogenesis. Recent study indicates that both the type of cell death program and its kinetics have major implications on host defense and survival. In this review, we discuss advances in our understanding of cell death programs during influenza virus infection, in hopes of fostering new areas of investigation for targeted clinical intervention.","publish_time":"2018-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Downey, Jeffrey; Pernet, Erwan; Coulombe, Fran\u00E7ois; Divangahi, Maziar","journal":"Microbes and Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d6839a8ec865e914bfc4e4fec44f8bc9f493ebb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110448.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1286457918300935; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29679740/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457918300935; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2018.03.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs5MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["induced cell death","consequences of cell death","type of cell death program","understanding of cell death programs","pulmonary pathogen","evidence of IAV","influenza virus infection","host defense","immune cells","Abstract Influenza","pathogen interactions","detrimental immune response","kinetics","major implications","new areas of investigation","hopes","emerging pandemic strain","significant yearly morbidity","factors","targeted clinical intervention","constant threat","considerable need","effective antiviral therapies","vaccine","mortality","survival","advances","viral pathogenesis","absence","Recent study","review","century"],"language":"en"},

We used RNA interference to decrease endogenous PKR levels. RSV replication was not altered in cells deficient for PKR expression. However, RSV-mediated stress granule formation was significantly reduced in PKR-knockdown cells. As an alternative method to block PKR activation, we used treatment with the kinase inhibitor 2-aminopurine (2-AP). We observed that 2-AP treatment significantly reduced viral replication. We also treated PKR-knockdown cells with 2-AP and inoculated with RSV. Under these conditions, 2-AP treatment diminished viral replication in the absence of PKR expression. These results suggest that PKR activation has a minimal effect on RSV replication and that the antiviral effect of 2-AP during RSV infection likely occurs via a PKR-independent mechanism.","publish_time":"2011-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lindquist, Michael E.; Mainou, Bernardo A.; Dermody, Terence S.; Crowe, James E.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c1c3b1f8dedc265986178cbd90213cd0f6b73cb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3072468.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682211000705; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2011.02.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682211000705; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21377708/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs5MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RSV replication","effect of PKR activation","PKR-knockdown cells","RSV infection","absence of PKR expression","endogenous PKR levels","PKR-independent mechanism","AP treatment","viral replication","RSV-mediated stress granule formation","minimal effect","antiviral effect","cells deficient","formation of host stress granules","respiratory syncytial virus","RNA interference","kinase inhibitor","aminopurine","phosphorylation of eIF2\u03B1","alternative method","conditions","results","experiments"],"language":"en"},

Several human HLA-A*0201 restricted CTL epitopes of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spike (S) protein have been identified in HLA-A*0201 transgenic (Tg) mice, but the mechanisms and properties of immune responses are still not well understood. In this study, HLA-A*0201 Tg mice were primed intramuscularly with SARS S DNA and boosted subcutaneously with HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides. The lymphocytes from draining lymph nodes, spleens and lungs were stimulated with the cognate peptides. Three different methods (ELISA, ELISPOT and FACS) were used to evaluate the immune responses during short and long periods of time after immunization. Results showed that peptide-specific CD8\u002B T cells secreted IFN-\u03B3, TNF-\u03B1 and IL-2 and expressed CD107a/b on cell surface. IFN-\u03B3\u002BCD8\u002B T cells and CD107a/b\u002BCD8\u002B T cells distributed throughout the lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, but the frequency of peptide-specific CD8\u002B T cells was higher in lungs than in spleens and lymph nodes. The phenotype of the CD8\u002B T cells was characterized based on the expression of IFN-\u03B3. Most of the HLA-A*0201 restricted peptide-specific CD8\u002B T cells represented a memory subset with CD45RBhigh and CD62Llow. Taken together, these data demonstrate that immunization with SARS S DNA and HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides can elicit antigen-specific CD8\u002B T cell immune responses which may have a significant implication in the long-term protection.

In this review, we summarize the most recent insights into our understanding of the evolutionary events and ecological contexts that determined the origin and spread of human hepatitis viruses.","publish_time":"2019-10-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cagliani, Rachele; Forni, Diego; Sironi, Manuela","journal":"Comput Struct Biotechnol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e34b22c8c7970674cc5d601d3bb2ba098e61ea04.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6872792.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6872792/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzIw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Human viral hepatitis","evolutionary history of human hepatitis viruses","human pathogens","sequences of human viral strains","large viral phylogenies","diverse viruses","exclusion of hepatitis D virus","throughput sequencing of viral genomes","different geographic locations","different time-spans","evolutionary events","ecological contexts","molecular dating approaches","distant relatives","application of phylogeographic","host range","major cause of morbidity","understanding","origin","number of domestic","knowledge","development of computational tools","genome data","Technological advances","pathogenetic features","wild mammals","mortality","recent insights","review"],"language":"en"},

Currently, most of the applications are focused on target-specific amplification. Because RPA has the advantage of amplifying DNA under isothermal conditions, we utilized RPA as a DNA library amplification tool. In this study, we used a sheared genomic DNA library and an oligonucleotide (oligo) library for the comparison of polymerase chain reaction and RPA. For the sheared DNA library, we observed biased amplification after RPA was conducted. Thus, to amplify the size-variable DNA library uniformly, we introduced a linear amplification strategy with RPA and successfully improved the uniformity. On the other hand, using the same-sized oligo library, we confirmed that RPA amplified this library uniformly without modification of the protocol. These results demonstrate that RPA can be applied not only to amplify a specific target as previously demonstrated but also to amplify a complex DNA library composed of a large number of different DNA molecules.","publish_time":"2019-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Jeewon; Heo, Sunghoon; Bang, Duhee","journal":"ACS Omega","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9fbbae703d150466db0f5312aa28bb4f449a1f9d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6882106.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6882106/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzMw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RPA","sheared DNA library","DNA library amplification tool","complex DNA library","sheared genomic DNA library","size-variable DNA library","isothermal DNA amplification method","sized oligo library","biased amplification","advantage of amplifying DNA","target-specific amplification","Recombinase polymerase amplification","linear amplification strategy","large number of different DNA molecules","specific target","isothermal conditions","broad applications","comparison of polymerase chain reaction","oligonucleotide","care test","point","text","molecular biology techniques","Image","modification","study","protocol","hand","uniformity","results"],"language":"en"},

We determined the nasal cytokine profiles of these children and investigated their relationship with RV-C load and clinical outcome. Flocked nasal swabs were collected from children aged 24\u201372 months presenting to the Emergency Department at Princess Margaret Hospital with a clinical diagnosis of acute wheeze and an acute upper respiratory tract viral infection.

No therapeutic agents have, so far, been approved for the treatment of ZIKV infection in humans; as such, there is a need for a continuous effort to develop effective and safe antiviral drugs to treat ZIKV-caused diseases. After screening a natural product library, we have herein identified four natural products with anti-ZIKV activity in Vero E6 cells, including gossypol, curcumin, digitonin, and conessine. Except for curcumin, the other three natural products have not been reported before to have anti-ZIKV activity. Among them, gossypol exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity against almost all 10 ZIKV strains tested, including six recent epidemic human strains. The mechanistic study indicated that gossypol could neutralize ZIKV infection by targeting the envelope protein domain III (EDIII) of ZIKV. In contrast, the other natural products inhibited ZIKV infection by targeting the host cell or cell-associated entry and replication stages of ZIKV. A combination of gossypol with any of the three natural products identified in this study, as well as with bortezomib, a previously reported anti-ZIKV compound, exhibited significant combinatorial inhibitory effects against three ZIKV human strains tested. Importantly, gossypol also demonstrated marked potency against all four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) human strains in vitro. Taken together, this study indicates the potential for further development of these natural products, particularly gossypol, as the lead compound or broad-spectrum inhibitors against ZIKV and other flaviviruses, such as DENV.","publish_time":"2019-11-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gao, Yaning; Tai, Wanbo; Wang, Ning; Li, Xiang; Jiang, Shibo; Debnath, Asim K.; Du, Lanying; Chen, Shizhong","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d8b8767e12fc4fee2b29c6473b7dd1f3244b933.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6893700.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6893700/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQ20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV"],"locations":["Vero"],"keyphrases":["ZIKV strains","ZIKV human strains","anti-ZIKV activity","anti-ZIKV compound","treatment of ZIKV infection","natural products","replication stages of ZIKV","combination of gossypol","natural product library","recent epidemic human strains","strongest inhibitory activity","Zika virus","curcumin","DENV","mechanistic study","host cell","lead compound","cell-associated entry","serotypes of dengue virus","significant combinatorial inhibitory effects","severe congenital Zika syndrome","pregnancy","Vero E6 cells","safe antiviral drugs","microcephaly","broad-spectrum inhibitors","envelope protein domain","continuous effort","EDIII","flaviviruses","development","marked potency","digitonin","potential","humans","bortezomib","neurological malformations","need","conessine","diseases","contrast","therapeutic agents"],"language":"en"},

No therapeutics or vaccines are currently licensed; however, a vaccine has shown promise in clinical trials. A critical step towards development of effective therapeutics is a better understanding of factors that govern host susceptibility to this pathogen. As macrophages are an important cell population targeted during virus replication, we explore the effect of cytokine polarization on macrophage infection. METHODS/MAIN FINDINGS: We utilized a BSL2 EBOV model virus, infectious, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus encoding EBOV glycoprotein (GP) (rVSV/EBOV GP) in place of its native glycoprotein. Macrophages polarized towards a M2-like anti-inflammatory state by combined IL-4 and IL-13 treatment were more susceptible to rVSV/EBOV GP, but not to wild-type VSV (rVSV/G), suggesting that EBOV GP-dependent entry events were enhanced by these cytokines. Examination of RNA expression of known surface receptors that bind and internalize filoviruses demonstrated that IL-4/IL-13 stimulated expression of the C-type lectin receptor DC-SIGN in human macrophages and addition of the competitive inhibitor mannan abrogated IL-4/IL-13 enhanced infection. Two murine DC-SIGN-like family members, SIGNR3 and SIGNR5, were upregulated by IL-4/IL-13 in murine macrophages, but only SIGNR3 enhanced virus infection in a mannan-inhibited manner, suggesting that murine SIGNR3 plays a similar role to human DC-SIGN. In vivo IL-4/IL-13 administration significantly increased virus-mediated mortality in a mouse model and transfer of ex vivo IL-4/IL-13-treated murine peritoneal macrophages into the peritoneal cavity of mice enhanced pathogenesis. SIGNIFICANCE: These studies highlight the ability of macrophage polarization to influence EBOV GP-dependent virus replication in vivo and ex vivo, with M2a polarization upregulating cell surface receptor expression and thereby enhancing virus replication. Our findings provide an increased understanding of the host factors in macrophages governing susceptibility to filoviruses and identify novel murine receptors mediating EBOV entry.","publish_time":"2019-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rogers, Kai J.; Brunton, Bethany; Mallinger, Laura; Bohan, Dana; Sevcik, Kristina M.; Chen, Jing; Ruggio, Natalie; Maury, Wendy","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/29e94dee0df31f591c6f09c590e4c3523a14e647.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6905523.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6905523/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzYx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ebolavirus"],"organizations":["EBOV","IL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["combined IL","murine macrophages","EBOV GP-dependent virus replication","EBOV glycoprotein","EBOV entry","BSL2 EBOV model virus","murine peritoneal macrophages","SIGNR3 enhanced virus infection","murine SIGNR3","human macrophages","murine DC-SIGN","EBOV GP-dependent entry events","enhanced infection","competitive inhibitor mannan abrogated IL","increased virus-mediated mortality","rVSV","human DC-SIGN","novel murine receptors","recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus","macrophage infection","M2a polarization upregulating cell surface receptor expression","C-type lectin receptor DC-SIGN","stimulated expression","host factors","ability of macrophage polarization","host susceptibility","increased understanding","filoviruses","better understanding of factors","Examination of RNA expression of known surface receptors","effect of cytokine polarization","mouse model","transfer of ex","native glycoprotein","MAIN FINDINGS","mannan-inhibited manner","peritoneal cavity of mice","development of effective therapeutics","important cell population","wild-type VSV","addition","similar role","family members","outbreaks","place","administration","critical step","studies","anti-inflammatory state","SIGNR5","tremendous morbidity","promise","clinical trials","pathogenesis","BACKGROUND","Ebolavirus","treatment","SIGNIFICANCE","METHODS","vaccines","cytokines"],"language":"en"},

Semiquantitative scoring has broad uses in preclinical and clinical studies for evaluation of tissue lesions. Reproducibility can be improved by constraining bias through appropriate experimental design, randomization of tissues, effective use of multidisciplinary collaborations, and valid masking procedures. Scoring can be applied to tissue lesions (eg, size, distribution, characteristics) and also to tissues through evaluation of staining distribution and intensity. Semiquantitative scores should be validated to demonstrate relevance to biological data and to demonstrate observer reproducibility.

Under the imposed vaccination policy and antiviral treatment in society, complex factors (costs and expected effects of the vaccines and treatments, and fear of being infected) trigger an emulous situation in which individuals avoid infection by the pre-emptive or ex post provision. Aside from the established voluntary vaccination game, we propose a treatment game model associated with the resistance evolution of antiviral/antibiotic overuse. Moreover, the imperfectness of vaccinations has inevitably led to anti-vaccine behaviour, necessitating a proactive treatment policy. However, under the excessively heavy implementation of treatments such as antiviral medicine, resistant strains emerge. The model explicitly exhibits a dual social dilemma situation, in which the treatment behaviour changes on a local time scale, and the vaccination uptake later evolves on a global time scale. The impact of resistance evolution and the coexistence of dual dilemmas are investigated by the control reproduction number and the social efficiency deficit, respectively. Our investigation might elucidate the substantial impacts of both vaccination and treatment in the framework of epidemic dynamics, and hence suggest the appropriate use of antiviral treatment.","publish_time":"2019-12-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kabir, K.

METHODS: Between 18 July 2017 and 31 October 2017, we surveyed the infection prevention teams of all acute care hospitals in the Netherlands. The survey instrument was based on the \u2018Translating Healthcare-Associated Infection Prevention Research into Practice\u2019 (TRIP) questionnaire and adapted to the Dutch context. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the reported regular use of CAUTI, CLABSI, VAP, and CDI prevention practices as well as the hospital characteristics. RESULTS: Out of 72 eligible hospitals, 47 (65.3%) responded. Surveillance systems for monitoring CAUTI, CLABSI, VAP, and CDI were present in 17.8, 95.4, 26.2, and 77.3% of hospitals, respectively. Antimicrobial stewardship programs have been established in 91.5% of participating hospitals. For CAUTI, the majority of hospitals regularly used aseptic technique during catheter insertion (95%) and portable bladder ultrasound scanners (86.1%). Intermittent catheterization and catheter stop-orders were regularly used by 65.8 and 62.2% of hospitals. For CLABSI, all hospitals regularly used maximum sterile barrier precautions and chlorhexidine gluconate for insertion site antisepsis. Avoidance of the femoral site for central line insertions was regularly used by 65.9% of hospitals. Urinary catheters and central-lines impregnated with antibiotics or antiseptics were rarely used (\u2264 5%). Selective decontamination strategies for preventing VAP were used in 84% of hospitals. With the exception of disposable thermometers (31.8%), all prevention practices to prevent CDI were regularly used by more than 80% of hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Most Dutch hospitals report regular use of recommended practices for preventing CLABSI and CDI. Several specific practices to prevent CAUTI and VAP were less frequently used, however, providing an opportunity for improvement.","publish_time":"2020-01-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huis, Anita; Schouten, Jeroen; Lescure, Dominique; Krein, Sarah; Ratz, David; Saint, Sanjay; Hulscher, Marlies; Greene, M.

Herein, a meta-analysis was contrived to assess the prevalence of Toxocara/Toxascaris in carnivore and human hosts in different regions of Iran from April 1969 to June 2019. METHODS: The available online articles of English (PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, and Ovid) and Persian (SID, Iran Medex, Magiran, and Iran Doc) databases and also the articles that presented in held parasitology congresses of Iran were involved. RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of Toxocara/Toxascaris in dogs (Canis familiaris) and cats (Felis catus) was 24.2% (95% CI: 18.0\u201331.0%) and 32.6% (95% CI: 22.6\u201343.4%), respectively.

World Health Organization guidelines for the clinical management of acute watery diarrhoea in children focus on oral rehydration, supplemental zinc and feeding advice. Routine use of antibiotics is not recommended except when diarrhoea is bloody or cholera is suspected. Young children who are undernourished or have a dehydrating diarrhoea are more susceptible to death at 90 days after onset of diarrhoea. Given the mortality risk associated with diarrhoea in children with malnutrition or dehydrating diarrhoea, expanding the use of antibiotics for this subset of children could be an important intervention to reduce diarrhoea-associated mortality and morbidity. We designed the Antibiotics for Childhood Diarrhoea (ABCD) trial to test this intervention. METHODS: ABCD is a double-blind, randomised trial recruiting 11,500 children aged 2\u201323 months presenting with acute non-bloody diarrhoea who are dehydrated and/or undernourished (i.e. have a high risk for mortality). Enrolled children in Bangladesh, India, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Pakistan and Tanzania are randomised (1:1) to oral azithromycin 10 mg/kg or placebo once daily for 3 days and followed-up for 180 days. Primary efficacy endpoints are all-cause mortality during the 180 days post-enrolment and change in linear growth 90 days post-enrolment. DISCUSSION: Expanding the treatment of acute watery diarrhoea in high-risk children to include an antibiotic may offer an opportunity to reduce deaths. These benefits may result from direct antimicrobial effects on pathogens or other incompletely understood mechanisms including improved nutrition, alterations in immune responsiveness or improved enteric function. The expansion of indications for antibiotic use raises concerns about the emergence of antimicrobial resistance both within treated children and the communities in which they live. ABCD will monitor antimicrobial resistance. The ABCD trial has important policy implications. If the trial shows significant benefits of azithromycin use, this may provide evidence to support reconsideration of antibiotic indications in the present World Health Organization diarrhoea management guidelines. Conversely, if there is no evidence of benefit, these results will support the current avoidance of antibiotics except in dysentery or cholera, thereby avoiding inappropriate use of antibiotics and reaffirming the current guidelines.

Recently we have identified that the peptide PH((1\u2013110)) from polyhedrin self-aggregates and incorporates foreign proteins to form particles. We have proposed that this peptide can be used as an antigen carrying system for vaccines. However, the immune response generated by the antigen fused to the peptide has not been fully characterized. In addition, the adjuvant effect and thermostability of the particles has not been evaluated. RESULTS: In the present study we demonstrate the use of a system developed to generate nano and microparticles carrying as a fusion protein peptides or proteins of interest to be used as vaccines. These particles are purified easily by centrifugation. Immunization of animals with the particles in the absence of adjuvant result in a robust and long-lasting immune response. Proteins contained inside the particles are maintained for over 1 year at ambient temperature, preserving their immunological properties. CONCLUSION: The rapid and efficient production of the particles in addition to the robust immune response they generate position this system as an excellent method for the rapid response against emerging diseases. The thermostability conferred by the particle system facilitates the distribution of the vaccines in developing countries or areas with no electricity.","publish_time":"2020-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cruz-Res\u00E9ndiz, Adolfo; Zepeda-Cervantes, Jes\u00FAs; Sampieri, Alicia; Basti\u00E1n-Eugenio, Carlos; Acero, Gonzalo; S\u00E1nchez-Betancourt, J.

Results: ARTSSN provides richly integrated information on a variety of health conditions for early detection of and prompt action on abnormal events such as clusters, outbreaks and trends. Examples of such health conditions include chronic and communicable disease, injury and environmentmediated adverse incidents. Discussion: Key advantages of ARTSSN over traditional paper-based methods are its timeliness, comprehensiveness and automation.

A reliable estimation of the energy expenditure (EE) of ICU patients may help to avoid these phenomena. Several factors that influence EE have been studied previously. However, the effect of neuromuscular blocking agents on EE, which conceptually would lower EE, has not been extensively investigated. METHODS: We studied a cohort of adult critically ill patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and treatment with continuous infusion of cisatracurium for at least 12 h. The study aimed to quantify the effect of cisatracurium infusion on EE (primary endpoint). EE was estimated based on ventilator-derived VCO(2) (EE in kcal/day = VCO(2) \u00D7 8.19). A subgroup analysis of septic and non-septic patients was performed. Furthermore, the effects of body temperature and sepsis on EE were evaluated. A secondary endpoint was hypercaloric feeding (\u003E 110% of EE) after cisatracurium infusion. RESULTS: In total, 122 patients were included. Mean EE before cisatracurium infusion was 1974 kcal/day and 1888 kcal/day after cisatracurium infusion. Multivariable analysis showed a significantly lower EE after cisatracurium infusion (MD \u2212 132.0 kcal (95% CI \u2212 212.0 to \u2212 52.0; p = 0.001) in all patients. This difference was statistically significant in both sepsis and non-sepsis patients (p = 0.036 and p = 0.011). Non-sepsis patients had lower EE than sepsis patients (MD \u2212 120.6 kcal; 95% CI \u2212 200.5 to \u2212 40.8, p = 0.003). Body temperature and EE were positively correlated (Spearman\u2019s rho = 0.486, p \u003C 0.001). Hypercaloric feeding was observed in 7 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that continuous infusion of cisatracurium in mechanically ventilated ICU patients is associated with a significant reduction in EE, although the magnitude of the effect is small. Sepsis and higher body temperature are associated with increased EE. Cisatracurium infusion is associated with overfeeding in only a minority of patients and therefore, in most patients, no reductions in caloric prescription are necessary.","publish_time":"2020-02-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koekkoek, W.

Phylogenetic and network inferences, drug resistant mutations (DRMs), subtypes and HIV-1 diversity estimations were completed. Haplotypes were reconstructed to infer transmission clusters. Phylodynamic inferences based on the HIV-1 polymerase (pol) and envelope genes (env) were compared. Higher HIV-1 diversity (n.s.) was seen in men who have sex with men, heterosexual, and male participants in DC. 54.0% of the participants contained at least one DRM. The 40\u201349 year-olds showed the highest prevalence of DRMs (22.9%). Phylogenetic analysis of pol and env sequences grouped 31.9\u201333.8% of the participants into clusters. HIV-TRACE grouped 2.9\u201312.8% of participants when using consensus sequences and 9.0\u201364.2% when using haplotypes. NGS allowed us to characterize the local phylodynamics of HIV-1 in DC more broadly and accurately, given a better representation of its diversity and dynamics. Reconstructed haplotypes provided novel and deeper phylodynamic insights, which led to networks linking a higher number of participants. Our understanding of the HIV-1 epidemic was expanded with the powerful coupling of HIV-1 NGS data with epidemiological data.","publish_time":"2020-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gibson, Keylie M.; Jair, Kamwing; Castel, Amanda D.; Bendall, Matthew L.; Wilbourn, Brittany; Jordan, Jeanne A.; Crandall, Keith A.; P\u00E9rez-Losada, Marcos","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65f58703255fe6afd5695312803e12281f4da353.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7004982.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7004982/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzMxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DRM","NGS"],"locations":["Washington"],"keyphrases":["Higher HIV","generalized HIV","HIV-TRACE","local phylodynamics of HIV","DC","powerful coupling of HIV","NGS data","male participants","epidemiological data","higher number of participants","Reconstructed haplotypes","Phylodynamic inferences","men","env sequences","epidemic","diversity estimations","Phylogenetic analysis of pol","network inferences","consensus sequences","transmission clusters","deeper phylodynamic insights","highest prevalence of DRMs","drug resistant mutations","subtypes","networks","heterosexual","envelope genes","polymerase","generation sequencing","year-olds","better representation","Viral samples","understanding","Washington"],"language":"en"},

Regulatory element activity is in turn modulated by genetic variation, resulting in variable transcription rates across individuals. The interplay of these factors, however, is poorly understood. Here we characterize expression and chromatin state dynamics across three tissues\u2014liver, lung, and kidney\u2014in 47 strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse population, examining the regulation of these dynamics by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and chromatin QTL (cQTL). QTL whose allelic effects were consistent across tissues were detected for 1,101 genes and 133 chromatin regions. Also detected were eQTL and cQTL whose allelic effects differed across tissues, including local-eQTL for Pik3c2g detected in all three tissues but with distinct allelic effects. Leveraging overlapping measurements of gene expression and chromatin accessibility on the same mice from multiple tissues, we used mediation analysis to identify chromatin and gene expression intermediates of eQTL effects. Based on QTL and mediation analyses over multiple tissues, we propose a causal model for the distal genetic regulation of Akr1e1, a gene involved in glycogen metabolism, through the zinc finger transcription factor Zfp985 and chromatin intermediates. This analysis demonstrates the complexity of transcriptional and chromatin dynamics and their regulation over multiple tissues, as well as the value of the CC and related genetic resource populations for identifying specific regulatory mechanisms within cells and tissues.","publish_time":"2020-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Keele, Gregory R.; Quach, Bryan C.; Israel, Jennifer W.; Chappell, Grace A.; Lewis, Lauren; Safi, Alexias; Simon, Jeremy M.; Cotney, Paul; Crawford, Gregory E.; Valdar, William; Rusyn, Ivan; Furey, Terrence S.","journal":"PLoS Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7d1c17055c7320e8d2a0cca313bddc7dcb3d401.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ae8b139ede9460926a290fbae525b59fbe0e5c53.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1029b20dd40ca982d05b80adad4c125beb10217b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7010298.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7010298/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzMzMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Collaborative Cross","CC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["multiple tissues","chromatin dynamics","chromatin QTL","chromatin intermediates","chromatin regions","chromatin accessibility","chromatin state dynamics","regions of accessible chromatin","gene expression intermediates of eQTL effects","Gene transcription profiles","distinct allelic effects","overlapping measurements of gene expression","local-eQTL","genetic variation","distal genetic regulation of Akr1e1","mediation analysis","Regulatory element activity","activity of regulatory elements","cQTL","expression quantitative trait loci","specific regulatory mechanisms","variable transcription rates","related genetic resource populations","mediation analyses","zinc finger transcription factor Zfp985","causal model","Collaborative Cross","mouse population","glycogen metabolism","turn","liver","complexity of transcriptional","strains","cells","value","mice","kidney","individuals","lung","Pik3c2g","genes","interplay","factors"],"language":"en"},

Many virulence genes of pathogenic bacteria were identified in temperate phage genomes, supporting the concept that temperate phages play important roles in increasing the bacterial pathogenicity through delivery of the virulence genes. However, little is known about the roles of temperate phages in attenuation of bacterial virulence. Here, we report a novel Bordetella bronchiseptica temperate phage, vB_BbrS_PHB09 (PHB09), which has a 42,129-bp dsDNA genome with a G\u002BC content of 62.8%. Phylogenetic analysis based on large terminase subunit indicated that phage PHB09 represented a new member of the family Siphoviridae. The genome of PHB09 contains genes encoding lysogen-associated proteins, including integrase and cI protein. The integration site of PHB09 is specifically located within a pilin gene of B. bronchiseptica. Importantly, we found that the integration of phage PHB09 significantly decreased the virulence of parental strain B. bronchiseptica Bb01 in mice, most likely through disruption the expression of pilin gene. Moreover, a single shot of the prophage bearing B. bronchiseptica strain completely protected mice against lethal challenge with wild-type virulent B. bronchiseptica, indicating the vaccine potential of lysogenized strain. Our findings not only indicate the complicated roles of temperate phages in bacterial virulence other than simple delivery of virulent genes but also provide a potential strategy for developing bacterial vaccines.","publish_time":"2020-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Yibao; Yang, Lan; Yang, Dan; Song, Jiaoyang; Wang, Can; Sun, Erchao; Gu, Changqin; Chen, Huanchun; Tong, Yigang; Tao, Pan; Wu, Bin","journal":"Front Cell Infect Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b287ba995f0d86627890bf70c5d6aad88deff2c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7010805.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7010805/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzMzNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bronchiseptica strain","temperate phage genomes","integration of phage PHB09","genome of PHB09","complicated roles of temperate phages","novel Bordetella bronchiseptica temperate phage","attenuation of bacterial virulence","virulence genes of pathogenic bacteria","bronchiseptica Bb01","virulence of parental strain","integration site of PHB09","bacterial pathogenicity","bacterial vaccines","pilin gene of","simple delivery of virulent genes","important roles","phenotype of host bacteria","gene transmission","expression of pilin gene","vaccine potential of lysogenized strain","protected mice","potential strategy","host chromosome","wild-type virulent","bp dsDNA genome","vB","lethal challenge","concept","lysogen-associated proteins","large terminase subunit","natural vectors","BbrS","integrase","disruption","prophage","new member","Phylogenetic analysis","fitness","cI protein","C content","family Siphoviridae","ability","single shot","findings"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to evaluate the effect of performing rib fixation with the addition of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) on patients with ARF caused by blunt thoracic injury with ventilator dependence. METHODS: This observational study prospectively enrolled patients with multiple bicortical rib fractures with hemothorax caused by severe blunt chest trauma. All patients received positive pressure mechanical ventilation within 24 h after trauma because of ARF. Some patients who received rib fixation with VATS were enrolled as group 1, and the others who received only VATS were designated as group 2. The length of ventilator use was the primary clinical outcome. Rates of pneumonia and length of hospital stay constituted secondary outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 61 patients were included in this study. The basic demographic characteristics between the two groups exhibited no statistical differences. All patients received operations within 6 days after trauma. The length of ventilator use was shorter in group 1 (3.19 \u00B1 3.37 days vs. 8.05 \u00B1 8.23, P = 0.002).

METHODS: Residents in rural communities of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces were recruited and enrolled in this study. Data were collected through ethnographic interviews and field observations, and thematically coded and analysed to identify both risk and protective factors for zoonotic disease emergence at the individual, community and policy levels. RESULTS: Eighty-eight ethnographic interviews and 55 field observations were conducted at nine selected sites. Frequent human\u2013animal interactions and low levels of environmental biosecurity in local communities were identified as risks for zoonotic disease emergence. Policies and programmes existing in the communities provide opportunities for zoonotic risk mitigation.

Between July 2005 and September 2015, 179 patients underwent surgical treatment for active LSNIE at a single institution. Patients were classified into two groups: \u226565 years (elderly group) and \u003C65 years (non-elderly group).

The study describes the epidemiological and virological features of the outbreak and discusses the origin of the infection. METHODS: Poultry exposure and timelines of key events for each patient were collected. Samples derived from the patients, their close contacts, and environments were tested for influenza A(H7N9) virus by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Genetic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were also conducted. RESULTS: Five patients were reported in the outbreak. An epidemiological investigation showed that all patients had been exposed at live poultry markets. The A(H7N9) isolates from these patients had low pathogenicity in avian species. Both epidemiological investigations of chicken sources and phylogenetic analysis of viral gene sequences indicated that the source of infection was from Guangxi Province, which lies 100 km to the east of Wenshan City. CONCLUSIONS: In the study, a sudden emergence of human cases of H7N9 was documented in urban area of Wenshan City. Chickens were an important carrier in the H7N9 virus spreading from Guangxi to Wenshan. Hygienic management of live poultry markets and virological screening of chickens transported across regions should be reinforced to limit the spread of H7N9 virus.","publish_time":"2020-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiang, Li; Zhao, Xiaonan; Xu, Wen; Zhou, Xuehua; Luo, Chunrui; Zhou, Jiunan; Fu, Xiaoqing; Chen, Yaoyao; Li, Duo","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/98665781b4dc02015d67b10389b21b6b05aa02d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7031964.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7031964/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzM5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Guangxi","Wenshan City"],"keyphrases":["patients","spread of H7N9 virus","east of Wenshan City","sudden emergence of human cases of H7N9","emergence of human infection","urban area of Wenshan City","Poultry exposure","avian influenza","source of infection","study","outbreak","Hygienic management of live poultry markets","virological screening of chickens","virological features","epidemiological investigations of chicken sources","avian species","Guangxi Province","phylogenetic analysis of viral gene sequences","real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","timelines of key events","low pathogenicity","isolates","important carrier","environments","METHODS","close contacts","Genetic sequencing","regions","southwestern China","BACKGROUND","origin","CONCLUSIONS","Samples","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

However, KLH is a multi-subunit particle derived from a natural source, and its manufacture as a clinical product remains a challenge. Here we report the preclinical development of recombinant tetanus toxoid heavy chain fragment (rTTHC) linked to FP8 (FP8-rTTHC) as a suitable FP-conjugate vaccine immunogen. We assessed 16 conjugates, made by coupling the 4 most prevalent FP8 sequences with 4 carrier proteins: the aforementioned KLH and rTTHC; the H. influenzae protein D (HiD); and the cross-reactive material from diphtheria toxin (CRM197). While each of the 16 FP8-carrier conjugates could elicit HIV-1-neutralizing responses, rTTHC conjugates induced higher FP-directed responses overall. A Sulfo-SIAB linker yielded superior results over an SM(PEG)2 linker but combinations of carriers, conjugation ratio of peptide to carrier, or choice of adjuvant (Adjuplex or Alum) did not significantly impact elicited FP-directed neutralizing responses in mice. Overall, SIAB-linked FP8-rTTHC appears to be a promising vaccine candidate for advancing to clinical assessment.","publish_time":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ou, Li; Kong, Wing-Pui; Chuang, Gwo-Yu; Ghosh, Mridul; Gulla, Krishana; O\u2019Dell, Sijy; Varriale, Joseph; Barefoot, Nathan; Changela, Anita; Chao, Cara W.; Cheng, Cheng; Druz, Aliaksandr; Kong, Rui; McKee, Krisha; Rawi, Reda; Sarfo, Edward K.; Sch\u00F6n, Arne; Shaddeau, Andrew; Tsybovsky, Yaroslav; Verardi, Raffaello; Wang, Shuishu; Wanninger, Timothy G.; Xu, Kai; Yang, Gengcheng J.; Zhang, Baoshan; Zhang, Yaqiu; Zhou, Tongqing; Arnold, Frank J.; Doria-Rose, Nicole A.; Lei, Q.

A major virulence factor of P. gulae consists of a 41-kDa filamentous appendage (FimA) on the cell surface, which is classified into three genotypes: A, B, and C. Thus far, inhibition of periodontal disease in dogs remains difficult. The present study assessed the inhibitory effects of a combination of clindamycin and interferon alpha (IFN-\u03B1) formulation against P. gulae and periodontal disease. Growth of P. gulae was significantly inhibited by clindamycin; this inhibition had a greater effect on type C P. gulae than on type A and B isolates. In contrast, the IFN-\u03B1 formulation inhibited the expression of IL-1\u03B2 and COX-2 elicited by type A and B isolates, but not that elicited by type C isolates. Furthermore, periodontal recovery was promoted by the administration of both clindamycin and IFN-\u03B1 formulation to dogs undergoing periodontal treatment; moreover, this combined treatment reduced the number of FimA genotypes in oral specimens from treated dogs. These results suggest that a combination of clindamycin and IFN-\u03B1 formulation inhibit P. gulae virulence and thus may be effective for the prevention of periodontal disease induced by P. gulae.","publish_time":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nomura, Ryota; Inaba, Hiroaki; Yasuda, Hidemi; Shirai, Mitsuyuki; Kato, Yukio; Murakami, Masaru; Iwashita, Naoki; Shirahata, So; Yoshida, Sho; Matayoshi, Saaya; Yasuda, Junya; Arai, Nobuaki; Asai, Fumitoshi; Matsumoto-Nakano, Michiyo; Nakano, Kazuhiko","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fad068abaa998641db5de8113fced6b3ef3d613f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7033253.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7033253/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQwOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Porphyromonas"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gulae virulence","IFN-\u03B1 formulation","periodontal treatment","Porphyromonas gulae","inhibition of periodontal disease","periodontal recovery","prevention of periodontal disease","combination of clindamycin","major periodontal pathogen","type C isolates","B isolates","treated dogs","number of FimA genotypes","major virulence factor of","combined treatment","oral specimens","greater effect","interferon alpha","inhibitory effects","expression of IL","administration","kDa filamentous appendage","present study","COX","contrast","cell surface","results","Growth of","owners"],"language":"en"},

As there is no previous study on antibiotic resistance in patients with clinical features of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in Sierra Leone, research is needed to inform public health policies. Our study aimed to assess antibiotic resistance rates from isolates in the urine and sputum samples of patients with clinical features of HAIs. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a cross-sectional study of adult inpatients aged \u226518 years at Connaught Hospital, an urban tertiary care hospital in Freetown between February and June 2018. RESULTS: Over the course of the study, we enrolled 164 patients. Risk factors for HAIs were previous antibiotic use (93.3%), comorbidities (58.5%) and age (\u226565 years) (23.9%). Of the 164 samples, 89.6% were urine. Bacterial growth was recorded in 58.8% of cultured specimens; the type of specimen was an independent predictor of bacterial growth (p \u003C 0.021). The most common isolates were Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae; 29.2% and 19.0% in urine samples and 18.8% and 31.3% in sputum samples, respectively. The overall resistance rates were 58% for all extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms, 13.4% for carbapenem-resistant non-lactose fermenting gram-negative bacilli, 8.7% for carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) and 1.3% for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). There were no carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (CRPA) isolates but all Staphylococcus aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant S. aureus. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated a high prevalence rate of ESBL-producing organisms which are a significant burden at the main tertiary hospital in Sierra Leone. Urgent action is needed to strengthen microbiological diagnostic infrastructure, initiate surveillance on antibiotic resistance and develop and implement policy framework on antibiotic stewardship.","publish_time":"2020-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lakoh, Sulaiman; Li, Letian; Sevalie, Stephen; Guo, Xuejun; Adekanmbi, Olukemi; Yang, Guang; Adebayo, Oladimeji; Yi, Le; Coker, Joshua M.; Wang, Shuchao; Wang, Tiecheng; Sun, Weiyang; Habib, Abdulrazaq G.; Klein, Eili Y.","journal":"Antimicrob Resist Infect Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/53515f9703700f28175a9bb0e635996aae0770e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7036224.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7036224/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["P. aeruginosa","S. aureus"],"organizations":["Connaught Hospital","CRAB"],"locations":["sub-Saharan Africa","Sierra Leone","Freetown"],"keyphrases":["antibiotic resistance rates","antibiotic stewardship","urine samples","carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae","previous antibiotic use","methicillin-resistant","previous study","sputum samples of patients","carbapenem-resistant non-lactose","carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii","overall resistance rates","common isolates","Staphylococcus aureus isolates","clinical features of HAIs","main tertiary hospital","Connaught Hospital","Sierra Leone","organisms","years","urban tertiary care hospital","cross-sectional study of adult inpatients","clinical features of healthcare","global public health","public health policies","independent predictor of bacterial growth","high prevalence rate of ESBL","associated infections","sub-Saharan Africa","CRPA","type of specimen","increasing threat","Available data","gram-negative bacilli","Escherichia coli","microbiological diagnostic infrastructure","significant burden","surveillance","research","CRAB","Klebsiella pneumoniae","Risk factors","policy framework","extended-spectrum beta-lactamase","Freetown","BACKGROUND","cultured specimens","Urgent action","comorbidities","CONCLUSION","age","course","METHODOLOGY","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Bayesian phylodynamic analysis suggested that five major Nigerian HIV-1 sub-epidemics were introduced in the 1960s and 1970s, close to the Nigerian Civil War. The analysis also indicated that the number of effective infections decreased in Nigeria after the introduction of free antiretroviral treatment in 2006. Finally, Bayesian phylogeographic analysis suggested gravity-like dynamics in which virus lineages first emerge and expand within large urban centers such as Abuja and Lagos, before migrating towards smaller rural areas.

We included RCTs involving adult patients (\u003E 18 years) who underwent at least two different SBT methods. All authors reported our primary outcome of successful extubation rate and clearly compared PS versus T-piece with clinically relevant secondary outcomes (rate of reintubation, ICU and hospital length of stay, and ICU and hospital mortality). Results were expressed as odds ratio (OR) and mean difference (MD) with accompanying 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Ten RCTs including 3165 patients were included.

In addition, compared with the PS group, the T-piece group showed no significant difference in the rate of reintubation (odds ratio [OR] = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.78\u20131.26; P = 0.95; I(2) = 5%), ICU mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 1.22; 95% CI, 0.83\u20131.80; P = 0.30; I(2) = 0%), hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 1.36; 95% CI, 0.99\u20131.87; P = 0.06; I(2) = 19%), ICU length of stay (mean difference = \u2212 0.10; 95% CI, \u2212 0.59 to 0.39; P = 0.69; I(2) = 13%), and hospital length of stay (mean difference = \u2212 0.82;95% CI, \u2212 2.2 to 0.55; P = 0.24; I(2) = 0%). CONCLUSIONS: T-piece and PSV as SBTs are considered to have comparable predictive power of successful extubation in critically ill patients. The analysis of secondary outcomes also shows no significant difference in the rate of reintubation, ICU and hospital length of stay, and ICU and hospital mortality between the two groups. Further randomized controlled studies of SBTs are still required.","publish_time":"2020-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yuting; Li, Hongxiang; Zhang, Dong","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9bfde810138fdbb84fe94c5a9e6a337f668545ca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7045460.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7045460/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQ0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SBT","PSV","ICU","PS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CI","ICU mortality","hospital mortality","odds ratio","T-piece group","ICU length of stay","hospital length of stay","significant difference","mean difference","rate of reintubation","PS group","RCTs","Results","primary outcome of successful extubation rate","analysis of secondary outcomes","extubation success","meta-analysis","comparable predictive power of successful extubation","relevant secondary outcomes","important outcomes","preferable SBT","PSV","different SBT methods","ill patients","adult patients","randomized controlled trials","controlled studies of SBTs","Embase databases","effect of alternative spontaneous breathing trial","techniques","pressure support ventilation","PubMed","Cochrane","BACKGROUND","years","authors","systematic review","inception","MD","CONCLUSIONS","confidence interval","addition","groups"],"language":"en"},

Many articles in this field enrolled trials not based on acute kidney injury. The safety of the watchful waiting strategy has not been fully discussed, and late RRT initiation criteria vary across studies. The effect of early RRT initiation in the AKI population with high plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) has not been examined yet. METHODS: In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were systemically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Trials not conducted in the AKI population were excluded. Data of study characteristics, primary outcome (all-cause mortality), and related secondary outcomes [mechanical ventilation (MV) days, length of hospital stay, RRT days, and length of ICU stay] were extracted. The outcomes were compared between early and late RRT groups by estimating the pooled odds ratio (OR) for binary outcomes and the weighted mean difference for continuous outcomes. Prospective trials were also examined and analyzed using the same method. RESULTS: Nine RCTs with 1938 patients were included. Early RRT did not provide a survival benefit (pooled OR, 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62\u20131.27). However, the early RRT group had significantly fewer MV days (pooled mean difference, \u2212 3.98 days; 95% CI \u2212 7.81 to \u2212 0.15 days). Subgroup analysis showed that RCTs enrolling the surgical population (P = .001) and the AKI population with high plasma NGAL (P = .031) had favorable outcomes regarding RRT days in the early initiation group. Moreover, 6 of 9 RCTs were selected for examining the safety of the watchful waiting strategy, and no significant differences were found in primary and secondary outcomes between the early and late RRT groups. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, early RRT initiation did not provide a survival benefit, but a possible benefit of fewer MV days was detected. Early RRT might also provide the benefit of shorter MV or RRT support in the surgical population and in AKI patients with high plasma NGAL. Depending on the conventional indication for RRT initiation, the watchful waiting strategy is safe on the basis of all primary and secondary outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Jia-Jin; Lee, Cheng-Chia; Kuo, George; Fan, Pei-Chun; Lin, Chan-Yu; Chang, Su-Wei; Tian, Ya-Chung; Chen, Yung-Chang; Chang, Chih-Hsiang","journal":"Ann Intensive Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c71e5f93ab9914688801a372ab78034f157b1eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7054512.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7054512/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQ1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRISMA","MV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RRT days","early RRT group","RRT support","effect of early RRT initiation","late RRT groups","late RRT initiation criteria","early initiation group","AKI population","binary outcomes","continuous outcomes","favorable outcomes","RCTs","related secondary outcomes","possible benefit of fewer MV days","surgical population","high plasma NGAL","benefit of shorter MV","AKI patients","survival benefit","watchful waiting strategy","Prospective trials","pooled mean difference","primary outcome","field enrolled trials","randomized controlled trials","safety","high plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin","weighted mean difference","pooled odds ratio","length of hospital","length of ICU","all-cause mortality","mechanical ventilation","optimal timing of renal replacement therapy","PubMed","basis","PRISMA guidelines","Embase","Data of study characteristics","significant differences","Cochrane databases","accordance","acute kidney injury","studies","conventional indication","METHODS","BACKGROUND","articles","CONCLUSIONS","Subgroup analysis","confidence interval","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of thoracic fluid content (TFC) as a predictor of weaning outcome. METHODS: An observational cohort study included 64 critically ill surgical patients who were eligible for extubation. Before initiating the spontaneous breathing trial, the TFC was measured using the electrical cardiometry technology. Patients were followed up after extubation and divided into successful weaning group and failed weaning group. Both groups were compared according to respiratory and cardiovascular parameters. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the ability of TFC to predict weaning outcome. RESULTS: The number of successfully weaned patients was 41/64 (64%). Twenty (31%) patients had impaired cardiac contractility, and of them, 13/20 (64%) patients were successfully extubated. Both groups, successful weaning group and failed weaning group, were comparable in most of baseline characteristics; however, the TFC was significantly higher in the failed weaning group compared to the successful weaning group. The area under the ROC curves (AUCs) showed moderate predictive ability for the TFC in predicting weaning failure (AUC [95% confidence interval] 0.69 [0.57\u20130.8], cutoff value \u003E 50 k\u03A9(\u22121)), while the predictive ability of TFC was excellent in the subgroup of patients with ejection fraction \u003C 40% (AUC [95% confidence interval 0.93 [0.72\u20131], cutoff value \u003E 50 k\u03A9(\u22121)).

The negative clinical results may be due to inadequate mean airway pressure (mPaw) settings in HFOV. Our objective was to evaluate the air distribution, ventilatory and hemodynamic effects of individual mPaw titration during HFOV in ARDS animal based on oxygenation and electrical impedance tomography (EIT). METHODS: ARDS was introduced with repeated bronchoalveolar lavage followed by injurious mechanical ventilation in ten healthy male pigs (51.2 \u00B1 1.9 kg). Settings of HFOV were 9 Hz (respiratory frequency), 33% (inspiratory time) and 70 cmH(2)O (\u2206pressure). After lung recruitment, the mPaw was reduced in steps of 3 cmH(2)O every 6 min. Hemodynamics and blood gases were obtained in each step. Regional ventilation distribution was determined with EIT. RESULTS: PaO(2)/FiO(2) decreased significantly during the mPaw decremental phase (p \u003C 0.001). Lung overdistended regions decreased, while recruitable regions increased as mPaw decreased. The optimal mPaw with respect to PaO(2)/FiO(2) was 21 (18.0\u201321.0) cmH(2)O, that is comparable to EIT-based center of ventilation (EIT-CoV) and EIT-collapse/over, 19.5 (15.0\u201321.0) and 19.5 (18.0\u201321.8), respectively (p = 0.07). EIT-CoV decreasing along with mPaw decrease revealed redistribution toward non-dependent regions. The individual mPaw titrated by EIT-based indices improved regional ventilation distribution with respect to overdistension and collapse (p = 0.035).

The bat surveillance data indicated that BatCoV HKU9 has been widely spreading and circulating in bats. This highlights the necessity of characterizing the virus for its potential to cross species barriers. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the coronavirus spike (S) protein recognizes host receptors to mediate virus entry and is therefore a key factor determining the viral tropism and transmission capacity. In this study, the putative S RBD of BatCoV HKU9 (HKU9-RBD), which is homologous to other betaCoV RBDs that have been structurally and functionally defined, was characterized via a series of biophysical and crystallographic methods. By using surface plasmon resonance, we demonstrated that HKU9-RBD binds to neither SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 nor MERS-CoV receptor CD26. We further determined the atomic structure of HKU9-RBD, which as expected is composed of a core and an external subdomain. The core subdomain fold resembles those of other betaCoV RBDs, whereas the external subdomain is structurally unique with a single helix, explaining the inability of HKU9-RBD to react with either ACE2 or CD26. Via comparison of the available RBD structures, we further proposed a homologous intersubdomain binding mode in betaCoV RBDs that anchors the external subdomain to the core subdomain. The revealed RBD features would shed light on the evolution route of betaCoV.","publish_time":"2016-10-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Canping; Qi, Jianxun; Lu, Guangwen; Wang, Qihui; Yuan, Yuan; Wu, Ying; Zhang, Yanfang; Yan, Jinghua; Gao, George F.","journal":"Biochemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f7d0062b880f92aacdf5f51f48278d4782f1817.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7075523.xml.json","url":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.biochem.6b00790","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzUxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RBD"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["HKU9-RBD","putative S RBD of BatCoV HKU9","inability of HKU9","betaCoV RBDs","external subdomain","Bat coronavirus","revealed RBD features","available RBD structures","MERS-CoV receptor CD26","atomic structure of HKU9","core subdomain fold","SARS-CoV receptor ACE2","evolution route of betaCoV","suggested bat origin","bat-derived coronaviruses","coronavirus spike","bat surveillance data","receptor binding domain","interspecies transmission potential","virus entry","homologous intersubdomain binding mode","transmission capacity","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","protein","respect","light","host receptors","viral tropism","key factor","text","single helix","studies","important betacoronavirus","cross species barriers","series of biophysical","crystallographic methods","comparison","study","surface plasmon resonance","Image","genus","necessity","bats"],"language":"en"},

Arbovirus surveillance is not conducted regularly in Romania, being particularly very scarce in the remote and diverse areas like the Danube Delta. Here we describe the detection and genetic characterization of a novel orbivirus (Reoviridae: Orbivirus) designated as Letea virus, which was found in grass snakes (Natrix natrix) during a metagenomic and metatranscriptomic survey conducted between 2014 and 2017. This virus is the first orbivirus discovered in reptiles. Phylogenetic analyses placed Letea virus as a highly divergent species in the Culicoides-/sand fly-borne orbivirus clade. Gene reassortment and intragenic recombination were detected in the majority of the nine Letea virus strains obtained, implying that these mechanisms play important roles in the evolution and diversification of the virus. However, the screening of arthropods, including Culicoides biting midges collected within the same surveillance program, tested negative for Letea virus infection and could not confirm the arthropod vector of the virus. The study provided complete genome sequences for nine Letea virus strains and new information about orbivirus diversity, host range, ecology and evolution. The phylogenetic associations warrant further screening of arthropods, as well as sustained surveillance efforts for elucidation of Letea virus natural cycle and possible implications for animal and human health.","publish_time":"2020-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tomazatos, Alexandru; Marschang, Rachel E.; Maranda, Iulia; Baum, Heike; Bialonski, Alexandra; Sp\u00EEnu, Marina; L\u00FChken, Renke; Schmidt-Chanasit, Jonas; Cadar, Daniel","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e84d4a546d0628f88face971c5bbe51036870bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7077223.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7077223/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzUyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Gene"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Danube Delta"],"keyphrases":["Letea virus strains","Letea virus infection","elucidation of Letea virus natural cycle","orbivirus diversity","novel orbivirus","evolution","orbivirus clade","genetic diversity","animal","ecology","characterization of novel arthropod","genetic characterization","Natrix natrix","surveillance program","screening of arthropods","Arbovirus surveillance","sustained surveillance efforts","new information","valuable information","human health","arthropod vector","public health","phylogenetic associations","Phylogenetic analyses","Culicoides biting midges","possible implications","host range","viruses","potential","complete genome sequences","diverse areas","majority","Reoviridae","sand fly","divergent species","intragenic recombination","important roles","metagenomic","mechanisms","diversification","Danube Delta","grass snakes","Gene reassortment","study","discovery","detection","metatranscriptomic survey","Romania","reptiles"],"language":"en"},

The island of Trinidad, is richly diverse in chiropteran fauna and endemic for bat-transmitted rabies with low RABV isolation rates observed in this population. We aimed to determine the seroprevalence of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies (RVNA) in light of spatio-temporal and bat demographic factors to infer the extent of natural exposure to RABV in the Trinidadian bat population. RVNA titers were determined by the RABV micro-neutralization test on 383 bat samples representing 21 species, comprising 30.9% of local bat diversity, from 31 locations across the island over 5 years. RVNA was positively detected in 33 samples (8.6%) representing 6 bat species (mainly frugivorous) with titers ranging from 0.1 to 19 IU/mL (mean 1.66 IU/mL). The analyses based on a multivariable binomial generalised linear mixed-effects model showed that bat age and year of capture were significant predictors of seropositivity. Thus, juvenile bats were more likely to be seropositive when compared to adults (estimate 1.13; p = 0.04) which may suggest early exposure to the RABV with possible implications for viral amplification in this population. Temporal variation in rabies seropositivity, 2012\u20132014 versus 2015\u20132017 (estimate 1.07; p = 0.03) may have been related to the prevailing rabies epizootic situation. Regarding other factors investigated, RVNA was found in bats from both rural and non-rural areas, as well as in both hematophagous and non-hematophagous bat species. The most common seropositive species, Artibeus jamaicensis planirostris is ubiquitous throughout the island which may potentially facilitate human exposure. The findings of this study should be factored into public health assessments on the potential for rabies transmission by non-hematophagous bats in Trinidad.","publish_time":"2020-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seetahal, Janine F.

The aim of this study was to analyze the results of surveillance of HAIs in a III level NICU in Naples, Italy during 2013\u20132017 and to compare with those obtained during 2006\u20132010. METHODS: The surveillance included 1265 neonates of all birth weight (BW) classes with \u003E 2 days NICU stay. Infections were defined using standard Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definitions adapted to neonatal pathology. RESULTS: A total of 125 HAIs were registered during 2013\u20132017 with a frequency of 9.9% and an incidence density of 3.2 per 1000 patient days. HAIs occurred in all BW classes with a decreasing trend from the lowest to the highest BW classes (p = \u003C 0.001). Central line-associated blood stream infection (CLABSI) was the most frequent infection (69.6%), followed by ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) (20%), urinary tract infection (UTI) (8.8%) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) (1.6%). Also, CLABSI and VAP incidence density decreased from lower to highest BW classes showing a significant trend (p = 0.007). Most frequent pathogens responsible for CLABSI were: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS) (25.3%), Candida parapsilosis (21.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.7), Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.8%). No microbiological diagnosis was achieved for 20.7% of CLABSI. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (28%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (20%), and CONS (20%) were the most frequent pathogens responsible for VAP. CLABSI incidence density showed no differences between 2006 and 2010 and 2013\u20132017, while VAP incidence density for the 751\u2013100 g BW class was higher during 2006\u20132010 than during 2013\u20132017 (p = 0.006). A higher incidence of the CLABSI caused by Gram positive bacteria (p = 0.002) or by undetermined etiology (p = 0.01) was observed during 2013\u20132017 than during 2006\u20132010, while a significant lower incidence of VAP caused by Gram-negative bacteria was found during 2013\u20132017 than during 2006\u20132010 (p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: HAIs in the NICU developed in all BW classes with a decreasing trend from the lowest to the highest BW classes in both study periods. Differences in the aetiology of CLABSI and VAP were found between the two study periods. This reinforces the importance of HAIs surveillance protocol in the NICU, which monitors microbiological isolates and use of medical devices for all BW classes of neonates.","publish_time":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scamardo, Marina Silvia; Dolce, Pasquale; Esposito, Eliana Pia; Raimondi, Francesco; Triassi, Maria; Zarrilli, Raffaele","journal":"Ital J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13557d309d24e6429459e469cf5a3e717083e3b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7079437.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079437/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzUzNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Klebsiella"],"organizations":["NICU","NEC","VAP"],"locations":["Naples"],"keyphrases":["highest BW classes","BW classes of neonates","CLABSI incidence density","VAP incidence density","aetiology of CLABSI","significant lower incidence of VAP","higher incidence","g BW class","days NICU","frequent infection","importance of HAIs surveillance protocol","decreasing trend","significant trend","level NICU","results of surveillance","study periods","frequent pathogens responsible","Healthcare-associated infections","differences","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","CONS","Central line-associated blood stream infection","urinary tract infection","Gram-negative bacteria","microbiological isolates","patient days","microbiological diagnosis","Gram positive bacteria","Prevention definitions","Disease Control","standard Centers","medical devices","Coagulase-negative staphylococci","Escherichia coli","birth weight","intensive care units","neonatal pathology","NICUs","Klebsiella pneumoniae","UTI","Naples","Italy","BACKGROUND","undetermined etiology","necrotizing enterocolitis","ventilator","METHODS","total","CONCLUSION","Candida parapsilosis","Stenotrophomonas maltophilia","aim","frequency"],"language":"en"},

The list of microbial pathogens associated with regulatory T cell responses is growing rapidly and includes bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. As the biology of regulatory T cells is revealed, we are discovering that their induction during infection is a normal aspect of immunity, necessary to limit collateral damage from inflammatory responses and aggressive immunological effectors. Thus, these cells play a critical role in maintaining the delicate balance between preventing immunopathology and allowing the immune response to clear infections. While generally successful, there are notable exceptions where regulatory T cell-mediated suppression appears to be responsible for allowing certain viruses to establish and maintain a persistent state. In this review, we will discuss our current understanding of what virus-induced regulatory T cells are, how they are induced, and what mechanisms they use to suppress immunity. The complex role of Tregs in regulating immunity to viral infections, and the consequences their activity has on disease is illustrated by a review of specific viral infections including hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus.","publish_time":"2006-07-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robertson, Shelly J.; Hasenkrug, Kim J.","journal":"Springer Semin Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9b9036c095358095dc4a971a75fd152b3d2a0a40.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7079961.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079961/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzYwOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["regulatory T cell responses","biology of regulatory T cells","microbial infections","regulatory T cell-mediated suppression","immune responses","clear infections","review of specific viral infections","inflammatory responses","critical role","hepatitis C virus","human immunodeficiency virus","normal aspect of immunity","complex role of Tregs","certain viruses","list of microbial pathogens","collateral damage","increased attention","notable exceptions","aggressive immunological effectors","immunopathology","delicate balance","consequences","recent years","induction","parasites","disease","activity","bacteria","current understanding","fungi","persistent state","mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

The specific affinity reaction of nucleic acids (hybridization) and antibodies towards antigens is the most common bioanalytical method for generating multiplexed quantitative results. Nucleic acid-based analysis is restricted to the detection of cells and viruses. Antibodies are more universal biomolecular receptors that selectively bind small molecules such as pesticides, small toxins, and pharmaceuticals and to biopolymers (e.g. toxins, allergens) and complex biological structures like bacterial cells and viruses. By producing an appropriate antibody, the corresponding antigenic analyte can be detected on a multiplexed immunoanalytical microarray. Food and water analysis along with clinical diagnostics constitute potential application fields for multiplexed analysis. Diverse fluorescence, chemiluminescence, electrochemical, and label-free microarray readout systems have been developed in the last decade. Some of them are constructed as flow-through microarrays by combination with a fluidic system. Microarrays have the potential to become widely accepted as a system for analytical applications, provided that robust and validated results on fully automated platforms are successfully generated.

In this study, we use the data from a chronic disease management information system in Shanghai to estimate vaccination coverage and characterize predictors of seasonal influenza and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) vaccination among people with chronic disease in Shanghai. METHODS: The Shanghai Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have information systems related to chronic disease management, hospital records, and immunizations. Data from individuals with hypertension, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were abstracted during July 2017. The main outcome was coverage of pneumococcal and influenza vaccination. Vaccination coverage was calculated across demographic groups. Significance in bivariate associations was assessed through Pearson\u2019s chi-square tests, and in multivariable models through logistic regression models with a forward stepwise method to select variables. RESULTS: In the sample of 2,531,227 individuals \u226515 years, 22.8% were vaccinated for pneumonia from January 2013 to July 2017, and the vaccination coverage of influenza in the 2016/17 influenza season was 0.4%. Vaccination coverage was highest in those 70\u201379 and lowest in those younger than 60. Compared to urban areas, uptake in rural areas was higher for pneumonia vaccination (OR: 2.43, 95% CI: 2.41, 2.45), but lower for influenza vaccination (OR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.59). Having a greater number of chronic diseases was associated with higher likelihood of pneumonia vaccination (3 vs 1: OR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.64, 1.71), but this relationship was not statistically significant for influenza vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: We found low levels with of pneumococcal vaccination, and extremely low uptake of influenza vaccination among individuals with high risk conditions in Shanghai who should be priority groups targeted for vaccination. Interventions could be designed to target groups with low uptake \u2013 like younger adults, and individuals who have not yet retired.","publish_time":"2020-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yuheng; Cheng, Minna; Wang, Siyuan; Wu, Fei; Yan, Qinghua; Yang, Qinping; Li, Yanyun; Guo, Xiang; Fu, Chen; Shi, Yan; Wagner, Abram L.; Boulton, Matthew L.","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7390fa9c82c4232856aa2b68e67fafce37a75786.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7081528.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7081528/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzY5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pearson"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Shanghai"],"keyphrases":["vaccination coverage of influenza","pneumococcal vaccination","low uptake of influenza vaccination","higher likelihood of pneumonia vaccination","influenza season","chronic conditions","Disease Control","heart disease","lung disease","coverage of pneumococcal","individuals","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","chronic disease management information system","predictors of seasonal influenza","greater number of chronic diseases","Shanghai Centers","diabetes","number of vaccine","low levels","data","younger adults","priority groups","demographic groups","valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine","information systems","multivariable models","rural areas","urban areas","preventable diseases","logistic regression models","high risk conditions","Prevention","PPSV23","hypertension","people","Pearson\u2019s chi-square tests","hospital records","bivariate associations","stepwise method","complications","COPD","main outcome","immunizations","sample","BACKGROUND","METHODS","vs","Significance","variables","CONCLUSIONS","years","relationship","RESULTS","study","Interventions"],"language":"en"},

Here, we present a fatal case of HLH secondary to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection complicated by both anti-viral drug resistance and sepsis from multiple MDROs including pandrug-resistant superbug bacteria. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy, six-year-old boy presented with a 45-day history of fever prior to a diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and hemorrhagic colitis, both associated with CMV. On hospital admission, the patient was found to be colonized with multiple, multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and carbapenamase-producing organisms (CPO). He eventually developed respiratory, urine and bloodstream infections with highly drug-resistant, including pandrug-resistant bacteria, which could not be controlled by antibiotic treatment. Antiviral therapy also failed to contain his CMV infection and the patient succumbed to overwhelming bacterial and viral infection. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the MDR bacteria and metagenomic analysis of his blood sample revealed an unusual accumulation of a wide range of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms in a single patient, including antiviral resistance to ganciclovir, and resistance mechanisms to all currently available antibiotics.

Elucidating the changes in innate and adaptive immunity during gestation may improve pregnancy outcomes and facilitate the development of targeted therapies for autoimmune diseases. METHOD: The Viral Immunity and Pregnancy (VIP) study evaluated over 50 subjects longitudinally at three time points during pregnancy and at two time points post-delivery. Leukocyte enumeration was performed; functional responses of NK cells and CD4 T cells were analyzed, and soluble factors such as cytokines, defensins, and steroid hormones were measured in maternal blood. RESULTS: In comparison to the post-partum period, the latter part of pregnancy was characterized by significant increases in blood phagocytes and pDCs and decreases in the number and activity of NK and T cells. Alterations were found in antimicrobial proteins and serum cytokines. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that pregnancy is not a period of immunosuppression but an alteration in immune priorities characterized by a strengthening of innate immune barriers and a concomitant reduction in adaptive/inflammatory immunity in the later stages of pregnancy.","publish_time":"2011-12-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kraus, Thomas A.; Engel, Stephanie M.; Sperling, Rhoda S.; Kellerman, Lisa; Lo, Yungtai; Wallenstein, Sylvan; Escribese, Maria M.; Garrido, Jose L.; Singh, Tricia; Loubeau, Martine; Moran, Thomas M.","journal":"J Clin Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c24ea320a94f89c6802d968806b3d5273882ecf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086597.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086597/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzcxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pregnancy outcomes","existence of pregnancy","later stages of pregnancy","adaptive immunity","inflammatory immunity","Viral Immunity","CD4 T cells","immune priorities","autoimmune diseases","immune status","functional responses of NK cells","strengthening of innate immune barriers","time points post-delivery","activity of NK","related alterations","period of immunosuppression","serum cytokines","blood phagocytes","maternal blood","post-partum period","concomitant reduction","certain microbial infections","mortality","demonstrated improvements","increased risk of morbidity","pDCs","defensins","steroid hormones","clinical course","development of targeted therapies","significant increases","VIP","gestation","soluble factors","comparison","antimicrobial proteins","subjects","number","study","PURPOSE","Leukocyte enumeration","changes","METHOD"],"language":"en"},

Supershift and western blot assays have identified these three proteins as mitochondrial HSP70 (mtHSP70), HSP60, and HSP40. A series of co-immunoprecipitation assays have established that these four MHV RNA binding proteins are associated, even in the absence of MHV RNA. However, the presence of a synthetic RNA containing the sequence bound by these four proteins does increase the amount of co-precipitated protein, in particular the amount of HSP60 which is brought down with antibodies directed against HSP40 and mtHSP70. We have provided evidence for the interaction of these four proteins with the 3\u2032 end region of MHV RNA in infected cells by a series of immunoprecipitation RT-PCR assays.

The NS5 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by His-tag based affinity chromatography. This recombinant NS5 protein exhibited RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity in vitro in the absence of other viral or cellular factors. The RNA polymerase activity was dependent on divalent cations, and Mn(2\u002B) was found to be 20 times more effective than Mg(2\u002B) in coordinating the catalytic reaction of RdRp, while Ca(2\u002B) inhibited enzyme activity. The optimal reaction conditions for the in vitro RdRp reaction were established. Characterization of the RdRp reaction products demonstrated that the JEV NS5 protein can initiate RNA synthesis through a de novo initiation mechanism in our in vitro reaction system. Comparing the efficiency of different RNA templates, we found that JEV NS5 protein was more efficient in using negative-strand RNA templates, indicating that the JEV NS5 protein is involved in regulating the ratio of positive- to negative-strand RNA. Four amino acid sequence motifs crucial for RdRp activity were also identified using site-directed mutagenesis analysis. All substitutions of the conserved residues within these motifs led to a complete inactivation or severe loss of enzyme activity.","publish_time":"2007-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, F.; Hasebe, F.; Inoue, S.; Mathenge, E.

Its prevalence in swine herds was first reported in China in 2000. PCV2 infection causes immunosuppression that leads to multiple diseases, causing serious economic problems for the swine industry in China. Since information on the genetic variation of PCV2 in Yunnan province is limited, this study aims to investigate the molecular epidemiological and evolutionary characteristics of PCV2 from 2016 to 2019. METHODS: A total of 279 clinical samples were collected from different regions of Yunnan between 2016 to 2019, and PCV2 was detected by PCR. We then amplified full genomes from the positive samples, and the sequences were analysed for homology and genetic evolution. RESULTS: Overall, 60.93% (170/279) of the screened swine herd samples were positive for PCV2. We sequenced 15 Yunnan province PCV2 strains from positive samples. Analyses of the complete genomes and Cap genes led to the classification of the 15 Yunnan PCV2 strains into PCV2a (2 of 15), PCV2b (1of 15) and PCV2d (12 of 15). All strains shared 94.3\u201399.9% of their identities with the nucleotide sequences of complete genomes in this study and shared 94.2\u201399.9% identity with the reference sequences. All strains share 89.4\u2013100% and 86.8\u2013100% of their identities with the nucleotide and amino acid (aa) sequences of Cap, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide evidence that PCV2a, PCV2b and PCV2d genotypes coexisted in Yunnan Province from 2016 to 2019, and the priority prevalence genotype was PCV2d. The data provide evidence for the increased genetic diversity and insights into the molecular epidemiology of PCV2. This study also provides basic data for the Yunnan province PCV2 molecular epidemiological survey and accumulates effective materials for the development of PCV2 vaccines.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lv, Nianci; Zhu, Li; Li, Wengui; Li, Zhilan; Qian, Qisheng; Zhang, Tianyu; Liu, Lu; Hong, Jinmei; Zheng, Xiaolin; Wang, Yuan; Zhang, Yifang; Chai, Jun","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c42f33171b8532b51242b08230d57f4e8bdc041f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087357.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087357/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozg0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Yunnan PCV2 strains","Yunnan province PCV2 strains","PCV2 infection","molecular epidemiology of PCV2","genetic variation of PCV2","Yunnan province PCV2 molecular epidemiological survey","evolutionary characteristics of PCV2","development of PCV2 vaccines","study","positive samples","sequences of Cap","nucleotide sequences of complete genomes","different regions of Yunnan","clinical samples","reference sequences","screened swine herd samples","swine industry","evidence","swine herds","genetic evolution","PCV2a","PCV2d genotypes","identities","PCV2b","China","RESULTS","increased genetic diversity","Porcine circovirus type","basic data","Cap genes","causative agent of porcine circovirus-associated disease","priority prevalence genotype","effective materials","serious economic problems","insights","multiple diseases","amino acid","classification","PCVAD","immunosuppression","total","BACKGROUND","homology","Analyses","information","METHODS","identity","CONCLUSIONS","PCR"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to evaluate a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) suspension microarray which detects 19 viral and four atypical bacterial targets. A comprehensive set of sensitive monoplex real-time PCR assays was used for each pathogen as the gold standard. A panel of archived as well as 300 prospectively collected clinical samples was analysed by both methods. At least one target was detected in 165/300 (55 %) samples by monoplex PCR and in 140/300 (46 %) samples by multiplex PCR, respectively. The positivity rate was significantly higher in paediatric patients compared to adults [126/154 (82 %) vs. 39/146 (27 %) by monoplex and 114/154 (74 %) vs. 26/146 (18 %) by multiplex PCR, respectively]. Among all samples, 17/300 (5.6 %) were positive for atypical bacteria by monoplex and 8/300 (2.6 %) by multiplex PCR, respectively. Multiple detections were recorded in 35/300 (11.6 %) samples by monoplex and 26/300 (8.7 %) by multiplex PCR. For the most common pathogens, the sensitivity ranged from 57 to 93 % and the specificity ranged from 95 to 100 %. The overall concordance between both methods was 77 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 72\u201381 %]. False-negative results by multiplex PCR were mainly due to the low target concentration. Compared to monoplex PCR, the novel microarray assay proved its principle but displayed overall lower sensitivities, potentially restricting its use to paediatric patients. For some targets, only small numbers of positive samples were available, requiring larger studies to firmly assess the sensitivity and specificity.","publish_time":"2012-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bierbaum, S.; K\u00F6nigsfeld, N.; Besazza, N.; Blessing, K.; R\u00FCcker, G.; Kontny, U.; Berner, R.; Schumacher, M.; Forster, J.; Falcone, V.; van de Sand, C.; Essig, A.; Huzly, D.; Rohde, G.; Neumann-Haefelin, D.; Panning, M.","journal":"Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/647fc59d8df8d1a26f925294f2ac8dc79b592fa5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087590.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087590/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozg1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["monoplex PCR","multiplex PCR","clinical samples","comprehensive set of sensitive monoplex real-time PCR assays","small numbers of positive samples","novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction","paediatric patients","sensitivity","methods","specificity","novel microarray assay","atypical bacterial targets","suspension microarray","common pathogens","overall concordance","rapid identification of pathogens","low target concentration","Symptoms of acute febrile respiratory tract infection","principle","optimised patient management","larger studies","use","False-negative results","positivity rate","lower sensitivities","adults","study","confidence interval","gold standard","Multiple detections","objective","panel"],"language":"en"},

The Public Health Agency of Canada has created the core competencies for public health to guide the development, delivery and evaluation of MPH programs. In Canada, a capstone project is the recommended method of evaluating the MPH graduate\u2019s ability to demonstrate proficiency in the public health core competencies. A business plan that develops the framework for a public health program is an ideal capstone project currently used in practice within the University of Guelph MPH program. This group assignment incorporates all 36 of the public health core competencies while providing students with a real-world public health experience, and should be considered for inclusion within MPH programs across Canada. Business planning provides students the opportunity to engage in practice-based learning, applying theoretical knowledge to practice. Further, the ability to develop realistic but financially feasible public health problems is an invaluable skill for MPH graduates.

Contemporary surveillance systems have to adapt to these changes. We describe temporal trends and geographic origins of vector-borne diseases in Germany with regard to strengths of existing disease surveillance and to areas marked for improvement. We focused on hantavirus infection (endemic in Germany), chikungunya fever (recently emerging in Europe) and dengue fever (imported from tropical regions), representing important subgroups of vector-borne infections. Routine surveillance data on demographics, origin of infection and the date of reporting were analysed. From 2001 through 2007, 3,005 symptomatic hantavirus infections, and 85 cases of chikungunya fever were reported, similarly 1,048 cases of dengue fever in 2002 through 2007. The geographic origin of hantavirus infection was reported for 95.5% of all cases (dengue virus, 98.4%; chikungunya virus, 100%). Hantavirus infections were acquired in Germany in 97.6% of cases (n = 2800). In 2007, there was a marked increase of hantavirus cases, mainly in areas known to be endemic for hantavirus. In 2006, imported cases of chikungunya fever primarily returned from several islands of the Indian Ocean, while the majority of imported cases in 2007 came from India. The reported number of dengue fever cases have increased since 2004. Thailand contributed the largest proportion of cases (17\u201343% in individual years), followed by India, Brazil and Indonesia. Surveillance of notifiable vector-borne diseases in Germany is able to timely detect spatial and temporal changes of autochthonous an imported infections. Geographic and temporal data obtained by routine surveillance served as a basis for public health recommendations.

The study was conducted in a 184-bed geriatric department in a university hospital during 4 winter months. All consecutive elderly persons admitted with a lower respiratory tract infection were included in the study. Clinical and laboratory parameters, a nasopharyngeal swab, and serological results for respiratory viruses were obtained for all participants. Available blood and sputum cultures were analysed. A total of 165 elderly persons (mean age, 82\u00B16.8 years) were hospitalised with a lower respiratory tract infection. Familial flu-like illness (OR, 4.25; 95%CI, 1.4\u201313), better functionality (OR, 4; 95%CI, 1.3\u201314.15), and leucocyte count \u003C10(10)/l (OR, 3; 95%CI, 1.3\u20137.1) were predictive for viral lower respiratory tract infection. Sixty (36.5%) definite diagnoses (positive blood culture, viral culture, or serological test) and seven (4.2%) probable diagnoses (positive sputum culture) were obtained. An early diagnosis (within 72 h) was possible in 38 (23%) and a late diagnosis in 29 (17.6%) participants. A nasopharyngeal swab contributed in 60.5% of the cases to an early diagnosis. Viral culture identified half (22/43) of the lower respiratory tract infections caused by influenza but only one of six lower respiratory tract infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus. In conclusion, a history of flu-like illness in family members and a total leucocyte count within normal limits makes a viral cause more likely in elderly people hospitalised with a lower respiratory tract infection during winter. Viral culture and rapid antigen detection are insensitive in elderly patients hospitalised with a lower respiratory tract infection.","publish_time":"2003-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Flamaing, J.; Engelmann, I.; Joosten, E.; Van Ranst, M.; Verhaegen, J.; Peetermans, W.

METHODS: In this multicenter nationwide study a total of 971 HCT procedures (741 allo-HCT; 230 auto-HCT) over a period of 6 years were analyzed. RESULTS: During this period 801 episodes of viral infections were diagnosed in 442 patients. The incidence of viral infections was 57.9% in allo-HCT and 4.8% in auto-HCT patients. The most frequent infections after allo-HCT were caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV), polyoma BK virus (BKV) and Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV). The majority of infections occurred within the first 4 months after allo-HCT and over 80% required pharmacotherapy or symptomatic therapy. The median time of treatment of specific viral infection ranged from 7 (for EBV) to 24 (for CMV) days. The highest mortality was observed in case of CMV infection. The risk factors for viral infections were allo-HCT, acute leukemia, acute and chronic graft versus host disease (a/cGVHD), and matched unrelated donor (MUD)/mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD)-HCT. The risk factor for death from viral infection were CMV-IgG seropositivity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia recipient, and MUD/MMUD-HCT. The incidence of EBV infection requiring pre-emptive treatment with rituximab in allo-HCT children was 19.3%. In 30.8% cases of EBV infection, these episodes were preceded by other viral infection and treated with antivirals, which did not prevent development of EBV-DNA-emia with need of rituximab treatment in 81.5% cases. In 47.7% of these cases, GVHD was a factor enabling development of significant EBV-DNA-emia during antiviral therapy of other infection.

These are postulated to be related to the virus\u2019s use of ACE-2 receptors located on certain intestinal cells, cholangiocytes, and hepatocytes. This brief review summarizes the available limited data on digestive manifestations of COVID-19. A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients can present initially with only digestive complaints. The most common digestive symptoms are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Liver-related transaminases are elevated in a substantial proportion of patients, although generally only mildly elevated. Currently it does not appear that severity of digestive symptoms corresponds to severity of COVID-19 clinical course, however, more severe alterations in liver enzymes may correlate with worse clinical course.

Quite a few infectious diseases are still lacking effective prevention or treatment. The pace of developing antiviral agents could be expedited by the availability of quick and efficient drug screening platforms. In this study, quantum dot (QD), an emerging probe for biological imaging and medical diagnostics, was employed to form complexes with virus and used as fluorescent imaging probes for exploring potential antiviral therapeutics. Inorganic CdSe/ZnS QDs synthesized in organic phase were encapsulated by amphiphilic alginate to attain biocompatible water-soluble QDs via phase transfer. Virus employed for this study was dengue virus which is a notorious one in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. To construct a QD\u2013virus imaging modality capable of providing meaningful information, preservation of viral infectivity after tagging virus with QDs is of utmost importance. In order to form colloidal complexes of QD\u2013virus, electrostatic repulsion force generated from both negatively charged virus and QDs was neutralized by various concentrations of cationic polybrene. Results showed that BHK-21 cells infected with dengue viruses incorporated with QDs exhibited bright fluorescence intracellularly within 30 min. To demonstrate the potency of QD\u2013virus complexes as bioprobes for screening antiviral agents, BHK-21 cells were incubated for one hour with allophycocyanin purified from blue-green algae and then infected with QD\u2013virus complexes. Based on the developed cell-based imaging assay, allophycocyanin with concentration of 125 \u03BCg/mL led to extremely weak intracellular fluorescence post-infection of QD\u2013virus complexes for 30 min. That is, the efficacy of anti-dengue viral activity of the algae extract was clearly illustrated by the inorganic\u2013organic hybrid platform constructed in current study.","publish_time":"2008-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Chung-Hao; Hsu, Yi-Shiou; Peng, Ching-An","journal":"Biosens Bioelectron","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126046.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566308004405; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566308004405","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs5OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus complexes","virus imaging modality capable","colloidal complexes of QD","potency of QD","ZnS QDs","biological imaging","biocompatible water-soluble QDs","screening antiviral agents","fluorescent imaging probes","weak intracellular fluorescence post-infection of QD","allophycocyanin","organic phase","dengue viruses","cells","BHK","current study","efficacy of anti-dengue viral activity","developed cell-based imaging assay","increasing threats of viral diseases","preservation of viral infectivity","potential antiviral therapeutics","algae extract","phase transfer","bright fluorescence","infectious diseases","Inorganic CdSe","organic hybrid platform","blue-green algae","efficient drug screening platforms","meaningful information","bioprobes","amphiphilic alginate","emerging probe","worldwide attention","availability of quick","medical diagnostics","electrostatic repulsion force","subtropical regions","effective prevention","various concentrations of cationic polybrene","recent years","quantum dot","\u03BCg","hour","order","utmost importance","treatment","Results","pace"],"language":"en"},

Anecdotal evidence suggests that PEDV is now endemic in this region, therefore genome information of circulating PEDV is important for molecular surveillance and evaluation of potential benefits of field vaccination. Here, we characterized PEDV infection on commercial Thai swine farms by screening 769 samples of feces and small intestinal contents from pigs with diarrhea between 2011 and 2016. Using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction targeting the spike (S) gene, 153 PEDV-positive samples were further subjected to analysis of the open reading frame 3 and nucleocapsid (N) genes. Comparison of 95 samples in which nucleotide sequencing was successfully obtained for all three genes revealed evolutionary diversity among the Thai PEDV strains. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that although some Thai strains changed little from years past, others resembled more closely to the recent strains reported in China. Interestingly, eight Thai PEDV strains possessed amino acid deletions in the N protein. The PEDV sequence divergence may be responsible for driving periodic outbreaks and continued persistence of PEDV on commercial swine farms. Our findings provide important insight into regional PEDV strains in circulation, which may assist future inclusions of suitable strains for future PEDV vaccines.","publish_time":"2019-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tuanthap, Supansa; Vongpunsawad, Sompong; Phupolphan, Cherdpong; Duang-in, Ausanee; Wattanaphansak, Suphot; Assavacheep, Pornchalit; Theamboonlers, Apiradee; Luengyosluechakul, Supol; Amonsin, Alongkorn; Poovorawan, Yong","journal":"PeerJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc8e81f5fd3efda044a42e965278d17c58bb4ea6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6499054.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31106060/; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.6843","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["Thailand","China"],"keyphrases":["Thai PEDV strains","PEDV infection","regional PEDV strains","PEDV-positive samples","Thai strains","future PEDV vaccines","continued persistence of PEDV","PEDV sequence divergence","genome information of circulating PEDV","recent strains","commercial Thai swine farms","commercial swine farms","future inclusions of suitable strains","pig farms","samples of feces","swine industry","genes","periodic outbreaks","important insight","N protein","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","molecular surveillance","screening","amino acid deletions","small intestinal contents","significant economic loss","spike","circulation","evaluation of potential benefits of field vaccination","reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction","pigs","analysis","nucleocapsid","open reading frame","evolutionary diversity","findings","nucleotide sequencing","Anecdotal evidence","Phylogenetic analyses","Comparison","China","years","Thailand","decade"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to investigate the prevalence rate of insomnia and to confirm the related social psychological factors among medical staff in hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHOD: Medical staff members in China were recruited, including frontline medical workers. The questionnaire, administered through the WeChat program, obtained demographic data and asked self-design questions related to the COVID-19 outbreak, insomnia/depressive/anxiety symptoms, and stress-related symptoms. We used a logistic regression analysis to examine the associations between sociodemographic factors and insomnia symptoms. RESULT: There were a total of 1,563 participants in our study. Five-hundred-and-sixty-four (36.1%) participants had insomnia symptoms according to the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (total score \u2265 8). A multiple binary logistic regression model revealed that insomnia symptoms were associated with an education level of high school or below (OR = 2.69, p = 0.042, 95% CI = 1.0\u20137.0), being a doctor (OR = 0.44, p = 0.007, 95% CI = 0.2\u20130.8), currently working in an isolation unit (OR = 1.71, p = 0.038, 95% CI = 1.0\u20132.8), is worried about being infected (OR = 2.30, p \u003C 0.001, 95% CI = 1.6\u20133.4), perceived lack of helpfulness in terms of psychological support from news or social media with regard to COVID-19 (OR = 2.10, p = 0.001, 95% CI = 1.3\u20133.3), and having very strong uncertainty regarding effective disease control (OR = 3.30, p = 0.013, 95% CI = 1.3\u20138.5). CONCLUSION: Our study found that more than one-third of the medical staff suffered insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak. The related factors included education level, an isolation environment, psychological worries about the COVID-19 outbreak, and being a doctor.

Here we applied household cohort study to determine the features of household transmission of COVID-19. METHODS: Total 105 index patients and 392 household contacts were enrolled. Both index patients and household members were inspected by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. The information of all recruited people was extracted from medical records and confirmed or supplemented by telephone interviews. The baseline characteristics of index cases and contact patients were described. Secondary attack rates of SARS-CoV-2 to the contact members were computed and the risk factors for transmission within household were estimated. RESULTS: Secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 developed in 64 of 392 household contacts (16.3%). The secondary attack rate to children was 4% comparing with 17.1% to adults. The secondary attack rate to the contacts within the households with index patients quarantined by themselves since onset of symptoms was 0% comparing with 16.9% to the contacts without index patients quarantined. The secondary attack rate to contacts who were spouses of index cases was 27.8% comparing with 17.3% to other adult members in the households. CONCLUSION: The secondary attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 in household is 16.3%. Ages of household contacts and spouse relationship with index case are risk factors for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within household. Quarantine of index patients at home since onset of symptom is useful to prevent the transmission of SARS-Co-2 within household.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Wei; Zhang, Bo; Lu, Jianhua; Liu, Shihua; Chang, Zhiqiang; Cao, Peng; Liu, Xinhua; Zhang, Peng; Ling, Yan; Tao, Kaixiong; Chen, Jianying","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dba2ef105f7601b1a285eb322070939028d0001d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32301964/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa450","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","household members","Secondary transmission of SARS","Ages of household contacts","secondary attack rate of SARS","Quarantine of index patients","Secondary attack rates of SARS","spouses of index cases","features of household transmission of COVID","contact patients","household cohort study","baseline characteristics of index cases","contact members","international cases","risk factors","adult members","households","onset of symptoms","spouse relationship","home","recruited people","medical records","virus","METHODS","children","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","RT-PCR","information","parts of China","countries","telephone interviews","BACKGROUND","adults"],"language":"en"},

These interactions have hindered the ability to distinguish the relative contributions of neutrophils, Th1 and Th17 cell-derived effector molecules from secondary mediators to tissue damage and morbidity. METHODS: Encephalitis induced by a gliatropic murine coronavirus was used as a model to assess the direct contributions of neutrophils, IFN-\u03B3 and IL-17 to virus-induced mortality. CNS inflammatory conditions were selectively manipulated by adoptive transfer of virus-primed wild-type (WT) or IFN-\u03B3 deficient (GKO) memory CD4(\u002B) T cells into infected SCID mice, coupled with antibody-mediated neutrophil depletion and cytokine blockade. RESULTS: Transfer of GKO memory CD4(\u002B) T cells into infected SCID mice induced rapid mortality compared to recipients of WT memory CD4(\u002B) T cells, despite similar virus control and demyelination. In contrast to recipients of WT CD4(\u002B) T cells, extensive neutrophil infiltration and IL-17 expression within the CNS in recipients of GKO CD4(\u002B) T cells provided a model to directly assess their contribution(s) to disease. Recipients of WT CD4(\u002B) T cells depleted of IFN-\u03B3 did not express IL-17 and were spared from mortality despite abundant CNS neutrophil infiltration, indicating that mortality was not mediated by excessive CNS neutrophil accumulation. By contrast, IL-17 depletion rescued recipients of GKO CD4(\u002B) T cells from rapid mortality without diminishing neutrophils or reducing GM-CSF, associated with pathogenic Th17 cells in CNS autoimmune models. Furthermore, co-transfer of WT and GKO CD4(\u002B) T cells prolonged survival in an IFN-\u03B3 dependent manner, although IL-17 transcription was not reduced. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that IL-17 mediates detrimental clinical consequences in an IFN-\u03B3-deprived environment, independent of extensive neutrophil accumulation or GM-CSF upregulation. The results also suggest that IFN-\u03B3 overrides the detrimental IL-17 effector responses via a mechanism downstream of transcriptional regulation.","publish_time":"2012-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Savarin, Carine; Stohlman, Stephen A; Hinton, David R; Ransohoff, Richard M; Cua, Daniel J; Bergmann, Cornelia C","journal":"J Neuroinflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/656d6bf0f5b0f360d55d5321e0c305eb6a12cbab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3419086.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22642802/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-2094-9-104","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","GKO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recipients of WT CD4","recipients of WT memory CD4","IFN-\u03B3 deficient","detrimental IL","T cells prolonged survival","Transfer of GKO memory CD4","express IL","depletion rescued recipients of GKO CD4","pathogenic Th17 cells","IFN-\u03B3 dependent manner","virus-induced mortality","neutrophil depletion","rapid mortality","abundant CNS neutrophil infiltration","excessive CNS neutrophil accumulation","CNS inflammatory disease","extensive neutrophil infiltration","co-transfer of WT","CNS inflammatory conditions","CNS autoimmune models","diminishing neutrophils","independent of extensive neutrophil accumulation","relative contributions of neutrophils","direct contributions of neutrophils","adoptive transfer of virus","infected SCID mice","contrast","RESULTS","GM-CSF upregulation","similar virus control","effector responses","Th17 cell-derived effector molecules","detrimental clinical consequences","secondary mediators","deprived environment","antibody","cross-regulatory factors","primed wild-type","expression","Encephalitis","negative feedback loops","damage","gliatropic murine coronavirus","mechanism","interplay","cytokine blockade","morbidity","ability","demyelination","transcriptional regulation","METHODS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","data","interactions"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We conducted an uncontrolled, non-comparative, observational study in a cohort of 80 relatively mildly infected inpatients treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin over a period of at least three days, with three main measurements: clinical outcome, contagiousness as assessed by PCR and culture, and length of stay in infectious disease unit (IDU). RESULTS: All patients improved clinically except one 86 year-old patient who died, and one 74 year-old patient still in intensive care. A rapid fall of nasopharyngeal viral load was noted, with 83% negative at Day7, and 93% at Day8. Virus cultures from patient respiratory samples were negative in 97.5% of patients at Day5. Consequently patients were able to be rapidly discharged from IDU with a mean length of stay of five days. CONCLUSION: We believe there is urgency to evaluate the effectiveness of this potentially-life saving therapeutic strategy at a larger scale, both to treat and cure patients at an early stage before irreversible severe respiratory complications take hold and to decrease duration of carriage and avoid the spread of the disease.

These topologies, in turn, possess unique characteristics that translate to specific therapeutic and diagnostic strategies within nanomedicine.","publish_time":"2010-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Campolongo, Michael J.; Tan, Shawn J.; Xu, Jianfeng; Luo, Dan","journal":"Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/35fd2c0808e2610d71581212993cfc81eb830919.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125827.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addr.2010.03.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20338202/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169409X10000736; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169409X10000736","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of DNA","rational design of DNA nanostructures","Abstract Nanomedicine","different polymeric topologies","drug delivery","molecular detection","diagnostics","gene regulation","new avenue","considerable attention","broad spectrum of fields","structural nanoscale material","protein production","unique characteristics","application of nanotechnology","gap","materials science","biological systems","diagnostic strategies","recent decades","functionality"],"language":"en"},

IFN-\u03B1 is first produced upon viral detection by pathogen recognition receptors. Following its expression, IFN-\u03B1 embarks upon a complex downstream signalling cascade called the JAK/STAT pathway. This signalling pathway results in the expression of hundreds of effector genes known as interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). These genes are the basis for an elaborate effector mechanism and ultimately, the clearance of viral infection. ISGs mark an elegant mechanism of anti-viral host defence that warrants renewed research focus in our global efforts to treat existing and emerging viruses. By understanding the mechanistic role of individual ISGs we anticipate the discovery of a new \u201Ctreasure trove\u201D of anti-viral mediators that may pave the way for more effective, targeted and less toxic anti-viral therapies. Therefore, with the aim of highlighting the value of the innate type 1 IFN response in our battle against viral infection, this review outlines both historic and recent advances in understanding the IFN-\u03B1 JAK/STAT pathway, with a focus on new research discoveries relating to specific ISGs and their potential role in curing existing and future emergent viral infections.","publish_time":"2017-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Raftery, Nicola; Stevenson, Nigel J.","journal":"Cell Mol Life Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30b49a6ee3d2088cb512ffda51671629cf691c46.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7079803.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-017-2520-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28432378/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JAK/STAT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral detection","anti-viral mediators","clearance of viral infection","IFN-\u03B1 JAK","potent anti-viral cytokine","toxic anti-viral therapies","IFN response","elegant mechanism of anti-viral host defence","future emergent viral infections","effector genes","specific ISGs","STAT pathway","interferon stimulated genes","signalling pathway results","mechanistic role of individual ISGs","renewed research focus","host immune response","new research discoveries","elaborate effector mechanism","potential role","expression of hundreds","Interferon-alpha","emerging viruses","complex downstream signalling cascade","global efforts","review outlines","treasure trove","battle","recent advances","discovery","innate type","value","pathogen recognition receptors","basis","aim"],"language":"en"},

In this study we demonstrate that the Q939\u2193S940 peptide bond, located between the polymerase and Zn-finger regions of pp1ab (the POL\u2193Zn site), is processed by the 3CLpro, albeit inefficiently. Mutagenesis of the POL\u2193Zn site, as well as the previously identified HD1\u21933C site in the 1a region of pp1a and pp1ab, demonstrated that the amino acid residues at the P2 and P1 positions of the cleavage site, occupied by L and Q, respectively, were important determinants of 3CLpro substrate specificity. Finally, a direct comparison of the 3CLpro-mediated cleavages at the HD1\u21933C and POL\u2193Zn sites was made by determining the rate constants using synthetic peptides. The results show that while a larger polypeptide substrate carrying the HD1\u21933C site was processed more efficiently than a polypeptide substrate carrying the POL\u2193Zn site, cleavage of the synthetic peptide substrates containing these two cleavage sites occurred at similar efficiencies. This indicates that the overall conformation of a large polyprotein substrate is important in the accessibility of the cleavage site to the proteinase.","publish_time":"1999-10-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pi\u00F1\u00F3n, Josefina D.; Teng, Henry; Weiss, Susan R.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ccc73dd3ffda06b6047e57064b44807fdad2412.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682299999543; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682299999543","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsyMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["C site","Zn sites","cleavage sites","CLpro substrate specificity","Zn-finger regions of pp1ab","larger polypeptide substrate","large polyprotein substrate","identified HD1","CLpro-mediated cleavages","proteinase","synthetic peptide substrates","MHV-A59","important determinants","synthetic peptides","region of pp1a","S940 peptide bond","replicase polyproteins pp1a","coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain A59","P2","P1 positions","place","polymerase","accessibility","amino acid residues","processing events","Q939","overall conformation","rate constants","majority","similar efficiencies","Mutagenesis","direct comparison","results","study"],"language":"en"},

Although coughing and sneezing have garnered much attention as potential, explosive sources of infectious aerosols, these are relatively rare events during daily life, whereas breathing is necessary for life and is performed continuously. Real-time shadowgraph imaging was used to visualise and capture high-speed images of healthy volunteers sneezing and breathing (through the nose \u2013 nasally, and through the mouth - orally). Six volunteers, who were able to respond to the pepper sneeze stimulus, were recruited for the sneezing experiments (2 women: 27.5\u00B16.36 years; 4 men: 29.25\u00B110.53 years). The maximum visible distance over which the sneeze plumes (or puffs) travelled was 0.6 m, the maximum sneeze velocity derived from these measured distances was 4.5 m/s. The maximum 2-dimensional (2-D) area of dissemination of these sneezes was 0.2 m(2). The corresponding derived parameter, the maximum 2-D area expansion rate of these sneezes was 2 m(2)/s.

This new microfluidic system integrates one-way micropumps, a four-membrane-type micromixer, two-way micropumps and an on-chip microcoil array in order to simultaneously perform the rapid detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM). An IgM/IgG titer in serum is used to confirm the presence of dengue virus infection. By utilizing microfluidic technologies and virus-bound magnetic beads, IgG and IgM in the serum samples are captured. This is followed by purification and isolation of these beads utilizing a magnetic field generated from the on-chip array of microcoils. Any interfering substances in the biological fluids are washed away automatically by the flow generated by the integrated pneumatic pumps. The fluorescence-labelled secondary antibodies are bound to the surface of the IgG/IgM complex attached onto the magnetic beads. Finally, the entire magnetic complex sandwich is transported automatically into a sample detection chamber. The optical signals are then measured and analyzed by a real-time optical detection module. The entire process is performed automatically on a single chip within 30 min, which is only 1/8th of the time required for a traditional method. More importantly, the detection limit has been improved to 21 pg, which is about 38 times better when compared to traditional methods.

The mechanism of nuclear translocation, and whether N protein associates with particular nucleolar components, is unknown. In this study, we confirm that a nucleolar phosphoprotein nucleophosmin (NPM1) interacts and co-localizes with the N protein in the nucleolus. In vitro binding studies indicated that aa 148\u2013294 of N and aa 118\u2013188 of NPM1 were required for binding. Interestingly, N protein importation into the nucleolus is independent of the ability of NPM1 to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Furthermore, overexpression of NPM1 promoted PEDV growth, while knockdown of NPM1 suppressed PEDV growth. In addition, binding of N protein to NPM1 protects it from proteolytic degradation by caspase-3, leading to increased cell survival. Taken together, our studies demonstrate a specific interaction of the N protein with the host cell protein NPM1 in the nucleolus. The results suggest potential linkages among viral strategies for the regulation of cell survival activities, possibly through an interaction of N protein with NPM1 which prevents its proteolytic cleavage and enhances cell survival, thus ultimately promoting the replication of PEDV.","publish_time":"2017-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Da; Shi, Hongyan; Sun, Dongbo; Chen, Jianfei; Zhang, Xin; Wang, Xiaobo; Zhang, Jialin; Ji, Zhaoyang; Liu, Jianbo; Cao, Liyan; Zhu, Xiangdong; Yuan, Jing; Dong, Hui; Wang, Xin; Chang, Tiecheng; Liu, Ye; Feng, Li","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/76260c67421abbf69da3c4b0c75204190188a2cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5206633.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep39700; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28045037/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsyNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["binding of N protein","interaction of N protein","N protein associates","N protein importation","host cell protein NPM1","knockdown of NPM1","ability of NPM1","overexpression of NPM1","nucleolus","PEDV growth","increased cell survival","replication of PEDV","binding studies","regulation of cell survival activities","proteolytic cleavage","specific interaction","proteolytic degradation","particular nucleolar components","nucleolar phosphoprotein nucleophosmin","cytoplasm of infected cells","replicates","viral strategies","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","potential linkages","results","shuttle","nucleocapsid","mechanism of nuclear translocation","caspase","nucleus","addition","study"],"language":"en"},

However, the disease burden has sharply declined and epidemic areas have shrunk after the implementation of an integrated malaria control and elimination strategy, especially since 2000. In this review, the lessons were distilled from the Chinese national malaria elimination programme and further efforts to mitigate the challenges of malaria resurgence are being discussed. METHODS: A retrospective evaluation was performed to assess the changes in malaria epidemic patterns from 1950 to 2017 at national level. The malaria data before 2004 were collected from paper-based annual reports. After 2004, each of the different cases from the Infectious Diseases Information Reporting Management System (IDIRMS) was closely examined and scrutinized. An additional documenting system, the National Information Management System for Malaria, established in 2012 to document the interventions of three parasitic diseases, was also examined to complete the missing data from IDIRMS. RESULTS: From 1950 to 2017, the occurrence of indigenous malaria has been steeply reduced, and malaria-epidemic regions have substantially shrunk, especially after the launch of the national malaria elimination programme. There were approximately 30 million malaria cases annually before 1949 with a mortality rate of 1%. A total of 5999 indigenous cases were documented from 2010 to 2016, with a drastic reduction of 99% over the 6 years (2010, n = 4262; 2016, n = 3). There were indigenous cases reported in 303 counties from 18 provinces in 2010, but only 3 indigenous cases were reported in 2 provinces nationwide in 2016. While in 2017, for the first time, zero indigenous case was reported in China, and only 7 of imported cases were in individuals who died of Plasmodium falciparum infection. CONCLUSION: Malaria elimination in China is a country-led and country-owned endeavour. The country-own efforts were a clear national elimination strategy, supported by two systems, namely a case-based surveillance and response system and reference laboratory system. The country-led efforts were regional and inter-sectoral collaboration as well as sustained monitoring and evaluation. However, there are still some challenges, such as the maintenance of non-transmission status, the implementation of a qualified verification and assessment system, and the management of imported cases in border areas, through regional cooperation. The findings from this review can probably help improving malaria surveillance systems in China, but also in other elimination countries.

Air samples indoor, upwind (10 and 50 m), and downwind (10, 50, 100, 200, and 400 m) of four chicken houses were collected using Andersen\u20106 stages sampler. The concentrations of S. aureus were determined for every sample site. Isolation of S. aureus from chicken feces was performed according to the standard method. The genetic relationship among the isolates was determined by profiles of PCR\u2010amplified repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP\u2010PCR) elements. The results showed that the concentrations of S. aureus indoor of four chicken houses were higher than those upwind and downwind sites (P \u003C 0.05 or P \u003C 0.01), but there were no significant concentration differences among downwind sites (P \u003E 0.05). The fingerprints and the phylogenetic tree indicated that a part of the S. aureus (55.6%, 10/18) isolates from indoor air had the same REP\u2010PCR fingerprints as feces isolates. Consequently, most isolates (57.1%, 20/35) from downwind 10, 50, 100, 200, even 400 m had the same REP\u2010PCR fingerprints as those from indoor or feces. These data indicated that some isolates from downwind and indoor originated from the chicken feces. However, those isolates from upwind had low similarity (similarity index 0.6\u20130.87) to those from indoor or feces. Therefore, the isolates upwind were not from the chicken feces or indoor. These results suggest that microbes in chicken feces can be aerosolized and spread indoor and outdoor, especially to downwind of the chicken houses. It should have an important epidemiological and public health significance. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Thus, the use of S. aureus as an indicator to study the origin and spread of airborne pathogens from chicken houses is potentially useful for enhancing public health and understanding the airborne epidemiology of this pathogen. Meanwhile it can provide evidence for studying the spreading model of airborne pathogens.","publish_time":"2009-07-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhong, Z.; Chai, T.; Duan, H.; Miao, Z.; Li, X.; Yao, M.; Yuan, W.; Wang, W.; Li, Q.; Zucker, B.\u2010A.; Schlenker, G.","journal":"Indoor Air","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c9c5807840403c132be45b29a83f60739f08871.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7201891.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19840144/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0668.2009.00618.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsyOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. aureus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chicken feces","chicken houses","aureus indoor","feces isolates","indoor air","downwind sites","Air samples indoor","PCR fingerprints","Abstract Staphylococcus aureus","profiles of PCR","airborne epidemiology","origin","indicator","results","concentrations","spreading model of airborne pathogens","public health significance","low similarity","similarity index","repetitive extragenic palindromic","significant concentration differences","Andersen","microbial aerosol","elements","microbes","Isolation","PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS","stages sampler","evidence","phylogenetic tree","sample site","genetic relationship","data","standard method"],"language":"en"},

Compared with the influenza group, the COVID-19 group was more likely to have rounded opacities (35% vs. 17%, p = 0.048) and interlobular septal thickening (66% vs. 43%, p = 0.014), but less likely to have nodules (28% vs. 71%, p \u003C 0.001), tree-in-bud sign (9% vs. 40%, p \u003C 0.001), and pleural effusion (6% vs. 31%, p \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in the CT manifestations of patients with COVID-19 and influenza. Presence of rounded opacities and interlobular septal thickening, with the absence of nodules and tree-in-bud sign, and with the typical peripheral distribution, may help us differentiate COVID-19 from influenza. KEY POINTS: \u2022 Typical CT features of COVID-19 include pure ground-glass opacities (GGO), GGO with consolidation, rounded opacities, bronchiolar wall thickening, interlobular septal thickening, and a peripheral distribution. \u2022 Presence of rounded opacities and interlobular septal thickening, with the absence of nodules and tree-in-bud sign, and with the typical peripheral distribution, may help us differentiate COVID-19 from influenza.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Mengqi; Zeng, Wenbin; Wen, Yun; Zheng, Yineng; Lv, Fajin; Xiao, Kaihu","journal":"Eur Radiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f86d7b7efeaa0d113a9b0cfe8908ea625239ed67.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7216854.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-06928-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32399710/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjszNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["interlobular septal thickening","Typical CT features of COVID","Presence of rounded opacities","chest CT characteristics of COVID","influenza group","common symptoms of COVID","linear opacities","CT manifestations of patients","GGO","bronchiolar wall thickening","typical peripheral distribution","pure ground-glass opacities","section CT","common CT features","chest CT findings","tree","bud sign","absence of nodules","mixed distribution","peripheral regions","consolidation","pneumonia","women","years","clinical data","significant differences","radiological differences","total","lung","KEY POINTS","METHODS","fever","MATERIALS","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","pleural effusion","Wuhan contact","cough","OBJECTIVES","study"],"language":"en"},

FMDV was less frequently detected in laryngeal mucosal tissues, oropharyngeal mucosal sites, and lymph nodes draining the pharynx. Immunomicroscopy indicated that within persistently infected mucosal tissues, FMDV antigens were rarely detectable within few epithelial cells in regions of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). Transcriptome analysis of persistently infected pharyngeal tissues by qRT-PCR for 14 cytokine genes indicated a general trend of decreased mRNA levels compared to uninfected control animals. Although, statistically significant differences were not observed, greatest suppression of relative expression (RE) was identified for IP-10 (RE = 0.198), IFN-\u03B2 (RE = 0.269), IL-12 (RE = 0.275), and IL-2 (RE = 0.312). Increased relative expression was detected for IL-6 (RE = 2.065). Overall, this data demonstrates that during the FMDV carrier state in cattle, viral persistence is associated with epithelial cells of the nasopharynx in the upper respiratory tract and decreased levels of mRNA for several immunoregulatory cytokines in the infected tissues.","publish_time":"2015-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pacheco, Juan M.; Smoliga, George R.; O\u2019Donnell, Vivian; Brito, Barbara P.; Stenfeldt, Carolina; Rodriguez, Luis L.; Arzt, Jonathan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9410459142b63fb34eac0375dda7d9b6460b3fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4440813.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25996935/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0125698","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjszNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FMDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected tissues","infected mucosal tissues","infected pharyngeal tissues","FMDV antigens","FMDV serotype","laryngeal mucosal tissues","FMDV carrier state","tissue-specific localization of FMDV","decreased levels of mRNA","oropharyngeal mucosal sites","Transcriptome analysis","epithelial cells","dorsal nasopharynx","cattle","selected immunoregulatory cytokines","general trend of decreased mRNA levels","viral persistence","lymphoid tissue","greatest suppression of relative expression","highest prevalence of overall viral detection","partial transcriptome profiles","distinct anatomic sites","dorsal soft palate","regions of mucosa","upper respiratory tract","qRT-PCR","cytokine genes","foot","SAT2","lymph nodes","steers","uninfected control animals","mouth disease virus","MALT","post-mortem","significant differences","data","Immunomicroscopy","IFN-\u03B2"],"language":"en"},

The present study aimed to identify the protective role of apocynin in ER stress-mediated EC apoptosis and the underlying mechanisms. We found that ER stress resulted in a significant increase in c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation, and elicited caspase 3 cleavage and apoptosis. However, apocynin obviously attenuated EC apoptosis and this effect was partly dependent on ER stress sensor inositol-requiring enzyme 1\u03B1 (IRE1\u03B1). Importantly, apocynin upregulated IRE1\u03B1 expression in both protein and mRNA levels and promoted the pro-survival XBP1 splicing.

On the other hand, Arbidol, an antiviral agent has been used safely and effectively in the past two decades to prevent and cure all types of influenza and flu. Therefore, the combination of both in a single dosage to further increase CD4 lymphocytes and interferon gamma (IFN-\u03B3) could be a better choice for treatment of viral infections.

Chinese Medicines (CMs) had been used to treat and prevent viral infection pneumonia diseases for thousands of years and had accumulated a large number of clinical experiences and effective prescriptions. AIM OF THE STUDY: : This research aimed to systematically excavate the classical prescriptions of Chinese Medicine (CM), which have been used to prevent and treat Pestilence (Wenbing, Wenyi, Shiyi or Yibing) for long history in China, to obtain the potential prescriptions and ingredients to alternatively treat COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed the screening system based on data mining, molecular docking and network pharmacology. Data mining and association network were used to mine the high-frequency herbs and formulas from ancient prescriptions. Virtual screening for the effective components of high frequency CMs and compatibility Chinese Medicine was explored by a molecular docking approach. Furthermore, network pharmacology method was used to preliminarily uncover the molecule mechanism. RESULTS: 574 prescriptions were obtained from 96,606 classical prescriptions with the key words to treat \u201CWarm diseases (Wenbing)\u201D, \u201CPestilence (Wenyi or Yibing)\u201D or \u201CEpidemic diseases (Shiyi)\u201D. Meanwhile, 40 kinds of CMs, 36 CMs-pairs, 6 triple-CMs-groups existed with high frequency among the 574 prescriptions. Additionally, the key targets of SARS-COV-2, namely 3CL hydrolase (Mpro) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2), were used to dock the main ingredients from the 40 kinds by the LigandFitDock method. A total of 66 compounds components with higher frequency were docked with the COVID-19 targets, which were distributed in 26 kinds of CMs, among which Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma), HuangQin (Scutellariae Radix), Dahuang (Rhei Radix Et Rhizome) and Chaihu (Bupleuri Radix) contain more potential compounds. Network pharmacology results showed that Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma) and HuangQin (Scutellariae Radix) CMs-pairs could also interact with the targets involving in immune and inflammation diseases. CONCLUSIONS: These results we obtained probably provided potential candidate CMs formulas or active ingredients to overcome COVID-19. Prospectively, animal experiment and rigorous clinic studies are needed to confirm the potential preventive and treat effect of these CMs and compounds.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ren, Xia; Shao, Xin-Xin; Li, Xiu-Xue; Jia, Xin-Hua; Song, Tao; Zhou, Wu-Yi; Wang, Peng; Li, Yang; Wang, Xiao-Long; Cui, Qing-Hua; Qiu, Pei-Ju; Zhao, Yan-Gang; Li, Xue-Bo; Zhang, Feng-Cong; Li, Zhen-Yang; Zhong, Yue; Wang, Zhen-Guo; Fu, Xian-Jun","journal":"J Ethnopharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b045e751b69d92a236fe3ed62074c0ff6c614c9e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7196535.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874120314409; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2020.112932; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874120314409?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376368/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs0NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["kinds of CMs","CMs-pairs","potential prescriptions","triple-CMs","effective prescriptions","Scutellariae Radix","effective components of high frequency CMs","potential candidate CMs formulas","classical prescriptions of Chinese Medicine","ancient prescriptions","Bupleuri Radix","potential compounds","Network pharmacology results","Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma","network pharmacology method","COVID","Rhei Radix Et Rhizome","high-frequency herbs","compatibility Chinese Medicine","Traditional Chinese Medicine","higher frequency","compounds components","Warm diseases","inflammation diseases","Epidemic diseases","potential preventive","Chinese Medicines","association network","HuangQin","Gancao","Yibing","data mining","active ingredients","Shiyi","Wenbing","molecular docking approach","key targets of SARS","main ingredients","Pestilence","Wenyi","viral infection pneumonia diseases","screening system","key words","Virtual screening","LigandFitDock method","Dahuang","Chaihu","thousands of years","large number of clinical experiences","China","rigorous clinic studies","angiotensin","animal experiment","long history","ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE","groups","Mpro","enzyme","METHODS","total","TCM","STUDY","hydrolase","ACE2","research","molecule mechanism","AIM","MATERIALS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

All the subtypes were categorized by their isolated regions, including Asia, Europe, and Africa, and most of the synonymous codon usage patterns were analyzed by correspondence analysis (CA). As a result, influenza A virus showed the lowest synonymous codon usage bias among the virus species of the orthomyxoviridae family, and influenza B and influenza C virus were followed, while suggesting that influenza A virus might have an advantage in transmitting across the species barrier due to their low codon usage bias. The ENC values of the host-specific HA and NA genes represented their different HA and NA types very well, and this reveals that each influenza A virus subtype uses different codon usage patterns as well as the amino acid compositions. In NP, PA and PB2 genes, most of the virus subtypes showed similar RSCU patterns except for H5N1 and H3N2 (A/HK/1774/1999) subtypes which were suspected to be transmitted across the species barrier, from avian and porcine species to human beings, respectively. This distinguishable synonymous codon usage patterns in non-human origin viruses might be useful in determining the origin of influenza A viruses in genomic levels as well as the serological tests. In this study, all the process, including extracting sequences from GenBank flat file and calculating codon usage values, was conducted by Java codes, and these bioinformatics-related methods may be useful in predicting the evolutionary patterns of pandemic viruses.","publish_time":"2006-07-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahn, Insung; Jeong, Byeong-Jin; Bae, Se-Eun; Jung, Jin; Son, Hyeon S.","journal":"Eur J Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/194412ed698eaea5c13e0cf9bc7a0b34d2855cc3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088104/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozk3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NA","PA"],"locations":["Asia","Europe"],"keyphrases":["virus species","virus subtypes","subtypes of influenza","codon usage values","influenza C virus","different codon usage patterns","distinguishable synonymous codon usage patterns","origin of influenza","low codon usage bias","lowest synonymous codon usage bias","overall relative synonymous codon usage","influenza B","species barrier","porcine species","genomic analysis","similar RSCU patterns","evolutionary patterns of pandemic viruses","correspondence analysis","non-human origin viruses","different HA","NA genes","orthomyxoviridae family","intensive pattern analysis","H3N2","H5N1","human beings","human population","study","PB2 genes","NA types","ENC values","genomic levels","isolated regions","host-specific HA","GenBank flat file","extracting sequences","H2N2","H1N1","advantage","Asia","Europe","process","bioinformatics-related methods","Java codes","steps","reveals","transmitting","NP","Africa","amino acid compositions","HK","serological tests","result"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, we carried out clinical, pathological, and molecular investigations of MP-induced MRM in a rat colony. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two female Wistar rats were observed to be diseased in animal facility of NISER, Bhubaneswar, and were kept in isolation for further investigation. Both the animals were found to be positive for MP after serological and molecular tests. Thereafter, whole rat colony comprising of 36 animals was segregated based on clinical symptoms and further sampled for histopathological, serological, and molecular investigations. Tracheal washing and infected lung tissue were collected during necropsy examination for DNA extraction. Molecular diagnosis was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay using species-specific primers. RESULT:: Classical symptoms of MP-associated respiratory tract infection were observed in only 2 of 36 infected animals, and most of the animals were found asymptomatic to the disease; however, all the animals were found to be carrier after necropsy and PCR assay. Gross and histopathological finding suggested severe congestion of the lungs along with suppurative and necrotizing pneumonia. The disease is confirmed by molecular diagnosis using species-specific primers in PCR assay. CONCLUSION: MRM may go undiagnosed due to asymptomatic nature.

And to offer fundamental materials for making improvements in current surveillance system was our purpose. METHODS: A study was conducted by reviewing the number of cases reported as acute diarrheal syndrome (mass type) from the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention between June, 2002 and July, 2008. And the data were compared with the number of mass food poisoning cases during the same period, reported from the Korea Food and Drug Administration. The difference between two groups was measured and their transitions were compared. RESULTS: The emergency department syndromic surveillance system\u0027s reports of the numbers of acute diarrheal syndrome (mass type) cases were different from the transition of mass food poisonings, reported by the Korea Food and Drug Administration. Their reports were not accurate and they could not follow the trends of increase in mass food poisonings since 2002. CONCLUSIONS: Current problems in the emergency department syndromic surveillance system in Korea are mostly related to inaccuracies of daily data reporting system. Manual data input by the reporters could play a big role in such inaccuracies. There need to be improvements in the ways of reporting data, such as automated information transport system linking electronic medical record.","publish_time":"2010-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahn, Shin; Lee, Jae Ho; Kim, Won; Lim, Kyung Soo","journal":"Healthc Inform Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/724a937a58d4217e5d5cc6d1d1e438a5b5b35d6e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3089857.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21818437/; https://doi.org/10.4258/hir.2010.16.3.177","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Center for Disease Control","Korea Food and Drug Administration"],"locations":["Korea"],"keyphrases":["Korea Food","mass type","emergency department syndromic surveillance system of Korea","transition of mass food poisonings","current surveillance system","number of mass food poisoning cases","inaccuracies of daily data reporting system","ways of reporting data","reporting of acute diarrheal syndrome","Drug Administration","emergency department syndromic surveillance system\u0027s reports","Manual data input","numbers of acute diarrheal syndrome","number of cases","automated information transport system","improvements","study","Current problems","detection","Korean Center","electronic medical record","reporters","period","Disease Control","Prevention","trends of increase","RESULTS","fundamental materials","big role","CONCLUSIONS","purpose","groups","difference","transitions","OBJECTIVES","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms for controlling memory T cell responses remain incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the role of respiratory macrophage (M\u03A6) in regulating CD4 T cell responses to recombinant adenovirus-based (rAd) vaccines. We demonstrated that rAd intranasal (i.n.) vaccination induced migration and accumulation of respiratory M\u03A6 and circulatory monocytes in the mediastinal lymph nodes and lung parenchyma. Under the influence of respiratory M\u03A6 CD4 T cells exhibited slow proliferation kinetics and an increased tendency of generating central memory, as opposed to effector memory, CD4 T cell responses in vitro and in vivo. Correspondingly, depletion of M\u03A6 using clodronate-containing liposome prior to i.n. immunization significantly enhanced CD4 T cell proliferation and increased the frequency of CD4 memory T cells in the airway lumen, demonstrating that M\u03A6 initially serve as a negative regulator in limiting generation of mucosal tissue-resident memory CD4 T cells. However, clodronate-containing liposome delivery following i.n. immunization markedly reduced the frequencies of memory CD4 T cells in the airway lumen and spleen, indicating that respiratory M\u03A6 and potentially circulating monocytes are critically required for maintaining long-term memory CD4 T cells. Collectively, our data demonstrate that rAd-induced mucosal CD4 T memory responses are regulated by respiratory M\u03A6 and/or monocytes at multiple stages.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Acosta-Ramirez, Elizabeth; Tram, Cynthia; Kampen, Rachel M.; Tillman, Melanie R.; Schwendener, Reto A.; Xing, Zhou; Halperin, Scott A.; Wang, Jun","journal":"Cellular Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b86ce9136c661b5bcd18f7cd529595c0e482719.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094387.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0008874916300557; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008874916300557; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cellimm.2016.07.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27425590/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mucosal CD4 T memory responses","CD4 T cell responses","memory T cell responses","frequency of CD4 memory T cells","long-term memory CD4 T cells","frequencies of memory CD4 T cells","influence of respiratory M\u03A6 CD4 T cells","enhanced CD4 T cell proliferation","effector memory","central memory","generation of mucosal tissue-resident memory CD4 T cells","accumulation of respiratory M\u03A6","mucosal protective memory responses","depletion of M\u03A6","Abstract Respiratory immunization","role of respiratory macrophage","airway lumen","circulatory monocytes","clodronate","increased tendency","liposome delivery","slow proliferation kinetics","attractive way","mediastinal lymph nodes","recombinant adenovirus","cellular mechanisms","vaccination","migration","spleen","negative regulator","lung parenchyma","multiple stages","mucosally transmitted infections","vaccines","data","study"],"language":"en"},

These harbor the viral replication complexes (RC) that synthesize viral RNA. Alphaviruses have four replicase or nonstructural proteins (nsPs), nsP1\u20134, expressed as polyprotein P1234. An early RC, which synthesizes minus-strand RNA, is formed by the polyprotein P123 and the polymerase nsP4. Further proteolytic cleavage results in a late RC consisting of nsP1\u20134 and synthesizing plus strands. Here, we show that only the late RCs are highly active in RNA synthesis in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that active RCs can be isolated from both virus-infected cells and cells transfected with the wild-type replicase in combination with a plasmid expressing a template RNA. When an uncleavable polyprotein P123 and polymerase nsP4 were expressed together with a template, high levels of minus-strand RNA were produced in cells, but RCs isolated from these cells were hardly active in vitro. Furthermore, we observed that the uncleavable polyprotein P123 and polymerase nsP4, which have previously been shown to form spherules even in the absence of the template, did not replicate an exogenous template. Consequently, we hypothesize that the replicase proteins were sequestered in spherules and were no longer able to recruit a template.","publish_time":"2017-10-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pietil\u00E4, Maija K.; Albulescu, Irina C.; van Hemert, Martijn J.; Ahola, Tero","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/792fa8ba0747cfa42ffa4247f036bc214e944185.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5691643.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v9100292; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28991178/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["template RNA","strand RNA","viral RNA","polymerase nsP4","uncleavable polyprotein P123","host cells","spherules","RNA synthesis","active RCs","exogenous template","virus-infected cells","replicase proteins","late RCs","polyprotein P1234","nsP1","early RC","wild-type replicase","nonstructural proteins","high levels of minus","Semliki Forest virus","viral replication complexes","membrane invaginations","combination","plasmid","SFV","arthropod","proteolytic cleavage results","nsPs","Alphaviruses","absence","strands"],"language":"en"},

Our results showed that: (i) deletion of 18aa from the C-terminus enhanced the S protein accumulation and virus entry, which might be due to the deletion of intracellular retention signals; (ii) further deletion to residue 29 also enhanced the amount of S protein on the cell surface and in virion, but reduced virus entry by 25%, suggesting that residues 19\u201329 contributes to membrane fusion; (iii) a 29aa-deletion mutant had a defect in anchoring on the plasma membrane, which led to a dramatic decrease of S protein in virion and virus entry; (iv) a total of 15 residues (Y498, V499, V531, G534, G537, D538, S540, G575, S576, E582, W585, Y590, T591, V593 and G594) within RBD were important for receptor binding and virus entry. They probably form three receptor binding motifs, and the third motif is conserved between NL63 and SARS-CoV.","publish_time":"2011-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Han-Xin; Feng, Yan; Tu, Xinming; Zhao, Xuesen; Hsieh, Chih-Heng; Griffin, Lauren; Junop, Murray; Zhang, Chengsheng","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf500c9cbe8d702be5d0a459ae1136c9bbffc114.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114368.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016817021100253X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016817021100253X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21798295/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2011.06.029","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsxMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["RBD"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S protein accumulation","pseudotype virus entry","reduced virus entry","RBD","receptor-binding domain","receptor binding motifs","receptor hACE2","dramatic decrease of S protein","entry-efficient S gene template","residues important","protein of human coronavirus NL63","aa-deletion mutant","series of cytoplasmic tail deletion","membrane fusion","virion","HCoV-NL63","plasma membrane","deletion of intracellular retention signals","hACE2 association","cell surface","cell attachment","pool of gene variants","single residue substitution mutants","Y590","W585","E582","G534","G537","S576","G575","S540","D538","V531","defect","T591","Y498","V499","V593","G594","anchoring","C-terminus","roles","backbone","total","spike","SARS-CoV","purposes","results"],"language":"en"},

In humans IFNL4 open reading frame is truncated by a polymorphic frame-shift insertion that eliminates IFN-\u03BB4 and turns IFNL4 into a polymorphic pseudogene. Functional IFN-\u03BB4 has antiviral activity but the elimination of IFN-\u03BB4 through pseudogenization is strongly associated with improved clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We show that functional IFN-\u03BB4 is conserved and evolutionarily constrained in mammals and thus functionally relevant. However, the pseudogene has reached moderately high frequency in Africa, America, and Europe, and near fixation in East Asia. In fact, the pseudogenizing variant is among the 0.8% most differentiated SNPs between Africa and East Asia genome-wide. Its raise in frequency is associated with additional evidence of positive selection, which is strongest in East Asia, where this variant falls in the 0.5% tail of SNPs with strongest signatures of recent positive selection genome-wide. Using a new Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach we infer that the pseudogenizing allele appeared just before the out-of-Africa migration and was immediately targeted by moderate positive selection; selection subsequently strengthened in European and Asian populations resulting in the high frequency observed today. This provides evidence for a changing adaptive process that, by favoring IFN-\u03BB4 inactivation, has shaped present-day phenotypic diversity and susceptibility to disease.","publish_time":"2014-10-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Key, Felix M.; Peter, Benjamin; Dennis, Megan Y.; Huerta-S\u00E1nchez, Emilia; Tang, Wei; Prokunina-Olsson, Ludmila; Nielsen, Rasmus; Andr\u00E9s, Aida M.","journal":"PLoS Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7cf7b575364a3a2b53035c0a271feae87d693b73.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b2acd23850d855ae1d4a6da8e0982b859777d11d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/30cf335327921bae888ad3d26a5864a8f4fb442e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a4f846f6e4d7efc8bfa7e67773a24aa03edb2549.json; document_parses/pdf_json/825c7de9d670f6f1100dab9071635dec57167e06.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4199494.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25329461/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004681","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsxNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ABC"],"locations":["Africa","East Asia","Europe"],"keyphrases":["Functional IFN-\u03BB4","IFN-\u03BB4 inactivation","elimination of IFN","IFN-\u03BB family","moderate positive selection","additional evidence of positive selection","East Asia genome-wide","high frequency","strongest signatures of recent positive selection genome-wide","antiviral activity","Africa migration","polymorphic pseudogene","pseudogenizing variant","humans IFNL4 open reading frame","tail of SNPs","new member","polymorphic frame-shift insertion","differentiated SNPs","variant falls","pseudogenizing allele","new Approximate Bayesian Computation","approach","improved clearance of hepatitis C virus","present-day phenotypic diversity","HCV","ABC","pseudogenization","Asian populations","susceptibility","disease","infection","Europe","America","changing adaptive process","Interferon lambda","fixation","raise","fact","mammals"],"language":"en"},

We tested two single nucleotide polymorphisms with a panel of 43 variola virus strains, collected over 40 years from countries across the world, and have shown that they provide reliable markers for variola virus identification.

We evaluated the frequency of viral testing, virus prevalence, risk factors and treatment coverage with oseltamivir in patients admitted for CAP. Methods Secondary analysis of GLIMP, an international, multicenter, point-prevalence study of hospitalized adults with CAP. Testing frequency, prevalence of viral CAP and treatment with oseltamivir were assessed among patients who underwent a viral swab. Univariate and multivariate analysis was used to evaluate risk factors. Results 553 (14.9%) patients with CAP underwent nasal swab. Viral CAP was diagnosed in 157 (28.4%) patients. Influenza virus was isolated in 80.9% of cases. Testing frequency and viral CAP prevalence were inhomogeneous across the participating centers. Obesity (OR 1.59, 95%CI: 1.01\u20132.48; p = 0.043) and need for invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 1.62, 95%CI: 1.02\u20132.56; p = 0.040) were independently associated with viral CAP.

The biosynthesis of S and M was analyzed in the presence of tunicamycin and monensin. The effect of treatment with endoglycosidases H and F and glycopeptidase F on the precursors and mature forms of S and M were also examined. Species 175K and 29K were characterized as high mannose forms of S and M, respectively, and species 220K and 30\u201336K as complex type glycosylated forms of these two proteins. M was present mainly as a 29K species in mature virions whereas the 175K form of S was not detected, thus implying that the two proteins undergo Golgi modifications at a far different efficiency. Anti-S and -M monoclonal antibodies were examined for their reactivity towards polypeptide species either treated with endo H or produced in the presence of tunicamycin. It was found that (i) among the four major antigenic sites previously defined (Delmas et al., 1986), only site C (amino acids 363 to 371) was notably expressed by the unglycosylated S polypeptide 155K, whereas the three other sites were dependent upon core-glycosylation, (ii) three of the four anti-M mAbs tested did not recognize the unglycosylated M polypeptide 26K. These data led us to conclude that co-translational, but not terminal glycosylation is an essential requirement for both acquisition and maintenance of the antigenicity of TGEV glycoproteins.","publish_time":"1991-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Delmas, Bernard; Laude, Hubert","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6749dcd4dcc8744eb090dde2f009a268596f6dbd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168170291901033; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0168170291901033","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsyMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Anti-S","mature forms of S","form of S","unglycosylated S polypeptide","biosynthesis of S","polypeptide species","high mannose forms of S","presence of tunicamycin","antigenicity of TGEV glycoproteins","glycopeptidase F","endoglycosidases H","endo H","terminal glycosylation","coronavirus TGEV","core-glycosylation","different stages","complex type glycosylated forms","mature virions","different efficiency","major antigenic sites","maintenance","precursors","essential requirement","acquisition","Delmas","Golgi modifications","immunoreactivity","monoclonal antibodies","effect of treatment","site C","amino acids","carbohydrate composition","maturation","monensin","mAbs","data"],"language":"en"},

The interactions between the F and HN, H or G viral glycoproteins and host molecules are critical in determining host range, virulence and spread of these viruses. Recently, atomic structures, together with biochemical and biophysical studies, have provided major insights into how these two viral glycoproteins successfully interact with host receptors on cellular membranes and initiate the membrane fusion process to gain entry into cells.

Viruses are known to be responsible for a considerable proportion of ARIs in children. This study was undertaken to know the viral aetiology of wheezing among the children less than five years of age, admitted to a tertiary care hospital in eastern India. METHODS: Seventy five children, under the age of five years admitted with wheezing, were included in the study. Throat and nasal swabs were collected, and real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was used to screen for influenza 1 and 2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1, 2, 3 and 4, rhinovirus, human meta-pneumovirus, bocavirus (HBoV), Coronavirus, adenovirus, Enterovirus and Parechovirus. RESULTS: The total viral detection rate was 28.57 per cent. Viral RNA markers were detected from children diagnosed to be having pneumonia (3 cases), bronchiolitis (9 cases), episodic wheeze (2 cases) and multitrigger wheeze (6 cases). RSV was the most common virus (35%) followed by PIV1, 2 and 3 (20%), HBoV (10%) and rhinovirus (5%). However, mixed infection was observed in 30 per cent of cases. INTERPRETATION \u0026 CONCLUSIONS: The study reported the presence of respiratory viral agents in 28.57 per cent of children with wheezing; RSV and PIV were most common, accounting to 55 per cent of the total cases. Mixed infection was reported in 30 per cent of cases. Seasonal variation in the occurrence of these viruses was also noted.

The psychological behavioural patterns of the family were as follows \u2013 creativity and high IQ, hypersexual behaviour, reduced appetite and eating behaviour, insomnia and reduced sleep patterns, increased tendency for spirituality, increased tendency for addiction, less of bonding and affectionate behaviour and left handedness. Digoxin, an endogenous Na\u002B\u2013K\u002B ATPase inhibitor secreted by the hypothalamus, was found to be elevated and RBC membrane Na\u002B\u2013K\u002B ATPase activity was found to be reduced in all the disorders and in the indexed family studied. Hypothalamic digoxin can modulate conscious perception and its dysfunction may lead to schizophrenia. Digoxin can also preferentially upregulate tryptophan transport over tyrosine resulting in increased levels of depolarising tryptophan catabolites \u2013 serotonin, quinolinic acid, strychnine and nicotine and decreased levels of hyperpolarising tyrosine catabolites dopamine, noradrenaline and morphine contributing to membrane Na\u002B\u2013K\u002B ATPase inhibition in all the above disorders and the indexed family. Digoxin induced membrane Na\u002B\u2013K\u002B ATPase inhibition can result in increased intracellular Ca2\u002B and reduced Mg\u002B\u002B levels leading to glutamate excitotoxicity, oncogene activation and immune activation. Digoxin induced altered Ca\u002B\u002B/Mg\u002B\u002B ratios, reduced ubiquinone and increased dolichol can affect glycoconjugate metabolism, membrane formation and structure and mitochondrial function leading to the diverse disorders described above including those in the indexed family. The isoprenoid pathway and neurotransmitter patterns were compared in right-handed/left hemispheric dominant and left-handed/right hemispheric dominant individuals.

Although they signal through distinct receptors, type I (IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2) and type III IFNs elicit remarkably similar responses in cells. However, in vivo, type III and type I IFN responses are not fully redundant as their respective contribution to the antiviral defense highly depends on virus species. IFN-\u03BB is much more potent than IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 at controlling rotavirus infection. In contrast, clearance of several other viruses, such as influenza virus, mostly depends on IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2. The IFN-\u03BB receptor was reported to be preferentially expressed on epithelial cells. Cells responsible for IFN-\u03BB production are still poorly characterized but seem to overlap only partly IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2-producing cells. Accumulating data suggest that epithelial cells are also important IFN-\u03BB producers. Thus, IFN-\u03BB may primarily act as a protection of mucosal entities, such as the lung, skin or digestive tract. Type I and type III IFN signal transduction pathways largely overlap, and cross talk between these IFN systems occurs. Finally, this review addresses the potential benefit of IFN-\u03BB use for therapeutic purposes and summarizes recent results of genome-wide association studies that identified polymorphisms in the region of the IFN-\u03BB3 gene impacting on the outcome of treatments against hepatitis C virus infection.","publish_time":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hermant, Pascale; Michiels, Thomas","journal":"Journal of Innate Immunity","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9fd9a616a587f16cac40684045df0398fc7152e4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6741612.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000360084; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24751921/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["III"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN-\u03B1","IFN responses","IFN systems","IFN family","IFN-\u03BB production","IFN-\u03BB receptor","type","important IFN-\u03BB producers","potential benefit of IFN","IFN signal transduction pathways","IFN-\u03BB3 gene impacting","\u03BB use","epithelial cells","Cells responsible","virus species","influenza virus","hepatitis C virus infection","similar responses","rotavirus infection","outcome of treatments","recent results of genome","therapeutic purposes","wide association studies","lung","antiviral defense","polymorphisms","region","IFNs","cross talk","respective contribution","viruses","skin","digestive tract","protection of mucosal entities","review","Accumulating data","contrast","clearance","distinct receptors","Interferon"],"language":"en"},

Phylogenetic analysis showed that recent prevalent Korean PEDV field isolates are closely related to the Chinese field strains and differ genetically from the European strains and the vaccine strains used in Korea, which raises questions of whether a new-type PEDV vaccine may be necessary for preventing PEDV infection more effectively in Korea.

This manuscript aims to provide an update of recent data on prevention of major healthcare-associated infections unique to transplantation, reviews the emergence of antimicrobial resistant infections, and discusses updated strategies to both identify and prevent transmission of these pathogens in transplant recipients.","publish_time":"2016-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pergam, Steven A.","journal":"Curr Infect Dis Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dff99e9ab98e383caee9c9da12d4b30dc6bf99da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088673.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11908-015-0513-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26820654/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prevention of transplant","transplant procedures","transplant recipients","number of patients","associated complications","infection prevention strategies","high-risk patients","number of centers","prevention of major healthcare-associated infections unique","marked improvements","emergence of antimicrobial resistant infections","updated strategies","solid organ transplantation","hematopoietic cell","immunosuppressive regimens","critical element","mortality","important sources of excess morbidity","update of recent data","year","transmission","survival","populations","pathogens","manuscript"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the level of awareness, perception, and attitude regarding the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and infection control among Jordanian dentists. METHODS: The study population consisted of dentists who worked in private clinics, hospitals, and health centers in Jordan. An online questionnaire was sent to a sample of Jordanian dentists in March 2020. The questionnaire was comprised of a series of questions about dentists\u2019 demographic characteristics; their awareness of the incubation period, the symptoms of the disease, mode of transmission of COVID-19 and infection control measures for preventing COVID-19; and their attitude toward treating patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: This study included a total of 368 dentists aged 22-73 years (mean 32.9 years, SD 10.6 years). A total of 112 (30.4%) dentists had completed a master or residency program in dentistry, 195 (53.0%) had received training in infection control in dentistry, and 28 (7.6%) had attended training or lectures regarding COVID-19. A total of 133 (36.1%) dentists reported that the incubation period is 1-14 days. The majority of dentists were aware of COVID-19 symptoms and ways of identifying patients at risk of having COVID-19, were able to correctly report known modes of transmission, and were aware of measures for preventing COVID-19 transmission in dental clinics. A total of 275 (74.7%) believed that it was necessary to ask patients to sit far from each other, wear masks while in the waiting room, and wash hands before getting in the dental chair to decrease disease transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Jordanian dentists were aware of COVID-19 symptoms, mode of transmission, and infection controls and measures in dental clinics. However, dentists had limited comprehension of the extra precautionary measures that protect the dental staff and other patients from COVID-19. National and international guidelines should be sent by the regional and national dental associations to all registered dentists during a crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic, to make sure that dentists are well informed and aware of best practices and recommended disease management approaches.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khader, Yousef; Al Nsour, Mohannad; Al-Batayneh, Ola Barakat; Saadeh, Rami; Bashier, Haitham; Alfaqih, Mahmoud; Al-Azzam, Sayer; AlShurman, Bara\u2019 Abdallah","journal":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7147327.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32250959/; https://doi.org/10.2196/18798","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Jordan"],"keyphrases":["aware of COVID","registered dentists","majority of dentists","infection control measures","sample of Jordanian dentists","dental clinics","disease transmission","dental practices","aware of measures","patients","total","dental staff","infection controls","dental chair","mode of transmission","national dental associations","symptoms","modes of transmission","years","coronavirus disease","aware of best practices","extra precautionary measures","private clinics","attitude","incubation period","dentistry","study population","training","recommended disease management approaches","level of awareness","international guidelines","online questionnaire","availability of prevention guidelines","recommendations","dentists\u2019 demographic characteristics","waiting room","hospitals","limited comprehension","minimum requirements","series of questions","health centers","wash hands","perception","master","ways","residency program","wear masks","SD","risk","pandemic","crisis","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","METHODS","days","RESULTS","lectures","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: Moving beyond Omran\u0027s original formulation, we discuss critiques and modifications of the theory of epidemiologic transitions and highlight some of the ways in which incorporating epidemiologic transition theory can benefit theory and practice in epidemiology. DESIGN: We focus on two broad contemporary trends in human health that epidemiologic transition theory is useful for conceptualizing: the increased incidence of chronic inflammatory diseases (CIDs), such as allergic and autoimmune diseases, and the emergence and reemergence of infectious disease. RESULTS: Situating these trends within epidemiologic transition theory, we explain the rise in CIDs with the hygiene hypothesis and the rise in emerging and reemerging infections with the concept of a third epidemiologic transition. CONCLUSIONS: Contextualizing these trends within epidemiologic transition theory reveals implications for clinical practice, global health policies, and future research within epidemiology.","publish_time":"2014-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zuckerman, Molly Kathleen; Harper, Kristin Nicole; Barrett, Ronald; Armelagos, George John","journal":"Glob Health Action","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0899d745009fa75954f75b381c040aebd927832a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4038768.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3402/gha.v7.23303; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24848652/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epidemiologic transition theory","theory of epidemiologic transitions","model of epidemiologic transitions","epidemiology","patterns of human health","rise","CIDs","global health policies","broad contemporary trends","clinical practice","autoimmune diseases","reemergence of infectious disease","increased incidence of chronic inflammatory diseases","implications","conceptualizing","economic development","critiques","relationships","hygiene hypothesis","future research","modifications","guiding framework","Omran\u0027s original formulation","past","reemerging infections","ways","OBJECTIVE","decades","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","DESIGN"],"language":"en"},

Effective public health system with a workforce to investigate outbreaks can reduce disease impact on livelihoods and economic development. Building effective public health partnerships is critical for sustainability of such a system. Uganda has made significant progress in responding to emergencies during the past quarter century, but its public health workforce is still inadequate in number and competency. Objectives: To reinforce implementation of priority public health programs in Uganda and cultivate core capacities for compliance with International Health Regulations. Methods: To develop a competent workforce to manage epidemics and improve disease surveillance, Uganda Ministry of Health (MoH) established an advanced-level Field Epidemiology Training Program, called Public Health Fellowship Program (PHFP); closely modelled after the US CDC\u2019s Epidemic Intelligence Service. PHFP is a 2-year, full-time, non-degree granting program targeting mid-career public health professionals. Fellows spend 85% of their field time in MoH placements learning through service delivery and gaining competencies in major domains. Results: During 2015\u20132018, PHFP enrolled 41 fellows, and graduated 30. Fellows were placed in 19 priority areas at MoH and completed 235 projects (91 outbreaks, 12 refugee assessments, 50 surveillance, and 60 epidemiologic studies, 3 cost analysis and 18 quality improvement); made 194 conference presentations; prepared 63 manuscripts for peer-reviewed publications (27 published as of December 2018); produced MoH bulletins, and developed three case studies. Projects have resulted in public health interventions with improvements in surveillance systems and disease control. Conclusion: During the 4 years of existence, PHFP has contributed greatly to improving real-time disease surveillance and outbreak response core capacities. Enhanced focus on evidence-based targeted approaches has increased effectiveness in outbreak response and control, and integration of PHFP within MoH has contributed to building a resilient and sustainable health system in Uganda.","publish_time":"2019-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ario, Alex Riolexus; Bulage, Lilian; Kadobera, Daniel; Kwesiga, Benon; Kabwama, Steven N.; Tusiime, Patrick; Wanyenze, Rhoda K.","journal":"Glob Health Action","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/12127085d9546a704eb677320d4df5b44f4dce8f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6534252.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/16549716.2019.1609825; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31117889/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs0Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Uganda Ministry of Health","Public Health Fellowship Program","PHFP"],"locations":["Uganda"],"keyphrases":["public health workforce","public health interventions","public health threats","Effective public health system","Public Health Fellowship Program","effective public health partnerships","Uganda Ministry of Health","sustainable health system","weak-health systems","implementation of priority public health programs","International Health Regulations","mid-career public health professionals","surveillance systems","real-time disease surveillance","disease control","MoH placements","MoH bulletins","integration of PHFP","disease impact","outbreak response core capacities","competent workforce","outbreaks","projects","advanced-level Field Epidemiology Training Program","service delivery","field time","priority areas","epidemiologic studies","case studies","US CDC\u2019s Epidemic Intelligence Service","improvements","non-degree","targeted approaches","compliance","manuscripts","emergencies","cost analysis","livelihoods","effectiveness","past quarter century","sustainability","epidemics","quality improvement","Low-income countries","conference presentations","evidence","competencies","economic development","number","Enhanced focus","major domains","refugee assessments","peer-reviewed publications","Background","significant progress","years of existence","competency","Objectives","Methods","Conclusion","Results"],"language":"en"},

Major knowledge gaps remain on the epidemiology, host reservoir, and emergence, transmission, pathogenesis and prevention of monkeypoz.","publish_time":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petersen, Eskild; Abubakar, Ibrahim; Ihekweazu, Chikwe; Heymann, David; Ntoumi, Francine; Blumberg, Lucille; Asogun, Danny; Mukonka, Victor; Lule, Swaib Abubaker; Bates, Matthew; Honeyborne, Isobella; Mfinanga, Sayoki; Mwaba, Peter; Dar, Osman; Vairo, Francesco; Mukhtar, Maowia; Kock, Richard; McHugh, Timothy D.; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Zumla, Alimuddin","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33079d1a2ca4bad577bda874e7a12289f7228fbd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129336.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2018.11.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971218345879; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971218345879; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30453097/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs1MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa"],"keyphrases":["identification of monkeypox","outbreak of human monkeypox cases","confirmed case of monkeypox","confirmed cases","evolution of monkeypox outbreaks","years","Animal Health","Human-Environmental","emerging public health threat","West African countries","epidemiology","transmission","emergence","political attention","USA","possible factors","changing clinical presentations","media","separate patients","United Kingdom","host reservoir","pathogenesis","increasing numbers","cessation of smallpox vaccination programs","prevention of monkeypoz","Major knowledge gaps","approach","history","majority","Nigeria"],"language":"en"},

Yet this interest from a medical perspective is not new as a review of The Lancet, one of the most well-established medical journals, shows. What is new is the way in which the interest in travel medicine has developed across the science\u2013social science divide and has now become one strand of a wider practitioner and academic interest in tourist well-being. With the exception of studies on technology and tourism and environmental science and tourism (e.g. climate change), this science\u2013social science intersection has been comparatively absent from research in Tourism Studies. For this reason, this current issue\u0027s paper seeks to broadly outline the evolution of this area of study and some of the influential studies published to date along with some of the research agendas now emerging in this new area of study.","publish_time":"2009-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Page, Stephen J.","journal":"Tourism Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/046d0aa77b0bd84466bf4d62ab57dcdcd12b8a5a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115677.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0261517708000733; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287728/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261517708000733; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2008.04.011","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs1Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Tourism Studies"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Tourism Studies","environmental science","social science intersection","social science divide","influential studies","exception of studies","new area of study","field of travel medicine","research agendas","medical perspective","well-established medical journals","technology","climate change","wider practitioner","strand","tourist well-being","current issue\u0027s paper","reason","considerable growth","Lancet","review","evolution","date","Abstract","way"],"language":"en"},

The model considers four routes of introduction: human travel, legal trade of products, live animal imports and illegal import of bushmeat and was applied to five virus outbreak scenarios. Two scenarios were considered for Zaire ebolavirus (wEBOV, cEBOV) and other scenarios for Hendra virus, Marburg virus (MARV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The use of the same framework and generic data sources for all EU Member States (MS) allows for a relative comparison of the probability of virus introduction and of the importance of the routes of introduction among MSs. According to the model wEBOV posed the highest risk of an introduction event within the EU, followed by MARV and MERS-CoV. However, the main route of introduction differed, with wEBOV and MERS-CoV most likely through human travel and MARV through legal trade of foodstuffs. The relative risks to EU MSs as entry points also varied between outbreak scenarios, highlighting the heterogeneity in global trade and travel to the EU MSs. The model has the capability to allow for a continual updating of the risk estimate using new data as, and when, it becomes available. The model provides an horizon scanning tool for use when available data are limited and, therefore, the absolute risk estimates often have high uncertainty. Sensitivity analysis suggested virus prevalence in bats has a large influence on the results; a 90% reduction in prevalence reduced the risk of introduction considerably and resulted in the relative ranking of MARV falling below that for MERS-CoV, due to this parameter disproportionately affecting the risk of introduction from the trade route over human travel.","publish_time":"2017-10-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Horigan, Verity; Gale, Paul; Kosmider, Rowena D.; Minnis, Christopher; Snary, Emma L.; Breed, Andrew C.; Simons, Robin R.L.","journal":"Microb Risk Anal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57a50193c033b31f92a1980e80b769eaa4a5d710.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103962.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352352217301408; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289058/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352352217301408; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mran.2017.09.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs1NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["MARV"],"organizations":["EU","EU Member States"],"locations":["Zaire","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["risk of introduction","routes of introduction","probability of virus introduction","risk of entry","introduction event","EU MSs","MERS-CoV","model wEBOV","virus outbreak scenarios","human travel","virus prevalence","highest risk","main route of introduction","Hendra virus","Marburg virus","trade route","absolute risk estimates","relative ranking of MARV","global trade","available data","legal trade of products","legal trade of foodstuffs","EU Member States","quantitative assessment model","new data","relative comparison","relative risks","generic data sources","entry points","live animal imports","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","bats","viruses","illegal import of bushmeat","cEBOV","tool","heterogeneity","large influence","continual updating","zoonotic bat","high uncertainty","framework","Sensitivity analysis","Zaire ebolavirus","horizon","importance","European Union","results","capability","paper","reduction","parameter"],"language":"en"}]}

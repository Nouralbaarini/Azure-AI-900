The dosage cost of vaccines for animal infectious diseases must be kept to a minimum, especially for non-lethal diseases that diminish animal welfare and growth, so efficient and economic production, storage and delivery are critical for commercialization. It has become clear that transgenic plants are an economic and efficient alternative to fermentation for large-scale production of vaccine antigens. The oral delivery of plant-made vaccines is particularly attractive since the expensive purification step can be avoided further reducing the cost per dose.

This study focuses on the infiltration-induced inter-unit pollutant dispersion in a high-rise residential (HRR) building. The outdoor wind pressure distribution on the building facades was obtained from the wind tunnel experiments. And the inter-household infiltration and tracer gas transmission were simulated using multi-zone model. The risk levels along building height and under different wind directions were examined, and influence of component leakage area was analysed. It is found that, the cross-infection risk can be over 20% because of the low air infiltration rate below 0.7 ACH, which is significantly higher than the risk of 9% obtained in our previous on-site measurement with air change rate over 3 ACH. As the air infiltration rate increases along building height, cross-infection risk is generally higher on the lower floors. The effect of wind direction on inter-unit dispersion level is significant, and the presence of a contaminant source in the windward side results in the highest cross-infection risks in other adjacent units on the same floor. Properly improving internal components tightness and increasing air change via external components are beneficial to the control of internal inter-unit transmission induced by infiltration. However, this approach may increase the cross-infection via the external transmission, and effective control measures should be further explored considering multiple transmission routes.","publish_time":"2017-07-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Yan; Niu, Jianlei; Liu, Xiaoping","journal":"Build Simul","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/baa783a36a0a189d01d4ac57d975e49b807b0f95.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090850/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["external transmission","control of internal inter-unit transmission","inter-household infiltration","low air infiltration rate","building height","air change rate","highest cross-infection risks","multiple transmission routes","inter-unit dispersion level","inter-unit pollutant dispersion","building facades","risk levels","tracer gas transmission","effective control measures","possible airborne transmission routes","external components","different wind directions","effect of wind direction","wind tunnel experiments","outdoor wind pressure distribution","internal components tightness","associated infectious risks","results","previous on-site measurement","adjacent units","contaminant source","presence","multi-zone model","HRR","influence of component leakage area","lower floors","approach","study"],"language":"en"},

Understanding airflow dynamics and transport property within an aircraft cabin is critical to creating a healthy cabin environment and improving control of epidemics. This work reveals the temporal and spatial evolution process of large-scale flow structures around the aisle region and evaluates impact of airflow\u2019s large-scale flow structures (swing motion around the aisle region and large-scale vortices) on transport property by calculating traces of marked fluid particles (MFPs) passing through passengers\u2019 exhalation area within a Boeing 737-200 cabin mock-up. The Peixoto theorem has been used to interpret temporal and spatial evolution process of large-scale flow structures around the aisle region. Transport property within this single-aisle aircraft cabin is a mixed effect of the airflow\u2019s swing motion, large-scale vortices and longitudinal airflow. Airflow\u2019s swing motion around the aisle region tends to carry MFPs nearby across the aisle region and invade the large-scale vortex in the opposite side. The large-scale vortices try to control MFPs in its each separated zone. The airflow\u2019s swing motion and large-scale vortices dominate MFPs\u2019 latitudinal transmission, while longitudinal airflow dominates MFPs\u2019 longitudinal transmission.","publish_time":"2017-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Changwei; Liu, Jiawei; He, Feng","journal":"Build Simul","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7550b8baf1b764cb890698b8e0c2236dc30c44b9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091181/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Boeing"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["large-scale vortices","aisle region","large-scale vortex","airflow\u2019s swing motion","impact of airflow\u2019s large-scale flow structures","spatial evolution process of large-scale flow structures","single-aisle aircraft cabin","transport property","longitudinal airflow","MFPs\u2019 longitudinal transmission","cabin mock-up","MFPs\u2019 latitudinal transmission","temporal","healthy cabin environment","airflow dynamics","potential risk of contaminant transmission","control of epidemics","mixed effect","traces of marked fluid particles","growing popularity of airline transportation","commercial air travel","Boeing","passengers\u2019 exhalation area","decades","crew","past","work","separated zone","Peixoto theorem"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study is to create a practical instrument for use in predicting an individualized survival probability of H7N9 patients. METHODS: A matched case\u2013control study (1:2 ratios) was performed in Zhejiang Province between 2013 and 2019. We reviewed specific factors and outcomes regarding patients with H7N9 virus infection (VI) to determine relationships and developed a nomogram to calculate individualized survival probability. This tool was used to predict each individual patient\u2019s probability of survival based on results obtained from the multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. RESULTS: We examined 227 patients with H7N9 VI enrolled in our study. Stepwise selection was applied to the data, which resulted in a final model with 8 independent predictors [including initial PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio \u2264300 mmHg, age \u226560 years, chronic diseases, poor hand hygiene, time from illness onset to the first medical visit, incubation period \u22645 days, peak C-reactive protein \u2265120 mg/L], and initial bilateral lung infection. The concordance index of this nomogram was 0.802 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.694\u20130.901] and 0.793 (95% CI: 0.611\u20130.952) for the training and validation sets, respectively, which indicates adequate discriminatory power. The calibration curves for the survival showed optimal agreement between nomogram prediction and actual observation in the training and validation sets, respectively. CONCLUSION: We established and validated a novel nomogram that can accurately predict the survival probability of patients with H7N9 VI. This nomogram can serve an important role in counseling patients with H7N9 VI and guide treatment decisions.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Qinglin; Sun, Zhou; Zhao, Gang; Xie, Li","journal":"Risk Manag Healthc Policy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16d34470dae42785a0ce4756653b82878a8d00fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094003.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094003/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjsxMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["survival probability of patients","individualized survival probability of H7N9 patients","H7N9 virus infection","counseling patients","individual patient\u2019s probability of survival","nomogram prediction","novel nomogram","human H7N9 infection cases","control study","training","results","validation sets","initial bilateral lung infection","routine use","practical instruments","specific factors","initial PaO","multiple risk factors","poor hand hygiene","days","optimal agreement","actual observation","illness onset","chronic diseases","years","time","outcomes","incubation period","medical visit","multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis","age","independent predictors","peak C-reactive protein","important role","ratios","matched case","guide treatment decisions","final model","calibration curves","data","mmHg","METHODS","FiO","studies","confidence interval","adequate discriminatory power","Stepwise selection","Zhejiang Province","concordance index","relationships","tool","objective","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

A mutation in the Rhizobium leguminosarum gmcA gene was generated by homologous recombination. The mutation in gmcA did not affect the growth of R. leguminosarum, but it displayed decreased antioxidative capacity at H(2)O(2) conditions higher than 5 mM. The gmcA mutant strain displayed no difference of glutathione reductase activity, but significantly lower level of the glutathione peroxidase activity than the wild type. Although the gmcA mutant was able to induce the formation of nodules, the symbiotic ability was severely impaired, which led to an abnormal nodulation phenotype coupled to a 30% reduction in the nitrogen fixation capacity. The observation on ultrastructure of 4-week pea nodules showed that the mutant bacteroids tended to start senescence earlier and accumulate poly-\u03B2-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) granules. In addition, the gmcA mutant was severely impaired in rhizosphere colonization. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that the gmcA gene expression was significantly up-regulated in all the detected stages of nodule development, and statistically significant decreases in the expression of the redoxin genes katG, katE, and ohrB were found in gmcA mutant bacteroids. LC-MS/MS analysis quantitative proteomics techniques were employed to compare differential gmcA mutant root bacteroids in response to the wild type infection. Sixty differentially expressed proteins were identified including 33 up-regulated and 27 down-regulated proteins. By sorting the identified proteins according to metabolic function, 15 proteins were transporter protein, 12 proteins were related to stress response and virulence, and 9 proteins were related to transcription factor activity. Moreover, nine proteins related to amino acid metabolism were over-expressed.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zou, Qian; Luo, Sha; Wu, Hetao; He, Donglan; Li, Xiaohua; Cheng, Guojun","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/501c5d126afc8f370cde39c613a23366f99983c7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105596.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7105596/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjszNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gmcA mutant bacteroids","gmcA mutant strain","regulated proteins","identified proteins","gmcA gene expression","differential gmcA mutant root bacteroids","Rhizobium leguminosarum gmcA gene","glutathione peroxidase activity","mutation","difference of glutathione reductase activity","transcription factor activity","wild type infection","LC-MS","stress response","formation of nodules","MS analysis quantitative proteomics techniques","week pea nodules","Real-time quantitative PCR","decreased antioxidative capacity","nitrogen fixation capacity","lower level","ohrB","choline oxidase","metabolic function","glucose-methanol","redoxin genes katG","amino acid metabolism","poly-\u03B2","significant decreases","transporter protein","hydroxybutyrate","PHB","detected stages of nodule development","katE","reduction","ultrastructure","symbiotic ability","enzyme","senescence","family of oxidoreductases","homologous recombination","rhizosphere colonization","granules","virulence","abnormal nodulation phenotype","conditions higher","observation","FAD","growth of","addition"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to determine the incidence, patients\u2019 characteristics, length of stay and mortality for US adults hospitalized with CAP due to Sp-PCV13VT. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study of adults hospitalized between October 7, 2013 and September 30, 2016 with radiographically confirmed CAP in 19 centers in the US. Patients were included if the following 5 criteria were met: 1) Age 18 years and older; 2) Presence of two or more of the following: fever, hypothermia, chills or rigors, pleuritic chest pain, cough, sputum production, dyspnea, tachypnea, malaise, and abnormal auscultatory findings suggestive of pneumonia; 3) Radiographic finding consistent with pneumonia; 4) Able to provide urine sample; 5) Signed informed consent. The presence of Sp-PCV13VT was investigated using a Luminex-based urinary antigen detection (UAD) assay or serotyping from a positive Sp isolate. Data on patients\u2019 characteristics, length of stay (LOS) and in-hospital mortality (IHM) were collected. RESULTS: From a total of 12,055 hospitalized patients with CAP, VT Sp-PCV13 was detected in 552 patients via UAD or culture (4.6%). Among patients hospitalized with CAP due to Sp-PCV13VT, median age was 64 years, and the most common comorbidities were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (46.2%) and diabetes (27.3%). Median LOS was 6 days, and IHM was 5.4%. There were no clinically significant differences when this population was compared with the population of patients with non-PCV13 VT Sp-CAP. CONCLUSION: In approximately 5% of US adults hospitalized with CAP, the etiologic agent is VT Sp-PCV13. Clinical characteristics and outcomes in this population were similar when compared with the general population of hospitalized patients with CAP.

{"cord_uid":"92tu8rfm","sha":null,"source_x":"PMC","title":"The Impact of Respiratory Viral Testing in Hospitalized Adult Patients at a Tertiary Care Facility","doi":"10.1093/ofid/ofx163.1323","pmcid":"PMC7107204","pubmed_id":null,"license":"cc-by-nc-nd","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The use of multiplex nucleic acid amplification assays to detect respiratory viruses is increasing. However, these tests are expensive, and the clinical significance of a positive result is often unclear. Positive viral results have the potential to decrease antibiotic use and length of stay, but their actual impact is unknown. METHODS: We completed a retrospective review of all adult patients with positive respiratory viral panel (RVP; GenMark) and/or rapid RSV/influenza PCR tests (Cepheid Xpert) collected within 48 hours of admission to the general inpatient or stepdown units of an academic tertiary care hospital between September 1, 2015 and March 15, 2016. Data collected included demographics, comorbidities, clinical presentation, time of test collection and result, additional diagnostic evaluation, and antibiotic use. RESULTS: A total of 221 positive respiratory viral tests were collected on 215 patients during the study period. The median age at time of testing was 56.8 years; 48% were female. Respiratory symptoms were documented in 92.8% of cases. COPD was the most common respiratory co-morbidity (20.2%), while 30% of patients had cancer, and 3.2% were HIV-infected. Respiratory support on admission was common (51.6%). A rapid PCR and RVP were performed in 58.8% of cases, while 28.5% had only an RVP and 12.7% had only a rapid PCR. Of the patients who had a positive rapid PCR, 17.6% also had an RVP done. Antibiotics were started within 24 hours of presentation in 87.4% of all cases and 70.6% of patients who had a positive rapid PCR. Rhinovirus was the most frequently isolated pathogen (44.6% of positive tests) followed by metapneumovirus (14%), respiratory syncytial virus (13.5%), and coronavirus (13.5%). Median time from specimen collection to result was 38.8 hours for RVP, and 15.3% were resulted after patient discharge. For those who had a rapid PCR alone, median time from collection to result was 1.5 hours. CONCLUSION: In this non-critically ill cohort, most patients with positive viral assays received antibiotics, and a substantial number of RVPs were resulted after discharge. This suggests that there are many lost opportunities to impact clinical management with respiratory viral testing. DISCLOSURES: M.

Frameshifting is a potential antiviral target. It is possible that the replication cycle of any virus that uses this process could be disrupted by modulation of frameshift efficiencies, but a better understanding of the occurrence and the molecular basis of frameshifting will be required before it can be considered a genuine target. To date, there are no confirmed examples of frameshift signals from conventional eukaryotic cellular genes, although computer-assisted database searches have identified a number of candidates. The frameshift allows the required ratio of viral proteins to be produced, but it may also serve to downregulate levels of viral replicases that may be toxic in high amounts.","publish_time":"2004-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brierley, Ian; Vidakovic, Marijana","journal":"Perspect Med Virol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133818/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["frameshifting process","molecular basis of frameshifting","chapter reviews ribosomal frameshifting","modulation of frameshift efficiencies","confirmed examples of frameshift signals","required ratio of viral proteins","genuine target","levels of viral replicases","potential antiviral target","conventional eukaryotic cellular genes","emphasis","computer","occurrence","better understanding","database searches","replication cycle","astroviruses","number of candidates","high amounts"],"language":"en"},

CWHDs support individuals in taking ownership of their personal well-being and keeping track of their fitness goals. However, there are genuine concerns over the accuracy of the data collected by these devices. In this study, we investigated the factors that influence the accuracy of the data collected by CWHDs for heart rate measurement, physical activity (PA), and sleep monitoring using a systematic literature review. Forty-seven papers were analyzed from five electronic databases based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. All 47 papers that we analyzed were published by authors from developed countries. Using thematic analysis, we classified the factors that influence the accuracy of the data collected by CWHDs into three main groups, namely (i) the tracker and sensor type, (ii) the algorithm used in the device, and (iii) the limitation in the design, energy consumption, and processing capability of the device. The research results point to a dearth of studies that focus on the accuracy of the data collected by CWHDs by researchers from developing countries.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mahloko, Lerato; Adebesin, Funmi","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a940e34e953c37ccc14ce74bd3430e41b8f0f182.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134235.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134235/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsxNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["accuracy","CWHDs support individuals","factors","papers","fitness tracing","fitness goals","developing countries","developed countries","use of consumer wearable health device","heart rate measurement","physical activity","sleep monitoring","specific inclusion","energy consumption","ownership","electronic databases","processing capability","design","systematic literature review","personal well-being","researchers","exclusion criteria","limitation","dearth of studies","upward trend","sensor type","research results","genuine concerns","main groups","tracker","authors","thematic analysis","algorithm","study","devices"],"language":"en"},

Zachman proposed the Zachman Framework for Enterprise Architecture (ZFEA), a descriptive, holistic representation of an enterprise for the purposes of providing insights and understanding. Some scholars claim that EA is an imperative to ensure successful business structures or business-IT alignment, or more recently with Enterprise Architecture Management (EAM), to manage required organizational transformation. However, EA initiatives within companies are often costly and the expected return on investment is not realized. In fact, Gartner recently indicated in their 2018 Enterprise Architecture Hype Cycle that EA is slowly emerging from the trough of disillusionment after nearly a decade. In this paper we argue that the role and value of EA is often misunderstood, and that EA, specifically the ZFEA for the purpose of this paper, could be considered as a theory given the view of theory within Information Systems (IS). The purpose of IS theories is to analyse, predict, explain and/or prescribe and it could be argued that EA often conform to these purposes. Using the taxonomy of theories as well as the structural components of theory within IS as proposed by Gregor, we motivate that the ZFEA could be regarded as an explanatory theory. Positioning ZFEA as IS explanatory theory provides insight into the role and purpose of the ZFEA (and by extension EA), and could assist researchers and practitioners with mediating the challenges experienced when instituting EA and EAM initiatives within organizations.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gerber, Aurona; le Roux, Pierre; Kearney, Carike; van der Merwe, Alta","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9bac987a1b5557cd07ceb79f43d3f9db1f7b7bbb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134282.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134282/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsxOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["John Zachman"],"organizations":["Zachman Framework for Enterprise Architecture","EA","Enterprise Architecture Management","Information Systems","ZFEA","EAM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EA initiatives","value of EA","extension EA","explanatory theory","Enterprise Architecture Management","Positioning ZFEA","view of theory","Enterprise Architecture Hype Cycle","structural components of theory","Zachman Framework","role","EAM initiatives","John Zachman","purposes","paper","taxonomy of theories","successful business structures","imperative","inception","pioneers","challenges","companies","holistic representation","alignment","controversial history","expected return","investment","Information Systems","researchers","organizations","required organizational transformation","trough of disillusionment","decade","practitioners","Gartner","scholars","insights","Gregor","fact"],"language":"en"},

These IS outsourcing decisions are driven by multiple organisational factors such as outsource vendor expertise and knowledge, process performance improvement due to better IS, and enabling the organisation\u2019s ability to focus on its core capabilities. In order to harnass such vendor knowledge to achieve business outcomes, the importance of a shared knowledge asset base, between the client organisation and outsource vendor, is emphasised. However, outcomes from IS outsourcing remain poor despite consideration of experience and research. Therefore, the aim of this study is to design and propose a knowledge asset management implementation framework that may be applied in IS outsourcing projects. The proposed framework was evaluated by an experienced programme director and its applicability was tested against a large scale IS outsourcing project. The purpose of such a framework is to enable organisations to manage and institutionalise knowledge assets that are created during the IS outsourcing project and to ensure that the organisation may gain the benefit from such knowledge assets as an outcome of the IS outsourcing arrangement.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smuts, Hanlie; Maramba, George","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46ae22fe5edfdd63120903d6415ce1734598dd27.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134288.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134288/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsyMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vendor knowledge","knowledge assets","outsourcing decisions","outsourcing arrangement","outsourcing projects","outsourcing information systems","knowledge asset management implementation framework","shared knowledge asset base","vendor expertise","Organisations","proposed framework","business outcomes","client organisation","importance","process performance improvement","multiple organisational factors","applicability","experienced programme director","consideration of experience","large scale","harnass","organisation\u2019s ability","external service providers","research","order","benefit","core capabilities","aim","study","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Using a direct survey method, IS courses information were collected from the websites of top universities in SSA based on a 2019 webometric world ranking of universities. The course offerings from these universities are mapped to the competencies specified in the Global competency model for graduate IS programmes (MSIS 2016). The findings generally indicate, among others, non-adherence of graduate IS programmes in SSA to the MSIS 2016. The reasons for the non-adherence to the MSIS 2016 curriculum model is recommended for future research.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kevor, Mark-Oliver; Boateng, Richard; Kolog, Emmanuel Awuni; Owusu, Acheampong; Afful-Dadzie, Anthony","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14711f41b76e8e14462c69d8fa0aa6e367892378.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134312.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134312/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsyMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Extant Information Systems","UK","SSA"],"locations":["Sub-Saharan Africa"],"keyphrases":["programmes","nature of graduate","SSA","MSIS","non-adherence of graduate","curriculum model","curriculum research","US","UK","courses information","future research","webometric world ranking of universities","nature of undergraduate","Global competency model","Extant Information Systems","eliciting calls","Sub-Saharan Africa","studies","direct survey method","competencies","websites","regions","course offerings","reasons","study","findings"],"language":"en"},

In this research, we analyze the potential of blockchain-based systems to enhance effectiveness, ease, and transparency in public procurement in the case of Nigeria and identify the current challenges facing public procurement, i.e., lack of trust and transparency among critical stakeholders in the procurement process, systems that only weakly support transaction recording and documentation, complex process structures, corruption in institutions involved in the procurement process. To address these issues, a blockchain-based framework is developed to enable interoperability of information-systems involved in the procurement process, increase citizen participation in eliciting project requirements and to enable a more transparent project monitoring and auditing. We apply the framework to a case study with respect to identifying on-chain activities that enable system interoperability, e-participation and project auditability.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Akaba, Temofe Isaac; Norta, Alex; Udokwu, Chibuzor; Draheim, Dirk","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a6c50c74125765f68e32f56a771c1188148eb38.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134314.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134314/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsyMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Nigeria"],"keyphrases":["procurement process","Public procurement","digitized public-procurement function yields progress","based systems","complex process structures","transparency","blockchain-based framework","project auditability","eliciting project requirements","transparent project monitoring","e-participation","citizen participation","system interoperability","interoperability of information","case of Nigeria","potential of blockchain","case study","core government function","documentation","weakly support transaction recording","economic growth","corruption","critical stakeholders","institutions","ease","goods","respect","lack of trust","effectiveness","chain activities","current challenges","services","overall success","nation","auditing","issues"],"language":"en"},

{"cord_uid":"51qul5ar","sha":null,"source_x":"PMC","title":"A Cool Drink on a Hot Day \u2013 Hospital-Acquired Legionella Pneumonia","doi":"10.1016/j.ajic.2006.05.193","pmcid":"PMC7135536","pubmed_id":null,"license":"no-cc","abstract":"ISSUE: A proactive Legionella control program combining continuous disinfection of the water distribution system, environmental sampling and active case detection was established in a large urban hospital in the early 1990\u0027s. While cases of community-acquired disease are generally seen in the area during the rainy spring months, no patients had been identified with hospital acquired infection until Sept. 2005, after a particularly hot, dry summer. PROJECT: In order to prevent additional infections, all systems were immediately reviewed. Routine cultures of hospital sinks and showers had occasionally shown low levels of Legionella pneumophila in less than 30% of samples collected. There were no disruptions in the water supply and readings from the copper-silver ionization system were within range. Although the hospital\u0027s hot water supply is disinfected by the system, the cold water supply is not treated since the cooler water is not considered to be at increased risk for Legionella multiplication. After the case was identified, cultures were collected from additional water sources, including the new state of the art ice and water dispenser that served the patient unit. Maintenance personnel provided documentation that the unit was cleaned and sanitized as per manufacturer\u0027s instructions and provided the service manual for review. RESULTS: Cultures collected from the dispenser\u0027s water chute showed confluent growth of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1. Isolates from the environment and patient submitted to a reference lab for Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) had identical patterns. Periodic cleaning procedures in the manual stated that a chlorinated cleaning solution (200 ppm available chlorine) should be used, followed by a sanitizing solution (50 ppm). Since this sequence was reversed from our usual disinfection practices, the manufacturer of the recommended cleaner was contacted. The company was unaware that their product was mentioned and confirmed that these steps were incorrectly listed. Another factor leading to the disinfection failure was identified- maintenance personnel did not realize that the solutions were to be 75\u00B0F-125\u00B0F. LESSONS LEARNED: During the hot summer months, water coming in from the municipal water supply was reported to be unusually warm, theoretically allowing small numbers of Legionella in the water to multiply. While the preventative maintenance schedule was being followed according to the manufacturer\u0027s instructions, the incorrect dilution sequence and low temperature of the solution used potentially allowed the interior surfaces of the machine to develop a biofilm layer containing Legionella - a problem common in our hard water area. While we thought that our high-tech, proactive system was working wonderfully, all it took was a cool drink on a hot day to break our winning streak of Legionella prevention. And an unfortunate patient with a history of aspiration.","publish_time":"2006-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krystofiak, S.P.","journal":"Am J Infect Control","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135536/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs0NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["water dispenser","cooler water","water distribution system","cold water supply","municipal water supply","hospital\u0027s hot water supply","additional water sources","hard water area","dispenser\u0027s water chute","Legionella multiplication","proactive system","low levels of Legionella pneumophila","small numbers of Legionella","proactive Legionella control program","hot summer months","winning streak of Legionella prevention","hot day","patient unit","Maintenance personnel","confluent growth of Legionella pneumophila serogroup","continuous disinfection","disinfection failure","chlorinated cleaning solution","sanitizing solution","Routine cultures of hospital sinks","manufacturer\u0027s instructions","unfortunate patient","copper-silver ionization system","usual disinfection practices","large urban hospital","preventative maintenance schedule","low temperature","service manual","additional infections","dry summer","incorrect dilution sequence","active case detection","ppm available chlorine","Periodic cleaning procedures","rainy spring months","environmental sampling","Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis","problem common","PFGE","reference lab","showers","readings","new state","art ice","biofilm layer","machine","patients","ISSUE","identical patterns","disease","order","history of aspiration","interior surfaces","cool drink","range","increased risk","LESSONS","documentation","disruptions","cases of community","recommended cleaner","company","product","solutions","PROJECT","systems","review","Isolates","factor","RESULTS","samples","steps"],"language":"en"},

It activates bone resorption cells and directly induces bone destruction. Cells that secrete MIP-1\u03B1/CCL3 are increased at sites of inflammation and bone resorption. MIP-1\u03B1/CCL3 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases and conditions that exhibit bone resorption, such as periodontitis, multiple myeloma, Sj\u00F6gren syndrome, and rheumatoid arthritis.

Such investment has also focused on fighting major diseases, enabled by the novel invention of cost-effective and valid drug development for treatment and side effect reduction, along with improved vector control. In addition, the demand for diagnostics that is essential in determining prognosis, identifying disease stages, monitoring treatment, and assessing the spreading as health services has expanded. Molecular-based diagnostics is critical for prevention, identification, and treatment of disease. Current laboratory analyses support correct diagnosis in over 70 % of all diseases and can be used to aid the continuous monitoring of drug therapy. However, classic diagnostic technologies are not completely well suited to meeting the expanded testing requirement because they rely on complicated sample purification and sophisticated instruments which are labor-intensive, timely, and expensive and require well-trained operators. One of the main challenges for industry is to develop fast, relatively accurate, easy-to-use, and inexpensive devices. In addition to the improved efficiency in laboratory diagnostics, there has been a trend toward a more decentralized diagnostics which occurs directly at patients\u2019 bedside, in outpatient clinics, or at the sites of accidents, so-called point-of-care (POC) systems. The concept of POC testing is mainly for the patient, so short turnaround time, minimum sample preparation, reagent storage and transferring, user-friendly analytical instruments, and digital or visible quantitative or semiquantitative single readout are required. POC test is a great option of potential in vitro diagnostics (IVD) for resource-limited settings. It is clear that on-site or minimum sample preparation and on-chip storage limit the delays that caused by transport and preparation of clinical samples. Shorter turnaround time leads to rapid clinical decision-making and may save fatal consequences. No previous knowledge in sample analysis should be required, so elders can perform the tests at home with minimum training to improve health outcome. Lateral-flow immunoassay (LFIA) devices, for example, which were originally proposed in the 1980s, remain popular largely because of their design simplicity. The purpose of this article is to introduce readers with basic information regarding the LFIA approach that we think the most representative product of IVD test for solving global health issues.","publish_time":"2015-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Chao-Min; Kuan, Chen-Meng; Chen, Chien-Fu","journal":"In-Vitro Diagnostic Devices","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5834c228fdd9363c26def9a4d90f708207521674.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124134.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124134/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjs4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare","POC","LFIA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["laboratory diagnostics","minimum sample preparation","decentralized diagnostics","sample analysis","treatment of disease","Molecular-based diagnostics","minimum training","complicated sample purification","preparation of clinical samples","health outcome","health services","concept of POC testing","addition","short turnaround time","Shorter turnaround time","global health issues","expanded testing requirement","sophisticated instruments","reagent storage","chip storage","representative product of IVD test","LFIA approach","improved efficiency","inexpensive devices","continuous monitoring of drug therapy","disease stages","major diseases","Healthcare investment","user-friendly analytical instruments","valid drug development","rapid clinical decision-making","Current laboratory analyses","improved vector control","novel invention of cost-effective","effect reduction","great option of potential","home","prevention","identification","semiquantitative single readout","so-called point","basic information","patients\u2019 bedside","sites of accidents","outpatient clinics","readers","correct diagnosis","tests","transport","delays","prognosis","Lateral-flow immunoassay","fatal consequences","resource-limited settings","industry","article","elders","previous knowledge","spreading","demand","trend","classic diagnostic technologies","main challenges","well-trained operators","design simplicity","systems","example","recent years","purpose"],"language":"en"},

As we have begun to unravel the complex underlying immunologic and inflammatory pathophysiology of the disease, new therapeutic strategies as well as specific molecular and cellular constituents have emerged as potential targets for clinical intervention. These efforts also have shed light on the mechanisms by which current antiallergy medications act\u2014or sometimes fail to be effective.7, 31, 51, 89 The similar pathophysiologic basis for allergic rhinitis and the often comorbid condition, asthma, was underscored in the recently published American Thoracic Society Workshop Summary on the Immunobiology of Asthma and Rhinitis: Pathogenic Factors and Therapeutic Options.(18) In his conclusion, workshop chair, Thomas Casale,(18) counsels readers to consider that \u201C\u2026allergic asthma and rhinitis represent a systemic disease affecting two organs, the lung and the nose. Asthma and allergic rhinitis share many of the same pathogenic factors, but they operate in different parts of the airway. Inflammatory cells and mediators are often the same, and there may be common alterations that occur in the immune system.\u201D Thus, therapeutic strategies and potential therapeutic agents found to be beneficial in the treatment of one airway target may show similar effects in the other. For this reason, and because many of the therapies now being developed are at early stages in their evolution, physicians interested in rhinitis therapy also must examine what is known about these agents in asthma. One avenue of active research has been the role of leukotrienes and other mediators in the pathophysiology of asthma and rhinitis. Three leukotriene modifiers now have been approved for the treatment of asthma in the United States; their potential use in the treatment of rhinitis has been a focus of considerable speculation and investigation. An early \u201Cday in the park\u201D study showed that with antileukotriene therapy, patients with rhinitis had demonstrable improvements in their rhinitic symptoms.(29) Roquet et al(83) reported that in the treatment of asthma, there was a synergistic effect when an antileukotriene agent and an antihistamine were used, compared with either drug alone. A product combining an antileukotriene with an antihistamine is currently under development. The most exciting developments, however, may be in the immunology arena. As described by Baraniuk elsewhere in this issue, the pathophysiology of allergic rhinitis is highly complex. Multiple interacting, interdependent, and redundant pathways and molecular and cellular constituents are involved in the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis. Briefly, exposure of the nasal mucosa to allergen in a sensitized individual leads to the release and further production of inflammatory mediators and the release of cytokines.(5) These released cytokines activate endothelial cells, thereby inducing expression of adhesion receptors on the cell surface and initiating a cascade of events that facilitates transendothelial migration of inflammatory cells. T lymphocytes also are activated by these cytokines. Within a given tissue, specific patterns of cytokines are released, dependent on the dominant subset of local T lymphocytes. These, in turn, lead to the preferential activation and recruitment of specific inflammatory cells and the characteristic cellular inflammation observed in allergic rhinitis.","publish_time":"2000-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Agosti, Jan M.; Sanes-Miller, Carol H.","journal":"Immunol Allergy Clin North Am","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62afd8bf1bb4f19f4b3da101315f7c19b9b00fc1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125815.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7125815/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjsxMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Thomas Casale"],"organizations":["American Thoracic Society Workshop Summary"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["treatment of rhinitis","allergic asthma","pathophysiology of allergic rhinitis","rhinitis therapy","allergic rhinitis share","understanding of allergic rhinitis","pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis","treatment of asthma","pathophysiology of asthma","Immunobiology of Asthma","inflammatory pathophysiology","recruitment of specific inflammatory cells","production of inflammatory mediators","potential therapeutic agents","release of cytokines","transendothelial migration of inflammatory cells","specific patterns of cytokines","cellular constituents","Therapeutic Options","antileukotriene therapy","endothelial cells","new therapeutic strategies","potential targets","potential use","Pathogenic Factors","antileukotriene agent","complex","antihistamine","characteristic cellular inflammation","systemic disease","workshop chair","airway target","similar effects","early stages","dominant subset of local T lymphocytes","similar pathophysiologic basis","American Thoracic Society Workshop Summary","redundant pathways","preferential activation","allergen","Thomas Casale","demonstrable improvements","sensitized individual leads","mechanisms","cell surface","cascade of events","rhinitic symptoms","evolution","physicians","patients","United States","expression of adhesion receptors","nasal mucosa","enormous changes","current antiallergy medications act","organs","conclusion","role of leukotrienes","focus of considerable speculation","park","study","given tissue","synergistic effect","comorbid condition","Multiple interacting","avenue of active research","light","investigation","exposure","turn","day","lung","counsels readers","clinical intervention","common alterations","immune system","Roquet et","different parts","nose","decades","leukotriene modifiers","exciting developments","immunology arena","efforts","Baraniuk","therapies","reason","drug"],"language":"en"},

Functional MSCs have been isolated and characterized from a wide array of adult tissues and are universally identified by the shared expression of a core panel of MSCs markers. One of these markers is the multifunctional cell surface peptidase CD13 that has been shown to be expressed on human and murine MSCs from many tissues. To investigate whether this universal expression indicates a functional role for CD13 in MSC biology we isolated, expanded and characterized MSCs from bone marrow of wild type (WT) and CD13(KO) mice. Characterization of these cells demonstrated that both WT and CD13(KO) MSCs expressed the full complement of MSC markers (CD29, CD44, CD49e, CD105, Sca1), showed comparable proliferation rates and were capable of differentiating toward the adipogenic and osteogenic lineages. However, MSCs lacking CD13 were unable to differentiate into vascular cells, consistent with our previous characterization of CD13 as an angiogenic regulator. Compared to WT MSCs, adhesion and migration on various extracellular matrices of CD13(KO) MSCs were significantly impaired, which correlated with decreased phospho-FAK levels and cytoskeletal alterations. Crosslinking human MSCs with activating CD13 antibodies increased cell adhesion to endothelial monolayers and induced FAK activation in a time dependent manner. In agreement with these in vitro data, intramuscular injection of CD13(KO) MSCs in a model of severe ischemic limb injury resulted in significantly poorer perfusion, decreased ambulation, increased necrosis and impaired vascularization compared to those receiving WT MSCs. This study suggests that CD13 regulates FAK activation to promote MSC adhesion and migration, thus, contributing to MSC-mediated tissue repair. CD13 may present a viable target to enhance the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cell therapies.","publish_time":"2014-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rahman, M.

METHODS: A population-based descriptive study was carried out between 2007 and 2010 with RTI patient records from the Fifth Center Hospital of Tianjin. Inpatient diagnoses of RTI patients were defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes. We analyzed the demographics and general characteristics of RTI patients that were in the hospital during the four years. In order to compare the group differences between local resident patients and floating migrant patients, the distribution of their ages, diagnoses, severity of injuries, duration of inpatient stays, hospitalization cost were analyzed. RESULTS: People between the ages of 16 and 55 were the most likely to suffer RTIs. The floating migrant patients between the ages of 16 and 45 had a higher incidence of accidents, while local resident patients between 46 and 55 had a higher incidence of accidents. Compared to local resident patients, floating migrant patients were more vulnerable to open injuries and severe traffic injuries. With the severity of injuries ranked from mild to severe, floating migrant patients had lower duration of inpatient stay, but higher hospitalization costs compared to local resident patients. CONCLUSIONS: Floating migrant patients had a different age distribution, severity of injuries, diseases, inpatient duration and hospitalization cost compared with local resident patients. Compared to local resident patients, floating migrants had a higher risk to RTIs and were more vulnerable to severer traffic accidents at lower ages.","publish_time":"2014-01-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Chungui; Wang, Yanhua; Han, Na; Kou, Yuhui; Yin, Xiaofeng; Zhang, Peixun; Wang, Tianbing; Zhang, Dianying; Jiang, Baoguo","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f18489a27432115deff5b9be2dd2e0af9d8409a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3903469.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3903469/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzMw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["floating migrant patients","local resident patients","Inpatient diagnoses of RTI patients","general characteristics of RTI patients","severity of injuries","characteristics of floating migrant population","floating migrants","local residents","severe traffic injuries","inpatient duration","open injuries","road traffic injuries","RTIs","lower ages","higher incidence of accidents","duration of inpatient stays","higher hospitalization costs","lower duration of inpatient stay","higher risk","severer traffic accidents","RTI patient records","descriptive study","different age distribution","International Classification of Diseases","Center Hospital of Tianjin","group differences","Revision","description","demographics","harbor city of China","ICD","CONCLUSIONS","codes","order","BACKGROUND","aim","METHODS","RESULTS","People","years"],"language":"en"},

For this purpose, we have formulated and analysed a metapopulation model in which the individuals in each subpopulation are organised into a scale-free contact network. The long-distance travellers between the subpopulations will temporarily change the network structure of the destination subpopulation through the \u201Cmerging effects (MEs),\u201D which indicates that the travellers will be regarded as either connected components or isolated nodes in the contact network. The results show that the presence of the MEs has constantly accelerated the transmission of the diseases and aggravated the outbreaks compared to the scenario in which the diversity of the long-distance travel types is arbitrarily discarded. Sensitivity analyses show that these results are relatively constant regarding a wide range variation of several model parameters.

When NA cells pretreated with rAAV-N796 were challenged with RABV, there was a 37.8 \u00B1 3.4% to 55.1 \u00B1 5.3% reduction in RABV virus titer. When cells pre-challenged with RABV were treated with rAAV-N796, there was a 4.4 \u00B1 1.4 to 28.8 \u00B1 3.2% reduction in RABV virus titer. Relative quantification of RABV transcripts using real-time PCR and Western blot revealed that the knockdown of RABV-N gene transcripts was based on the rAAV-N796 inoculation titer. When any NA cells were treated with rAAV-N796 before or after challenged with RABV, significant reduction in virus titer was observed in both administrations. Mice treated intracerebrally with rAAV-N796 exhibited 50 \u00B1 5.3 and 62.5 \u00B1 4.7% protection when challenged intracerebrally or intramuscally, respectively, with lethal RABV.

Previously, we demonstrated the efficacy of our first-generation vaccine in blocking heroin self-administration in rats, however, many vaccine components can be modified to further improve performance. Herein we examine the effects of varying heroin vaccine injection route and adjuvant formulation. Mice immunized via subcutaneous (sc) injection exhibited inferior anti-heroin titers compared to intraperitoneal (ip) and sc/ip coadministration injection routes. Addition of TLR9 agonist cytosine-guanine oligodeoxynucleotide 1826 (CpG ODN 1826) to the original alum adjuvant elicited superior antibody titers and opioid affinities compared to alum alone. To thoroughly assess vaccine efficacy, full dose\u2013response curves were generated for heroin-induced analgesia in both hot plate and tail immersion tests. Mice treated with CpG ODN 1826 exhibited greatly shifted dose\u2013response curves (10\u201313-fold vs unvaccinated controls) while non-CpG ODN vaccine groups did not exhibit the same robust effect (2\u20137-fold shift for ip and combo, 2\u20133-fold shift for sc). Our results suggest that CpG ODN 1826 is a highly potent adjuvant, and injection routes should be considered for development of small molecule\u2013protein conjugate vaccines.

METHODS: We examined gene expression profiles in L-O2-X cells, an engineered L-O2 cell line that constitutively expresses HBx, relative to L-O2 cells using an Agilent 22 K human 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray representing more than 21,329 unique, well-characterized Homo sapiens genes. Western blot analysis and RNA interference (RNAi) targeting HBx mRNA validated the overexpression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Bcl-2 in L-O2-X cells. Meanwhile, the BrdU incorporation assay was used to test cell proliferation mediated by upregulated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). RESULTS: The microarray showed that the expression levels of 152 genes were remarkably altered; 82 of the genes were upregulated and 70 genes were downregulated in L-O2-X cells. The altered genes were associated with signal transduction pathways, cell cycle, metastasis, transcriptional regulation, immune response, metabolism, and other processes. PCNA and Bcl-2 were upregulated in L-O2-X cells. Furthermore, we found that COX-2 upregulation in L-O2-X cells enhanced proliferation using the BrdU incorporation assay, whereas indomethacin (an inhibitor of COX-2) abolished the promotion. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide new evidence that HBx is able to regulate many genes that may be involved in the carcinogenesis. These regulated genes mediated by HBx may serve as molecular targets for the prevention and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.","publish_time":"2009-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Wei-ying; Xu, Fu-qing; Shan, Chang-liang; Xiang, Rong; Ye, Li-hong; Zhang, Xiao-dong","journal":"Acta Pharmacol Sin","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5b6d465b8bdc9073442e0349d75211417cc02b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4002275.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4002275/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzEyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","PCNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["O2 cells","O2-X cells","altered genes","O2 cell line","regulated genes","HBx mRNA","cell proliferation","cell cycle","well-characterized Homo sapiens genes","gene expression profiles","human liver cell model","hepatitis B virus X protein","BrdU incorporation assay","expression levels","PCNA","Bcl","inhibitor of COX","upregulated cyclooxygenase","overexpression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen","molecular targets","mer oligonucleotide microarray","molecular features of pathogenesis","metastasis","transcriptional regulation","RNA interference","signal transduction pathways","RNAi","immune response","metabolism","prevention","new evidence","indomethacin","Western blot analysis","findings","Agilent","treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma","CONCLUSION","METHODS","upregulation","processes","AIM","RESULTS","promotion","carcinogenesis"],"language":"en"},

We aimed at characterizing the liver pathology in CCHF virus-infected IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice by immunohistochemistry and employed the model to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of ribavirin, arbidol, and T-705 against CCHF virus. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: CCHF virus-infected IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice died 2\u20136 days post infection with elevated aminotransferase levels and high virus titers in blood and organs. Main pathological alteration was acute hepatitis with extensive bridging necrosis, reactive hepatocyte proliferation, and mild to moderate inflammatory response with monocyte/macrophage activation. Virus-infected and apoptotic hepatocytes clustered in the necrotic areas. Ribavirin, arbidol, and T-705 suppressed virus replication in vitro by \u22653 log units (IC(50) 0.6\u20132.8 \u00B5g/ml; IC(90) 1.2\u20134.7 \u00B5g/ml). Ribavirin [100 mg/(kg\u00D7d)] did not increase the survival rate of IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice, but prolonged the time to death (p\u003C0.001) and reduced the aminotransferase levels and the virus titers. Arbidol [150 mg/(kg\u00D7d)] had no efficacy in vivo. Animals treated with T-705 at 1 h [15, 30, and 300 mg/(kg\u00D7d)] or up to 2 days [300 mg/(kg\u00D7d)] post infection survived, showed no signs of disease, and had no virus in blood and organs. Co-administration of ribavirin and T-705 yielded beneficial rather than adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Activated hepatic macrophages and monocyte-derived cells may play a role in the proinflammatory cytokine response in CCHF. Clustering of infected hepatocytes in necrotic areas without marked inflammation suggests viral cytopathic effects. T-705 is highly potent against CCHF virus in vitro and in vivo. Its in vivo efficacy exceeds that of the current standard drug for treatment of CCHF, ribavirin.","publish_time":"2014-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oestereich, Lisa; Rieger, Toni; Neumann, Melanie; Bernreuther, Christian; Lehmann, Maria; Krasemann, Susanne; Wurr, Stephanie; Emmerich, Petra; de Lamballerie, Xavier; \u00D6lschl\u00E4ger, Stephan; G\u00FCnther, Stephan","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/25e53f84ee9bb3d0f9be47a740938c12dbbd559b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4006714.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4006714/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzEyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CCHF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CCHF virus-infected IFNAR","Mice","high virus titers","treatment of CCHF","suppressed virus replication","antiviral efficacy of ribavirin","arbidol","Clustering of infected hepatocytes","Co-administration of ribavirin","necrotic areas","days post infection","survival rate of IFNAR","blood","organs","\u00B5g","elevated aminotransferase levels","apoptotic hepatocytes","liver pathology","adverse effects","liver damage","moderate inflammatory response","monocyte-derived cells","proinflammatory cytokine response","viral cytopathic effects","extensive bridging necrosis","acute hepatitis","reactive hepatocyte proliferation","Congo hemorrhagic fever","hepatic macrophages","relevant aspects of Crimean","inflammation","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","Main pathological alteration","role","humans","type","current standard drug","macrophage activation","SIGNIFICANCE","model","interferon receptor","METHODOLOGY","log units","CONCLUSIONS","time","signs of disease","death","immunohistochemistry","BACKGROUND","Animals"],"language":"en"},

It discusses ontological and epistemic challenges raised in the humanities and social sciences, and attempts to systematically reply to their criticisms from the viewpoint of clinical medicine, philosophy of medicine, particularly the ontology of disease and the epistemology of diagnosis, and medical ethics. The ontological challenge focuses on the doubt about the persistence of a disease over historical time, whereas the epistemic challenge disputes the inaccessibility of scientific verification of a diagnosis in the past. I argue that the critics are in error in conflating the taxonomy of disease (nosology) and the act of diagnosing a patient. Medical diagnosis is fundamentally a hypothesis-construction and an explanatory device that can be generated under various degrees of uncertainty and limited amount of information. It is not an apodictic judgment (true or false) as the critics presuppose, but a probabilistic (Bayesian) judgment with varying degrees of plausibility under uncertainty. In order to avoid this confusion, I propose that retrospective diagnosis of a historical figure be syndromic without identifying underlying disease, unless there is justifiable reason for such specification. Moreover it should be evaluated not only from the viewpoint of medical science but also in a larger context of the scholarship of the humanities and social sciences by its overall plausibility and consistency. On the other hand, I will endorse their concerns regarding the ethics and professionalism of retrospective diagnosis, and call for the need for situating such a diagnosis in an interdisciplinary scope and the context of the scholarship of the historical figure. I will then enumerate several important caveats for interdisciplinary retrospective diagnosis using an example of the retrospective diagnosis of Socrates for his life-long intermittent neurologic symptoms. Finally, I will situate the present argument in a larger context of the major debate among the historians of medicine and paleopathologists, and discuss the similarities and differences.","publish_time":"2014-05-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muramoto, Osamu","journal":"Philos Ethics Humanit Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1eb35b941f7e07060926dbac6e49c295e1fbfa88.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4049481.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4049481/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzE2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Socrates"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Medical diagnosis","interdisciplinary retrospective diagnosis","epistemology of diagnosis","retrospective diagnosis of Socrates","professionalism of retrospective diagnosis","ethical underpinnings of posthumous diagnosis of famous historical figures","historical time","underlying disease","larger context","ontology of disease","taxonomy of disease","medical ethics","philosophy of medicine","historians of medicine","humanities","scholarship","viewpoint of clinical medicine","social sciences","ontological challenge","viewpoint of medical science","critics","varying degrees of plausibility","various degrees of uncertainty","overall plausibility","epistemic challenges","interdisciplinary scope","apodictic judgment","life","example","major debate","inaccessibility of scientific verification","artistic products","hypothesis-construction","Bayesian","persistence","doubt","important caveats","explanatory device","justifiable reason","intermittent neurologic symptoms","essay","concerns","paleopathologists","act","nosology","consistency","present argument","criticisms","error","confusion","similarities","specification","information","past","need","differences","aim","hand","patient","order"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to determine serum malondialdehyde (MDA) levels during the first week of follow up, whether such levels are associated with severity during the first week and whether non-surviving patients showed higher MDA levels than survivors during the first week. METHODS: We performed an observational, prospective, multicenter study in six Spanish Intensive Care Units. Serum levels of MDA were measured in 328 patients (215 survivors and 113 non-survivors) with severe sepsis at days one, four and eight of diagnosis, and in 100 healthy controls. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality and the secondary endpoint was six -month mortality. The association between continuous variables was carried out using Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient. Cox regression analysis was applied to determine the independent contribution of serum MDA levels on the prediction of 30-day and 6-month mortality. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated as measures of the clinical impact of the predictor variables. RESULTS: We found higher serum MDA in septic patients at day one (p \u003C 0.001), day four (p \u003C 0.001) and day eight (p \u003C 0.001) of diagnosis than in healthy controls. Serum MDA was lower in surviving than non-surviving septic patients at day one (p \u003C 0.001), day four (p \u003C 0.001) and day eight (p \u003C 0.001). Serum MDA levels were positively correlated with lactic acid and SOFA during the first week. Finally, serum MDA levels were associated with 30-day mortality (HR = 1.05; 95% CI = 1.02-1.09; p = 0.005) and six-month mortality (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.05; 95% CI = 1.02-1.09; p = 0.003) after controlling for lactic acid levels, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE)-II, diabetes mellitus, bloodstream infection and chronic renal failure. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest series providing data on the oxidative state in septic patients to date. The novel finding is that high serum MDA levels sustained throughout the first week of follow up were associated with severity and mortality in septic patients.","publish_time":"2013-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lorente, Leonardo; Mart\u00EDn, Mar\u00EDa M; Abreu-Gonz\u00E1lez, Pedro; Dom\u00EDnguez-Rodriguez, Alberto; Labarta, Lorenzo; D\u00EDaz, C\u00E9sar; Sol\u00E9-Viol\u00E1n, Jordi; Ferreres, Jos\u00E9; Cabrera, Judith; Ige\u00F1o, Jose Carlos; Jim\u00E9nez, Alejandro","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fbc71b4b125e8c1c9206b2e444ae9b48f54ba571.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4055989.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4055989/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzE3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDA","Intensive Care Units"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Serum levels of MDA","day mortality","high serum MDA levels","higher MDA levels","higher serum MDA","independent contribution of serum MDA levels","week","serum malondialdehyde","lactic acid levels","non-surviving patients","non-surviving septic patients","six-month mortality","non-survivors","Hazard ratio","diagnosis","severity","healthy controls","multicenter study","secondary endpoint","hyperoxidative state","primary endpoint","continuous variables","predictor variables","severe sepsis","chronic health evaluation","chronic renal failure","acute physiology","bloodstream infection","APACHE","diabetes mellitus","Spanish Intensive Care Units","data","largest series","novel finding","clinical impact","date","Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient","prediction","knowledge","measures","days","confidence intervals","SOFA","RESULTS","Cox regression analysis","association","INTRODUCTION","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","objective"],"language":"en"},

The GenOSept study was designed to determine genetic influences on sepsis outcome. Phenotypic data was recorded using a robust clinical database allowing a contemporary analysis of the clinical characteristics, microbiology, outcomes and independent risk factors in patients with severe CAP admitted to ICUs across Europe. METHODS: Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine mortality rates. A Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) model was used to identify variables independently associated with 28-day and six-month mortality. RESULTS: Data from 1166 patients admitted to 102 centres across 17 countries was extracted. Median age was 64 years, 62% were male. Mortality rate at 28 days was 17%, rising to 27% at six months. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the commonest organism isolated (28% of cases) with no organism identified in 36%. Independent risk factors associated with an increased risk of death at six months included APACHE II score (hazard ratio, HR, 1.03; confidence interval, CI, 1.01-1.05), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates (HR1.44; CI 1.11-1.87) and ventilator support (HR 3.04; CI 1.64-5.62). Haematocrit, pH and urine volume on day one were all associated with a worse outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rate in patients with severe CAP admitted to European ICUs was 27% at six months. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the commonest organism isolated. In many cases the infecting organism was not identified. Ventilator support, the presence of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, lower haematocrit, urine volume and pH on admission were independent predictors of a worse outcome.","publish_time":"2014-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walden, Andrew P; Clarke, Geraldine M; McKechnie, Stuart; Hutton, Paula; Gordon, Anthony C; Rello, Jordi; Chiche, Jean-Daniel; Stueber, Frank; Garrard, Christopher S; Hinds, Charles J","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/666b7a42e5eace656f7b8b9a95c8c72a222fce0b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4056764.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4056764/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzE3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Community","Intensive Care Unit","Cox Proportional Hazards","CI"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["patients","CI","months","independent risk factors","commonest organism isolated","severe CAP","six-month mortality","mortality rates","infecting organism","worse outcome","admission","urine volume","independent predictors","Streptococcus pneumoniae","ventilator support","sepsis outcome","cases","increased risk of death","bilateral pulmonary infiltrates","contemporary analysis","lower haematocrit","presence of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates","clinical characteristics","European ICUs","Phenotypic data","robust clinical database","Kaplan-Meier analysis","microbiology","outcomes","Intensive Care Unit","model","APACHE","hazard ratio","score","common infectious reason","genetic influences","Cox Proportional Hazards","HR1","confidence interval","years","METHODS","INTRODUCTION","Community","CONCLUSIONS","GenOSept study","Median age","variables","centres","RESULTS","days","countries","male"],"language":"en"},

Fruit-bats of the genus Pteropus (commonly known as flying-foxes) are the natural host of the virus, and the putative source of infection in horses; infected horses are the source of human infection. Effective treatment is lacking in both horses and humans, and notwithstanding the recent availability of a vaccine for horses, exposure risk mitigation remains an important infection control strategy. This study sought to inform risk mitigation by identifying spatial and environmental risk factors for equine infection using multiple analytical approaches to investigate the relationship between plausible variables and reported Hendra virus infection in horses. Spatial autocorrelation (Global Moran\u2019s I) showed significant clustering of equine cases at a distance of 40 km, a distance consistent with the foraging \u2018footprint\u2019 of a flying-fox roost, suggesting the latter as a biologically plausible basis for the clustering. Getis-Ord Gi* analysis identified multiple equine infection hot spots along the eastern Australia coast from far north Queensland to central New South Wales, with the largest extending for nearly 300 km from southern Queensland to northern New South Wales. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) showed the density of P. alecto and P. conspicillatus to have the strongest positive correlation with equine case locations, suggesting these species are more likely a source of infection of Hendra virus for horses than P. poliocephalus or P. scapulatus. The density of horses, climate variables and vegetation variables were not found to be a significant risk factors, but the residuals from the GWR suggest that additional unidentified risk factors exist at the property level. Further investigations and comparisons between case and control properties are needed to identify these local risk factors.","publish_time":"2014-06-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Craig; Skelly, Chris; Kung, Nina; Roberts, Billie; Field, Hume","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5731fc26e72aba85b25549b527871aba02053b50.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4061024.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4061024/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzE5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["P. scapulatus"],"organizations":["GWR"],"locations":["Australia","Queensland","New South Wales"],"keyphrases":["density of horses","fatal infection","infected horses","reported Hendra virus infection","source of human infection","putative source of infection","significant risk factors","environmental risk factors","local risk factors","multiple equine infection hot spots","important infection control strategy","exposure risk mitigation","additional unidentified risk factors","plausible variables","equine case locations","significant clustering of equine cases","climate variables","vegetation variables","GWR","humans","central New South Wales","northern New South Wales","eastern Australia coast","north Queensland","southern Queensland","control properties","Spatial autocorrelation","flying-foxes","distance consistent","plausible basis","multiple analytical approaches","flying-fox roost","analysis","relationship","strongest positive correlation","vaccine","conspicillatus","footprint","Global Moran\u2019s","species","residuals","Getis-Ord Gi","genus Pteropus","foraging","comparisons","largest extending","recent availability","poliocephalus","natural host","property level","Fruit-bats","investigations","weighted regression","alecto","Effective treatment","scapulatus","study"],"language":"en"},

We describe a multiplex assay for the study of neutralizing antibodies that are directed against both influenza H5 and H7 HA. This assay permits the measurement of neutralizing antibody responses against two antigenically distinct HAs in the same serum/plasma sample thus increasing the amount and quality of serological data that can be acquired from valuable sera. Sera obtained from chickens vaccinated with a monovalent H5N2 vaccine, chickens vaccinated with a bivalent H7N1/H5N9 vaccine, or turkeys naturally infected with an H7N3 virus were evaluated in this assay and the results correlated strongly with data obtained by HI assay. We show that pseudotypes are highly stable under basic cold-chain storage conditions and following multiple rounds of freeze-thaw.

Outbreaks are associated with high morbidity and create a public health challenge for countries affected. Recent outbreaks have occurred in both Europe and the Americas, suggesting CHIKV may continue to spread. Despite the sustained threat of the virus, there is no approved vaccine or antiviral therapy against CHIKV. Therefore, it is critical to develop a vaccine that is both well tolerated and highly protective. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we describe the construction and characterization of a modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) virus expressing CHIKV E3 and E2 proteins (MVA-CHIK) that protected several mouse models from challenge with CHIKV. In particular, BALB/c mice were completely protected against viremia upon challenge with CHIKV after two doses of MVA-CHIK. Additionally, A129 mice (deficient in IFN\u03B1/\u03B2) were protected from viremia, footpad swelling, and mortality. While high anti-virus antibodies were elicited, low or undetectable levels of neutralizing antibodies were produced in both mouse models. However, passive transfer of MVA-CHIK immune serum to na\u00EFve mice did not protect against mortality, suggesting that antibodies may not be the main effectors of protection afforded by MVA-CHIK. Furthermore, depletion of CD4(\u002B), but not CD8(\u002B) T-cells from vaccinated mice resulted in 100% mortality, implicating the indispensable role of CD4(\u002B) T-cells in the protection afforded by MVA-CHIK. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results presented herein demonstrate the potential of MVA to effectively express CHIKV E3-E2 proteins and generate protective immune responses. Our findings challenge the assumption that only neutralizing antibodies are effective in providing protection against CHIKV, and provides a framework for the development of novel, more effective vaccine strategies to combat CHIKV.","publish_time":"2014-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weger-Lucarelli, James; Chu, Haiyan; Aliota, Matthew T.; Partidos, Charalambos D.; Osorio, Jorge E.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3aa75376556fa96324ad4cacb0b862ad86b7a11e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4109897.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4109897/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzIyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHIKV","MVA"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["MVA-CHIK","potential of MVA","doses of MVA","express CHIKV E3-E2 proteins","Chikungunya virus","high anti-virus antibodies","passive transfer of MVA","mortality","CHIK immune serum","na\u00EFve mice","c mice","vaccinated mice","A129 mice","modified Vaccinia virus Ankara","undetectable levels of neutralizing antibodies","effective vaccine strategies","approved vaccine","T-cells","viremia","public health challenge","mouse models","protective immune responses","main effectors of protection","high morbidity","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","Recent outbreaks","depletion of CD4","indispensable role of CD4","characterization","febrile illness","development of novel","re-emerging arbovirus","construction","IFN\u03B1","Europe","antiviral therapy","assumption","arthralgia","results","rash","study","BALB","countries","framework","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","SIGNIFICANCE","METHODOLOGY","CD8","sustained threat","footpad","Americas","years"],"language":"en"},

Viable P aeruginosa are contained in aerosols produced during coughing, raising the possibility of airborne transmission. METHODS: Using purpose-built equipment, we measured viable P aeruginosa in cough aerosols at 1, 2 and 4 m from the subject (distance) and after allowing aerosols to age for 5, 15 and 45 min in a slowly rotating drum to minimise gravitational settling and inertial impaction (duration). Aerosol particles were captured and sized employing an Anderson Impactor and cultured using conventional microbiology. Sputum was also cultured and lung function and respiratory muscle strength measured. RESULTS: Nineteen patients with CF, mean age 25.8 (SD 9.2) years, chronically infected with P aeruginosa, and 10 healthy controls, 26.5 (8.7) years, participated. Viable P aeruginosa were detected in cough aerosols from all patients with CF, but not from controls; travelling 4 m in 17/18 (94%) and persisting for 45 min in 14/18 (78%) of the CF group. Marked inter-subject heterogeneity of P aeruginosa aerosol colony counts was seen and correlated strongly (r=0.73\u20130.90) with sputum bacterial loads. Modelling decay of viable P aeruginosa in a clinic room suggested that at the recommended ventilation rate of two air changes per hour almost 50 min were required for 90% to be removed after an infected patient left the room.

The identification of genetic predictors of increased risk might suggest novel therapeutic targets for such patients. In AIDS Clinical Trials Group protocol 384, antiretroviral-na\u00EFve patients were randomized to d4T/didanosine (ddI)- or zidovudine/lamivudine-containing regimens.

The necessary attributes for transfusion transmission were outlined including: presence of the agent in blood during the donor\u0027s asymptomatic phase, the agent\u0027s survival/persistence in blood during processing/storage, and lastly that the agent must be recognized as responsible for a clinically apparent outcome in at least a proportion of recipients who become infected. Without these attributes, agents are not considered as a transfusion-transmission threat and were excluded. Sixty-eight such agents were identified with enough evidence/likelihood of transfusion transmission (e.g., blood phase) and potential for clinical disease to warrant further consideration. In the Supplement, Fact Sheets (FS) were published providing information on: agent classification; disease agent\u0027s importance; clinical syndromes/diseases caused; transmission modes (including vectors/reservoirs); likelihood of transfusion transmission, and if proven to be transfusion-transmitted, information on known cases; the feasibility/predicted success of interventions for donor screening (questioning) and tests available for diagnostics/ adapted for donor screening; and finally, the efficacy, if known, of inactivation methods for plasma-derived products. The Supplement included a separate section on pathogen reduction using published data. Agents were prioritized relative to their scientific/epidemiologic threat and their perceived threat to the community including concerns expressed by the regulators of blood. Agents given the highest priority due to a known transfusion-transmission threat and severe/fatal disease in recipients were the vCJD prion, dengue viruses and the obligate red-cell parasite that causes babesiosis (B. microti and related Babesia). Although the focus of the Supplement was towards the United States and Canada, many of the agents (and the process) are applicable worldwide. NEXT STEPS: Since the publication of the Supplement, six new FSs (yellow fever viruses-including vaccine breakthrough infections, miscellaneous arboviruses, XMRV, human parvoviruses/bocaviruses other than B19, and most recently the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS-CoV) were added and 14 existing FSs updated (Anaplasma, Babesia, Bartonella, Erhlichia, chronic wasting disease-CWD, human prions other than vCJD, vCJD, Coxiella burnetii-the agent of Q fever, dengue viruses, HAV, HEV, Japanese encephalitis-JE complex, tick-borne encephalitis viruses-TBEV, and human parvovirus B19). Also, tables were released outlining pathogen reduction clinical trials/results (published) and availability/commercial routine use of such technologies by country. Of necessity, the list of EID agents is not, and can never be, complete due to the nature of emergence. We recognized that a system of assessing the risk/threat of EIDs for their potential impact on blood safety and availability must include processes for monitoring, identifying, evaluating, estimating severity, assessing risk and developing interventions. Thus, a \u2018toolkit\u2019 containing the necessary \u2018tools\u2019 from EID monitoring (horizon scanning) to validation/effectiveness evaluations of interventions is being developed. The goal is, to develop a systematic approach to risk assessment and intervention development for the impact of emerging infectious upon blood safety intended to educate and provide advise about risks/interventions in a timely/accurate fashion. CONCLUSIONS: The process and final product (toolkit) including methods to monitor EID agent emergence, identification/recognition of a transfusion-transmission threat, methods for quantitative risk assessments, and the appropriate management of such threats should be considered for implementation by all blood systems.","publish_time":"2014-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stramer, S L","journal":"ISBT Sci Ser","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ff2ac3737c6edf81ff29b8d72c3abc2b3df5b344.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4142007.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4142007/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzI1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Coxiella"],"organizations":["AABB","Transfusion Safety","EID"],"locations":["United States","Canada","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["Transfusion Safety","known transfusion-transmission threat","likelihood of transfusion transmission","Potential Threat","Emerging Infectious Disease Agents","blood safety","Supplement","clinical disease","blood phase","perceived threat","epidemiologic threat","threat of EIDs","theoretical threat","list of EID agents","fatal disease","transmission modes","regulators of blood","dengue viruses","disease agent\u0027s importance","impact of emerging infectious","potential impact","agent classification","EID monitoring","published data","yellow fever viruses","agent of Q fever","chronic wasting disease-CWD","tick-borne encephalitis viruses-TBEV","clinical syndromes","human parvoviruses","human prions","vCJD prion","human parvovirus B19","donor screening","predicted success of interventions","availability","effectiveness evaluations of interventions","risk assessment","known cases","information","existing FSs","necessary attributes","outlining pathogen reduction clinical trials","existing effective intervention","agent\u0027s survival","intervention development","new FSs","proportion of recipients","related Babesia","donor\u0027s asymptomatic phase","Japanese encephalitis-JE complex","vaccine breakthrough infections","XMRV","miscellaneous arboviruses","Erhlichia","HEV","HAV","horizon scanning","babesiosis","validation","Bartonella","tools\u2019","questioning","persistence","feasibility","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","results","diseases","reservoirs","MERS-CoV","obligate red-cell parasite","Coxiella burnetii","separate section","tests available","diagnostics","systematic approach","Anaplasma","concerns","inactivation methods","plasma-derived products","microti","processing","community","bocaviruses","vectors","tables","storage","processes","highest priority","evidence","presence","apparent outcome","commercial routine","technologies","accurate fashion","United States","Fact Sheets","publication","Canada","AABB","Stramer","necessity","nature of emergence","country","group","efficacy","toolkit","risks","severity","consideration","STEPS","goal","focus","BACKGROUND","methods","recognition","quantitative risk assessments","transfusion-transmission threat","EID agent emergence","identification","final product","appropriate management","process"],"language":"en"},

The causal mechanism(s) linking these illnesses is unknown. We hypothesized autoimmune responses may be involved in both disorders. OBJECTIVES: To discover an antigen-specific autoimmune response associated with both emphysema and osteoporosis among smokers. METHODS: Replicate nonbiased discovery assays indicated that autoimmunity to glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone and cell surface signaling receptor, is present in many smokers. Subject assessments included spirometry, chest CT scans, dual x-ray absorptiometry, and immunoblots for anti-GRP78 IgG. Anti-GRP78 autoantibodies were isolated from patient plasma by affinity chromatography, leukocyte functions assessed by flow cytometry, and soluble metabolites and mediators measured by immunoassays. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Circulating anti-GRP78 IgG autoantibodies were detected in plasma specimens from 86 (32%) of the 265 smoking subjects. Anti-GRP78 autoantibodies were singularly prevalent among subjects with radiographic emphysema (OR 3.1, 95%CI 1.7\u20135.7, p = 0.003). Anti-GRP78 autoantibodies were also associated with osteoporosis (OR 4.7, 95%CI 1.7\u201313.3, p = 0.002), and increased circulating bone metabolites (p = 0.006). Among emphysematous subjects, GRP78 protein was an autoantigen of CD4 T-cells, stimulating lymphocyte proliferation (p = 0.0002) and IFN-gamma production (p = 0.03). Patient-derived anti-GRP78 autoantibodies had avidities for osteoclasts and macrophages, and increased macrophage NFkB phosphorylation (p = 0.005) and productions of IL-8, CCL-2, and MMP9 (p = 0.005, 0.007, 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Humoral and cellular GRP78 autoimmune responses in smokers have numerous biologically-relevant pro-inflammatory and other deleterious actions, and are associated with emphysema and osteoporosis. These findings may have relevance for the pathogenesis of smoking-associated diseases, and development of biomarker immunoassays and/or novel treatments for these disorders.","publish_time":"2014-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bon, Jessica; Kahloon, Rehan; Zhang, Yingze; Xue, Jianmin; Fuhrman, Carl R.; Tan, Jiangning; Burger, Mathew; Kass, Daniel J.; Csizmadia, Eva; Otterbein, Leo; Chandra, Divay; Bhargava, Arpit; Pilewski, Joseph M.; Roodman, G.

We therefore set out to quantify, in a population-based adult general population cohort, the possible protection against acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) conferred by a person\u2019s self-perceived hand-washing frequency. METHODS: During the pandemic influenza season from September 2009 through May 2010, a cohort of 4365 adult residents of Stockholm County, Sweden, reported respiratory illnesses in real-time. A questionnaire about typical contact and hand-washing behaviour was administered at the end of the period (response rate 70%). RESULTS: There was no significant decrease in ARI rates among adults with increased daily hand-washing frequency: Compared to 2\u20134 times/day, 5\u20139 times was associated with an adjusted ARI rate ratio (RR) of 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87-1.33), 10\u201319 times with RR = 1.22 (CI 0.97-1.53), and \u226520 times with RR = 1.03 (CI 0.81-1.32). A similar lack of effect was seen for influenza-like illness, and in all investigated subgroups. We found no clear effect modification by contact behaviour. Health care workers exhibited rate ratio point estimates below unity, but no dose-risk trend. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that increases in what adult laymen perceive as being adequate hand-washing may not significantly reduce the risk of ARIs. This might have implications for the design of public health campaigns in the face of threatening outbreaks of respiratory infections. However, the generalizability of our results to non-pandemic circumstances should be further explored.

Smoking has a systemic negative impact on CFTR function. A diagnostic comparison between NPD and ICM and the impact of smoking on both CFTR tests has not been done. METHODS: The sweat chloride test, NPD, and ICM were performed in 18 patients with CF (sweat chloride \u003E60 mmol/l), including 6 pancreatic sufficient (PS) patients, and 13 healthy controls, including 8 smokers. The NPD CFTR response to Cl-free and isoproterenol perfusion (\u03940Cl(-) \u002B Iso) was compared to the ICM CFTR response to forskolin/IBMX, carbachol, and histamine (\u0394I(sc, forskolin/IBMX\u002B carbachol\u002Bhistamine)). RESULTS: The mean NPD CFTR response and ICM CFTR response between patients with CF and healthy controls was significantly different (p \u003C0.001), but not between patients with CF who were PS and those who were pancreatic insufficient (PI). Smokers have a decreased CFTR response measured by NPD (p = 0.049). For ICM there is a trend towards decreased CFTR response (NS). Three healthy control smokers had NPD responses within the CF-range. In contrast to NPD, there was no overlap of the ICM response between patients with CF and controls. CONCLUSIONS: ICM is superior to NPD in distinguishing between patients with CF who have a sweat chloride \u003E 60 mmol/l and healthy controls, including smokers. Neither NPD nor ICM differentiated between patients with CF who were PS from those who were PI. Smoking has a negative impact on CFTR function in healthy controls measured by NPD and challenges the diagnostic interpretation of NPD, but not ICM.

Entamoeba histolytica is a major cause of amebic diarrhea in developing countries. It colonizes the colon lumen in close proximity to the gut microbiota. Interestingly, not all individuals are equally susceptible to E. histolytica infection. Therefore, as the microbiota is highly variable within individuals, we sought to determine if a component of the microbiota could regulate susceptibility to infection. In studies utilizing a murine model, we demonstrated that colonization of the gut with the commensal Clostridia-related bacteria known as segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) is protective during E. histolytica infection. SFB colonization in this model was associated with elevated cecal levels of interleukin 17A (IL-17A), dendritic cells, and neutrophils. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) from SFB-colonized mice had higher levels of IL-23 production in response to stimulation with trophozoites. Adoptive transfer of BMDCs from an SFB(\u002B) to an SFB(\u2212) mouse was sufficient to provide protection against E. histolytica. IL-17A induction during BMDC transfer was necessary for this protection. This work demonstrates that intestinal colonization with a specific commensal bacterium can provide protection during amebiasis in a murine model. Most importantly, this work demonstrates that the microbiome can mediate protection against an enteric infection via extraintestinal effects on bone marrow-derived dendritic cells.","publish_time":"2014-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burgess, Stacey L.; Buonomo, Erica; Carey, Maureen; Cowardin, Carrie; Naylor, Caitlin; Noor, Zannatun; Wills-Karp, Marsha; Petri, William A.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0afa3ea846396533c7ca515968abcfea3f895082.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4222101.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4222101/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzMxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Entamoeba"],"organizations":["SFB","BMDC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["histolytica infection","protection","SFB colonization","enteric infection","murine model","gut microbiota","Entamoeba histolytica","Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells","SFB-colonized mice","higher levels of IL","intestinal colonization","individuals","work","Adoptive transfer of BMDCs","commensal Clostridia-related bacteria","human microbiome","BMDC transfer","segmented filamentous bacteria","specific commensal bacterium","elevated cecal levels of interleukin","extraintestinal effects","major cause of amebic diarrhea","production","close proximity","amebiasis","developing countries","response","induction","aspects of health","colon lumen","emerging paradigm","stimulation","trophozoites","role","susceptibility","mouse","component","studies","neutrophils"],"language":"en"},

In a reverse reaction it synthesizes A-rich RNA tails. Its RNA-binding cap comprises the eukaryotic orthologs Rrp4 and Csl4, and an archaea-specific subunit annotated as DnaG. In Sulfolobus solfataricus DnaG and Rrp4 but not Csl4 show preference for poly(rA). Archaeal DnaG contains N- and C-terminal domains (NTD and CTD) of unknown function flanking a TOPRIM domain. We found that the NT and TOPRIM domains have comparable, high conservation in all archaea, while the CTD conservation correlates with the presence of exosome. We show that the NTD is a novel RNA-binding domain with poly(rA)-preference cooperating with the TOPRIM domain in binding of RNA. Consistently, a fusion protein containing full-length Csl4 and NTD of DnaG led to enhanced degradation of A-rich RNA by the exosome. We also found that DnaG strongly binds native and in vitro transcribed rRNA and enables its polynucleotidylation by the exosome. Furthermore, rRNA-derived transcripts with heteropolymeric tails were degraded faster by the exosome than their non-tailed variants. Based on our data, we propose that archaeal DnaG is an RNA-binding protein, which, in the context of the exosome, is involved in targeting of stable RNA for degradation.","publish_time":"2014-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hou, Linlin; Klug, Gabriele; Evguenieva-Hackenberg, Elena","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a3bf6f0444bb71c6d5b232122353d551a15d0a5f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4227792.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4227792/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzMxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTD","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["binding of RNA","NTD of DnaG","Archaeal DnaG","archaeal exosome","RNA-binding protein","RNA-binding cap","novel RNA-binding domain","rich RNA tails","presence of exosome","targeting of stable RNA","Sulfolobus solfataricus DnaG","TOPRIM domains","full-length Csl4","CTD conservation correlates","high conservation","preference cooperating","enhanced degradation","fusion protein","transcribed rRNA","heteropolymeric tails","eukaryotic orthologs Rrp4","C-terminal domains","archaea-specific subunit","rRNA-derived transcripts","unknown function","non-tailed variants","polynucleotidylation","phosphorolytic","reverse reaction","context","data","exoribonuclease complex"],"language":"en"},

However, despite these catastrophic events little Information is available on bat defences or how they interact with their pathogens. Even less is known about the response of bats to infection during torpor or long-term hibernation. Using tissue samples collected at the termination of an experiment to explore the pathogenesis of White Nose Syndrome in Little Brown Bats, we determined if hibernating bats infected with the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans could respond to infection by activating genes responsible for innate immune and stress responses. Lesions due to fungal infection and, in some cases, secondary bacterial infections, were restricted to the skin. However, we were unable to obtain sufficient amounts of RNA from these sites. We therefore examined lungs for response at an epithelial surface not linked to the primary site of infection. We found that bats responded to infection with a significant increase in lungs of transcripts for Cathelicidin (an anti-microbial peptide) as well as the immune modulators tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukins 10 and 23. In conclusion, hibernating bats can respond to experimental P. destructans infection by activating expression of innate immune response genes.","publish_time":"2014-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rapin, Noreen; Johns, Kirk; Martin, Lauren; Warnecke, Lisa; Turner, James M.; Bollinger, Trent K.; Willis, Craig K.

However, few studies have so far reviewed analyses of autopsy findings in patients with AE-IPF. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 52 consecutive patients with AE-IPF who underwent autopsies at five university hospitals and one municipal hospital between 1999 and 2013. The following variables were abstracted from the medical records: demographic and clinical data, autopsy findings and complications during the clinical course until death. RESULTS: The median age at autopsy was 71 years (range 47\u201386 years), and the subjects included 38 (73.1%) males. High-dose corticosteroid therapy was initiated in 45 (86.5%) patients after AE-IPF. The underling fibrotic lesion was classified as having the usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern in all cases. Furthermore, 41 (78.8%) patients had diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), 15 (28.8%) exhibited pulmonary hemorrhage, nine (17.3%) developed pulmonary thromboembolism and six (11.5%) were diagnosed with lung carcinoma. In addition, six (11.5%) patients developed pneumothorax prior to death and 26 (53.1%) developed diabetes that required insulin treatment after the administration of high-dose corticosteroid therapy. In addition, 15 (28.8%) patients presented with bronchopneumonia during their clinical course and/or until death, including fungal (seven, 13.5%), cytomegalovirus (six, 11.5%) and bacterial (five, 9.6%) infections. CONCLUSIONS: The pathological findings in patients with AE-IPF represent not only DAD, but also a variety of pathological conditions. Therefore, making a diagnosis of AE-IPF is often difficult, and the use of cautious diagnostic approaches is required for appropriate treatment.","publish_time":"2014-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oda, Keishi; Ishimoto, Hiroshi; Yamada, Sohsuke; Kushima, Hisako; Ishii, Hiroshi; Imanaga, Tomotoshi; Harada, Tatsuhiko; Ishimatsu, Yuji; Matsumoto, Nobuhiro; Naito, Keisuke; Yatera, Kazuhiro; Nakazato, Masamitsu; Kadota, Jun-ichi; Watanabe, Kentaro; Kohno, Shigeru; Mukae, Hiroshi","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/990f222ee5a26b7b1c09cfff878a1c987efd44b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4243719.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4243719/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzM0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AE-IPF","consecutive patients","diagnosis of AE","death","pathological findings","clinical course","reviewed analyses of autopsy findings","High-dose corticosteroid therapy","clinical data","administration of high","years","DAD","high mortality","pulmonary hemorrhage","pulmonary thromboembolism","addition","appropriate treatment","insulin treatment","Acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis","variety of pathological conditions","complications","medical records","UIP","pattern","use of cautious diagnostic approaches","university hospitals","usual interstitial pneumonia","BACKGROUND","median age","diffuse alveolar damage","autopsies","municipal hospital","RESULTS","range","bronchopneumonia","CONCLUSIONS","following variables","underling fibrotic lesion","cases","diabetes","studies","pneumothorax","lung carcinoma","METHODS","subjects","males","cytomegalovirus","infections"],"language":"en"},

Following zoonotic transmission, the pathogen may already have, or may acquire, the ability to transmit from human to human. With infections such as Lassa fever (LF), an often fatal, rodent-borne, hemorrhagic fever common in areas of West Africa, rodent-to-rodent, rodent-to-human, human-to-human and even human-to-rodent transmission patterns are possible. Indeed, large hospital-related outbreaks have been reported. Estimating the proportion of transmission due to human-to-human routes and related patterns (e.g. existence of super-spreaders), in these scenarios is challenging, but essential for planned interventions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we make use of an innovative modeling approach to analyze data from published outbreaks and the number of LF hospitalized patients to Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone to estimate the likely contribution of human-to-human transmission. The analyses show that almost [Image: see text] of the cases at KGH are secondary cases arising from human-to-human transmission. However, we found much of this transmission is associated with a disproportionally large impact of a few individuals (\u2018super-spreaders\u2019), as we found only [Image: see text] of human cases result in an effective reproduction number (i.e. the average number of secondary cases per infectious case) [Image: see text], with a maximum value up to [Image: see text]. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This work explains the discrepancy between the sizes of reported LF outbreaks and a clinical perception that human-to-human transmission is low. Future assessment of risks of LF and infection control guidelines should take into account the potentially large impact of super-spreaders in human-to-human transmission. Our work highlights several neglected topics in LF research, the occurrence and nature of super-spreading events and aspects of social behavior in transmission and detection.","publish_time":"2015-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lo Iacono, Giovanni; Cunningham, Andrew A.; Fichet-Calvet, Elisabeth; Garry, Robert F.; Grant, Donald S.; Khan, Sheik Humarr; Leach, Melissa; Moses, Lina M.; Schieffelin, John S.; Shaffer, Jeffrey G.; Webb, Colleen T.; Wood, James L.

It is the leading cause of death in HIV patients in Asia and Africa. No major advance has been made in the treatment of CM since the 1970s. The mainstays of induction therapy are amphotericin B and flucytosine, but these are often poorly available where the disease burden is highest. Adjunctive treatments, such as dexamethasone, have had dramatic effects on mortality in other neurologic infections, but are untested in CM. Given the high death rates in patients receiving current optimal treatment, and the lack of new agents on the horizon, adjuvant treatments, which offer the potential to reduce mortality in CM, should be tested. The principal research question posed by this study is as follows: does adding dexamethasone to standard antifungal therapy for CM reduce mortality? Dexamethasone is a cheap, readily available, and practicable intervention. METHOD: A double-blind placebo-controlled trial with parallel arms in which patients are randomised to receive either dexamethasone or placebo, in addition to local standard of care. The study recruits patients in both Asia and Africa to ensure the relevance of its results to the populations in which the disease burden is highest. The 10-week mortality risk in the control group is expected to be between 30% and 50%, depending on location, and the target hazard ratio of 0.7 corresponds to absolute risk reductions in mortality from 30% to 22%, or from 50% to 38%. Assuming an overall 10-week mortality of at least 30% in our study population, recruitment of 824 patients will be sufficient to observe the expected number of deaths. Allowing for some loss to follow-up, the total sample size for this study is 880 patients.

Virus-like particles (VLPs) are a promising vaccine candidate against EBOV. We recently showed that VLPs protect mice from lethal EBOV infection when given before or after viral infection. To elucidate pathways through which VLPs confer post-exposure protection, we investigated the role of type I interferon (IFN) signaling. We found that VLPs lead to accelerated induction of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) in liver and spleen of wild type mice, but not in Ifnar(-/-) mice. Accordingly, EBOV infected Ifnar(-/-) mice, unlike wild type mice succumbed to death even after VLP treatment. The ISGs induced in wild type mice included anti-viral proteins and negative feedback factors known to restrict viral replication and excessive inflammatory responses. Importantly, proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression was much higher in WT mice without VLPs than mice treated with VLPs. In EBOV infected Ifnar(-/-) mice, however, uninhibited viral replication and elevated proinflammatory factor expression ensued, irrespective of VLP treatment, supporting the view that type I IFN signaling helps to limit viral replication and attenuate inflammatory responses. Further analyses showed that VLP protection requires the transcription factor, IRF8 known to amplify type I IFN signaling in dendritic cells and macrophages, the probable sites of initial EBOV infection. Together, this study indicates that VLPs afford post-exposure protection by promoting expeditious initiation of type I IFN signaling in the host.","publish_time":"2015-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ayithan, Natarajan; Bradfute, Steven B.; Anthony, Scott M.; Stuthman, Kelly S.; Bavari, Sina; Bray, Mike; Ozato, Keiko","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/473b926e3266337d27883cca29c6186faf3d7ba2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4342244.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4342244/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBOV","IFN","VLP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["WT mice","spleen of wild type mice","viral infection","role of type","VLPs lead","EBOV infected Ifnar","lethal EBOV infection","uninhibited viral replication","expeditious initiation of type","VLP protection","VLP treatment","anti-viral proteins","probable sites of initial EBOV infection","post-exposure protection","ISGs","accelerated induction of IFN stimulated genes","elevated proinflammatory factor expression","excessive inflammatory responses","chemokine expression","transcription factor","proinflammatory cytokine","Ebola virus","negative feedback factors","liver","macrophages","dendritic cells","severe hemorrhagic disease","IRF8","death","promising vaccine candidate","high fatality","view","particles","pathways","study","interferon","analyses","host"],"language":"en"},

To control these diseases various studies have been developed in the field of mathematical modelling, which is useful tool for understanding the epidemiological dynamics and their dependence on social mixing patterns. Method. We have used Bayesian approach to quantify the disease outbreak through key epidemiological parameter basic reproduction number (R (0)), using effective contacts, defined as sum of the product of incidence cases and probability of generation time distribution. We have estimated R (0) from daily case incidence data for pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 in India, for the initial phase. Result. The estimated R (0) with 95% credible interval is consistent with several other studies on the same strain. Through sensitivity analysis our study indicates that infectiousness affects the estimate of R (0). Conclusion. Basic reproduction number R (0) provides the useful information to the public health system to do some effort in controlling the disease by using mitigation strategies like vaccination, quarantine, and so forth.","publish_time":"2015-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kadi, Adiveppa S.; Avaradi, Shivakumari R.","journal":"Comput Math Methods Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b50ee1febe5e4b252cbc70678de7272524377ca1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4345055.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4345055/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["estimated R","estimate of R","Basic reproduction number R","influenza pandemic","pandemic influenza","H1N1","key epidemiological parameter basic reproduction number","diseases various studies","disease outbreak","epidemiological dynamics","useful tool","useful information","health authorities","product of incidence cases","public health system","Emergence of infectious diseases","daily case incidence data","probability of generation time distribution","sum","new challenges","dependence","infectiousness","study","social mixing patterns","mitigation strategies","vaccination","great concern","India","effort","field of mathematical modelling","sensitivity analysis","quarantine","Bayesian approach","credible interval","initial phase","effective contacts","strain","Background","Method","Result","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

In this study, a high-throughput cell-based screening on the serine/threonine kinase siRNA library was performed to identify potential antiviral agents against EV71 replication. Among the hits, Misshapen/NIKs-related kinase (MINK) was selected for detailed analysis due to its strong inhibitory profile and novelty. In the investigation of the stage at which MINK is involved in EV71 replication, virus RNA transfection in MINK siRNA-treated cells continued to cause virus inhibition despite bypassing the normal entry pathway, suggesting its involvement at the post-entry stage. We have also shown that viral RNA and protein expression level was significantly reduced upon MINK silencing, suggesting its involvement in viral protein synthesis which feeds into viral RNA replication process. Through proteomic analysis and infection inhibition assay, we found that the activation of MINK was triggered by early replication events, instead of the binding and entry of the virus. Proteomic analysis on the activation profile of p38 Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) indicated that the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was stimulated by EV71 infection upon MINK activation. Luciferase reporter assay further revealed that the translation efficiency of the EV71 internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) was reduced after blocking the MINK/p38 MAPK pathway. Further investigation on the effect of MINK silencing on heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) localisation demonstrated that cytoplasmic relocalisation of hnRNP A1 upon EV71 infection may be facilitated via the MINK/p38 MAPK pathway which then positively regulates the translation of viral RNA transcripts. These novel findings hence suggest that MINK plays a functional role in the IRES-mediated translation of EV71 viral RNA and may provide a potential target for the development of specific antiviral strategies against EV71 infection.","publish_time":"2015-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leong, Shi Yun; Ong, Bryan Kit Teck; Chu, Justin Jang Hann","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8f7ee410837cdbf7f974543e432d161fb70cd11.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4352056.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4352056/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MINK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["activation of MINK","MINK activation","EV71 replication","EV71 infection","effect of MINK silencing","IRES-mediated translation of EV71 viral RNA","viral RNA replication process","p38 MAPK pathway","MINK siRNA-treated cells","translation of viral RNA transcripts","virus RNA transfection","EV71 internal ribosomal entry site","viral protein synthesis","phosphorylation of p38 MAPK","infection inhibition assay","normal entry pathway","virus inhibition","proteomic analysis","activation profile of p38 Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase","post-entry stage","translation efficiency","involvement","early replication events","detailed analysis","investigation","cytoplasmic relocalisation of hnRNP A1","threonine kinase siRNA library","potential antiviral agents","protein expression level","NIKs-related kinase","heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1","potential target","strong inhibitory profile","Luciferase reporter assay","development of specific antiviral strategies","serine","young children","Foot","high-throughput cell-based screening","Mouth Disease","occasional occurrences of neurological complications","functional role","Hand","binding","study","hits","novelty","Human Enterovirus","novel findings"],"language":"en"},

Almost 2 million children die from ARTIs each year, and most of them are from developing countries. The prevalence and correlation of pathogens in ARTIs are poorly understood, but are critical for improving case prevention, treatment, and management. In this study, we investigated the prevalence and correlation of infectious agents in children with ARTIs. A total of 39,756 children with one or more symptoms, including fever, cough, sore throat, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, herpangina, pneumonia, and bronchiolitis, were enrolled in the study. All patients were hospitalized in Wuhan Children\u2019s Hospital between October 1, 2010 and September 30, 2012, and were evaluated for infectious agents. Pathogens, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Coxiella burnetii, were screened simultaneously in patient blood samples using anti-pathogen IgM tests. Regression analysis was used to reveal correlations among the pathogens. Our results showed that one or more pathogens were identified in 10,206 patients, and that Mycoplasma pneumoniae, adenoviruses, and influenza B virus were the leading infectious agents. Mixed-infections of pathogens were detected in 2,391 cases, with Mycoplasma pneumoniae as the most frequent pathogen. The most common agents in the co-infections were Mycoplasma pneumoniae and influenza B virus. Regression analysis revealed a linear correlation between the proportion of mixed infections and the incidence of multi-pathogen infections. The prevalence of infectious agents in children with ARTIs was determined. Equations were established to estimate multiple infections by single-pathogen detection.

To combat HCC effectively research is directed towards its early detection and the development of targeted therapies. Given the fact that epidermal growth factor (EGF) is an important mitogen for hepatocytes we searched for disease regulated proteins to improve an understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of EGF induced HCC. Disease regulated proteins were studied by 2DE MALDI-TOF/TOF and a transcriptomic approach, by immunohistochemistry and advanced bioinformatics. RESULTS: Mapping of EGF induced liver cancer in a transgenic mouse model identified n = 96 (p \u003C 0.05) significantly regulated proteins of which n = 54 were tumour-specific. To unravel molecular circuits linked to aberrant EGFR signalling diverse computational approaches were employed and this defined n = 7 key nodes using n = 82 disease regulated proteins for network construction. STRING analysis revealed protein-protein interactions of \u003E 70% disease regulated proteins with individual proteins being validated by immunohistochemistry. The disease regulated network proteins were mapped to distinct pathways and bioinformatics provided novel insight into molecular circuits associated with significant changes in either glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, argine and proline metabolism, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, Hif- and MAPK signalling, lipoprotein metabolism, platelet activation and hemostatic control as a result of aberrant EGF signalling. The biological significance of the findings was corroborated with gene expression data derived from tumour tissues to evntually define a rationale by which tumours embark on intriguing changes in metabolism that is of utility for an understanding of tumour growth. Moreover, among the EGF tumour specific proteins n = 11 were likewise uniquely expressed in human HCC and for n = 49 proteins regulation in human HCC was confirmed using the publically available Human Protein Atlas depository, therefore demonstrating clinical significance. CONCLUSION: Novel insight into the molecular pathogenesis of EGF induced liver cancer was obtained and among the 37 newly identified proteins several are likely candidates for the development of molecularly targeted therapies and include the nucleoside diphosphate kinase A, bifunctional ATP-dependent dihydroyacetone kinase and phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein1, the latter being an inhibitor of the Raf-1 kinase.

Endemic areas exhibit wide variations regarding severe disease frequency. This study, conducted simultaneously in Brazil and India, constitutes, to our knowledge, the first multisite study focused on clinical characterization of P. vivax severe disease. METHODS: Patients admitted with P. vivax mono-infection at reference centers in Manaus (Amazon - Brazil) and Bikaner (Rajasthan - India), where P. vivax predominates, were submitted to standard thorough clinical and laboratory evaluations in order to characterize clinical manifestations and identify concurrent co-morbidities. RESULTS: In total, 778 patients (88.0% above 12 years old) were hospitalized at clinical discretion with PCR-confirmed P. vivax mono-infection (316 in Manaus and 462 in Bikaner), of which 197 (25.3%) presented at least one severity criterion as defined by the World Health Organization (2010). Hyperlactatemia, respiratory distress, hypoglycemia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation were more frequent in Manaus. Noteworthy, pregnancy status was associated as a risk factor for severe disease (OR = 2.03; 95% CI = 1.2-3.4; P = 0.007). The overall case fatality rate was 0.3/1,000 cases in Manaus and 6.1/1,000 cases in Bikaner, with all deaths occurring among patients fulfilling at least one severity criterion. Within this subgroup, case fatality rates increased respectively to 7.5% in Manaus and 4.4% in Bikaner. CONCLUSION: P. vivax-associated severity is not negligible, and although lethality observed for complicated cases was similar, the overall fatality rate was about 20-fold higher in India compared to Brazil, highlighting the variability observed in different settings. Our observations highlight that pregnant women and patients with co-morbidities need special attention when infected by this parasite due to higher risk of complications.

Clinically, influenza virus and Streptococcus suis co-infections in pigs are very common, which often contribute to severe pneumonia and can increase the mortality. However, the co-infection pathogenesis in pigs is unclear. In the present study, co-infection experiments were performed using swine H1N1 influenza virus and Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2). The H1N1-SS2 co-infected pigs exhibited more severe clinical symptoms, serious pathological changes, and robust apoptosis of lungs at 6 days post-infection compared with separate H1N1 and SS2 infections. A comprehensive gene expression profiling using a microarray approach was performed to investigate the global host responses of swine lungs against the swine H1N1 infection, SS2 infection, co-infection, and phosphate-buffered saline control. Results showed 457, 411, and 844 differentially expressed genes in the H1N1, SS2, and H1N1-SS2 groups, respectively, compared with the control. Noticeably, genes associated with the immune, inflammatory, and apoptosis responses were highly overexpressed in the co-infected group. Pathway analysis indicated that the cytokine\u2013cytokine receptor interactions, MAPK, toll-like receptor, complement and coagulation cascades, antigen processing and presentation, and apoptosis pathway were significantly regulated in the co-infected group. However, the genes related to these were less regulated in the separate H1N1 and SS2 infection groups. This observation suggested that a certain level of synergy was induced by H1N1 and SS2 co-infection with significantly stronger inflammatory and apoptosis responses, which may lead to more serious respiratory disease syndrome and pulmonary pathological lesion.","publish_time":"2015-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Xian; Huang, Canhui; Shi, Jian; Wang, Ruifang; Sun, Xin; Liu, Xiaokun; Zhao, Lianzhong; Jin, Meilin","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73f93646de4efa4c3b8d02d07dea684c028763d1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4407888.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4407888/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQ5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SS2 co-infection","swine H1N1 infection","SS2 infection groups","H1N1-SS2 co-infected pigs","H1N1-SS2 groups","co-infection experiments","co-infection pathogenesis","separate H1N1","SS2 infections","swine H1N1 influenza virus","co-infected group","Streptococcus suis co-infections","apoptosis responses","days post-infection","Swine influenza virus","apoptosis pathway","Streptococcus suis serotype","robust apoptosis of lungs","global host responses of swine lungs","serious respiratory disease syndrome","serious pathological changes","cytokine receptor interactions","porcine respiratory disease complex","severe pneumonia","Pathway analysis","saline control","severe clinical symptoms","pulmonary pathological lesion","important contributors","presentation","MAPK","antigen processing","microarray approach","coagulation cascades","toll","comprehensive gene expression profiling","phosphate","present study","certain level of synergy","significant economic impacts","observation","mortality","Results"],"language":"en"},

In order to the better understand these latter roles the cellular interactome of PRRSV N protein was defined using label free quantitative proteomics. This identified several cellular factors that could interact with the N protein including poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1), a cellular protein, which can add adenosine diphosphate ribose to a protein. Use of the PARP-1 small molecule inhibitor, 3-AB, in PRRSV infected cells demonstrated that PARP-1 was required and acted as an enhancer factor for virus biology. Serial growth of PRRSV in different concentrations of 3-AB did not yield viruses that were able to grow with wild type kinetics, suggesting that by targeting a cellular protein crucial for virus biology, resistant phenotypes did not emerge.

Drak2(-/-) mice are resistant to autoimmunity in mouse models of type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis. Resistance to these diseases occurs, in part, because Drak2 is required for the survival of autoreactive T cells that induce disease. However, the molecular mechanisms by which Drak2 affects T cell survival and autoimmunity are not known. A recent report demonstrated that Drak2 negatively regulated transforming growth factor-\u03B2 (TGF-\u03B2) signaling in tumor cell lines. Thus, increased TGF-\u03B2 signaling in the absence of Drak2 may contribute to the resistance to autoimmunity in Drak2(-/-) mice. Therefore, we examined if Drak2 functioned as a negative regulator of TGF-\u03B2 signaling in T cells, and whether the enhanced susceptibility to death of Drak2(-/-) T cells was due to augmented TGF-\u03B2 signaling. Using several in vitro assays to test TGF-\u03B2 signaling and T cell function, we found that activation of Smad2 and Smad3, which are downstream of the TGF-\u03B2 receptor, was similar between wildtype and Drak2(-/-) T cells. Furthermore, TGF-\u03B2-mediated effects on na\u00EFve T cell proliferation, activated CD8(\u002B) T cell survival, and regulatory T cell induction was similar between wildtype and Drak2(-/-) T cells. Finally, the increased susceptibility to death in the absence of Drak2 was not due to enhanced TGF-\u03B2 signaling. Together, these data suggest that Drak2 does not function as a negative regulator of TGF-\u03B2 signaling in primary T cells stimulated in vitro. It is important to investigate and discern potential molecular mechanisms by which Drak2 functions in order to better understand the etiology of autoimmune diseases, as well as to validate the use of Drak2 as a target for therapeutic treatment of these diseases.","publish_time":"2015-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harris, Tarsha L.; McGargill, Maureen A.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b02698e082376846f59c99c449161a7a7eb737f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4423867.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4423867/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzUwOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["death of Drak2","absence of Drak2","Drak2 functions","use of Drak2","T cell survival","enhanced TGF-\u03B2","primary T cells","increased TGF-\u03B2","T cell function","TGF-\u03B2 receptor","augmented TGF-\u03B2","survival of autoreactive T cells","regulatory T cell induction","na\u00EFve T cell proliferation","B cells","negative regulator of TGF","transforming growth factor-\u03B2","autoimmunity","tumor cell lines","wildtype","enhanced susceptibility","increased susceptibility","mice","Resistance","potential molecular mechanisms","etiology of autoimmune diseases","mediated effects","CD8","mouse models of type","threonine kinase","diabetes","target","serine","order","therapeutic treatment","multiple sclerosis","activation of Smad2","recent report","Smad3","assays","data"],"language":"en"},

The influenza virus A/Guizhou/01502/2014 isolated from the patient had 99% identity with viruses circulating in the Yangtze River Delta region. Selected amino acids substitutions, well-known to be associated with mammalian adaptation, viral replication and drug resistance were similar to other H7N9 viruses circulating in humans. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiology investigation and laboratory results confirmed it was the first imported case of H7N9 infection in Guizhou Province. This finding further indicated that more human H7N9 cases may be detected in other regions due to frequent travel both domestically and internationally.","publish_time":"2015-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Dingming; Tang, Guangpeng; Huang, Yan; Yu, Chun; Li, Shijun; Zhuang, Li; Fu, Lin; Wang, Shiping; Li, Nanshi; Li, Xiyan; Yang, Lei; Lan, Yu; Bai, Tian; Shu, Yuelong","journal":"J Med Case Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8da5544ddb9881dc68d16a4ed8f852d3b92c040e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4437457.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4437457/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzUyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Hong Kong SAR"],"locations":["China","Republic","Malaysia","Guizhou","Guizhou Province","Zhejiang"],"keyphrases":["human H7N9 cases","Human infection","human case of H7N9 infection","human case of infection","H7N9 viruses","imported case of H7N9 infection","Guizhou Province","imported human cases","human transportation","majority of human cases","mainland China","influenza virus","Zhejiang Province","avian influenza","Republic of China","CASE PRESENTATION","Yangtze River Delta region of China","regions","day","frequent travel","Chinese New Year","year-old healthy Chinese man","Spring Festival travel season","drug resistance","Hong Kong SAR","viral replication","mammalian adaptation","migrant worker","Taiwan","laboratory results","CONCLUSIONS","Epidemiology investigation","patient","Malaysia","INTRODUCTION","amino acids substitutions","identity","illness onset","fever","beginning","humans","medical care"],"language":"en"},

We further investigated the spatial variation in virus transmission patterns between islands and identified the origin of circulating viruses using a molecular approach. Our findings indicate that terns represent a major host for IAV on oceanic islands, not only for seabird-related virus subtypes such as H16, but also for those commonly isolated in wild and domestic ducks (H3, H6, H9, H12 subtypes). We also identified strong species-associated variation in virus exposure that may be associated to differences in the ecology and behaviour of terns.

We observed a substantial delay in the onset of collagen-induced arthritis in T. brucei-infected DBA/1 mice that correlates with a drastic decrease of type II collagen titers of the different IgG isotypes in the serum. Treatment of infected mice with Berenil, a trypanocidal drug, restored the development of CIA-associated clinical symptoms. Interestingly, these data were confirmed by the challenge of immunized DBA/1 prone mice with T. brucei-infected tsetse flies.

We report here the role of \u03B3-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), a constitutively expressed secretory enzyme of H. pylori, in potentiating VacA-dependent vacuolation formation in H. pylori-infected AGS and primary gastric cells. The enhancement is brought about by GGT hydrolysing glutamine present in the extracellular medium, thereby releasing ammonia which accentuates the VacA-induced vacuolation. The events of vacuolation in H. pylori wild type (WT)- and \u0394ggt-infected AGS cells were first captured and visualized by real-time phase-contrast microscopy where WT was observed to induce more vacuoles than \u0394ggt. By using semi-quantitative neutral red uptake assay, we next showed that \u0394ggt induced significantly less vacuolation in AGS and primary gastric epithelial cells as compared to the parental strain (P\u003C0.05) indicating that GGT potentiates the vacuolating effect of VacA. Notably, vacuolation induced by WT was significantly reduced in the absence of GGT substrate, glutamine (P\u003C0.05) or in the presence of a competitive GGT inhibitor, serine-borate complex. Furthermore, the vacuolating ability of \u0394ggt was markedly restored when co-incubated with purified recombinant GGT (rGGT), although rGGT itself did not induce vacuolation independently. Similarly, the addition of exogenous ammonium chloride as a source of ammonia also rescued the ability of \u0394ggt to induce vacuolation. Additionally, we also show that monoclonal antibodies against GGT effectively inhibited GGT activity and successfully suppressed H. pylori-induced vacuolation. Collectively, our results clearly demonstrate that generation of ammonia by GGT through glutamine hydrolysis is responsible for enhancing VacA-dependent vacuolation. Our findings provide a new perspective on GGT as an important virulence factor and a promising target in the management of H. pylori-associated gastric diseases.","publish_time":"2015-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ling, Samantha Shi Min; Khoo, Lawrence Han Boon; Hwang, Le-Ann; Yeoh, Khay Guan; Ho, Bow","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/424606001b632c4148c73e7a2c288a08ff978842.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0fbc383f838f9db0f9146ae8889373a9375ec056.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4482420.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4482420/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzU2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AGS","GGT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pylori-induced vacuolation","VacA-induced vacuolation","cellular vacuolation","events of vacuolation","competitive GGT inhibitor","purified recombinant GGT","inhibited GGT activity","absence of GGT substrate","potentiating VacA-dependent vacuolation formation","pylori-infected AGS","Helicobacter pylori","\u0394ggt-infected AGS cells","vacuolating ability of \u0394ggt","primary gastric cells","WT","vacuolating effect of VacA","pylori wild type","host cells","primary gastric epithelial cells","source of ammonia","generation of ammonia","glutamine hydrolysis","glutamine present","rGGT","gastric diseases","vacuolating cytotoxin","presence of permeant weak bases","important virulence factor","cytotoxic event","promising target","semi-quantitative neutral red uptake assay","serine-borate complex","new perspective","extracellular medium","monoclonal antibodies","addition of exogenous ammonium chloride","real-time phase-contrast microscopy","glutamyl transpeptidase","management of","role of \u03B3","parental strain","findings","secretory enzyme of","results","vacuoles","enhancement"],"language":"en"},

In theory, community structure\u2014aggregation into highly intraconnected and loosely interconnected social groups\u2014within human populations may lead to punctuated outbreaks as diseases progress from one community to the next. However, this explanation has been largely overlooked in favor of temporal shifts in environmental conditions and human behavior and because of the difficulties associated with estimating large-scale contact patterns. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to characterize naturally arising patterns of human contact that are capable of producing simulated epidemics with multiple wave structures. METHODS: We used an extensive dataset of proximal physical contacts between users of a public Wi-Fi Internet system to evaluate the epidemiological implications of an empirical urban contact network. We characterized the modularity (community structure) of the network and then estimated epidemic dynamics under a percolation-based model of infectious disease spread on the network. We classified simulated epidemics as multiwave using a novel metric and we identified network structures that were critical to the network\u2019s ability to produce multiwave epidemics. RESULTS: We identified robust community structure in a large, empirical urban contact network from which multiwave epidemics may emerge naturally. This pattern was fueled by a special kind of insularity in which locally popular individuals were not the ones forging contacts with more distant social groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that ordinary contact patterns can produce multiwave epidemics at the scale of a single urban area without the temporal shifts that are usually assumed to be responsible. Understanding the role of community structure in epidemic dynamics allows officials to anticipate epidemic resurgence without having to forecast future changes in hosts, pathogens, or the environment.","publish_time":"2015-07-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoen, Anne G; Hladish, Thomas J; Eggo, Rosalind M; Lenczner, Michael; Brownstein, John S; Meyers, Lauren Ancel","journal":"J Med Internet Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4526984.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4526984/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzU5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["multiwave epidemics","simulated epidemics","empirical urban contact network","patterns of human contact","network structures","infectious disease epidemics","robust community structure","role of community structure","epidemic dynamics","ordinary contact patterns","estimating large-scale contact patterns","human populations","human behavior","behavioral drivers of epidemic resurgence","RESULTS","single urban area","favor of temporal shifts","interconnected social groups","multiple wave structures","distant social groups","percolation-based model of infectious disease","Multiple waves of transmission","public Wi-Fi Internet system","major public health challenge","extensive dataset of proximal physical contacts","users","epidemiological implications","environmental conditions","difficulties","officials","punctuated outbreaks","novel metric","ones","aggregation","future changes","network\u2019s ability","hosts","pathogens","popular individuals","diseases progress","special kind of insularity","BACKGROUND","theory","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","aim","modularity","OBJECTIVE","explanation"],"language":"en"},

The diagnostic distribution was as follows: pheochromocytoma crisis (n = 4), thyroid storm (n = 5), and diabetic ketoacidosis (n = 3). The initial presentation of pheochromocytoma crisis was indistinguishable from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and frequently accompanied by paroxysmal hypertension and limb ischemia. Thyroid storm was characterized by hyperbilirubinemia and severe gastrointestinal bleeding, whereas neurological symptoms were common in diabetic ketoacidosis. The clinical outcomes of patients with endocrine emergencies were compared with those of 80 cases with AMI who received ECMO because of cardiogenic shock. The cardiac function and the general conditions showed a significantly faster recovery in patients with endocrine emergencies than in those with AMI. We conclude that ECMO support can be clinically useful in endocrine emergencies. The screening of endocrine diseases should be considered during the resuscitation of patients with refractory circulatory shock.","publish_time":"2015-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chao, Anne; Wang, Chih-Hsien; You, Hao-Chun; Chou, Nai-Kwoun; Yu, Hsi-Yu; Chi, Nai-Hsin; Huang, Shu-Chien; Wu, I-Hui; Tseng, Li-Jung; Lin, Ming-Hsien; Chen, Yih-Sharng","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3357db65aa31717ba4a076d0859a682ef0ca2c75.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4547135.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4547135/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzYxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ECMO","AMI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["endocrine emergencies","resuscitation of patients","ECMO support","AMI","clinical outcomes of patients","ECMO registry","screening of endocrine diseases","refractory shock secondary","refractory circulatory shock","cardiogenic shock","diabetic ketoacidosis","thyroid storm","initial presentation of pheochromocytoma crisis","clinical utility","neurological symptoms","faster recovery","severe gastrointestinal bleeding","acute myocardial infarction","general conditions","hyperbilirubinemia","paroxysmal hypertension","limb ischemia","cardiac function","Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","diagnostic distribution","case series","cardiopulmonary arrest","cases"],"language":"en"},

Peptidoglycan (PGN) is a conserved and major component of S. aureus cell wall. However, it has not been used as a vaccine candidate since it is a thymus-independent antigen. In this study, we synthesized a multiple antigenic peptide, named MAP27, which comprised four copies of a peptide that mimics the epitope of PGN. After immunization with MAP27 five times and boosting with heat-inactivated bacterium one time, anti-MAP27 serum bound directly to S. aureus or PGN. Immunization with MAP27 decreased the bacterial burden in organs of BALB/c mice and significantly prolonged their survival time after S. aureus lethal-challenge. The percentage of IFN-\u03B3(\u002B)CD3(\u002B) T cells and IL-17(\u002B)CD4(\u002B) T cells in spleen, as well as the levels of IFN-\u03B3, IL-17A/F and CCL3 in spleen and lung, significantly increased in the MAP27-immunized mice after infection. Moreover, in vitro incubation of heat-inactivated S. aureus with splenocytes isolated from MAP27-immunized mice stimulated the production of IFN-\u03B3 and IL-17A/F. Our findings demonstrated that MAP27, as a thymus-dependent antigen, is efficient at eliciting T cell-mediated responses to protect mice from S. aureus infection.

Polyphenols like flavonoids and their derivatives have been extensively studied as amyloid inhibitors. However, the anti-amyloidogenic property of a biphenyl backbone containing polyphenols such as Mag and Hon has not been reported. In this study, these two compounds were tested for their effects on hCT aggregation. We found that Mag and Hon both inhibited the amyloid formation of hCT, whereas Mag showed a stronger inhibitory effect; moreover, they both dose-dependently disassembled preformed hCT aggregates. Further immuno-dot blot and dynamic light scattering studies suggested Mag and Hon suppressed the aggregation of hCT both at the oligomerization and the fibrillation stages, while MTT-based and dye-leakage assays demonstrated that Mag and Hon effectively reduced cytotoxicity caused by hCT aggregates. Furthermore, isothermal titration calorimetry indicated Mag and Hon both interact with hCT.

The model broadly hypothesizes disease emergence is driven by the co-incidence of genetic, physical environmental, ecological, and social factors. We developed and tested a model of the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 based on suspected convergence factors that are mainly associated with land-use change. Building on previous geospatial statistical studies that identified natural and human risk factors associated with urbanization, we added new factors to test whether causal mechanisms and pathogenic landscapes could be more specifically identified. Our findings suggest that urbanization spatially combines risk factors to produce particular types of peri-urban landscapes with significantly higher HPAI H5N1 emergence risk. The work highlights that peri-urban areas of Viet Nam have higher levels of chicken densities, duck and geese flock size diversities, and fraction of land under rice or aquaculture than rural and urban areas. We also found that land-use diversity, a surrogate measure for potential mixing of host populations and other factors that likely influence viral transmission, significantly improves the model\u2019s predictability. Similarly, landscapes where intensive and extensive forms of poultry production overlap were found at greater risk. These results support the convergence hypothesis in general and demonstrate the potential to improve EID prevention and control by combing geospatial monitoring of these factors along with pathogen surveillance programs.","publish_time":"2015-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saksena, Sumeet; Fox, Jefferson; Epprecht, Michael; Tran, Chinh C.; Nong, Duong H.; Spencer, James H.; Nguyen, Lam; Finucane, Melissa L.; Tran, Vien D.; Wilcox, Bruce A.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee5b43d20a640664510cb7a540caaae4a8e19933.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4580613.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4580613/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzY1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPAI","Viet Nam"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human risk factors","social factors","new factors","suspected convergence factors","urban landscapes","convergence model","higher HPAI H5N1 emergence risk","pathogenic landscapes","greater risk","fraction of land","urbanization","multifactorial causality of disease emergence","convergence hypothesis","peri-urban areas of Viet Nam","geospatial monitoring","EID prevention","particular types of peri","pathogenic avian influenza","higher levels of chicken densities","potential mixing of host populations","previous geospatial statistical studies","duck","geese flock size diversities","extensive forms of poultry production overlap","surrogate measure","aquaculture","co-incidence of genetic","control","rice","causal mechanisms","attention","diversity","viral transmission","series of ground breaking reviews","pathogen surveillance programs","infectious diseases","results","work","model\u2019s predictability","findings","change"],"language":"en"},

The introduction of multivalent vaccines has coincided with a dramatic decrease in the number of pneumococcal-related deaths. In spite of this, at a global level, pneumococcal infection remains an important cause of death among children under 5 years of age and in adults 65 years of age or older. In order to properly manage patients and control the spread of infection, a rapid and highly sensitive diagnostic method is needed for routine implementation, especially in resource-limited regions where pneumococcal disease is most prevalent. METHODS: Using the gene encoding leader peptidase A as a molecular diagnostics target, a real-time RPA assay was designed and optimised for the detection of S. pneumoniae in whole blood. The performance of the assay was compared to real-time PCR in terms of its analytical limit of detection and specificity. The inhibitory effect of human genomic DNA on amplification was investigated. The potential clinical utility of the assay was investigated using a small number of clinical samples. RESULTS: The RPA assay has a limit of detection equivalent to PCR (4.0 and 5.1 genome equivalents per reaction, respectively) and was capable of detecting the equivalent of \u003C1 colony forming unit of S. pneumoniae when spiked into human whole blood. The RPA assay was 100 % inclusive (38/38 laboratory reference strains and 19/19 invasive clinical isolates) and 100 % exclusive; differentiating strains of S. pneumoniae species from other viridans group streptococci, including S. pseudopneumoniae. When applied to the analysis of a small number (n = 11) of clinical samples (blood culture positive for S. pneumoniae), the RPA assay was demonstrated to be both rapid and sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: The RPA assay developed in this work is shown to be as sensitive and as specific as PCR. In terms of reaction kinetics, the RPA assay is shown to exceed those of the PCR, with the RPA running to completion in 20 minutes and capable generating a positive signal in as little as 6 minutes. This work represents a potentially suitable assay for application in point-of-care settings.","publish_time":"2015-10-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Clancy, Eoin; Higgins, Owen; Forrest, Matthew S.; Boo, Teck Wee; Cormican, Martin; Barry, Thomas; Piepenburg, Olaf; Smith, Terry J.","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd1b26543d016107178798ed466d39ecfe4572cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4625855.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4625855/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzY5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. pneumoniae","S. pseudopneumoniae"],"organizations":["RPA","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["real-time RPA assay","suitable assay","number of pneumococcal","pneumoniae species","Streptococcus pneumoniae","real-time PCR","small number of clinical samples","pneumococcal infection","pneumococcal disease","limit of detection equivalent","invasive clinical isolates","analytical limit of detection","potential clinical utility","years of age","blood culture positive","minutes","work","important cause of microbial disease","important cause of death","sensitive diagnostic method","terms of reaction kinetics","spread of infection","positive signal","laboratory reference strains","inhibitory effect of human genomic DNA","molecular diagnostics target","resource-limited regions","leader peptidase","routine implementation","viridans group streptococci","point","adults","children","dramatic decrease","amplification","application","global level","humans","introduction of multivalent vaccines","gene","pseudopneumoniae","patients","analysis","specificity","genome equivalents","related deaths","colony","unit","BACKGROUND","completion","care settings","METHODS","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","order","spite","performance"],"language":"en"},

Filovirus antivirals are currently not clinically available. Our findings suggest interferon gamma, an FDA-approved drug, may serve as a novel and effective prophylactic or treatment option. Using mouse-adapted Ebola virus, we found that murine interferon gamma administered 24 hours before or after infection robustly protects lethally-challenged mice and reduces morbidity and serum viral titers. Furthermore, we demonstrated that interferon gamma profoundly inhibits Ebola virus infection of macrophages, an early cellular target of infection. As early as six hours following in vitro infection, Ebola virus RNA levels in interferon gamma-treated macrophages were lower than in infected, untreated cells. Addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, to interferon gamma-treated macrophages did not further reduce viral RNA levels, suggesting that interferon gamma blocks life cycle events that require protein synthesis such as virus replication. Microarray studies with interferon gamma-treated human macrophages identified more than 160 interferon-stimulated genes. Ectopic expression of a select group of these genes inhibited Ebola virus infection. These studies provide new potential avenues for antiviral targeting as these genes that have not previously appreciated to inhibit negative strand RNA viruses and specifically Ebola virus infection.

Intriguingly, the induction of this cross-reactive immunity leads to significant reduction of viral loads in a recombinant vaccinia-HCV virus infected mouse model, supporting their role in antiviral immunity against HCV. Healthy human subjects with Ad-specific pre-existing immunity demonstrated cross-reactive cellular and humoral immune responses against multiple HCV antigens. These findings reveal the potential of a previously uncharacterized property of natural human adenovirus infection to dictate, modulate and/or alter the course of HCV infection upon exposure.

Functional impairment of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is associated with inflammatory retinal diseases. Enhancing the protective axis namely ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas by activation of ACE2 presents anti-inflammatory properties. We investigated whether diminazene aceturate (DIZE), an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activator, prevented lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response by activating the protective axis and whether the effect was mediated by inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the nuclear factor-\u03BAB (NF-\u03BAB) pathways. METHODS: Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and real-time PCR were used to determine the optimum concentration and incubation time of DIZE. ARPE-19 cells and primary cultured human retinal pigment epithelia (hRPE) were incubated with or without 10 \u03BCg/mL DIZE for 6 h before stimulated with 5 \u03BCg/mL LPS for 24 h. The mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines, AT1R, and AT2R was analyzed. The protein level of inflammatory cytokines, Ang II, and Ang-(1-7) was detected. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and phosphorylated transcription inhibition factor-\u03BAB-\u03B1 (p-I\u03BAB-\u03B1) were measured. Inhibitors of MAPKs and NF-\u03BAB were added to verify the involvement of these pathways. A small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted to ACE2 and a selective Ang-(1-7) antagonist A779 was used to confirm the role of ACE2 and the involvement of ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis. RESULTS: DIZE remarkably increased the expression of ACE2 and inhibited the expression of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 at both mRNA and protein levels in both RPE cell lines stimulated with LPS. Inhibitors of p38, ERK1/2, JNK, and NF-\u03BAB significantly decreased LPS-induced overproduction of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1. DIZE reduced the expression of Ang II and AT1R, whereas increased Ang-(1-7). Furthermore, DIZE downregulated the phosphorylation of p38MAPK, ERK1/2, JNK, and the activation of NF-\u03BAB upon stimulation with LPS. Downregulating ACE2 and pre-treatment with A779 abrogated the effects of DIZE on production of cytokines, the expression of Ang II, Ang-(1-7), AT1R, phosphorylation of MAPKs and activation of NF-\u03BAB. CONCLUSIONS: DIZE inhibits LPS-induced inflammatory response by activating ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis in human RPE cells. The protective effect is mediated by inhibiting the p38MAPK, ERK1/2, JNK, and NF-\u03BAB pathways.","publish_time":"2016-02-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tao, Lifei; Qiu, Yiguo; Fu, Xinyu; Lin, Ru; Lei, Chunyan; Wang, Jiaming; Lei, Bo","journal":"J Neuroinflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c1071de1f40c5b4d95e93e6f8390d93ba283bf3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4748536.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4748536/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzgyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ang II"],"organizations":["MAPK","DIZE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of Ang","expression of ACE2","activation of ACE2","increased Ang","NF-\u03BAB pathways","involvement of ACE2","selective Ang","Downregulating ACE2","role of ACE2","activation of NF","expression of IL","effects of DIZE","JNK","mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines","nuclear factor-\u03BAB","inflammatory retinal diseases","inflammatory response","LPS-induced overproduction of IL","Mas axis","protective axis","incubation time of DIZE","protein level of inflammatory cytokines","AT1R","ERK1","phosphorylated transcription inhibition factor-\u03BAB","Retinal inflammation","phosphorylation of MAPKs","phosphorylation of p38MAPK","protective effect","human RPE cells","Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK","mitogen-activated protein kinase","RPE cell lines","production of cytokines","protein levels","Inhibitors of p38","Inhibitors of MAPKs","\u03BCg","MCP","primary cultured human retinal pigment epithelia","Functional impairment of retinal pigment epithelium","N-terminal kinase","extracellular signal-regulated kinase","ocular diseases","antagonist A779","devastating pathological process","hRPE","optimum concentration","p-I\u03BAB","CCK","siRNA","pre-treatment","activator","angiotensin","lipopolysaccharide","stimulation","small interfering RNA","anti-inflammatory properties","assay","real-time PCR","kit","ARPE","BACKGROUND","enzyme","AT2R","diminazene aceturate","METHODS","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Selenoproteins have a crucial role in the maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis in nearly all tissues, and are also involved in thyroid hormone metabolism, inflammation and immunity. Several immune processes rely on Se status and can be compromised if this element is present below the required level. Previous work has supported the notion that when Se is delivered at levels above those deemed to be the minimal required but below toxic concentrations it can have a boosting effect on the organism\u2019s immune response. Based on this concept Se-enriched supplements may represent a valuable resource for functional feeds in animal farming, including aquaculture. RESULTS: In this study we tested the effects of Se supplemented as Sel-Plex during an immune challenge induced by polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that mimics viral infection. Trout were fed two diets enriched with 1 or 4 mg Se Kg(\u22121) of feed (dry weight) by Sel-Plex addition and a commercial formulation as control. The whole trout transcriptomic response was investigated by microarray and gene ontology analysis, the latter carried out to highlight the biological processes that were influenced by Sel-Plex supplementation in the head kidney (HK) and liver, the main immune and metabolic organs in fish. Overall, Sel-Plex enrichement up to 4 mg Se Kg(\u22121) induced an important response in the trout HK, eliciting an up-regulation of several genes involved in pathways connected with hematopoiesis and immunity. In contrast, a more constrained response was seen in the liver, with lipid metabolism being the main pathway altered by Se supplementation. Upon stimulation with poly(I:C), supplementation of 4 mg Se Kg(\u22121) increased the expression of principal mediators of the antiviral defences, especially IFN-\u03B3, and down-stream molecules involved in the cell-mediated immune response. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation of diets with 4 mg Se Kg(\u22121) using Sel-Plex remarkably improved the fish response to viral PAMP stimulation. Sel-Plex, being a highly bioavailable supplement of organic Se, might represent a suitable option for supplementation of fish feeds, to achieve the final aim of improving fish fitness and resistance against immune challenges.

Here we identify a STING-dependent, cGAS-independent pathway important for full interferon production and antiviral control of enveloped RNA viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV). Further, IAV interacts with STING through its conserved hemagglutinin fusion peptide (FP). Interestingly, FP antagonizes interferon production induced by membrane fusion or IAV but not by cGAMP or DNA. Similar to the enveloped RNA viruses, membrane fusion stimulates interferon production in a STING-dependent but cGAS-independent manner. Abolishment of this pathway led to reduced interferon production and impaired control of enveloped RNA viruses.

Consequently, it has also become a key testing ground for systems that monitor and identify outbreaks of disease. Here, we describe a new technology that automatically collects body temperatures during triage. The technology was tested in an ED as an approach to monitoring diseases that cause fever, such as seasonal flu and some pandemics. METHODS: Temporal artery thermometers that log temperature measurements were placed in a Boston ED and used for initial triage vital signs. Time-stamped measurements were collected from the thermometers to investigate the performance a real-time system would offer. The data were summarized in terms of rates of fever (temperatures \u2265100.4 \u00B0F [\u226538.0 \u00B0C]) and were qualitatively compared with regional disease surveillance programs in Massachusetts. RESULTS: From September 2009 through August 2011, 71,865 body temperatures were collected and included in our analysis, 2073 (2.6 %) of which were fevers. The period of study included the autumn\u2013winter wave of the 2009\u20132010 H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic, during which the weekly incidence of fever reached a maximum of 5.6 %, as well as the 2010\u20132011 seasonal flu outbreak, during which the maximum weekly incidence of fever was 6.6 %. The periods of peak fever rates corresponded with the periods of regionally elevated flu activity. CONCLUSIONS: Temperature measurements were monitored at triage in the ED over a period of 2 years. The resulting data showed promise as a potential surveillance tool for febrile disease that could complement current disease surveillance systems. Because temperature can easily be measured by non-experts, it might also be suitable for monitoring febrile disease activity in schools, workplaces, and transportation hubs, where many traditional syndromic indicators are impractical. However, the system\u2019s validity and generalizability should be evaluated in additional years and settings.

However, its function in the internalization of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, an important component of adherens junctions, and as a result regulating the endothelial cell polarity and barrier function remain unknown. Here, we demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) simulation markedly enhanced the activation and expression of Rab5 in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs), which is accompanied by VE-cadherin internalization. In parallel, LPS challenge also induced abnormal cell polarity and dysfunction of the endothelial barrier in HPMECs. LPS stimulation promoted the translocation of VE-cadherin from the plasma membrane to intracellular compartments, and intracellularly expressed VE-cadherin was extensively colocalized with Rab5. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of Rab5a expression attenuated the disruption of LPS-induced internalization of VE-cadherin and the disorder of cell polarity. Furthermore, knockdown of Rab5 inhibited the vascular endothelial hyperpermeability and protected endothelial barrier function from LPS injury, both in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that Rab5 is a critical mediator of LPS-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction, which is likely mediated through regulating VE-cadherin internalization. These findings provide evidence, implicating that Rab5a is a potential therapeutic target for preventing endothelial barrier disruption and vascular inflammation.

In such cases, it can be challenging to maintain adequate gas exchange by conventional mechanical ventilation and at the same time prevent further ventilator-induced lung injury. We report a young HIV positive male with poorly compliant lungs and pneumomediastinum secondary to severe Pneumocystis infection, rescued with veno-venous extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO). CASE PRESENTATION: A 26 year old male with no significant past medical history was admitted with fever, cough and shortness of breath. He initially required non-invasive ventilation for respiratory failure. However, his respiratory function progressively deteriorated due to increasing pulmonary infiltrates and development of pneumomediastinum, eventually requiring endotracheal intubation and invasive ventilation. Despite attempts at optimizing gas exchange by ventilatory maneuvers, patients\u2019 pulmonary parameters worsened necessitating rescue ECMO therapy. The introduction of V-V ECMO facilitated the use of ultra-protective lung ventilation and prevented progression of pneumomediastinum, maintaining optimal gas exchange. It allowed time for the antibiotics to show effect and pulmonary parenchyma to heal. Further diagnostic workup revealed Pneumocystis jirovecii as the causative organism for pneumonia and serology confirmed Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection. Patient was successfully treated with appropriate antimicrobials and de-cannulated after six days of ECMO support. CONCLUSION: ECMO was an effective salvage therapy in HIV positive patient with an otherwise fatal respiratory failure due to Pneumocystis pneumonia and air leak syndrome.","publish_time":"2016-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ali, Husain Shabbir; Hassan, Ibrahim Fawzy; George, Saibu","journal":"BMC Pulm Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9092d318e7c26bafb9d75a1bb4a902e543678074.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4832462.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4832462/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzkwMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ECMO","V-V ECMO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["V-V ECMO","Pneumocystis pneumonia","Pneumocystis jirovecii","progression of pneumomediastinum","pneumomediastinum secondary","Pulmonary infections","pulmonary infiltrates","development of pneumomediastinum","pulmonary parenchyma","introduction of V","non-invasive ventilation","severe Pneumocystis infection","adequate gas exchange","days of ECMO support","optimal gas exchange","necessitating rescue ECMO therapy","patients\u2019 pulmonary parameters","HIV positive patient","conventional mechanical ventilation","fatal respiratory failure","time","respiratory function","use of ultra-protective lung ventilation","young HIV positive male","air leaks","year old male","effective salvage therapy","air leak syndrome","Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection","ventilator-induced lung injury","compliant lungs","veno-venous extra corporeal membrane oxygenation","serology","ventilatory maneuvers","significant past medical history","fever","causative organism","cysts","appropriate antimicrobials","immunocompromised host","endotracheal intubation","cough","antibiotics","CASE PRESENTATION","diagnostic workup","shortness of breath","pneumatoceles","CONCLUSION","attempts","BACKGROUND","pneumothoraxes","cases"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, understanding the immunoinflammatory processes underlying the initiation, progression, and exacerbation of many cardiovascular diseases is of prime importance. The innate immune system has an ancient origin and is well conserved across species. Its activation occurs in response to pathogens or tissue injury. Recent studies suggest that altered ionic balance, and production of noxious gaseous mediators link to immune and inflammatory responses with altered ion channel expression and function. Among plausible candidates for this are transient receptor potential (TRP) channels that function as polymodal sensors and scaffolding proteins involved in many physiological and pathological processes. In this review, we will first focus on the relevance of TRP channel to both exogenous and endogenous factors related to innate immune response and transcription factors related to sustained inflammatory status. The emerging role of inflammasome to regulate innate immunity and its possible connection to TRP channels will also be discussed. Secondly, we will discuss about the linkage of TRP channels to inflammatory CV diseases, from a viewpoint of inflammation in a general sense which is not restricted to the innate immunity.

Gene parity plot analysis and overall similarity of ORFs indicated that CapoNPV is more closely related to the Group I alphabaculoviruses than to other baculoviruses.

Among them, M2 protein functions as an ion channel, important for virus uncoating in endosomes of virus-infected cells and essential for virus replication. In an effort to explore potential new functions of M2 in the virus life cycle, we used yeast two-hybrid system to search for M2-associated cellular proteins. One of the positive clones was identified as human Hsp40/Hdj1, a DnaJ/Hsp40 family protein. Here, we report that both BM2 (M2 of influenza B virus) and A/M2 (M2 of influenza A virus) interacted with Hsp40 in vitro and in vivo. The region of M2-Hsp40 interaction has been mapped to the CTD1 domain of Hsp40. Hsp40 has been reported to be a regulator of PKR signaling pathway by interacting with p58(IPK) that is a cellular inhibitor of PKR. PKR is a crucial component of the host defense response against virus infection. We therefore attempted to understand the relationship among M2, Hsp40 and p58(IPK) by further experimentation. The results demonstrated that both A/M2 and BM2 are able to bind to p58(IPK)in vitro and in vivo and enhance PKR autophosphorylation probably via forming a stable complex with Hsp40 and P58(IPK), and consequently induce cell death. These results suggest that influenza virus M2 protein is involved in p58(IPK) mediated PKR regulation during influenza virus infection, therefore affecting infected-cell life cycle and virus replication.","publish_time":"2010-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guan, Zhenhong; Liu, Di; Mi, Shuofu; Zhang, Jie; Ye, Qinong; Wang, Ming; Gao, George F.; Yan, Jinghua","journal":"Protein \u0026 Cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/374c3b822d0f666408ccd08ae000d07959492bdd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs13238-010-0115-x.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzkzNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus M2 protein","M2 of influenza B virus","virus replication","virus uncoating","endosomes of virus","influenza virus infection","region of M2","M2 protein functions","virus life cycle","p58","IPK","human Hsp40","Hsp40 interaction","Hsp40 family protein","potential new functions of M2","CTD1 domain of Hsp40","PKR regulation","PKR autophosphorylation","regulator of PKR","cellular inhibitor of PKR","matrix protein","infected-cell life cycle","BM2","cellular proteins","results","infected cells","cell death","integral membrane proteins","neuraminidase","ion channel","haemagglutinin","host defense response","DnaJ","crucial component","yeast","Hdj1","stable complex","M1","pathway","effort","positive clones","hybrid system","relationship","experimentation"],"language":"en"},

Dysregulated immunity as a result of inappropriate innate inflammatory responses is a hallmark of chronic viral infections such as, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that expression of an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG), ubiquitin-like protease (USP)18 is upregulated in chronic HCV infection, leading to impaired hepatocyte responses to IFN-\u03B1. We examined the ability of inflammatory stimuli, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03B1), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10 to upregulate hepatocyte USP18 expression and blunt the IFN-\u03B1 response. Human hepatoma cells and primary murine hepatocytes were treated with TNF-\u03B1/LPS/IL-6/IL-10 and USP18, phosphorylated (p)-STAT1 and myxovirus (influenza virus) resistance 1 (Mx1) expression was determined. Treatment of Huh7.5 cells and primary murine hepatocytes with LPS and TNF-\u03B1, but not IL-6 or IL-10, led to upregulated USP18 expression and induced an IFN-\u03B1 refractory state, which was reversed by USP18 knockdown. Liver inflammation was induced in vivo using a murine model of hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury. Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury led to an induction of USP18 expression in liver tissue and promotion of lymphocytic choriomeningitis replication. These data demonstrate that certain inflammatory stimuli (TNF-\u03B1 and LPS) but not others (IL-6 and IL-10) target USP18 expression and thus inhibit IFN signaling. These findings represent a new paradigm for how inflammation alters hepatic innate immune responses, with USP18 representing a potential target for intervention in various inflammatory states. IMPORTANCE Inflammation may prevent the control of viral infection when it impairs the innate immune response, enhancing viral replication and spread. Blunted immunity as a result of inappropriate innate inflammatory responses is a common characteristic of chronic viral infections. Previous studies have shown that expression of certain interferon-stimulated genes is upregulated in chronic HCV infection, leading to impaired hepatocyte responses. In this study, we show that multiple inflammatory stimuli can modulate interferon stimulated gene expression and thus inhibit hepatocyte interferon signaling via USP18 induction. These findings represent a new paradigm for how inflammation alters hepatic innate immune responses, with the induction of USP18 representing a potential target for intervention in various inflammatory states.","publish_time":"2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"MacParland, Sonya A.; Ma, Xue-Zhong; Chen, Limin; Khattar, Ramzi; Cherepanov, Vera; Selzner, Markus; Feld, Jordan J.; Selzner, Nazia; McGilvray, Ian D.","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75882d6856d4243248aa32fe119153efeb0dbe12.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4886784.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4886784/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozk2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hepatocyte USP18 expression","target USP18 expression","induction of USP18 expression","upregulated USP18 expression","USP18 induction","TNF-\u03B1","IFN-\u03B1 response","USP18 knockdown","hepatic innate immune responses","result of inappropriate innate inflammatory responses","viral replication","impaired hepatocyte responses","interferon stimulated gene expression","certain inflammatory stimuli","hepatocyte interferon","control of viral infection","LPS","IFN-\u03B1 refractory state","multiple inflammatory stimuli","ability of inflammatory stimuli","various inflammatory states","IFN-stimulated gene","chronic HCV infection","expression of certain interferon-stimulated genes","Liver inflammation","hallmark of chronic viral infections","IMPORTANCE Inflammation","common characteristic of chronic viral infections","potential target","murine model of hepatic ischemia","primary murine hepatocytes","hepatitis B virus","hepatitis C virus","influenza virus","intervention","reperfusion injury","new paradigm","Previous studies","findings","liver tissue","promotion of lymphocytic choriomeningitis replication","Dysregulated immunity","Blunted immunity","Human hepatoma cells","tumor necrosis factor alpha","myxovirus","ubiquitin","resistance","ISG","STAT1","Mx1","lipopolysaccharide","protease","Treatment of Huh7","laboratory","interleukin","data","study"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we investigated the relationship between induction of IFN and IFN-stimulated gene responses in vivo and the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of NS1-truncated LAIV. Our data demonstrates that accelerated antibody induction and protective efficacy of NS1-truncated LAIV correlates well with upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes. Further, through oral administration of recombinant chicken IFN alpha in drinking water, we provide direct evidence that type I IFN can promote rapid induction of adaptive immune responses and protective efficacy of influenza vaccine in chickens.","publish_time":"2016-06-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jang, Hyesun; Ngunjiri, John M.; Lee, Chang-Won","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d38a164a0b254a96195ad1715929340f82cc110e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4892592.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4892592/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozk2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["induction of IFN","NS1-truncated mutants","high protective efficacy of NS1","truncated NS1 proteins","upregulation of IFN","truncated LAIV correlates","protective efficacy of influenza vaccine","IFN-stimulated gene responses","chickens","induction of high levels of type","oral administration of recombinant chicken IFN alpha","rapid induction of adaptive immune responses","accelerated antibody induction","Influenza virus mutants","avian live attenuated influenza vaccine","stimulated genes","chicken embryonic fibroblast cells","attractive candidates","drinking water","interferon","immunogenicity","direct evidence","development","relationship","data","study"],"language":"en"},

However, its ability to induce adverse effects has held back the use of VSV as a potential vaccine vector. In this study we developed VSV-\u0394P, a safe yet potent replication-defective recombinant VSV in which the phosphoprotein (P) gene was deleted. VSV-\u0394P replicated only in supporting cells expressing P (BHK-P cells) and at levels more than 2 logs lower than VSV. In vivo studies indicated that the moderate replication of VSV-\u0394P in vitro was associated with the attenuation of this virus in the mouse model, whereas mice intracranially injected with VSV succumbed to neurotoxicity. Furthermore, we constructed VSV and VSV-\u0394P expressing a variety of antigens including hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) from Newcastle disease virus (NDV), hemagglutinin (HA) from either a 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus (pdm/09) or the avian H7N9. VSV and VSV-\u0394P incorporated the foreign antigens on their surface resulting in induction of robust neutralizing antibody, serum IgG, and hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers against their corresponding viruses. These results indicated that VSV with P gene deletion was attenuated in vitro and in vivo, and possibly expressed the foreign antigen on its surface. Therefore, the P gene-deletion strategy may offer a potentially useful and safer approach for attenuating negative-sense RNA viruses which use phosphoprotein as a cofactor for viral replication.","publish_time":"2016-06-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wongthida, Phonphimon; Jengarn, Juggragarn; Narkpuk, Jaraspim; Koonyosying, Pongpisid; Srisutthisamphan, Kanjana; Wanitchang, Asawin; Leaungwutiwong, Pornsawan; Teeravechyan, Samaporn; Jongkaewwattana, Anan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50adcf9bfee16b95201df9fdcc9dcf30c1f8ea6e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4912100.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4912100/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozk4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VSV-\u0394P","use of VSV","moderate replication of VSV","potent replication-defective recombinant VSV","P gene deletion","P gene-deletion strategy","BHK-P cells","phosphoprotein","Newcastle disease virus","viral replication","foreign antigens","Vesicular stomatitis virus","surface","H1N1 pandemic influenza virus","variety of antigens","hemagglutinin-neuraminidase","corresponding viruses","attenuating negative-sense RNA viruses","serum IgG","HAI","induction of robust neutralizing antibody","HN","hemagglutination inhibition","safer approach","titers","pdm","NDV","levels","cofactor","potential vaccine vector","mouse model","adaptive immune responses","adverse effects","mice","logs lower","attenuation","results","ability","studies","study","avian H7N9","neurotoxicity"],"language":"en"},

We have examined acclimation by comparing changes in the leaf content of RuBP carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) with changes in the transcripts of Rubisco subunit genes and with leaf carbohydrate metabolism. When grown at 1000 mm(3) dm(\u20133) CO(2), 12 of 16 crop species at peak vegetative growth had a 15\u201344% decrease in leaf Rubisco protein, but with no specific association with changes in transcript levels measured at midday. Species with only modest reductions in Rubisco content (10\u201320%) often had a large reduction in Rubisco small subunit gene mRNAs (\u003E 30%), with no reduction in large subunit gene mRNAs. However, species with a very large reduction in Rubisco content generally had only small reductions in transcript mRNAs. Photosynthetic acclimation also was not specifically associated with a change in the level of any particular carbohydrate measured at midday. However, a threshold relationship was found between the reduction in Rubisco content at high CO(2) and absolute levels of soluble acid invertase activity measured in plants grown at ambient or high CO(2). This relationship was valid for 15 of the 16 species examined. There also occurred a similar, albeit less robust, threshold relationship between the leaf hexose/sucrose ratio at high CO(2) and a reduced photosynthetic capacity \u2265 20%. These data indicate that carbohydrate repression of photosynthetic gene expression at elevated CO(2) may involve leaf sucrose cycling through acid invertase and hexokinase.","publish_time":"2002-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moore, B.

This review highlights that intrinsically disordered protein antigens, which lack an ordered three\u2010dimensional structure, represent excellent starting points for the development of such vaccines. Disordered proteins represent an important class of antigen in a wide range of human pathogens, and, contrary to widespread belief, they are frequently targets of protective antibody responses. Importantly, disordered epitopes appear invariably to be linear epitopes, rendering them ideally suited to incorporation into a peptide vaccine. Nonetheless, the conformational properties of disordered antigens, and hence their recognition by antibodies, frequently depend on the interactions they make and the context in which they are presented to the immune system. These effects must be considered in the design of an effective vaccine. Here we discuss these issues and propose design principles that may facilitate the development of peptide vaccines targeting disordered antigens.","publish_time":"2018-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"MacRaild, Christopher A.; Seow, Jeffrey; Das, Sreedam C.; Norton, Raymond S.","journal":"Pept Sci (Hoboken)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca77332f8de0b0262fac838affdccb3c2541296c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167742.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167742/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjsxMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disordered epitopes","disordered protein antigens","development of peptide vaccines","Disordered proteins","conformational properties of disordered antigens","based vaccines","useful peptide","design principles","linear epitopes","effective vaccine","excellent starting points","ordered three\u2010dimensional structure","important class of antigen","wide range of human pathogens","review highlights","long\u2010standing goal","recognition","widespread belief","interactions","protective antibody responses","antibodies","issues","incorporation","immune system","context","effects"],"language":"en"},

Stem nodules formed only on submerged stems of flooded plants (mean of 25 per plant), and did not form on aerial parts, although they were capable of growing and fixing N(2) after drainage of the stems. Root nodules formed on both non\u2010flooded and flooded plants but were usually decreased in number by flooding (from means of 124 to 51 per plant, respectively). Flooding (and stem\u2010nodulation) resulted in an increase in shoot (and a decrease in root) dry weight, regardless of rhizobial isolate. Stem nodules were attached by a wide collar of aerenchymatous tissue at the base of the nodule. There were large air spaces in the stem where nodules were subtended and these were continuous with nodule aerenchyma/outer cortex. In addition, aerenchyma and spongy tissue at the base of the nodule connected both flooded and non\u2010flooded root nodules to large intercellular spaces in the root cortex. The stem and root nodules were ovoid in shape, and essentially aeschynomenoid in type, i.e. the central infected tissue was without uninfected, interstitial cells. Root nodules had a similar structure to stem nodules (although stem nodules were generally larger), and flooded root nodules were approximately twice the size of non\u2010flooded nodules. The infected tissue of root and stem nodules consisted of spherical, bacteroid\u2010containing cells containing one or two rod\u2010shaped bacteroids per peribacteroid unit and prominent organelles. Infection threads were observed in root but not in stem nodules. The cortex of stem and root nodules had an apparent oxygen diffusion barrier, consisting of concentric layers of small cells with interlocking cell walls and few intercellular spaces. Cell layers external to these consisted of larger cells and intercellular spaces, with some spaces being occluded with an electron\u2010dense material that contained a glycoprotein recognized by the monoclonal antibodies MAC236 and MAC265. The amount of glycoprotein occlusions did not appear to differ between nodule types or treatments, although stem nodules contained intracellular glycoprotein vesicles adjacent to cell walls. The exterior of the nodules consisted of an epidermis of thin flattened cells with occasional lenticels. Amyloplasts were common in lower stem and hypocotyl nodules, but fewer in flooded or non\u2010flooded root nodules. Upper stem nodules (i.e. those within 6 cm of the water surface) differed from more profoundly submerged stem nodules by having chloroplasts throughout the cortex.

It results in immunity for the vaccinated individuals, but it also reduces the infection pressure for unvaccinated people. Thus people may actually escape infection without being vaccinated: the so\u2010called \u201Cherd effect.\u201D We analytically study the relation between the herd effect and the vaccination fraction for the seminal SIR compartmental model, which consists of a set of differential equations describing the time course of an epidemic. We prove that the herd effect is in general convex\u2010concave in the vaccination fraction and give precise conditions on the epidemic for the convex part to arise. We derive the significant consequences of these structural insights for allocating a limited vaccine stockpile to multiple non\u2010interacting populations. We identify for each population a unique vaccination fraction that is most efficient per dose of vaccine: our dose\u2010optimal coverage. We characterize the solution of the vaccine allocation problem and we show the crucial importance of the dose\u2010optimal coverage. A single dose of vaccine may be a drop in the ocean, but multiple doses together can save a population. To benefit from this, policy makers should select a subset of populations to which the vaccines are allocated. Focusing on a limited number of populations can make a significant difference, whereas allocating equally to all populations would be substantially less effective.","publish_time":"2017-10-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Duijzer, Lotty E.; van Jaarsveld, Willem L.; Wallinga, Jacco; Dekker, Rommert","journal":"Prod Oper Manag","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/235eeefb15c8ad94d6d9998cb892427f9ef82e38.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5bc6c031927d7866b49dd599d65f4e38e5d9a6d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168135.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168135/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjsxODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["single dose of vaccine","herd effect","epidemic","unique vaccination fraction","subset of populations","limited vaccine stockpile","limited number of populations","vaccine allocation problem","multiple non\u2010interacting populations","optimal coverage","multiple doses","significant consequences","infection pressure","significant difference","unvaccinated people","effective way","vaccinated individuals","structural insights","seminal SIR compartmental model","crucial importance","concave","time course","precise conditions","set of differential equations","drop","ocean","solution","policy makers","immunity","vaccines","relation"],"language":"en"},

These characteristics of ASMase suggest a possible role of this molecule in the phagocytotic uptake and phagosomal degradation processes of antigens or in antigen presentation. We show here that ASMase(\u2013/\u2013) mice fail to eliminate the noncytopathic lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus as rapidly as littermate wildtype mice. Investigation of the immune response revealed a reduced expansion of CD8(\u002B) T cells. The secretion of IFN\u2010\u03B3 in response to contact with target cells as well as the cytolytic activity of virus\u2010specific CD8(\u002B) T cells was severely impaired. Additionally, both phases of the LCM virus\u2010specific DTH response, mediated by CD8(\u002B) and CD4(\u002B) T cells consecutively, were diminished in ASMase(\u2013/\u2013) mice. However, the secondary memory response of virus\u2010specific CTL was not altered, and the virus was effectively controlled for at least 3 months by ASMase(\u2013/\u2013) mice. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest an involvement of the ASMase in the activation, expansion or maturation of virus\u2010specific CD8(\u002B) T cells during the acute infection of mice with the LCM virus.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Uterm\u00F6hlen, O.; Karow, U.; Baschuk, N.; Herz, J.; Loegters, T.

We investigated serum mannose\u2010binding lectin (MBL) levels and polymorphisms in the MBL gene in type 1 diabetic (T1DM) patients with and without diabetic nephropathy and associated macrovascular complications. Polymorphisms in the MBL gene and serum MBL levels were determined in 199 T1DM patients with overt nephropathy and 192 T1DM patients with persistent normoalbuminuria matched for age, sex and duration of diabetes as well as in 100 healthy control subjects. The frequencies of high and low expression MBL genotypes were similar in patients with T1DM and healthy controls. High MBL genotypes were significantly more frequent in diabetic patients with nephropathy than in the normoalbuminuric group, and the risk of having nephropathy, given a high MBL genotype, assessed by odds ratio was 1.52 (1.02\u20132.27), P = 0.04. Median serum MBL concentrations were significantly higher in patients with nephropathy than in patients with normoalbuminuria [2306 \u00B5g/l (IQR 753\u20134867 \u00B5g/l) versus 1491 \u00B5g/l (IQR 577\u20132944), P = 0.0003], and even when comparing patients with identical genotypes, serum MBL levels were higher in the nephropathy group than in the normoalbuminuric group.

The differences in MBL levels between patients with and without vascular complications were driven primarily by pronounced differences among carriers of high MBL genotypes (P \u003C 0.0001).

Expression of CD89 can be stimulated by inflammatory cytokines, activated complement factors and certain microbial components. In one study, unstimulated phagocytes were able to ingest IgA antibody\u2010treated pneumococci, but only in the presence of complement, which was found to be activated by the IgA antibodies along the alternative pathway. Pneumococci produce IgA1 protease that cleaves human IgA1, but not IgA2, molecules in the hinge region. This leaves IgA1 as Fab\u03B1 (monovalent) deprived of Fc\u03B1 which contains the docking site for CD89. IgA1 is the vastly predominant subclass of IgA in the upper airways and circulation of humans. Aims: To examine the effects of IgA1 protease activity and complement on phagocytosis of IgA antibody\u2010coated pneumococci by an unstimulated human phagocytic cell line (hl60). Materials and methods: IgA1 and IgA2 monoclonal antibodies to serotype 4 pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide (ps) were generated by heterohybridoma technique involving B cells from human vaccinees. Isogenic serotype 4 pneumococci with and without IgA1 protease activity, respectively, were obtained after inactivation of the iga gene of the TIGR4 strain. Opsonophagocytosis was quantitated using the assay described by Romero\u2010Steiner et al. Based on enumeration of surviving bacteria by culture. The integrity of IgA molecules was examined by western blotting. Results: Both IgA1 and IgA2 antibody to type\u20104 polysaccharide\u2010induced phagocytosis of IgA1 protease\u2010deficient type\u20104 pneumococci equally well in the absence as in the presence of complement. Iga1 antibody to type\u20104 polysaccharide displayed a fourfold higher opsonophagocytosis titer against IgA1 protease deficient compared to homologous wildtype target bacteria. A similar effect of IgA1 protease activity of the target bacteria was not observed in a parallel experiment where IgA2 antibody to type\u20104 polysaccharide served as opsonin. IgA1 antibody extracted from IgA1 protease\u2010producing target bacteria was almost exclusively in the form of Fab\u03B1. Conversely, IgA1 from protease\u2010deficient bacteria and IgA2 from both types of bacteria were intact. Conclusions: These results indicate that the IgA1 protease activity of S. neumoniae may help the bacteria escape IgA1 antibody\u2010mediated opsonophagocytosis. Besides, in these experiments, IgA\u2010mediated opsonophagocytosis was independent of complement.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reinholdt, J.; Baxendale, H.; Ekstr\u00F6m, N.; Kayhty, H.; Poulsen, K.; Kilian, M.","journal":"Scand J Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/90a3d91db9857a61bec466985cdee9ea15e6cde3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169534/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjszMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pneumococci"],"organizations":["Fca","Isogenic"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Iga1 antibody","human IgA1","IgA1 protease deficient","leaves IgA1","effects of IgA1 protease activity","induced phagocytosis of IgA1 protease","similar effect of IgA1 protease activity","IgA2 antibody","phagocytosis of IgA antibody","deficient bacteria","iga gene","types of bacteria","specific IgA antibodies","integrity of IgA molecules","deficient type","presence of complement","predominant subclass of IgA","enumeration of surviving bacteria","homologous wildtype target bacteria","IgA2 monoclonal antibodies","coated pneumococci","treated pneumococci","mediated opsonophagocytosis","independent of complement","unstimulated phagocytes","pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide","human vaccinees","mononuclear phagocytes","Results","Expression of CD89","fourfold higher opsonophagocytosis titer","unstimulated human phagocytic cell line","form of Fab\u03B1","Isogenic serotype","efficient opsonins","neutrophils","heterohybridoma technique","upper airways","factors","B cells","hl60","methods","neumoniae","parallel experiment","Steiner","Fc\u03B1","circulation of humans","inflammatory cytokines","certain microbial components","Romero","docking site","assay","study","TIGR4 strain","culture","Fca receptor","hinge region","western blotting","alternative pathway","absence","Materials","experiments","inactivation","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

This first crystal structure of a 2\u2032\u20105\u2032\u2010oligoadenylate synthetase reveals a structural conservation with the 3\u2032\u2010specific poly(A) polymerase that, coupled with structure\u2010guided mutagenesis, supports a conserved catalytic mechanism for the 2\u2032\u2010 and 3\u2032\u2010specific nucleotidyl transferases. Comparison with structures of other superfamily members indicates that the donor substrates are bound by conserved active site features while the acceptor substrates are oriented by nonconserved regions. The 2\u2032\u20105\u2032\u2010oligoadenylate synthetases are activated by viral double\u2010stranded RNA in infected cells and initiate a cellular response by synthesizing 2\u2032\u20105\u2032\u2010oligoadenylates, that in turn activate RNase L. This crystal structure suggests that activation involves a domain\u2013domain shift and identifies a putative dsRNA activation site that is probed by mutagenesis. We demonstrated that this site is required both for the binding of dsRNA and for the subsequent activation of OAS. This RNA\u2010binding site is different from known RNA\u2010binding site; rather than forming a defined three\u2010dimensional domain, it is located at the interface of the two major domains in OAS. This novel architecture ensures that the dsRNA helix can make simultaneously contact with both domains of OAS and ensure the subsequent structural rearrangement leading to the activation of OAS.

We studied the effect of major and minor surgery on potential variations in sVEGF and sVEGFR1 concentrations in vivo and on bacterial antigen\u2010induced release of sVEGF and sVEGFR1 from whole blood in vitro. Methods: Sixty\u2010one patients with abdominal diseases undergoing five different surgical procedures were included. Blood samples were drawn from anaesthetized patients before and after the operation. White blood cells and platelets were counted, and plasma sVEGF and sVEGFR1 was determined by an ELISA method. Whole blood from each blood sample was stimulated in vitro with bacteria\u2010derived antigens (LPS or protein\u2010A) and sVEGF and sVEGFR1 levels were subsequently determined in the supernatants. Stimulation with isotonic saline served as control assay. Results: Neither sVEGF or sVEGFR1 in plasma changed during surgery. In vitro stimulation of blood samples with bacteria\u2010derived antigens resulted in a significant increase in sVEGF (P \u003C 0.0001) and a less pronounced but still significant increase in sVEGFR1. Release of sVEGF due to stimulation was significantly higher after the operation (nonsignificant), whereas sVEGFR1 release remained largely unchanged after surgery. Correlation between bacterial antigen\u2010induced release of sVEGF and neutrophile cell count was highly significant (P \u003C 0.0001). There was no correlation between sVEGF and platelet cell count, and bacterial antigen\u2010induced sVEGFR1 release did not correlate with counts of neutrophils and platelets. Conclusions: Plasma sVEGF and sVEGFR1 concentrations did not change during surgery. In vitro bacterial stimulation led to increased release of sVEGF and sVEGFR1, which was not significantly amplified during surgery and which may be related to number of circulating neutrophils.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Svendsen, M.

Previously, ectopic GC have been associated with increased local autoantibody production. The aim of this study was to determine whether GC in primary Sj\u00F6gren\u0027s syndrome (pSS) defines a distinct seroimmunological phenotype. Retrospectively, a material of 130 haematoxylin and eosin\u2010stained paraffin\u2010embedded tissue sections of minor salivary gland tissue from patients with pSS was morphologically screened for the presence of ectopic GC. GC\u2010like lesions were detected in 33/130 (25%) of the pSS patients. Seventy\u2010two pSS patients lacking these structures (GC\u2010) were randomly selected for comparison. Focus score was significantly increased in the GC(\u002B) patients compared to the GC(\u2013) patients (P = 0.035). In the GC(\u002B) group, 54.5% of the patients presented with anti\u2010Ro/SSA compared to 43.7% in the GC(\u2013) group. Anti\u2010La/SSB was detected in 31.3% of the GC(\u002B) patients compared to 25.7% of the GC(\u2013) patients. Sixty\u2010one percentage of GC(\u002B) patients presented with increased levels of IgG, a nonsignificant difference when compared to 39.4% in the GC(\u2013) patients (P = 0.089). Levels of RF, ANA, ENA, IgM and IgA were similar in both patient groups, as were ESR and CRP. In conclusion, patients with ectopic GC have a higher focus score and more often present with autoantibodies and increased levels of IgG compared to pSS patients with regular focal infiltration (GC(\u2013)). Our findings may indicate a certain seroimmunological phenotype and warrant for further prospective studies.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jonsson, M. V.; Brun, J.

Eighty\u2010nine species of algae were recorded, five of which were previously unrecorded for New South Wales. The area studied is dominated by the large brown algae Ecklonia radiata and Phyllospora comosa, large areas of which were cleared periodically by storms. Turf, shade and crustose coralline algal communities also were present. Storms, seasonal variation and longer term changes all affected the abundance and distribution of the algal species growing along the transect and hence the floristic composition of the area.","publish_time":"2006-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"MAY, VALERIE; LARKUM, A.

Methods: Ethical analysis is carried out by examining arguments that can be made in favor or against such a mandatory measure and by seeking a reasonably balanced position between them. Arguments under consideration are based on the duties of health professionals and public health authorities, the consequences of their actions and on other ethical principles. The importance of relevant empirical data is stressed without any attempt to review or analyze them systematically. Results: Mandatory vaccination of some health care professionals during a serious pandemic of influenza can be justified, but only under certain limited conditions. Conclusions: In the throes of an influenza pandemic, health care professionals (and to a variable degree, other health care workers) have an ethical obligation to accept influenza vaccination if it is reasonably safe and effective. The ethical responsibility of public health authorities is to limit the impact of a pandemic on the population by all reasonable means, which clearly includes the appropriate use of vaccine. Consequently, the vaccination of health care staff can be made mandatory under certain conditions. However, a critical objection to this conclusion, which upholds that a voluntary vaccination program (an ethically much less problematic intervention) is just as effective, needs to be addressed.","publish_time":"2006-11-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kotalik, Jaro","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7161670.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161670/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs3MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health care professionals","health care workers","vaccination of health care staff","duties of health professionals","influenza vaccination","ethical responsibility of public health authorities","influenza pandemic","mandatory vaccination program","serious pandemic of influenza","voluntary vaccination program","mandatory measure","ethical obligation","Ethical analysis","ethical principles","certain conditions","arguments","certain limited conditions","reasonably balanced position","variable degree","population","actions","consequences","impact","throes","importance of relevant empirical data","reasonable means","favor","Results","problematic intervention","appropriate use of vaccine","critical objection","attempt","consideration","Methods","Conclusions","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

(1) In the wake of a plague, politics tends to shape a community\u0027s response in protecting the system, evaluating performances and allocating blame, punishments, and rewards, and restructuring organizations. (2) Because of their potential for demographic and institutional destruction, systemic responses to plague tend to become entwined in politics at all levels \u2013 the local, national, and international.","publish_time":"2006-08-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schwirian, Kent P.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d10418200137830c9672ef9767db3c2164830d2f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7161672.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161672/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs3MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Republic"],"keyphrases":["politics","SARS epidemic","local level","institutional destruction","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","systemic responses","demographic","late autumn","Foshan city","rewards","punishments","blame","levels","People\u0027s Republic of China","performances","potential","community\u0027s response","restructuring organizations","continent","plagues","global events","theses","wake","months","countries"],"language":"en"},

In a matter of months there were around 8,000 infections and over 689 deaths related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In my hometown, Toronto, 43 people died of SARS during the outbreaks of 2003. Approach \u2013 This chapter examines issues of class and poverty in emergence of SARS. The chapter begins with a discussion of the political economy of the emergence of SARS, and its relation to the spread of the virus. It then discusses issues of public policy, and particularly neo-liberal cuts to social services and public spending, that set the stage for the SARS outbreak, influenced its impact and contributed to the failures of response in Ontario. Findings \u2013 Through analysis of the lack of social resources available to working people in the province and the prioritizing of corporate, particularly tourism industry, concerns, the chapter illustrates how issues of class underpinned public responses to SARS, exacerbating problems. The chapter concludes by giving attention to the need for social solidarity and community mutual aid. Contributions to the field \u2013 The chapter shows the extent to which neo-liberal governments prioritize business security above the health and social security of workers and reveals some of the ways in which the pressures of capitalist social relations make people ill.","publish_time":"2010-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shantz, Jeffrey","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/53ca9f8582622a1c1bf1e7eb344c11a005b6d7dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162428.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162428/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs4MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["chapter","emergence of SARS","SARS outbreak","social solidarity","social services","people","social security of workers","issues of class","issues of public policy","lack of social resources available","pressures of capitalist social relations","public spending","public responses","Toronto","neo-liberal cuts","neo-liberal governments","business security","deadly virus","world attention","health","deaths","prioritizing of corporate","news","places","lives","tourism industry","severe acute respiratory syndrome","need","concerns","extent","poverty","community mutual aid","province","analysis","political economy","stage","ways","Beijing","field","discussion","impact","problems","failures of response","Ontario","infections","Findings","half","spread","Contributions","hometown","Approach","outbreaks","matter of months"],"language":"en"},

Systematic differences in species characteristics between eastern North American species and their New Zealand counterparts prevented the initial version of the model from running acceptably with New Zealand species. Several equations were identified as responsible, and those modeling available light were extended to give more robust formulations. The resulting model (LINKNZ) was evaluated by comparing site simulations against independent field measurements of stand sequences and across temperature and moisture gradients. It successfully simulated gap dynamics and forest succession for a range of temperate forest ecosystems in New Zealand, while retaining its utility for the forests of eastern North America. These simulations provided insight into New Zealand conifer\u2013hardwood and beech species forest succession. The adequacy of the ecological processes, such as soil moisture balance, decomposition rates, and nutrient cycling, embodied in a forest simulation model was tested by applying it to New Zealand forest ecosystems. This gave support to the model\u2019s underlying hypothesis, derived from LINKAGES, that interactions among demographic, microbial, and geological processes can explain much of the observed variation in ecosystem carbon and nitrogen storage and cycling. The addition of a disturbance option to the model supported the hypothesis that large\u2010scale disturbance significantly affects New Zealand forest dynamics.","publish_time":"2000-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hall, Graeme M.

This study details the preparation of poly\u2010L\u2010lysine\u2010based pencil graphite electrodes (PLL/PGEs) and use of the coated electrodes for direct ultrasensitive DNA hybridization detection.

SUMMARY: Immune\u2010complex diseases in man and animals 1. In certain infectious diseases the clinical signs and changes in organs are not due to the direct effects of the infectious agent. After deposition or local formation of pathogenic immune complexes there develop in a series of target organs characteristic inflammatory processes; an immune complex disease develops. 2. From numerous observations of spontaneous diseases as well as experimental studies it is possible to explain which factors are responsible for the development, biological effects, elimination and localization of immune complexes in the tissues. The most important factors responsible for determining the pathogenicity of immune complexes are the nature of the antigen, class and sub\u2010class of immunoglobulin, molar relationship between antigen and antibody, rate of production and availability of both immune reactants, and the functional state of the reticulo\u2010endothelial system. In addition, genetic factors may be important since they determine the amount of antibody produced as well as its affinity for the antigen. 3. The pathogenic, especially the inflammation\u2010stimulating action, of immune complexes rests on their ability to activate the complement system i. e. the formation of biologically active complement breakdown products; to react with Fc\u2010receptors on thrombocytes, neutrophil and eosinophil granulocytes and macrophages; and also to activate mediators of the kinin system. 4. The localization of circulating immune complexes in tissues is determined by the size of the immune complex, the molar relations between antigen and antibody, the haemodynamic relationships in the area of deposition, the local increase in vascular permeability caused by vaso\u2010active mediators, and, in the case of the kidney, by the presence of C 3 b\u2010receptors in the glomeruli. Immune complexes have some significance as regulators of cell\u2010mediated and humoral responses since they can react with cells which carry Fc and C receptors and can sometimes increase and at other times reduce the immune response. 5. Circulating immune complexes have a pathogenic effect after deposition in certain target organs such as renal glomeruli, vessel walls, choroid plexus, synovial membranes and skin, as well as after activation of humoral and cellular mediators. The reasons for the continuing persistence of immune complexes in the circulation are deficient elimination by the monocyte\u2010macrophage system, lack of certain complement factors, an antigen\u2010antibody relationship unfavourable for phagocytosis, and the degree of antibody affinity; these various reasons are discussed. 6. The development of new methods to detect immune complexes in biological fluids and in tissues has resulted in explaining the primary importance of immune complexes in the development of diseases in man and animals. In some diseases the aetiology can be further explained after indentifying the antigens in isolated immune complexes.","publish_time":"2010-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Trautwein, G.","journal":"J Vet

We also constructed the first infectious DNA clones of a DNA mycovirus. Our results show that DNA-A and DNA-B are mutually interdependent for their replication and are associated with severely reduced colony growth and hypovirulence. DNA-C relies on DNA-A and DNA-B for replication and is necessary for the recovery of abnormal fungal phenotypes. DNA-C also enhances the accumulation of viral DNA in infected fungi and permits stable colonization and easy transmission via conidia. This is the first multipartite DNA virus isolated from a fungus.

Evolution of pathogens within the lifetime of a host individual is implicated as a strong selective force in the evolution of sex and aging in the host. However, this assumption or its testable predictions have not been examined empirically. We classified infectious bacteria and viruses into those that can have continued long-term existence on the host body (group 1) versus those that have only a short-term interaction during an active infection (group 2). We surveyed the literature for age-specific incidence data about infections from both the groups. The age trends of the two groups show contrasting patterns. The incidence of infections by all group 1 pathogens showed a 2.28- to 28-fold increase in older ages. In group 2, 6 out of the 9 pathogens showed a significant declining trend in incidence with age. In both groups, there was greater mortality or morbidity among the infected in the old-age classes. These patterns are better explained by pathogen evolution than by age-related decline in immunity.

The objective of the study was to explore the role of TRIM62 in reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) infection and its potential molecular mechanism. We first demonstrated that the REV infection affected the TRIM62 expression first upregulated and then downregulated in CEF cells. Next, we evaluated the effect of TRIM62 on viral replication. Overexpression of TRIM62 decreased REV replication. On the contrary, silencing of endogenously expressed TRIM62 increased viral replication. Then, to explore the necessity of domains in TRIM62\u0027s negative regulation on viral replication, we transfected CEF cells with TRIM62 domain deletion mutants. Deletion domain partially abolished TRIM62\u0027s antiviral activity. The effect of SPRY domain deletion was the highest and that of coiled-coil was the lowest. Further, we identified 18 proteins that coimmunoprecipitated and interacted with TRIM62 by immunocoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis. Strikingly, among which, both Ras-related protein Rab-5b (RAB5B) and Arp2/3 complex 34-kDa subunit (ARPC2) were involved in actin cytoskeletal pathway. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that chicken TRIM62 provides host defense against viral infection, and all domains are required for its action. RAB5B and ARPC2 may play important roles in its negative regulation processes.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Ling; Niu, Dongyan; Yang, Jie; Bi, Jianmin; Zhang, Lingjuan; Cheng, Ziqiang; Wang, Guihua","journal":"Front Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d93c41ec19c3c8ee0f70f131ef06fd034a0db9ea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7146716.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7146716/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs2ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CEF","SPRY"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of TRIM62","effect of TRIM62","abolished TRIM62","chicken TRIM62","TRIM62 expression","Overexpression of TRIM62","TRIM62 domain deletion mutants","viral replication","viral infection","REV replication","REV infection","Deletion domain","effect of SPRY domain deletion","s negative regulation","negative regulation processes","CEF cells","ARPC2","RAB5B","antiviral processes","s antiviral activity","important roles","necessity of domains","host defense","reticuloendotheliosis virus","Ras-related protein Rab","Arp2","TRIM family","tripartite motif","immunocoprecipitation","mass spectrometry analysis","potential molecular mechanism","kDa subunit","coiled-coil","Emerging evidence","member","silencing","actin cytoskeletal pathway","study","results","objective","action","proteins"],"language":"en"},

Our study showed that codon usage bias of DEV UL21 had strong bias towards the A-ended or T-ended codons, and GC3s contents of the codon usage bias in DEV UL21 gene were significantly varied compared with those of other 27 reference herpesviruses. The CAI, ENC value of DEV CHv strain UL21 gene is 0.615 and 55.167, respectively, indicating that the codon usage bias of this gene is weak and lowly expressed. The plot of ENC versus GC3S content revealed that DEV UL21 gene is subject to GC compositional constraints.

We propose a novel variational recurrent seq2seq (VRSS) retrieval model for this seq2seq task. Unlike most cross-modal methods, we generate an image vector corresponding to the latent topic obtained from combining the text semantics and context. This synthetic image embedding point associated with every text embedding point can then be employed for either image generation or image retrieval as desired. We evaluate the model for the application of stepwise illustration of recipes, where a sequence of relevant images are retrieved to best match the steps described in the text. To this end, we build and release a new Stepwise Recipe dataset for research purposes, containing 10K recipes (sequences of image-text pairs) having a total of 67K image-text pairs. To our knowledge, it is the first publicly available dataset to offer rich semantic descriptions in a focused category such as food or recipes.

CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that variables at suitable spatial resolution may be useful in improving the predictive powers of models for disease outbreaks.","publish_time":"2015-07-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lai, Poh-Chin; Chow, Chun Bong; Wong, Ho Ting; Kwong, Kim Hung; Liu, Shao Haei; Tong, Wah Kun; Cheung, Wai Keung; Wong, Wing Leung; Kwan, Yat Wah","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148642/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs5MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["population factors","suitable spatial resolution","higher spatial resolution","disease outbreaks","disease incidence","RESULTS","disease transmission modeling","different geographic scales","population census statistics","risk factors","different degrees","geographic aggregation levels","socio-demographic data","Patient records of confirmed H1N1 influenza","proxies","predictive powers of models","METHODS","variables","study","OBJECTIVE","degree of association","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

However, some jurisdictions, particularly the United States, have provisions and procedures for screening human remains along the same lines as they do cargo. As this article will discuss, the trouble with this subject is that it has not been given the attention it requires, which has led to a hopelessly fragmented approach in regulating this aspect of air cargo. The High Level Conference on Aviation Security, convened by the International Civil Aviation Organization from 12 to 14 September 2012 in Montreal, focused on three overarching themes - cargo security, sustainability of security measures and innovation in addressing threats to aviation security. The Conference did not address the carriage by air of human remains from a security perspective. However, if one were to apply one of the key principles recognized by the Conference \u2013 that each State should ensure that appropriate security controls, including screening where applicable, are applied to cargo and mail, prior to their being loaded onto an aircraft engaged in passenger commercial air transport operations, the operative words would be \u201Csecurity controls\u201D which bring to bear the reality that different States could have different security controls and that they should be harmonized. This article discusses the manner in which such controls can be harmonized from a regulatory perspective in the context of the carriage by air of human remains.","publish_time":"2012-10-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abeyratne, Ruwantissa","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149049/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["International Civil Aviation Organization","State"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["Aviation Security","security perspective","different security controls","appropriate security controls","air of human remains","overarching themes - cargo security","sustainability of security measures","aspect of air cargo","screening human","carriage","different States","article","passenger commercial air transport operations","High Level Conference","United States","context of sanitation","International Civil Aviation Organization","regulatory perspective","operative words","innovation","provisions","procedures","threats","global community","aircraft","reality","lines","fragmented approach","Montreal","trouble","safety","jurisdictions","key principles","manner","subject","mail","attention"],"language":"en"},

The role that temporary immunity (vaccinated-induced) and treatment of infected people play in the spread of disease, is incorporated in the model. The basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] is found, under certain conditions on the incidence rate and treatment function. It is shown that the model exhibits two equilibria, namely, the disease-free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium. By constructing a suitable Lyapunov function, it is observed that the global asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium depends on [Formula: see text] as well as on the treatment rate. If [Formula: see text] , then the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable with the help of the Li and Muldowney geometric approach applied to four dimensional systems.

Today, virologists are beginning to think of viruses as living organisms that can be classified phylogenetically into defined species, much like any other living organism. The primary reasons for this shift in attitude can be partially attributed to the discovery of giant viruses, having large genomes and complex regulatory systems. Aside from that, it has become obvious that viruses lead complex lives; they evolve, speciate, and participate in the evolution of all classes of living organisms. In this chapter, we will discuss the early attempts to classify viruses, and review the biologic properties of the classes of virus that contain human pathogens.","publish_time":"2019-06-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berman, Jules J.","journal":"Taxonomic Guide to Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149528.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149528/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjszMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["discovery of giant viruses","classes of living organisms","classes of virus","complex lives","complex regulatory systems","large genomes","nonliving infectious particles","genetic material","biologic properties","evolution","primary reasons","shift","attitude","protein capsid","human pathogens","speciate","past","early attempts","defined species","chapter","virologists"],"language":"en"},

The anatomy of the rabbit eye reflects its niche as a diurnal herbivore. The rabbit has both photopic and scotopic vision without the benefit of a tapetum. Orbits are laterally situated; the rabbit is one of the few animals in which the orbital axis coincides with the visual axis. The shape of the orbit is circular, compared to the cone shaped human orbit. The orbital walls are of bone, except inferiorly, where the wall is formed partially by the muscles of mastication. The superior orbital wall is formed by the frontal bone. The supraorbital process of the frontal bone contains three supraorbital foramina, which are unique feature of the rabbit orbit; the foramina are incisures formed into apertures by a cartilaginous sheet. The optic foramina share a common canal anteriorly with only a thin boney plate to divide them, which disappears posteriorly to form one canal opening into the cranium as a single foramen. Entropion in young rabbits can occur as a primary or as a secondary condition arising from infection. Viral-induced eyelid proliferations can result from infection by the rabbit myxoma and papilloma viruses. The papilloma virus is a part of the papovaviridae and is a DNA virus transmitted by arthropod vectors. The cottontail rabbit in the mid-western United States is most frequently affected, although domestic rabbits are susceptible.","publish_time":"2013-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peiffer, Robert L.; Pohm-Thorsen, Laurie; Corcoran, Kelly","journal":"The Biology of the Laboratory Rabbit","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149682.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149682/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjszNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["rabbit orbit","rabbit eye","cottontail rabbit","rabbit myxoma","supraorbital foramina","frontal bone","orbital axis","infection","optic foramina","anatomy","human orbit","orbital walls","superior orbital wall","supraorbital process","DNA virus","visual axis","young rabbits","common canal","papilloma viruses","domestic rabbits","incisures","unique feature","mid-western United States","scotopic vision","benefit","apertures","photopic","niche","physiology","Viral-induced eyelid proliferations","cranium","arthropod vectors","secondary condition","cone","papovaviridae","comparative perspective","animals","cartilaginous sheet","diurnal herbivore","single foramen","tapetum","Entropion","chapter","shape","boney plate","muscles of mastication","Orbits"],"language":"en"},

Vesalius, W. Harvey, and F. Glisson. Vesalius is referred to as the founder of modern human anatomy, and in his influential book, De humani corporis fabrica libri septem, he elaborated the first anatomical atlas of the hepatic portal venous system (Vesalius 2013). Sir William Harvey laid the foundations of modern cardiovascular research with his Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus (Harvey 1931) in which he established the nature of blood circulation. Finally, F. Glisson characterized the gastrointestinal-hepatic vascular system (Child 1955). These physiological descriptions were later complemented with clinical observations. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Morgagni, Puckelt, Cruveilhier, and Osler were the first to make the connection between common hepatic complications \u2013 ascites, splenomegaly, and gastrointestinal bleeding \u2013 and obstruction of the portal system (Sandblom 1993). These were the foundations that allowed Gilbert, Villaret, and Thompson to establish an early definition of portal hypertension at the beginning of the twentieth century. In this period, Thompson performed the first direct measurement of portal pressure by laparotomy in some patients (Gilbert and Villaret 1906; Thompson et al. 1937). Considering all these milestones, and paraphrasing Sir Isaac Newton, if hepatologists have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants. Nowadays, our understanding of the pathogenesis of portal hypertension has largely improved thanks to the progress in preclinical and clinical research. However, this field is ever-changing and hepatologists are continually identifying novel pathological mechanisms and developing new therapeutic strategies for this clinical condition. Hence, the aim of this chapter is to summarize the current knowledge about this clinical condition.","publish_time":"2015-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morales-Ruiz, Manuel; Rodr\u00EDguez-Vita, Juan; Ribera, Jordi; Jim\u00E9nez, Wladimiro","journal":"PanVascular Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b08b8516281dc6e5271e608c2fe93f45d15076a2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153457.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153457/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjsxMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["A.

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), together with the genetically related coronaviruses of turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) and ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), is a group 3 coronavirus, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus being tentatively in group 4, the other known mammalian coronaviruses being in groups 1 and 2. IBV replicates not only in respiratory tissues (including the nose, trachea, lungs and airsacs, causing respiratory disease), but also in the kidney (associated with minor or major nephritis), oviduct, and in many parts of the alimentary tract\u2014the oesophagus, proventriculus, duodenum, jejunum, bursa of Fabricius, caecal tonsils, rectum and cloaca, usually without clinical effects. The virus can persist, being re-excreted at the onset of egg laying (4 to 5 months of age), believed to be a consequence of the stress of coming into lay. Genetic lines of chickens differ in the extent to which IBV causes mortality in chicks, and in respect of clearance of the virus after the acute phase. Live attenuated (by passage in chicken embryonated eggs) IBV strains were introduced as vaccines in the 1950s, followed a couple of decades later by inactivated vaccines for boosting protection in egg-laying birds. Live vaccines are usually applied to meat-type chickens at 1 day of age. In experimental situations this can result in sterile immunity when challenged by virulent homologous virus. Although 100% of chickens may be protected (against clinical signs and loss of ciliary activity in trachea), sometimes 10% of vaccinated chicks may not respond with a protective immune response. Protection is short lived, the start of the decline being apparent 9 weeks after vaccination with vaccines based on highly attenuated strains. IBV exists as scores of serotypes (defined by the neutralization test), cross-protection often being poor. Consequently, chickens may be re-vaccinated, with the same or another serotype, two or three weeks later. Single applications of inactivated virus has generally led to protection of \u003C50% of chickens. Two applications have led to 90 to 100% protection in some reports, but remaining below 50% in others. In practice in the field, inactivated vaccines are used in laying birds that have previously been primed with two or three live attenuated virus vaccinations. This increases protection of the laying birds against egg production losses and induces a sustained level of serum antibody, which is passed to progeny. The large spike glycoprotein (S) comprises a carboxy-terminal S2 subunit (approximately 625 amino acid residues), which anchors S in the virus envelope, and an amino-terminal S1 subunit (approximately 520 residues), believed to largely form the distal bulbous part of S. The S1 subunit (purified from IBV virus, expressed using baculovirus or expressed in birds from a fowlpoxvirus vector) induced virus neutralizing antibody. Although protective immune responses were induced, multiple inoculations were required and the percentage of protected chickens was too low (\u003C50%) for commercial application. Remarkably, expression of S1 in birds using a non-pathogenic fowl adenovirus vector induced protection in 90% and 100% of chickens in two experiments. Differences of as little as 5% between the S1 sequences can result in poor cross-protection. Differences in S1 of 2 to 3% (10 to 15 amino acids) can change serotype, suggesting that a small number of epitopes are immunodominant with respect to neutralizing antibody. Initial studies of the role of the IBV nucleocapsid protein (N) in immunity suggested that immunization with bacterially expressed N, while not inducing protection directly, improved the induction of protection by a subsequent inoculation with inactivated IBV. In another study, two intramuscular immunizations of a plasmid expressing N induced protective immunity. The basis of immunity to IBV is not well understood. Serum antibody levels do not correlate with protection, although local antibody is believed to play a role. Adoptive transfer of IBV-infection-induced \u03B1\u03B2 T cells bearing CD8 antigen protected chicks from challenge infection. In conclusion, live attenuated IBV vaccines induce good, although short-lived, protection against homologous challenge, although a minority of individuals may respond poorly. Inactivated IBV vaccines are insufficiently efficacious when applied only once and in the absence of priming by live vaccine. Two applications of inactivated IBV are much more efficacious, although this is not a commercially viable proposition in the poultry industry. However, the cost and logistics of multiple application of a SARS inactivated vaccine would be more acceptable for the protection of human populations, especially if limited to targeted groups (e.g. health care workers and high-risk contacts). Application of a SARS vaccine is perhaps best limited to a minimal number of targeted individuals who can be monitored, as some vaccinated persons might, if infected by SARS coronavirus, become asymptomatic excretors of virus, thereby posing a risk to non-vaccinated people. Looking further into the future, the high efficacy of the fowl adenovirus vector expressing the IBV S1 subunit provides optimism for a live SARS vaccine, if that were deemed to be necessary, with the possibility of including the N protein gene.","publish_time":"2010-07-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cavanagh, Dave","journal":"Avian Pathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f1d647d43af4ed96625ed113f8bf0ab737e2f0c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7154303.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7154303/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjsxMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV virus","inactivated vaccines","virus envelope","Live vaccines","laying birds","increases protection","Infectious bronchitis virus","IBV strains","poor cross-protection","infectious bronchitis of chickens","live attenuated virus vaccinations","Single applications of inactivated virus","virulent homologous virus","percentage of protected chickens","IBV replicates","meat-type chickens","Genetic lines of chickens","amino-terminal S1 subunit","S1 sequences","expression of S1","onset of egg laying","porcine coronaviruses","attenuated strains","respiratory tissues","respiratory disease","amino acid residues","related coronaviruses of turkey","trachea","known mammalian coronaviruses","amino acids","weeks","vaccinated chicks","Differences","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","carboxy-terminal S2 subunit","egg production losses","Gallus gallus domesticus","protective immune responses","fowlpoxvirus vector","clinical signs","respect of clearance","acute phase","sustained level of serum antibody","clinical effects","day of age","months of age","non-pathogenic fowl adenovirus vector","Meleagris gallopavo","proventriculus","bursa of Fabricius","jejunum","SARS","chicken embryonated eggs","passage","caecal tonsils","ring-necked pheasant","oesophagus","duodenum","cloaca","decline","rectum","sterile immunity","loss of ciliary activity","immunodominant","lungs","airsacs","nose","start","Phasianus colchicus","multiple inoculations","small number of epitopes","oviduct","alimentary tract","bovine","canine","neutralization test","mortality","extent","couple of decades","major nephritis","large spike glycoprotein","parts","groups","scores of serotypes","practice","field","baculovirus","experimental situations","kidney","diseases","commercial application","consequence","stress","progeny","experiments","reports","Inactivated IBV vaccines","applications of inactivated IBV","SARS inactivated vaccine","IBV nucleocapsid protein","live SARS vaccine","live attenuated IBV vaccines","live vaccine","IBV S1 subunit","Adoptive transfer of IBV","induction of protection","SARS coronavirus","N induced protective immunity","N protein gene","protection of human populations","challenge infection","role","basis of immunity","targeted groups","homologous challenge","minimal number of targeted individuals","minority of individuals","local antibody","vaccinated persons","infection-induced \u03B1\u03B2 T cells","logistics of multiple application","Serum antibody levels","non-vaccinated people","CD8 antigen","fowl adenovirus vector","health care workers","chicks","plasmid","optimism","high efficacy","subsequent inoculation","intramuscular immunizations","high-risk contacts","asymptomatic excretors of virus","possibility","conclusion","viable proposition","poultry industry","cost","absence of priming","Initial studies","future","study"],"language":"en"},

Pathologies of these species include infectious, toxic, and other disease processes, such as ship strike and entanglements in free-ranging animals. In animals under managed care, concerns include nutritional, degenerative and geriatric processes, such as formation of ammonium urate renal calculi. Due to potential population level effects and individual animal health concerns, viral agents of interest include morbilliviruses, pox virus, and herpes viruses. Both free ranging and captive animals have important neoplasms, including a variety of toxin-related tumors in beluga whales from the St. Lawrence Estuary and oral squamous cell carcinomas in bottlenose dolphins in managed care.","publish_time":"2018-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"St. Leger, Judy; Raverty, Stephen; Mena, Alexandria","journal":"Pathology of Wildlife and Zoo Animals","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150327.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7150327/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs1MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["beluga whales","baleen whales","managed care","captive animals","free ranging","freshwater toothed whales","bottlenose dolphins","disease processes","geriatric processes","largest mammals","diverse group of mammals","individual animal health concerns","oral squamous cell carcinomas","Lawrence Estuary","viral agents","potential population level effects","important neoplasms","variety of toxin","morbilliviruses","related tumors","ship strike","earth","formation of ammonium urate renal calculi","pox virus","pathology of cetaceans","entanglements","herpes viruses","species","taxa","porpoises","aquatic habitats","Pathologies"],"language":"en"},

The various types of solids and the composition of the samples influence the results and there is no technique available today which is 100% efficient under varied circumstances. Negative findings may be misleading, because there is no guarantee that the virus cultivation system employed will reveal all the virus types present in the sample. For some sludges it is possible to detect viruses by direct inoculation in cell cultures. Such a method may give 10-50% recovery, essentially depending on a balance between the cell-toxicity of the samples, the tenacity of the virus to stick to the solids and the care given the cell cultures. In most methods viruses are extracted from the sample either by elution by high pH (8.5-11.5), by proteinaceous media, with chelating agents, agitation with solvents or by sonication.

Most typically caused by respiratory syncytial virus in 70% of cases, the condition lasts for 4 to 7 days, with a prolonged cough in many. Children with comorbidity, particularly those born prematurely or with significant congenital heart disease, are at risk of more severe disease. Nasal obstruction progresses over 3 to 4 days to difficulty with feeding and increased work of breathing with hypoxemia. Crackles and/or wheeze may be auscultated. Apnoea may be a presenting sign in those less than 3 months of age. Viral load is highest at peak of symptoms and in those with more severe disease. Approximately 2% to 3% of all children are admitted to hospital with bronchiolitis. The differential diagnosis may include bacterial pneumonia, congenital lesions of the lung or heart, or an interstitial lung disease. There are no effective treatments, and admission is for feeding support (by nasogastric or intravenous fluids) or treatment of hypoxemia. Critical care support is required for some infants experiencing respiratory failure, though mortality rates remain unchanged. Practice within and between countries varies significantly and alignment of practice is a common goal of guidelines. Vaccines for RSV are in advanced development, as are several antiviral therapies for RSV. In most children, acute symptoms improve within 5 to 7 days and cough by 2 weeks. Recurrent wheeze is common following acute bronchiolitis and a good association with a diagnosis of asthma in childhood.","publish_time":"2018-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cunningham, Steve","journal":"Kendig\u0027s Disorders of the Respiratory Tract in Children","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7152174/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs4Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Acute viral bronchiolitis","days","severe disease","common following acute bronchiolitis","acute symptoms","young children","interstitial lung disease","significant congenital heart disease","common viral lower respiratory tract infection","Viral load","respiratory failure","RSV","feeding","common goal of guidelines","respiratory syncytial virus","congenital lesions","diagnosis of asthma","differential diagnosis","peak of symptoms","Recurrent wheeze","treatment of hypoxemia","alignment of practice","prolonged cough","Critical care support","good association","bacterial pneumonia","intravenous fluids","increased work of breathing","infants","risk","advanced development","mortality rates","difficulty","antiviral therapies","cases","admission","Vaccines","countries","presenting sign","Apnoea","effective treatments","childhood","condition","weeks","hospital","months of age","Nasal obstruction","Crackles","comorbidity"],"language":"en"},

It was surmised that this might be because of increased sensitivity to one of the common families of respiratory viruses. Two lines of study were therefore followed. In the first, men were examined at intervals throughout their stay in Antarctica at Stonington Island, and their titers of specific antibody against a wide range of respiratory viruses were measured throughout the isolation period. The second line of study consisted of three clinical trials in which a dose of a known respiratory virus was given to a number of subjects. The clinical and serological responses and the spread of the organism within the community were observed. The results of these investigations were compared with those of similar trials in England carried out at the Common Cold Unit at Salisbury. The results of the study suggested that it is possible to introduce a virus into a closed community, and under primitive conditions, to record its spread and the symptoms it causes.","publish_time":"2013-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Holmes, M.J.","journal":"Polar Human Biology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7152200/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs4NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Common Cold"],"locations":["Antarctica","Stonington Island","England"],"keyphrases":["known respiratory virus","common families of respiratory viruses","wide range of respiratory viruses","spread","Antarctica","acute respiratory infections","clinical trials","line of study","lines of study","men","results","closed community","similar trials","years isolation","isolation period","Common Cold Unit","titers of specific antibody","dose","Stonington Island","stay","England","primitive conditions","serological responses","Salisbury","intervals","organism","increased sensitivity","chapter","reports","investigations","number of subjects","symptoms"],"language":"en"},

Interferon \u03B2 (IFN-\u03B2) is a single protein species and is molecularly related to IFN-\u03B1 subtypes, although it is antigenically distinct from them. IFN omega (IFN-\u03C9) is antigenically distinct from IFN-\u03B1 and IFN-\u03B2 but is molecularly related to both. The genes of three IFN subtypes are tandemly arranged on the short arm of chromosome 9. They are transiently expressed following induction by various exogenous stimuli, including viruses. They are synthesized from their respective mRNAs for relatively short periods following gene activation and are secreted to act, via specific cell surface receptors, on other cells. IFN-\u03B1 subtypes are secreted proteins and as such are transcribed from mRNAs as precursor proteins, pre-IFN-\u03B1, containing N-terminal signal polypeptides of 23 hydrophobic amino acids (aa) mainly. Pre-IFN-\u03B2 contains 187 aa, of which 21 comprise the N-terminal signal polypeptide and 166 comprise the mature IFN-\u03B2 protein. IFN-\u03C9 contains 195 aa\u2014the N-terminal 23 comprising the signal sequence and the remaining 172, the mature IFN-\u03C9 protein. At the C-terminus, the aa sequence of IFN-\u03C9 is six residues longer than that of IFN-\u03B1 or IFN-\u03B2 proteins. IFN-\u03B1, as a mixture of subtypes, and IFN-\u03C9 may be produced together following viral infection of null lymphocytes or monocytes/macrophages. The biological activities of IFNs are mostly dependent upon protein synthesis with selective subsets of proteins mediating individual activities.

In the web-2 era much of this misinformation is disseminated via social media where information could spread easily and quickly. Monitoring social media content provides crucial insights for health managers to manage the crisis. OBJECTIVE Objective: Given the misinformation surrounding COVID-19 outbreak, this study was aimed to analyze contents of the most commonly used social networks in Iran that is among the affected countries. METHODS Methods: A social media monitoring conducted through a qualitative design to analyze the discussions of social media users about the content related to COVID-19 transferred via Iranian medical faculty members\u0060 groups in Telegram and Whats App during Feb 20 to March 20, 2020 emphasizing the misinformation. Discourse analysis was applied and the written dialogues and discussions regarding misinformation about different aspects of the outbreak between medical faculty members all over the country were analyzed. RESULTS Results: Cultural factors, demand pressure for information during the crisis, the easiness of information dissemination via social networks, marketing incentives and the poor legal supervision of online contents are the main reasons of misinformation dissemination. Disease statistics; treatments, vaccines and medicines; prevention and protection methods; dietary recommendations and disease transmission ways are the main subjective categories of releasing misinformation regarding novel coronavirus outbreak. Consequences of misinformation dissemination regarding disease include psychosocial; economic; health status; health system and ethical ones. Active and effective presence of health professionals and authorities on social media during the crisis and the improvement of public health literacy in the long term are the most recommended strategies for dealing with issues related to misinformation. CONCLUSIONS Conclusion: This study contributes the management of COVID-19 outbreak trough providing applicable insights for health managers to manage public information in this challenging time.

CoVs are a large family of viruses (enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses), which includes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). New SARS CoV2 is the members of Betacoronavirus genus. These viruses cause infections in bats, camels and humans, and a few other associated species. Despite many neurologic complications associated with SARSCoV-2 infection, it is still unclear whether these symptoms results from direct neural injury or due to some other reason. Currently, it appears that most of the neurological symptoms of COVID-19 are non-specific and secondary to the systemic illness. A single case of acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy has been reported. SARS-CoV-2 associated Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome is an atypical case. Till today, no convincing evidence is available to confirm that the SARS-CoV-2 virus directly affects nerves system in humans.

A questionnaire was used as a data collection tool. For that purpose, the authors designed a questionnaire specifically for this research via the \u0022Google Forms\u0022 web. This consisted of 40 open- and close-ended questions. The questionnaire was completed by 1375 (67.1%) students. Accordingly, 52.4% of medical students reported feeling mentally unwell. Although 50.8% of medical students reported generally/usually obtaining information about COVID-19 through the social media, 82.0% did not trust information/messages arriving through the social media and WhatsApp. We found that 86.7% of students regarded frequent hand washing as the most important means of protection against COVID-19, and 19.3% of students did not regard the COVID-19 pandemic as a severe public health problem for Turkey at that moment. In addition, 61.6% of students stated that a suppression strategy involving tight restrictions need to be applied to being the pandemic under control in Turkey. Use can be made of medical students in the transmission of accurate information during the COVID-19 pandemic. Students can be excellent activists on these subjects in countries in which medical education is suspended. Measures therefore need to be taken concerning the transmission of up to date and accurate information to medical students.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aker, Servet; M\u0131d\u0131k, \u00D6zlem","journal":"Journal of community health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10900-020-00841-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32415519/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ondokuz May\u0131s University Medical Faculty","The Medical Faculty","WhatsApp"],"locations":["Turkey"],"keyphrases":["medical students","views of medical faculty students","COVID","medical education","Ondokuz May\u0131s University Medical Faculty students","pandemic","questionnaire","transmission of accurate information","Turkey","social media","descriptive study","severe public health problem","subjects","countries","date","important means of protection","frequent hand washing","suppression strategy","excellent activists","Google Forms","tight restrictions","moment","research","messages","data collection tool","questions","web","purpose","authors","WhatsApp","control","Use","aim","addition","Measures"],"language":"en"},

Amino acid-based supramolecular polymer hydrogels, which boast intrinsic antibacterial activity, are an important solution due to their good biocompatibility, cost effectiveness, and tunable structural properties. Herein, we reported three types of transparent supramolecular hydrogel with intrinsic antibacterial activity from self-assembly of commercially available Fmoc-tryptophan (Fmoc-W), Fmoc-methionine (Fmoc-M), and Fmoc-tyrosine (Fmoc-Y). The resulting hydrogels selectively inhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria. Moreover, the order of antibacterial activity was Fmoc-W hydrogel \u003E Fmoc-M hydrogel \u003E Fmoc-Y hydrogel. The critical aggregation concentration (CAC) values were found at concentrations of approximately 0.0293, 0.1172, and 0.4688 mM for Fmoc-W, Fmoc-M, and Fmoc-Y, respectively. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images revealed rigid and aligned nanofibers for Fmoc-W hydrogel, while flexible nanofibers for Fmoc-M hydrogel and Fmoc-Y hydrogel. The results indicated that stronger aggregation capability of the gelator and the synergistic nanostructural morphology with more rigid and aligned nanofibers can lead to higher antibacterial activity of its corresponding hydrogel. In addition, the molecular arrangements of Fmoc-amino acids in the hydrogels may also contribute to their antibacterial activity.

Limited data are available for liver function in COVID-19 patients. We aimed to investigate the risk factors related to liver injury in the COVID-19 patients. METHODS A retrospective study was performed in Non-ICU Ward at Jinyintan Hospital from February 2, 2020 to February 23, 2020. Consecutively confirmed COVID-19 discharged cases were enrolled. The clinical characteristics of patients with liver injury and without liver injury were compared. RESULTS A total of 79 COVID-19 patients were included. 31.6%, 35.4% and 5.1% COVID-19 patients had elevated levels of ALT, AST and bilirubin, respectively. Median value of ALT, AST and bilirubin for entire cohort were 36.5 (17.5~71.5) U/L, 34.5 (25.3~ 55.3) U/L and 12.7 (8.1~15.4) mmol/L, respectively. There were no significant differences in age, previous medical history, and symptoms between the two groups. Males were more likely to have liver injury when infected with COVID-19 (p\u003C0.05); Compared to patients without liver injury, patients with liver injury had increased levels of white blood cell counts, neutrophils, CRP and CT score (p\u003C 0.05), and had a longer length of stay (p\u003C 0.05). Logistic regression analyses suggested that the extent of pulmonary lesions on CT was a predictor of liver function damage (p\u003C 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Liver injury is common in Non-ICU hospitalized COVID-19 patients. It may be related to systemic inflammation. Intense monitoring and evaluation of liver function in patients with severe pulmonary imaging lesions should be considered.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xie, Hansheng; Zhao, Jianming; Lian, Ningfang; Lin, Su; Xie, Qunfang; Zhuo, Huichang","journal":"Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/liv.14449; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32239591/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsxMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BACKGROUND \u0026 AIMS Coronavirus","CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CONCLUSIONS Liver injury","evaluation of liver function","confirmed COVID","predictor of liver function damage","clinical characteristics of patients","AST","bilirubin","Non-ICU Ward","elevated levels of ALT","extent of pulmonary lesions","CT score","severe pulmonary imaging lesions","Median value of ALT","levels of white blood cell counts","neutrophils","CRP","previous medical history","significant differences","retrospective study","symptoms","Jinyintan Hospital","discharged cases","Limited data","Intense monitoring","world concern","entire cohort","Logistic regression analyses","global epidemic","longer length of stay","Coronavirus disease","risk factors","BACKGROUND","METHODS","Males","total","systemic inflammation","groups","mmol"],"language":"en"},

During April 2020, ExoFlo was provided to 24 SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients at a single hospital center, all of whom met criteria for severe COVID-19 as well as moderate to severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Patients received a single 15 mL intravenous dose of ExoFlo and were evaluated for both safety and efficacy day 1-14 post-treatment. All safety endpoints were met with no adverse events observed within 72 hours of ExoFlo administration. A survival rate of 83% was observed. 17/24 (71%) of the patients recovered; 3/24 (13%) remained critically ill though stable; 4/24 (16%) expired for reasons unrelated to the treatment. Overall, after one treatment, patients\u0027 clinical status and oxygenation improved with an average PaO2/FiO2 ratio increase of 192% (p \u003C 0.001). Laboratory values revealed significant improvements in absolute neutrophil count [mean reduction 32% [(p-value \u003C 0.001)] and lymphopenia with average CD3\u002B, CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B lymphocyte counts increasing by 46% (p \u003C 0.05), 45% (p \u003C 0.05), and 46% (p \u003C 0.001), respectively.

Kidney transplant recipients are commonly prescribed renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (AAS) inhibitors given the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. As the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) facilitates the entry of coronaviruses into target cells, there have been hypotheses that preexisting use of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) inhibitors may increase the risk of developing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Given the common use of RAAS inhibitors among solid organ transplant recipients, we sought to review the RAAS cascade, the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 entry, and pertinent data related to the effect of RAAS inhibitors on ACE2 to guide management of solid organ transplant recipients during the COVID-19 pandemic. At present there is no clear evidence to support the discontinuation of RAAS inhibitors in solid organ transplant recipients during the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Sunnie Y; Brubaker, Aleah L; Wang, Aileen X; Taiwo, Adetokunbo A; Melcher, Marc L","journal":"Clinical transplantation","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/ctr.13991; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32446267/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsyMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["management of solid organ transplant recipients","outcomes of solid organ transplant recipients","discontinuation of RAAS inhibitors","Kidney transplant recipients","effect of RAAS inhibitors","common use of RAAS inhibitors","RAAS cascade","COVID","Angiotensin-Aldosterone System","prescribed renin-angiotensin","use of Renin","ACE2","SARS-CoV","coronavirus disease","pandemic","mechanism of SARS","entry of coronaviruses","pertinent data","cardiovascular disease","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","risk","prevalence of hypertension","target cells","diabetes","hypotheses","clear evidence","present","infection","enzyme"],"language":"en"},

However, the influence of hemodynamic factors on clinical outcome is still unclear after EVT. Dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) is an important brain reserve mechanism and is impaired after AIS. This study aimed to explore the role of dCA in predicting the outcome of AIS patients after EVT. METHODS AIS patients with severe stenosis/occlusion of unilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) or internal carotid and treatment with EVT were enrolled to receive dCA examinations at the 24 h, 72 h and 7th day after stroke onset. Healthy volunteers were also recruited as controls. DCA was recorded from spontaneous fluctuations of blood pressure and MCA flow velocity. Transfer function analysis was used to derive dCA parameters, including phase difference (PD) and coherence in the low-frequency range (0.06-0.12 Hz). The clinical outcome was measured using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days after onset. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to reveal the correlation between dCA and clinical outcomes. The receiver operation characteristics (ROC) curve was performed to determine the cut-off point of PD. RESULTS A total of 62 AIS patients and 77 healthy controls were included. Compared with controls, dCA were impaired bilaterally till to 7th day after onset in patients, presenting as much lower PD value on the ipsilateral side. During follow-up, we found that PD on the ipsilateral side at 24 h after onset was significantly lower in patients with unfavourable outcome (n = 41) than those with favourable outcome (n = 21), even after adjustment of confounding factors (p = 0.009). ROC curve analysis revealed that PD \u003C 26.93\u00B0 was an independent predictor of unfavourable-outcome. CONCLUSION In AIS patients after EVT, dCA was impaired on both sides over the first 7 days. PD on the ipsilateral side at 24 h after onset is an independent unfavourable-outcome predictor for AIS after EVT.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tian, Ge; Ji, Zhong; Huang, Kaibin; Lin, Zhenzhou; Pan, Suyue; Wu, Yongming","journal":"BMC neurology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12883-020-01737-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32414382/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsyNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AIS","EVT","MCA","DCA","PD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["outcome of AIS patients","EVT","unfavourable outcome","METHODS AIS patients","dCA parameters","role of dCA","dCA examinations","independent unfavourable-outcome predictor","stroke onset","lower PD value","healthy controls","independent predictor of unfavourable","cerebral reperfusion","ROC curve analysis","clinical outcomes","days","Dynamic cerebral autoregulation","severe stenosis","severe acute ischemic stroke","Healthy volunteers","occlusion of unilateral middle cerebral artery","MCA flow velocity","influence of hemodynamic factors","adjustment of confounding factors","Transfer function analysis","coherence","spontaneous fluctuations of blood pressure","internal carotid","moderate","mRS","phase difference","RESULTS","total","important brain reserve mechanism","modified Rankin Scale","low-frequency range","receiver operation characteristics","treatment","correlation","cut-off point of","BACKGROUND Endovascular therapy","CONCLUSION","Multivariate logistic regression","Hz","sides","study","follow-up"],"language":"en"},

The NGS workflow comprises several steps, namely sample processing, library preparation, sequencing and primary/secondary/tertiary bioinformatics (BI) analyses. The latter is constituted by a complex process extremely difficult to standardize, due to the variety of tools and metrics available. Thus, it is of the utmost importance to assess the comparability of results obtained through different methods and in different laboratories. To achieve this goal, we have organized a proficiency test focused on the bioinformatics components for the generation of complete genome sequences of salmonid rhabdoviruses. METHODS Three partners, that performed virus sequencing using different commercial library preparation kits and NGS platforms, gathered together and shared with each other 75 raw datasets which were analyzed separately by the participants to produce a consensus sequence according to their own bioinformatics pipeline. Results were then compared to highlight discrepancies, and a subset of inconsistencies were investigated more in detail. RESULTS In total, we observed 526 discrepancies, of which 39.5% were located at genome termini, 14.1% at intergenic regions and 46.4% at coding regions. Among these, 10 SNPs and 99 indels caused changes in the protein products. Overall reproducibility was 99.94%. Based on the analysis of a subset of inconsistencies investigated more in-depth, manual curation appeared the most critical step affecting sequence comparability, suggesting that the harmonization of this phase is crucial to obtain comparable results. The analysis of a calibrator sample allowed assessing BI accuracy, being 99.983%. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated the applicability and the usefulness of BI proficiency testing to assure the quality of NGS data, and recommend a wider implementation of such exercises to guarantee sequence data uniformity among different virology laboratories.","publish_time":"2019-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zamperin, Gianpiero; Lucas, Pierrick; Cano, Irene; Ryder, David; Abbadi, Miriam; Stone, David; Cuenca, Argelia; Vigouroux, Estelle; Blanchard, Yannick; Panzarin, Valentina","journal":"Virology journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-019-1223-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31752912/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjszMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NGS","BI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different laboratories","different methods","different virology laboratories","comparability of results","generation sequencing","sequence comparability","NGS platforms","NGS workflow","comparable results","quality of NGS data","different commercial library preparation kits","virus sequencing","sequence data uniformity","bioinformatics components","tertiary bioinformatics","consensus sequence","bioinformatics pipeline","subset of inconsistencies","research laboratories","analysis","usefulness of BI proficiency testing","assessing BI accuracy","calibrator sample","sample processing","genome termini","veterinary virology","intergenic regions","variety of tools","variety of disciplines","coding regions","highlight discrepancies","generation of complete genome sequences of salmonid rhabdoviruses","manual curation","critical step","exercises","steps","indels","changes","phase","applicability","harmonization","wider implementation","protein products","metrics available","partners","analyses","BACKGROUND","utmost importance","complex process","SNPs","diagnostics","participants","total","raw datasets","Overall reproducibility","CONCLUSIONS","goal"],"language":"en"},

These artificial tissues were then successfully transplanted into ewe goats with total LSCD. Binding of EpiASCs to the base membrane of an EpiASCs-HAM-Sheet (EHS) indicated their proliferating status. After transplantation, the EpiASCs could survive in the host tissue and they reconstructed the damaged ocular surface of total LSCD. The crystal reconstructed corneal epithelium expressed CK3 and Pax-6 similar to normal corneal epithelium and expressed the Sry gene after transplantation. These results demonstrated that EpiASCs could be induced to differentiate into corneal epithelial cell types in a corneal microenvironment and had the ability to activate corneal genetic programs.

DESIGN Analysis of Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) registry data, supplemented by an ICU surge capability survey and veterinary facilities survey (both March 2020). SETTINGS All Australian ICUs and veterinary facilities. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Baseline numbers of ICU beds, ventilators, dialysis machines, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machines, intravenous infusion pumps, and staff (senior medical staff, registered nurses); incremental capability to increase capacity (surge) by increasing ICU bed numbers; ventilator-to-bed ratios; number of ventilators in veterinary facilities. RESULTS The 191 ICUs in Australia provide 2378 intensive care beds during baseline activity (9.3 ICU beds per 100 000 population). Of the 175 ICUs that responded to the surge survey (with 2228 intensive care beds), a maximal surge would add an additional 4258 intensive care beds (191% increase) and 2631 invasive ventilators (120% increase). This surge would require additional staffing of as many as 4092 senior doctors (245% increase over baseline) and 42 720 registered ICU nurses (269% increase over baseline). An additional 188 ventilators are available in veterinary facilities, including 179 human model ventilators. CONCLUSIONS The directors of Australian ICUs report that intensive care bed capacity could be near tripled in response to the expected increase in demand caused by COVID-19. But maximal surge in bed numbers could be hampered by a shortfall in invasive ventilators and would also require a large increase in clinician and nursing staff numbers.","publish_time":"2020-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Litton, Edward; Bucci, Tamara; Chavan, Shaila; Ho, Yvonne Y; Holley, Anthony; Howard, Gretta; Huckson, Sue; Kwong, Philomena; Millar, Johnny; Nguyen, Nhi; Secombe, Paul; Ziegenfuss, Marc; Pilcher, David","journal":"The Medical journal of Australia","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.5694/mja2.50596; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32306408/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs0MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["New Zealand Intensive Care Society","ICU"],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["intensive care beds","expected increase","intensive care bed capacity","surge survey","large increase","ICU bed numbers","capacity of intensive care units","ICU surge capability survey","maximal surge","invasive ventilators","veterinary facilities survey","number of ventilators","New Zealand Intensive Care Society","registered ICU nurses","MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Baseline numbers of ICU beds","nursing staff numbers","human model ventilators","directors of Australian ICUs report","baseline activity","bed ratios","senior medical staff","registered nurses","demand","additional staffing","COVID","DESIGN Analysis of Australian","dialysis machines","incremental capability","senior doctors","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machines","intravenous infusion pumps","ANZICS","registry data","clinician","CONCLUSIONS","response","SETTINGS","shortfall","OBJECTIVES","population"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this review is to characterize how the CFIR has been applied in LMIC contexts, to evaluate the utility of specific constructs to global implementation science research, and to identify opportunities to refine the CFIR to optimize utility in LMIC settings. METHODS A systematic literature review was performed to evaluate the use of the CFIR in LMICs. Citation searches were conducted in Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, CINAHL, SCOPUS, and Web of Science. Data abstraction included study location, study design, phase of implementation, manner of implementation (ex., data analysis), domains and constructs used, and justifications for use, among other variables. A standardized questionnaire was sent to the corresponding authors of included studies to determine which CFIR domains and constructs authors found to be compatible with use in LMICs and to solicit feedback regarding ways in which CFIR performance could be improved for use in LMICs. RESULTS Our database search yielded 504 articles, of which 34 met final inclusion criteria. The studies took place across 21 countries and focused on 18 different health topics. The studies primarily used qualitative study designs (68%). Over half (59%) of the studies applied the CFIR at study endline, primarily to guide data analysis or to contextualize study findings. Nineteen (59%) of the contacted authors participated in the survey. Authors unanimously identified culture and engaging as compatible with use in global implementation research. Only two constructs, patient needs and resources and individual stages of change were commonly identified as incompatible with use. Author feedback centered on team level influences on implementation, as well as systems characteristics, such as health system architecture. We propose a \u0022Characteristics of Systems\u0022 domain and eleven novel constructs be added to the CFIR to increase its compatibility for use in LMICs. CONCLUSIONS These additions provide global implementation science practitioners opportunities to account for systems-level determinants operating independently of the implementing organization. Newly proposed constructs require further reliability and validity assessments.

Methods This study was conducted in a consecutive series of 130 patients. 134 procedures were performed for treating these patients in Hanoi Medical University Hospital and Bach Mai Hospital from January 2012 to April 2017. 143 flow diverter stents (Pipeline, FRED and SILK) were used. Aneurysm morphology, stent patency and cerebral parenchyma before and after intervention were analyzed on images of digital subtraction angiography (DSA), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR). The follow-up data after 3-6 months and 12 months were recorded. Results In 130 patients (31 men, 99 women), aneurysms of internal carotid artery were mostly common (92.6%), especially in cavernous (35.1%) and in para-ophthalmic (40.3%) segments. 83 cases (61.9%) had wide-neck aneurysms, and 16 cases (11.9%) had multiple aneurysms, and only 5 cases (3.7%) had blister-liked aneurysms. Endovascular treatment was successfully performed at rate of 94.8%. In 3 patients, the stent could not be delivered. Mortality and morbidity rates were 1.5% and 3.7%, respectively. MRI and MSCT follow-up at 3 months showed complete or incomplete occlusions of aneurysms was 7.4% or 17.5%, respectively. 3 patients experienced a thromboembolic event (4.3%). Conclusions Intracranial aneurysms of cavernous and para-ophthalmic segments of internal carotid artery are mostly common with wide-neck and multi aneurysms.

Our objective was to examine evidence of the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce antibiotic use and/or inappropriate use in LTCFs. DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL from 1997 until November 2018. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Controlled and uncontrolled studies in LTCFs measuring intervention effects on rates of overall antibiotic use and/or appropriateness of use were included. Secondary outcomes were intervention implementation barriers from process evaluations. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers independently applied the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care group\u0027s resources to classify interventions and assess risk of bias. Meta-analyses used random effects models to pool results. RESULTS Of include studies (n=19), 10 had a control group and 17 had a high risk of bias. All interventions had multiple components. Eight studies (with high risk of bias) showed positive impacts on outcomes and included one of the following interventions: audit and feedback, introduction of care pathways or an infectious disease team. Meta-analyses on change in the percentage of residents on antibiotics (pooled relative risk (RR) (three studies, 6862 residents): 0.85, 95% CI: 0.61 to 1.18), appropriateness of decision to treat with antibiotics (pooled RR (three studies, 993 antibiotic orders): 1.10, 95% CI: 0.64 to 1.91) and appropriateness of antibiotic selection for respiratory tract infections (pooled RR (three studies, 292 orders): 1.15, 95% CI: 0.95 to 1.40), showed no significant intervention effects. However, meta-analyses only included results from intervention groups since most studies lacked a control group. Insufficient data prevented meta-analysis on other outcomes. Process evaluations (n=7) noted poor intervention adoption, low physician engagement and high staff turnover as barriers. CONCLUSIONS There is insufficient evidence that interventions employed to date are effective at improving antibiotic use in LTCFs.

We aimed to describe the characteristics and outcomes and to analyze the risk factors for in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This two-center retrospective study was performed at two tertiary hospitals in Wuhan, China. Confirmed COVID-19 patients with diabetes (N = 153) who were discharged or died from 1 January 2020 to 8 March 2020 were identified. One sex- and age-matched COVID-19 patient without diabetes was randomly selected for each patient with diabetes. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were abstracted. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors associated with the mortality in these patients. RESULTS Of 1,561 COVID-19 patients, 153 (9.8%) had diabetes, with a median age of 64.0 (interquartile range 56.0-72.0) years. A higher proportion of intensive care unit admission (17.6% vs. 7.8%, P = 0.01) and more fatal cases (20.3% vs. 10.5%, P = 0.017) were identified in COVID-19 patients with diabetes than in the matched patients. Multivariable Cox regression analyses of these 306 patients showed that hypertension (hazard ratio [HR] 2.50, 95% CI 1.30-4.78), cardiovascular disease (HR 2.24, 95% CI 1.19-4.23), and chronic pulmonary disease (HR 2.51, 95% CI 1.07-5.90) were independently associated with in-hospital death. Diabetes (HR 1.58, 95% CI 0.84-2.99) was not statistically significantly associated with in-hospital death after adjustment. Among patients with diabetes, nonsurvivors were older (76.0 vs. 63.0 years), most were male (71.0% vs. 29.0%), and were more likely to have underlying hypertension (83.9% vs. 50.0%) and cardiovascular disease (45.2% vs. 14.8%) (all P values \u003C0.05). Age \u226570 years (HR 2.39, 95% CI 1.03-5.56) and hypertension (HR 3.10, 95% CI 1.14-8.44) were independent risk factors for in-hospital death of patients with diabetes. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 patients with diabetes had worse outcomes compared with the sex- and age-matched patients without diabetes. Older age and comorbid hypertension independently contributed to in-hospital death of patients with diabetes.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Qiao; Zhang, Xiaoyi; Jiang, Fang; Zhang, Xuanzhe; Hu, Ning; Bimu, Chibu; Feng, Jiarui; Yan, Su; Guan, Yongjun; Xu, Dongxue; He, Guangzhen; Chen, Chen; Xiong, Xingcheng; Liu, Lei; Li, Hanjun; Tao, Jing; Peng, Zhiyong; Wang, Weixing","journal":"Diabetes care","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20-0598; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32409504/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs5OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Multivariable Cox"],"organizations":["OBJECTIVE Diabetes"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["hospital death of patients","age-matched patients","OBJECTIVE Diabetes","CI","age-matched COVID","hospital mortality of COVID","Confirmed COVID","CONCLUSIONS COVID","Older age","median age","years","comorbid hypertension","underlying hypertension","cardiovascular disease","independent risk factors","sex","worse outcomes","unfavorable outcomes","P values","Multivariable Cox regression analyses","chronic pulmonary disease","Cox proportional hazards regression analyses","METHODS","higher proportion of intensive care unit admission","tertiary hospitals","center retrospective study","hazard ratio","laboratory data","interquartile range","Demographic","Wuhan","China","nonsurvivors","RESEARCH DESIGN","adjustment","RESULTS","fatal cases","male","characteristics"],"language":"en"},

Patients are at risk of progression of the existing lesions and development of new lesions upon skin injury when surgical procedures are performed. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the literature of disease unrelated surgery during active pyoderma gangrenosum. CASE PRESENTATION We present a case of femoral neck fracture in a Caucasian patient with concurrent pyoderma gangrenosum localized in the axilla. Hemiarthroplasty was safely performed after disease activity was reduced with systemic corticosteroids. Tissue-protective wound closure was used together with perioperative corticosteroids and antibiotics. No signs of pyoderma gangrenosum developed at the surgical wound site, and the axillary lesions showed constant improvement until healing with scar tissue. CONCLUSIONS In our patient, the preoperative steroid treatment, perioperative antibiotics, and soft tissue protective surgical technique led to successful management of this rare coincidence.","publish_time":"2020-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Antoni, Anna; Trautinger, Franz; Heinz, Thomas; Hajdu, Stefan","journal":"Journal of medical case reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-019-2329-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31931877/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pyoderma"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["concurrent pyoderma gangrenosum","active pyoderma gangrenosum","BACKGROUND Pyoderma gangrenosum","signs of pyoderma gangrenosum","rare coincidence","axillary lesions","existing lesions","soft tissue protective surgical technique","disease activity","surgical wound site","perioperative antibiotics","surgical procedures","Tissue-protective wound closure","rare challenge","scar tissue","perioperative corticosteroids","rare ulcerating skin disease of unknown etiology","development of new lesions","skin injury","Caucasian patient","literature of disease unrelated surgery","CASE PRESENTATION","systemic corticosteroids","case of femoral neck fracture","successful management","constant improvement","healing","preoperative steroid treatment","risk of progression","orthopedic trauma","report","Patients","CONCLUSIONS","Hemiarthroplasty"],"language":"en"},

Experimental absolute IR intensities and vibrational band centers of the overtones 2\u03BD1, 3\u03BD1, 4\u03BD1 of HFA were measured and compared with their ab initio counterparts, calculated by the second-order canonical vibrational perturbation theory (CVPT2). A hybrid potential energy surface (PES) was evaluated using the quantum-mechanical models MP2/cc-pVQZ for harmonic and MP2/cc-pVTZ for anharmonic parts. Cubic surfaces of dipole moment components were determined using the MP2/cc-pVTZ model. The predicted IR intensities for the first and second overtones reproduced the experimental values with a discrepancy of 6% and 9%, respectively. A weak Fermi resonance between the first overtone 2\u03BD1 and combination tone \u03BD1 \u002B \u03BD2 \u002B \u03BD8 was predicted. The appropriate model was employed for simulating the bands studied using: (i) the asymmetric-top vibration-rotational structure of the \u03BD1 mode, (ii) the inhomogeneous band structure due to contributions of the vibrational states populated at the room temperature, and (iii) the homogeneous broadening of each vibration-rotation transition due to the intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR). The rotational and vibrational anharmonic constants were taken from the ab initio calculations, whereas the IVR data were obtained from the experimental data of Chekalin et al.

The clinical spectrum of this infection includes, in order of lesser to greater severity, asymptomatic viremia, paucisymptomatic forms, clinical conditions characterized by respiratory failure that needs mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit, systemic manifestations of infection, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. There is currently no vaccine to prevent CoViD-19, but the international scientific community is intensely focused on finding a vaccine that will prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In the meanwhile, to prevent hospitals from risking collapse, it is crucial to stratify patients at high risk of poor lung progression, to find effective monitoring strategies, even at home, for the positive patients and/or those highly at risk of positivity of CoViD-19. Starting from the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the development of this infection up to the clinical characteristics of the infected patients, in this review we tried to focus on the crucial points of the infection in combination with the appropriateness of the medical intervention. We aim to offer indications of therapeutic intervention that are timely and, as far as possible, effective, targeted to the individual patient in relation to age, clinical condition and comorbidities. An early diagnosis associated with an appropriate therapeutic action in the initial stages of the disease can reduce the progression of CoViD-19 towards interstitial pneumonia, thus interfering with the number of transfers to intensive care and lethality of the pandemic in progress.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Basta, Giuseppina; Del Turco, Serena; Caselli, Chiara; Melani, Luca; Vianello, Annamaria","journal":"Recenti progressi in medicina","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1701/3347.33187; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32319446/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["progression of CoViD","clinical conditions","clinical characteristics","clinical spectrum","SARS-CoV","Coronavirus Disease","pandemic disease","systemic manifestations of infection","infected patients","positive patients","vaccine","intensive care unit","indications of therapeutic intervention","respiratory failure","individual patient","individual travel","new coronavirus","crucial points","risk of positivity","medical intervention","high risk of poor lung progression","appropriate therapeutic action","effective monitoring strategies","severe acute respiratory syndrome","septic shock","asymptomatic viremia","paucisymptomatic forms","greater severity","support","mechanical ventilation","multiple organ dysfunction syndromes","restrictions","China","strict containment measures","order of lesser","home","initial stages","combination","relation","lethality","Wuhan","number of transfers","appropriateness","early diagnosis","risking collapse","development","comorbidities","interstitial pneumonia","international scientific community","pathogenetic mechanisms","hospitals","outbreak","review","transmission","spread"],"language":"en"},

Our objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the benefits of high-flow nasal cannula in the peri-intubation period. DATA SOURCES We performed a comprehensive search of relevant databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science). STUDY SELECTION We included randomized clinical trials that compared high-flow nasal cannula to other noninvasive oxygen delivery systems in the peri-intubation period. DATA EXTRACTION Our primary outcome was severe desaturation (defined as peripheral oxygen saturation reading \u003C 80% during intubation). Secondary outcomes included peri-intubation complications, apneic time, PaO2 before and after intubation, PaCO2 after intubation, ICU length of stay, and short-term mortality. DATA SYNTHESIS We included 10 randomized clinical trials (n = 1,017 patients). High-flow nasal cannula had no effect on the occurrence rate of peri-intubation hypoxemia (relative risk, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.68-1.42; 0.3% absolute risk reduction, moderate certainty), serious complications (relative risk, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.71-1.06), apneic time (mean difference, 10.3 s higher with high-flow nasal cannula; 95% CI, 11.0 s lower to 31.7 s higher), PaO2 measured after preoxygenation (mean difference, 3.6 mm Hg higher; 95% CI, 3.5 mm Hg lower to 10.7 mm Hg higher), or PaO2 measured after intubation (mean difference, 27.0 mm Hg higher; 95% CI, 13.2 mm Hg lower to 67.2 mm Hg higher), when compared with conventional oxygen therapy. There was also no effect on postintubation PaCO2, ICU length of stay, or 28-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS We found moderate-to-low certainty evidence that the use of high-flow nasal cannula likely has no effect on severe desaturation, serious complications, apneic time, oxygenation, ICU length of stay, or overall survival when used in the peri-intubation period when compared with conventional oxygen therapy.","publish_time":"2020-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chaudhuri, Dipayan; Granton, David; Wang, Dominic Xiang; Einav, Sharon; Helviz, Yigal; Mauri, Tommaso; Ricard, Jean-Damien; Mancebo, Jordi; Frat, Jean-Pierre; Jog, Sameer; Hernandez, Gonzalo; Maggiore, Salvatore M; Hodgson, Carol; Jaber, Samir; Brochard, Laurent; Burns, Karen E A; Rochwerg, Bram","journal":"Critical care medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000004217; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31923025/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high-flow nasal cannula","peri-intubation complications","peri-intubation period","Hg higher","intubation hypoxemia","s higher","Hg lower","benefits of high","use of high","role of high","ICU length of stay","effect","apneic time","PaO2","mean difference","s lower","conventional oxygen therapy","serious complications","number of randomized clinical trials","relative risk","occurrence rate of peri","severe desaturation","moderate certainty","peripheral oxygen saturation","DATA EXTRACTION","DATA SYNTHESIS","DATA SOURCES","OBJECTIVE","noninvasive oxygen delivery systems","absolute risk reduction","postintubation PaCO2","short-term mortality","day mortality","low certainty evidence","MEDLINE","comprehensive search of relevant databases","EMBASE","meta-analysis","primary outcome","systematic review","overall survival","STUDY SELECTION","Secondary outcomes","preoxygenation","patients","Web of Science","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Nevertheless, the mechanisms of its emergence, adaptability in siliciclastic-dominated margins and demise, especially in southern South China Sea (SCS), are largely speculative and remains enigmatic along with a scarcity of constraints on paleoclimatic and palaeoceanographic conditions. Here we show, through newly acquired high-resolution geophysical data and accurate stratigraphic records based on strontium isotopic dating, the evolution of these platforms from ~15.5-9.5 Ma is initially tied to tectonics and eustasy, and ultimately, after ~9.5 Ma, to changes in the global climate patterns and consequent palaeoceanographic conditions. Our results demonstrate at least two paleodeltas that provided favourable substratum of elevated sand bars, which conditioning the emergence of the buildups that inadvertently mirrored the underlying strata. We show unprecedented evidences for ocean current fluctuations linked to the intensification of the Asian summer monsoon winds resulting in the formation of drifts and moats, which extirpated the platforms through sediment removal and starvation.

Three (20.0%) out of the 15 cases with diabetic ketosis developed acidosis, 5 cases (26.7%) with diabetic ketosis died, and one (25.0%) of the deaths presented with acidosis. Two (7.4%) and four (14.3%) cases of the 27 non-diabetic ketotic patients developed severe acidosis and died, respectively, and one (25.0%) of the deaths presented with acidosis. This suggested that COVID-19 infection caused ketosis or ketoacidosis, and induced DKA for those patients with diabetes. Ketosis increased the length of hospital stay and mortality. Meanwhile, diabetes increased the length of hospital stay for patients with ketosis but had no effect on their mortality. This article is protected by copyright.

Independent authors selected studies, appraised quality and extracted data. After screening 7111 titles and abstracts, eleven studies were included. Seven studies evaluated interventions for moving/handling training. Four evaluated other interventions. None focused on our primary outcome education/work dropout. All studies reported on physical complaints among student nurses only. Overall, risk of bias was high and clinical heterogeneity prohibited pooling of data. Intervention effects were small and inconsistent.

Here we tested a symbol-trained chimpanzee\u0027s recall memory of a hidden food item\u0027s identity after a 10-min delay. During this delay, the subject was sometimes (depending on the condition) shown consistent or inconsistent video information about the identity of the food, before being asked to name the item to a second experimenter blind to the reward and condition. Across all conditions, our subject, Sherman, correctly named the food item at above chance levels. In the Inconsistent condition, in which Sherman was shown a video with misleading information, his performance was the worst of all conditions (although accuracy was still high). Interestingly, however, during three of the four trials in this condition in which Sherman made a mistake, he incorrectly named the food item shown during the misleading video information. These results provide evidence that chimpanzees, like humans, may be vulnerable to misinformation effects, even when that misleading information is presented in a different modality (video) than the original live event memory, demonstrating further commonality between human and ape memory systems.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"James, Brielle T; Webster, Mackenzie F; Menzel, Charles R; Whitham, Will; Beran, Michael J","journal":"Animal cognition","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10071-020-01391-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388782/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjszNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sherman"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["misleading video information","misleading information","inconsistent video information","Sherman","Inconsistent condition","subject","misinformation effects","ape memory systems","nonhuman species\u0027 memory","widespread human memory challenges","original live event memory","hidden food item\u0027s identity","conditions","delay","symbol-trained chimpanzee\u0027s recall memory","presentation of subsequent misinformation","commonality","Errors of source monitoring","distortion","memories","performance","humans","worst","experimenter blind","different modality","evidence","chimpanzees","accuracy","reward","chance levels","mistake","results","trials"],"language":"en"},

Patients and Methods Patients undergoing esophagectomy often have little understanding about postoperative symptom management. The Mayo Clinic esophageal CONDUIT tool is a validated questionnaire comprising 5 multi-item symptom-assessment domains and 2 health-assessment domains. A prospective nonrandomized cohort study was conducted on adult patients who have had esophagectomies using the CONDUIT tool from August 17, 2015, to July 30, 2018 (NCT02530983). The Statistical Analysis System v9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used to calculate and analyze the scores. Results Over the study period, 569 patients were assessed for eligibility, and 241 patients consented and were offered the tool. Of these, 188 patients (median age: 65 years; range: 24 to 87 years; 80% male patients) had calculable scores. Of the 188 patients, 50 (26.6%) patients were identified as potential beneficiaries for educational intervention to improve symptoms (received moderate scores for a domain), and 131 (69.7%) patients were identified as needing further testing or provider intervention (received poor scores for a domain) based on the tool. Conclusion The CONDUIT tool scores, when compared with standardized scales with established preliminary normative scores, could be used to identify and triage patients who need targeted education, further testing, or provider interventions. These score ranges will serve as the first set of normative standards to aid in the interpretation of conduit performance among providers and patients.","publish_time":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mahajan, Nandita N; Lee, Minji K; Yost, Kathleen J; Pierson, Karlyn E; Viehman, Jason K; Allen, Mark S; Cassivi, Stephen D; Nichols, Francis C; Reisenauer, Janani S; Shen, K Robert; Wigle, Dennis A; Blackmon, Shanda H","journal":"Mayo Clinic proceedings.

Intense immediate postoperative pain after many spinal procedures makes its control of utmost importance. Preemptive injection of local anesthetics can significantly reduce postoperative pain during rest and movement; however, the analgesic effect is only maintained for a relatively short period of time. Whether betamethasone combined with local anesthetic for laminoplasty or laminectomy has better short-term and long-term effects than the local anesthetic alone has not been reported yet. METHODS The PRE-EASE trial is a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint, single-center clinical study including 116 participants scheduled for elective laminoplasty or laminectomy, with a 6 months\u0027 follow-up process. Preemptive local infiltration with betamethasone and ropivacaine (treatment group) or ropivacaine alone (control group) throughout the entire thickness of the planned incision site will be performed by the surgeon prior to making the incision. The primary outcome will be the cumulative butorphanol consumption within the first 48-h postoperative period.

Effective strategies that target known barriers to implementation are key to reducing this evidence to practice gap. The aim of this review is to synthesise the evidence on the effectiveness of implementation strategies in improving the provision of preconception and antenatal care for these modifiable risk factors. METHODS Randomised and non-randomised study designs will be eligible for inclusion if they have a parallel control group. We will include studies that either compare an implementation strategy to usual practice or compare two or more strategies. Participants may include any health service providing preconception or antenatal care to women and/or the health professionals working within such a service. The primary outcome will be any measure of the effectiveness of implementation strategies to improve preconception and/or antenatal care for tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption and/or weight management (including care to improve nutrition and/or physical activity). Secondary outcomes will include the effect of the implementation strategy on women\u0027s modifiable risk factors, estimates of absolute costs or cost-effectiveness and any reported unintentional consequences. Eligible studies will be identified via searching Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Maternity and Infant Care, CINAHL, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses and other sources (e.g. contacting experts in the field). Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias will be assessed independently by two review authors and differences resolved by a third reviewer. If data permits, we will conduct fixed-effects or random-effects meta-analysis where appropriate. If studies do not report the same outcome or there is significant heterogeneity, results will be summarised narratively.

METHODS An otolaryngologic triage committee was created to appropriately allocate resources to patients. Hospital ethicists provided support. Our tumor conference screened patients for non-surgical options. Patients were tested twice for Sars-CoV-2 before performing urgent contaminated operations. N95 masks and protective equipment were conserved when possible. Patients with low-grade cancers were advised to delay surgery, and other difficult decisions were made. RESULTS Hundreds of surgeries were cancelled. Sixty-five cases supervised over three weeks are tabulated.

METHODS Data from 62 treatment-naive patients with hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC), with 83 lesions in challenging locations, and who met the Milan criteria and underwent CT-RFA between June 2013 and June 2016 were reviewed. Patients were divided into one of two groups according to different treatment modalities: study group (TAE combined with RFA assisted by 3DVAPS [n = 32]); and control (RFA only [n = 30]). Oncological outcomes included ablation-related complications, local tumor progression (LTP), and overall survival (OS). Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to assess risk factors associated with LTP and OS. RESULTS HCC lesions (mean size, 1.9 \u00B1 1.0 mm in diameter) abutting the gastrointestinal tract (n = 25), heart and diaphragm (n = 21), major vessels (n = 13), and gallbladder (n = 3) were treated. A significant difference was detected in LTP between the two groups (P = 0.034), with no significant difference in OS between the two groups (P = 0.193). There were no severe complications related to ablation. Univariate analysis revealed that sex (P = 0.046) and child-turcotte-pugh (CTP) grade (P\u003C0.001) were risk factors for OS, whereas CTP grade and treatment method (P\u003C0.001) were risk factors for LTP. Multivariate analysis revealed that CTP grade B (P = 0.005) was independently associated with poor OS, and RFA alone (P\u003C0.001) was independently associated with poor LTP. CONCLUSION CT-RFA combined with TAE assisted by a 3DVAPS provided ideal clinical efficiency for HCC in challenging locations and was a highly safe treatment modality.","publish_time":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Zhi-Mei; Zuo, Meng-Xuan; Gu, Yang-Kui; Gu, Hai-Feng; Lai, Chun-Xiao; Zhang, Tian-Qi; Wang, Xiu-Chen; An, Chao; Huang, Jin-Hua","journal":"Abdominal radiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00261-020-02426-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32006072/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs2MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RFA","LTP","HCC"],"locations":["Milan"],"keyphrases":["poor OS","poor LTP","CONCLUSION CT-RFA","DVAPS","TAE","challenging locations","risk factors","groups","ablation-related complications","treatment method","CTP grade B","treatment-naive patients","RESULTS HCC lesions","different treatment modalities","hepatocellular carcinoma","safe treatment modality","Multivariate analysis","Univariate analysis","significant difference","three-dimensional visualization ablation planning system","safety of computed tomography-guided radiofrequency ablation","clinical efficacy","severe complications","ideal clinical efficiency","multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses","local tumor progression","study group","pugh","mean size","child-turcotte","Oncological outcomes","METHODS Data","overall survival","transarterial embolization","Milan criteria","gastrointestinal tract","sex","heart","major vessels","diameter","OBJECTIVE","diaphragm","gallbladder","control"],"language":"en"},

In Afghanistan, health care delivery is already a major crosscutting challenge. Although efforts to rebuild the health care systems in Afghanistan have been made (Acerra et al.), both acute and chronic illnesses remain as major medical and critical governance gaps to be remedied.

The aim of the present study was to estimate whether the CRP level is able to act as a marker in indicating the severity of COVID-19. METHODS Patients who complained cough or chest pain with or without fever were enrolled after laboratory confirmed of SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid via qRT-PCR. Chest computed tomography (CT) was then performed to classify the patients into mild, moderate and severe pneumonia groups according to the interim management guideline. Then linear regression models were applied to analyze the association between c-reactive protein (CRP) levels and severity of COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS When compared to mild pneumonia, the adjusted-Odds Ratio were 11.46, p = 0.029 and 23.40, p = 0.025 in moderate and severe pneumonia, respectively. The area under receiver operation curve was 0.898 (95% CI 0.835, 0.962, p \u003C 0.001). Higher plasma CRP level indicated severe COVID-19 pneumonia and longer inpatients duration. CONCLUSIONS The level of plasma CRP was positively correlated to the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia. Our findings could assist to discern patients of moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia from the mild ones. Our findings may be useful as an earlier indicator for severe illness and help physicians to stratify patients for intense care unit transfer.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Wei; Zheng, Kenneth I; Liu, Saiduo; Yan, Zhihan; Xu, Chongyong; Qiao, Zengpei","journal":"Annals of clinical microbiology and antimicrobials","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12941-020-00362-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32414383/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs2OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe COVID","mild pneumonia","severity of COVID","severe pneumonia groups","patients of moderate","severe illness","level of plasma CRP","Higher plasma CRP level","METHODS Patients","mild ones","findings","chest pain","coronavirus disease","Chest computed tomography","physicians","viral nucleic acid","c-reactive protein","earlier indicator","levels","SARS-CoV","intense care unit transfer","adjusted-Odds Ratio","association","qRT-PCR","interim management guideline","cough","longer inpatients duration","receiver operation curve","area","laboratory","fever","convenient biomarker","CONCLUSIONS","present study","linear regression models","aim","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

However, current measurement techniques are limited since they are assessed intermittently at non-physiological frequencies or involve specialized equipment. To this end, we introduce ZVV, a practical approach to continuously track resistance and elastance during Variable Ventilation (VV), in which frequency and tidal volume vary from breath-to-breath. ZVV segments airway pressure and flow recordings into individual breaths, calculates resistance and elastance for each breath, bins them according to frequency or tidal volume and plots the results against bin means. ZVV\u0027s feasibility was assessed clinically in five human patients with acute lung injury, experimentally in five mice ventilated before and after lavage injury, and computationally using a viscoelastic respiratory model.

However, a recent meta-analysis based on low-quality trials suggested no evidence of supplementation benefit. A systematic review and meta-analysis of high-quality observational cohort studies should provide us further evidences. METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE, and WEB-of-SCIENCE databases were systematically searched to identify eligible studies published before October 2018. Prospective cohort studies assessing the associations of serum 25(OH)D levels with MS relapses, radiological inflammatory lesions, or changes in expanded disability status scale in adults (\u226518 years) with MS were included. Pooled RRs were calculated using fixed-effect or random-effects model depending on heterogeneity. RESULTS Thirteen studies and 3498 patients were included. Each 25 nmol/L increase in serum 25(OH)D levels was associated with a reduction in (1) clinical relapse rate [RR = 0.90; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.83-0.99], (2) gadolinium-enhancing lesions (RR = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.60-0.79), (3) new/enlarging T2 lesions (RR = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.77-0.95), and (4) new active lesions (RR = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.74-0.89) in the magnetic resonance imaging(MRI). CONCLUSIONS Serum 25(OH)D levels are associated with a modest decrease in relapse rate and radiological inflammatory activities in patients with MS. The association with disability worsening remains inconclusive.","publish_time":"2020-01-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mart\u00EDnez-Lapiscina, Elena H; Mahatanan, Rattanaporn; Lee, Chih-Hong; Charoenpong, Prangthip; Hong, Jia-Pei","journal":"Journal of the neurological sciences","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2020.116668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32004798/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs3MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BACKGROUND Vitamin D"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["D levels","patients","radiological inflammatory lesions","T2 lesions","eligible studies","Prospective cohort studies","new active lesions","associations of serum","meta-analysis of high-quality observational cohort studies","MS relapses","CONCLUSIONS Serum","BACKGROUND Vitamin D supplementation","radiological inflammatory activities","recent meta-analysis","clinical relapse rate","disability worsening","evidence of supplementation benefit","expanded disability status scale","changes","low-quality trials","modest decrease","WEB","fixed-effect","adults","random-effects model","systematic review","reduction","multiple sclerosis","magnetic resonance imaging","MRI","METHODS MEDLINE","EMBASE","heterogeneity","years","increase","SCIENCE databases","Pooled RRs","confidence interval","nmol","evidences","RESULTS","gadolinium"],"language":"en"},

These roles include: (i) driving atheroprogression in the clinically stable phase of disease; (ii) inciting atheroma destabilization and precipitating acute coronary syndromes (ACS); and (iii) responding to cardiomyocyte necrosis in myocardial infarction (MI). Despite an evolving understanding of these biologic processes, successful clinical translation into effective therapies has proven challenging. Realizing the promise of targeting inflammation in the prevention and treatment of ASCVD will likely require more individualized approaches, as the degree of inflammation differs among cardiovascular patients. A large body of evidence has accumulated supporting the use of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) as a clinical measure of inflammation. Appreciating the mechanistic diversity of ACS triggers and the kinetics of hsCRP in MI may resolve purported inconsistencies from prior observational studies. Future clinical trial designs incorporating hsCRP may hold promise to enable individualized approaches. The aim of this Clinical Review is to summarize the current understanding of how inflammation contributes to ASCVD progression, destabilization, and adverse clinical outcomes. We offer forward-looking perspective on what next steps may enable successful clinical translation into effective therapeutic approaches-enabling targeting the right patients with the right therapy at the right time-on the road to more individualized ASCVD care.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lawler, Patrick R; Bhatt, Deepak L; Godoy, Lucas C; L\u00FCscher, Thomas F; Bonow, Robert O; Verma, Subodh; Ridker, Paul M","journal":"European heart journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32176778/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs4MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ACS","MI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical measure of inflammation","Clinical Review","successful clinical translation","ASCVD progression","degree of inflammation","individualized approaches","promise of targeting inflammation","adverse clinical outcomes","individualized ASCVD care","right patients","treatment of ASCVD","Systemic vascular inflammation","Future clinical trial designs","kinetics of hsCRP","atheroma destabilization","right therapy","effective therapeutic approaches","right time","destabilization of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease","cardiovascular patients","effective therapies","current understanding","evolving understanding","multiple maladaptive roles","stable phase of disease","mechanistic diversity of ACS triggers","biologic processes","purported inconsistencies","sensitivity C-reactive protein","acute coronary syndromes","steps","road","prevention","use of high","prior observational studies","cardiomyocyte necrosis","myocardial infarction","large body of evidence","atheroprogression","forward-looking perspective","aim"],"language":"en"},

This shortage has initiated discussions of how to support multiple patients with a single ventilator (ventilator splitting). Ventilator splitting is incompletely tested, experimental and the effects have not been fully characterised. This study investigated the effect of ventilator splitting on system variables (inspiratory pressure, flow, and volume) and the possibility of different ventilation targets for each limb using only standard hospital equipment. Experiments were conducted on two test lungs with different compliances (0.02 and 0.04 l.cmH2 O-1 ). The ventilator was used in both pressure and volume control modes and was set to ventilate the low compliance lungs at end-tidal volumes of 500 \u00B1 20 ml. A flow restrictor apparatus consisting of a Hoffman clamp and tracheal tube was connected in series to the inspiratory limb of the high compliance test lungs and the resistance modified to achieve end-tidal volumes of 500 \u00B1 20 ml.

Efforts to improve eye health contribute to the advancement of several SDGs, including those not exclusively health-related. This scoping review will summarise the nature and extent of the published literature that demonstrates a link between improved eye health and advancement of the SDGs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Searches will be conducted in MEDLINE, Embase and Global Health for published, peer-reviewed manuscripts, with no time period, language or geographic limits. All intervention and observational studies will be included if they report a link between a change in eye health and (1) an outcome related to one of the SDGs or (2) an element on a pathway between eye health and an SDG (eg, productivity). Two investigators will independently screen titles and abstracts, followed by full-text screening of potentially relevant articles. Reference lists of all included articles will be examined to identify further potentially relevant studies. Conflicts between the two independent investigators will be discussed and resolved with a third investigator. For included articles, data regarding publication characteristics, study details and SDG-related outcomes will be extracted. Results will be synthesised by mapping the extracted data to a logic model, which will be refined through an iterative process during data synthesis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION As this scoping review will only include published data, ethics approval will not be sought. The findings of the review will be published in an open-access, peer-reviewed journal.

To evaluate the potential infection risk of 2019-nCoV on ocular surface, we compared ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression among different eye tissues. Methods: Experimental article. Thirty mice were assigned to male, female, aging, diabetic and non-diabetic groups, with 6 mice in each group. Real-time PCR was performed to quantify ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression in conjunctiva, cornea, lacrimal gland, iris, lens, retina, lung, heart, kidney, and liver from male mice. Immunohistochemistry staining was applied to visualize the distribution of the two proteins in different mice tissues, and in human corneal and conjunctival sections. Published transcriptome datasets were extracted to generate the expression comparasion of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 between human conjunctival and corneal tissues, and results were analyzed with Mann-Whitney U test. Female mice, aging mice, STZ-induced diabetic mice, diabetic group control mice were also subjected to ACE2 expression analysis. Results were analyzed using Student\u0027s t-test. Results: The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes were the highest in conjunctiva among all the six mice eye tissues explored. The expression of these two genes in conjunctiva were lower than that in kidney and lung. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 shared similar expression pattern with the staining concentrated in corneal epithelium, conjunctival epithelium and lacrimal gland serous cells. The expression levels of ACE2 showed sex-difference. Female mice had lower ACE2 in conjunctiva and cornea than male mice, with the expression levels taking only 43% (t=3.269, P=0.031) and 63% (t=4.080, P=0.015) of that in the male conjunctiva and cornea, respectively. Diabetic mice expressed more ACE2 in conjunctiva (1.21-fold, P\u003E0.05) and lacrimal gland (1.10-fold, P\u003E0.05) compared with the control group. No significant difference on ACE2 expression was found between the aging and young adult mice. The expression level of human conjunctiva ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were significantly higher than that in the cornea (P=0.007), with 5.74-fold and 12.84-fold higher in the conjunctiva than in the corneal epithelium cells, which resembled the situation in mice. Conclusion: The observation of high-level ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in conjunctiva among the 6 eye tissues examined suggests that conjunctiva serves as an infection target tissue of 2019-nCoV.

WRKY transcription factors (TFs) are encoded by one of the largest families in plants and are involved in several biological processes such as growth and development, signal transduction, and plant defence against stress. In this study, 79 and 84 genes encoding putative WRKY TFs have been identified in two wild potato relatives, Solanum commersonii and S. chacoense. Phylogenetic analysis of WRKY proteins divided ScWRKYs and SchWRKYs into three Groups and seven subGroups. Structural and phylogenetic comparative analyses suggested an interspecific variability of WRKYs. Analysis of gene expression profiles in different tissues and under various stresses allowed to select ScWRKY045 as a good candidate in wounding-response, ScWRKY055 as a bacterial infection triggered WRKY and ScWRKY023 as a multiple stress-responsive WRKY gene. Those WRKYs were further studied through interactome analysis allowing the identification of potential co-expression relationships between ScWRKYs/SchWRKYs and genes of various pathways.

Our aim was to determine the lifetime health and cost consequences of the quality of reperfusion for patients, healthcare systems, and society. Methods- A Markov model estimated lifetime quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and lifetime costs of endovascular thrombectomy-treated patients with stroke based on eTICI grades. The analysis was performed over a lifetime horizon in a United States setting, adopting healthcare and societal perspectives. The reference case analysis was conducted for stroke at 65 years of age. National health and cost consequences of improved eTICI 2c/3 reperfusion rates were estimated. Input parameters were based on best available evidence. Results- Lifetime QALYs increased for every grade of improved reperfusion (median QALYs for eTICI 0/1: 2.62; eTICI 2a: 3.46; eTICI 2b: 5.42; eTICI 2c: 5.99; eTICI 3: 6.73). Achieving eTICI 3 over eTICI 2b reperfusion resulted on average in 1.31 incremental QALYs as well as healthcare and societal cost savings of $10 327 and $20 224 per patient. A 10% increase in the eTICI 2c/3 reperfusion rate of all annually endovascular thrombectomy-treated patients with stroke in the United States is estimated to yield additional 3656 QALYs and save $21.0 million and $36.8 million for the healthcare system and society, respectively. Conclusions- Improved reperfusion grants patients with stroke additional QALYs and leads to long-term cost savings. Procedural strategies to achieve complete reperfusion should be assessed for safety and feasibility, even when initial reperfusion seems to be adequate.","publish_time":"2020-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kunz, Wolfgang G; Almekhlafi, Mohammed A; Menon, Bijoy K; Saver, Jeffrey L; Hunink, Myriam G; Dippel, Diederik W J; Majoie, Charles B L M; Liebeskind, David S; Jovin, Tudor G; Davalos, Antoni; Bracard, Serge; Guillemin, Francis; Campbell, Bruce C V; Mitchell, Peter J; White, Philip; Muir, Keith W; Brown, Scott; Demchuk, Andrew M; Hill, Michael D; Goyal, Mayank","journal":"Stroke","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.119.027874; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31964289/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs5NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["eTICI grades","quality of reperfusion","reperfusion grade","b reperfusion","initial reperfusion","complete reperfusion","reperfusion rates","cost consequences of improved eTICI","grade of improved reperfusion","stroke additional QALYs","Conclusions- Improved reperfusion grants patients","Results- Lifetime QALYs","lifetime health","lifetime costs of endovascular thrombectomy-treated patients","lifetime horizon","median QALYs","incremental QALYs","societal cost savings","healthcare systems","long-term cost savings","Markov model estimated lifetime quality-adjusted life years","United States","society","National health","years of age","societal perspectives","reference case analysis","large vessel occlusions","expanded Thrombolysis","Cerebral Infarction","benefit","average","safety","Purpose","Methods","best available evidence","Input parameters","Procedural strategies","feasibility","scale","Background","aim","increase"],"language":"en"},

In this study, aiming to investigate these adverse events (AEs) using a large self-reporting database, we conducted a disproportionality analysis for the detection of neuropsychiatric AE signals associated with the use of chloroquine (or hydroxychloroquine), reported to FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2019. We included 2,389,474 AE cases, among which 520 cases developed neuropsychiatric AE following the use of chloroquine. Adjusted reporting odds ratio (ROR) for the development of each of the neuropsychiatric AEs following the use of chloroquine was calculated using a multilevel model: exposure to chloroquine was associated with a statistically significant high reporting of amnesia, delirium, hallucinations, depression, and loss of consciousness, (lower 95% confidence interval of the adjusted ROR \u003E 1), although the degree of increase in their ROR was limited. There was no statistically significant high reporting of any other neuropsychiatric AE, including suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation. Current pharmacovigilance study results did not suggest any potential link between the use of chloroquine and an increased risk of suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation, which would be informative during the emergency use of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sato, Kenichiro; Mano, Tatsuo; Iwata, Atsushi; Toda, Tatsushi","journal":"Bioscience trends","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.5582/bst.2020.03082; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32321905/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs5NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AE","FDA","ROR"],"locations":["United States","Europe"],"keyphrases":["emergency use of chloroquine","neuropsychiatric AEs","neuropsychiatric symptoms","AE cases","detection of neuropsychiatric AE signals","significant high reporting of amnesia","emergency treatment","adjusted ROR","treatment of COVID","large self-reporting database","Adjusted reporting odds ratio","FDA Adverse Event Reporting System","psychosis","treatment of malaria","confusion","agitation","quarter","adverse events","increased risk of suicide","Current pharmacovigilance study results","FAERS","delirium","depression","hallucinations","disproportionality analysis","confidence interval","potential link","loss of consciousness","coronavirus disease","development","multilevel model","hydroxychloroquine","patients","autoimmune diseases","antimalarial drug","exposure","United States","Europe","degree of increase"],"language":"en"},

Effective interventions and treatments at the earliest possible times are warranted to suppress the fatality of the disease to a minimum, and inappropriate treatments should be abolished. In this situation, the ability to extract most information out of the data available is critical so that important decisions can be made. Ineffectiveness of the treatment can be reflected by a constant fatality over time while effective treatment normally leads to a decreasing fatality rate. A statistical test for constant fatality over time is proposed in this article. The proposed statistic is shown to converge to a Brownian motion asymptotically under the null hypothesis. With the special features of the Brownian motion, we are able to analyze the first passage time distribution based on a sequential tests approach. This allows the null hypothesis of constant fatality rate to be rejected at the earliest possible time when adequate statistical evidence accumulates. Simulation studies show that the performance of the proposed test is good and it is extremely sensitive in picking up decreasing fatality rate. The proposed test is applied to the severe acute respiratory syndrome data in Hong Kong and Beijing.","publish_time":"2007-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lam, K. F.; Deshpande, J. V.; Lau, E. H.

SUMMARY: Attempts to establish an immunoprophylaxis for transmissible gastroenteritis virus infection of pigs I. Pathogenicity of the Bl strain after serial passages The Bl strain of TGE virus was propagated for 350 passages in swine thyroid cell cultures. Pathogenicity for newborn piglets was tested after 2, 120, 250, 300 and 350 passages. Pathological lesions observed with passage number 300 were similar to those detected with the virulent field strain. however, in a shorter portion of the small intestine. It did not, however, produce clinical symptoms when administered to newborn piglets. After 350 passages only 1/4 of the middle part of the jejunum is infected without any clinical signs. The results are discussed with respect to the possibility of using the described strain for the development of an immune prophylaxis.

SUMMARY: Studies on aerosol vaccination of chicks with inactivated vaccines against Newcastle Disease A study was made of whether and under what conditions immunity can be achieved by aerosols of inactivated Newcastle Disease vaccines. It was found that protection could be conferred only if a high concentration of antigen was reached in the vaccine; protection was not obtainable with a large volume of lower antigen concentration. Furthermore virus from chick embryos was superior, on account of its probably greater stability. The protective effect of the various aerosol vaccines was proportional to the amount of vaccine present in droplets under 5 \u03BCm. in size. Optimal immunity results from an exposure time of two hours and longer. The resulting protection was greater against conjunctival infection than against intramuscular challenge. Even in fully immune groups of birds antibodies were present only in traces and only in serum. A lasting immunity was only achieved by revaccination. In comparative studies only 5 % of the birds were immune after a single vaccination, 70 % after a second, and 100 % after the third vaccination. The practical value of vaccination with aerosols made from inactivated vaccine against ND is discussed in the light of the various limitations.

The chapter discusses how parasites can affect a man\u0027s health and it also explains their diagnosis, prevention, and control. A large number of bacteria do not cause disease. Some live in dead organic matter and are called saprophytes. Saprophytes are important in industrial and agricultural microbiology. Saprophytes are responsible, for the ripening of cheese, the fermentation of carbohydrate leading to alcohol production, and the acidification of milk. In nature, bacteria are involved in carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles. Thus, decomposition of organic matter is associated with the action of bacteria. Viruses differ from the other obligate intracellular parasites in certain important respects. Viruses are spread from patients, carriers, and healthy individuals who are in the incubation stage of the disease.","publish_time":"2014-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jamison, Jennifer R.","journal":"Man Meets Microbes","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7195943/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjsxNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["saprophytes","viruses","action of bacteria","overview of parasites","man\u0027s health","large number of bacteria","disease","chapter","obligate intracellular parasites","dead organic matter","decomposition of organic matter","tape-worms","Flat worms","groups of trematodes","non-hermaphrodites","certain important respects","carbon","flukes","alcohol production","healthy individuals","fermentation of carbohydrate","ripening of cheese","patients","carriers","nitrogen","cestodes","incubation stage","agricultural microbiology","sulfur cycles","diagnosis","acidification of milk","prevention","control","nature"],"language":"en"},

As many invertebrates are nocturnal, their spatial distribution may change from day to night. This behavioural aspect of their population dynamics has been ignored, but is now examined for the first time by testing the hypotheses: (i) a power function was a suitable model for the spatial distribution of common species of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera in a stony stream; (ii) the spatial distribution varied between species but was similar within species for larvae greater and smaller than half\u2010size; (iii) diurnal and nocturnal spatial distributions were significantly different for each species. To ensure that the conclusions were consistent, large samples (n = 30) were taken near midday and midnight in April, June and November over 4 years. 2.. Twenty\u2013one species were taken in sufficient numbers for the analyses; seven species were too sparse to be included. The first hypothesis was supported. A power function, relating spatial variance (s (2)) to mean (m), was an excellent fit in all the analyses (P \u003C 0\u00B7001, r (2) \u003E 0\u00B795), i.e. the spatial variance was density\u2013dependent. The power b, often used as an \u2018index of aggregation\u2019, varied in the range 0\u00B788\u20132\u00B750. 3.. Most analyses supported the second hypothesis. For four species, the difference between the two size groups was just significant (P \u003C 0\u00B705), but was due to inadequate data for three species. Large larvae of the fourth species, the caddis Odontocerum albicorne, were less aggregated than small larvae at night, and were the only group with a b\u2010value less than one. 4.. The third hypothesis was partially supported. The distribution did not change significantly (P \u003E 0\u00B705) for nine species; five burrowers in gravel, moss or mud, two highly mobile predators, one sedentary, case\u2013building, Trichoptera species, and one net\u2013spinning Trichoptera species. Aggregation was reduced significantly (P \u003C 0\u00B7001) at night for four species, all case\u2013building Trichoptera larvae. Aggregation increased significantly (P \u003C 0\u00B7001) at night, except at low densities, for the remaining eight species, one being a nocturnal predator and the others being herbivorous species; all occurred frequently in night samples of invertebrate drift.

In this paper, we bring forward a novel meta-transfer feature method (MetaTrans) for this problem. MetaTrans is used to train a model to predict performance improvement ratio from historical transfer learning experiences, and can consider both the Transferability between tasks and the Discriminability emphasized on targets. We apply this method to both shallow and deep transfer learning algorithms, providing a detail explanation for the success of specific transfer learning algorithms. From experimental studies, we find that different transfer learning algorithms have varying dominant factor deciding their success, so we propose a multi-task learning framework which can learn both common and specific experience from historical transfer learning results.

In particular, we focus on multi-player, skill-based card games, and use Rummy as a case study. GAIM framework provides a novel and extensible encapsulation of the game state as an image, and uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to learn these images to calibrate the goodness of the state, in such a way that the challenges arising from multiple players, chance factors and large state space, are all abstracted. We show that our model out-performs well-known image classification models, and also learns the nuances of the game without explicitly training with game-specific features, resulting in a true state model, wherein most of the misclassifications can be attributed to user mistakes or genuinely confusing hands. We show that GAIM helps gather fine-grained insights about player behavior, skill, tendencies, and business implications, that were otherwise not possible, thereby enabling targeted services and personalized player journeys.

However, most of the existing subspace clustering methods tend to only exploit the subspace information to construct a single affinity graph (typically for spectral clustering), which often lack the ability to go beyond a single graph to explore multiple graphs built in various subspaces in high-dimensional space. To address this, this paper presents a new spectral clustering approach based on subspace randomization and graph fusion (SC-SRGF) for high-dimensional data. In particular, a set of random subspaces are first generated by performing random sampling on the original feature space. Then, multiple K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) affinity graphs are constructed to capture the local structures in the generated subspaces. To fuse the multiple affinity graphs from multiple subspaces, an iterative similarity network fusion scheme is utilized to achieve a unified graph for the final spectral clustering. Experiments on twelve real-world high-dimensional datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.

For applications like ranking and cost-sensitive classification, probability estimation trees (PETs) are used. These are built using smoothing or calibration techniques. Older smoothing techniques used counts local to a leaf node, but a few more recent techniques consider the broader context of a node when doing estimation. We apply a recent advanced smoothing method called Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) to PETs, and then propose a novel hierarchical smoothing approach called Hierarchical Gradient Smoothing (HGS) as an alternative. HGS smooths leaf nodes up to all the ancestors, instead of recursively smoothing to the parent used by HDP. HGS is made faster by efficiently optimizing the Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) loss measure using gradient descent, instead of sampling used in HDP. An extensive set of experiments are conducted on 143 datasets showing that our HGS estimates are not only more accurate but also do so within a fraction of HDP time. Besides, HGS makes a single tree almost as good as a Random Forest with 10 trees. For applications that require more interpretability and efficiency, a single decision tree plus HGS is more preferred.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, He; Petitjean, Fran\u00E7ois; Buntine, Wray","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/001c647797abea963cbbd93fc85932ab96f00482.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206292.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206292/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Hierarchical Gradient Smoothing","HGS","HDP","Random Forest"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Hierarchical Gradient Smoothing","HGS estimates","Older smoothing techniques","novel hierarchical smoothing approach","recent advanced smoothing method","recent techniques","Decision trees","HGS smooths leaf nodes","single tree","single decision tree","PETs","probability estimation trees","calibration techniques","interpretability","fraction of HDP time","applications","Hierarchical Dirichlet Process","gradient descent","LOOCV","cost-sensitive classification","loss measure","efficiency","broader context","Cross-Validation","use","embedded contexts","Random Forest","datasets","sampling","extensive set of experiments","ancestors","alternative","Leave","parent"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, to investigate the function of the DPV US3 protein, we used scarless Red recombination technology based on an infectious bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing the DPV Chinese virulent strain (CHv) genome and successfully constructed and rescued a US3-deleted mutant and the corresponding revertant virus (BAC-CHv-\u0394US3 and BAC-CHv-\u0394US3R, respectively). For viral growth characteristics, compared to the parental and revertant viruses, the US3-deleted mutant showed an approximately 100-fold reduction in viral titers but no significant reduction in genome copies, indicating that the US3-deleted mutant exhibited decreased viral replication but not decreased viral DNA generation. In addition, the US3-deleted mutant formed viral plaques that were 33% smaller on average than those formed by the parental and revertant viruses, demonstrating that US3 protein affected the viral cell-to-cell spread of DPV. Finally, the results of electron microscopy showed that the deletion of US3 resulted in a large number of virions accumulating in the nucleus and perinuclear space, thus blocking virion nuclear egress. In this study, we found that the DPV US3 protein played pivotal roles in viral replication by promoting viral cell-to-cell spread and virion nuclear egress, which may provide some references for research on the function of the DPV US3 protein.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deng, Liyao; Wang, Mingshu; Cheng, Anchun; Yang, Qiao; Wu, Ying; Jia, Renyong; Chen, Shun; Zhu, Dekang; Liu, Mafeng; Zhao, Xinxin; Zhang, Shaqiu; Huang, Juan; Ou, Xumin; Mao, Sai; Zhang, Ling; Liu, Yunya; Yu, Yanling; Tian, Bin; Pan, Leichang; Rehman, Mujeeb Ur; Chen, Xiaoyue","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64190-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346128/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs5ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DPV US3 protein","viral cell","US3-deleted mutant","deletion of US3","viral titers","viral plaques","decreased viral replication","viral DNA generation","viral growth characteristics","BAC-CHv","revertant viruses","corresponding revertant virus","DPV Chinese virulent strain","function","virion nuclear egress","herpes simplex virus","duck plague virus","significant reduction","genome copies","fold reduction","pivotal roles","scarless Red recombination technology","infectious bacterial artificial chromosome","homolog","perinuclear space","HSV","nucleus","large number of virions","results of electron microscopy","references","\u0394US3R","research","addition","average","study"],"language":"en"},

The initial gastrointestinal symptoms that appear early during the course of Covid-19 support this hypothesis. Furthermore, SARS-CoV virions are preferentially released apically and not at the basement of the airway cells. Thus, in the setting of a productive infection of conducting airway epithelia, the apically released SARS-CoV may be removed by mucociliary clearance and gain access to the GI tract via a luminal exposure. In addition, post-mortem studies of mice infected by SARS-CoV have demonstrated diffuse damage to the GI tract, with the small bowel showing signs of enterocyte desquamation, edema, small vessel dilation and lymphocyte infiltration, as well as mesenteric nodes with severe hemorrhage and necrosis. Finally, the small bowel is rich in furin, a serine protease which can separate the S-spike of the coronavirus into two \u0022pinchers\u0022 (S1 and 2). The separation of the S-spike into S1 and S2 is essential for the attachment of the virion to both the ACE receptor and the cell membrane.

We performed a multicenter randomized crossover trial comparing EUS-FNB with a 20G Procore needle vs. a 22G Acquire needle. The aims were to compare the quantity of targeted tissue (pancreas) and diagnostic accuracy for the two needles. METHODS : 60 patients admitted for EUS-FNB in three endoscopy units were included. One pass was performed consecutively with each needle, in a randomized order. Histologic material was studied in a blinded manner with respect to the needle. The primary end point was mean cumulative length of tissue core biopsies per needle pass. RESULTS : Final diagnosis was adenocarcinoma (n = 46; 77 %), neuroendocrine neoplasm (n = 11; 18 %), autoimmune pancreatitis (n = 2), and mass-forming chronic pancreatitis (n = 1). The mean cumulative length of tissue core biopsies per needle pass was significantly higher with the 22G Acquire needle at 11.4 mm (95 % confidence interval [CI] 9.0 - 13.8] vs. 5.4 mm (95 %CI 3.8 - 7.0) for the 20G Procore needle (P \u003C 0.001), as was the mean surface area (3.5 mm2 [95 %CI 2.7 - 4.3] vs. 1.8 mm2 [95 %CI 1.2 - 2.3]; P \u003C 0.001).

Early and effective predictors of clinical outcomes is urgent needed to improve management of Covid-19 patients. OBJECTIVE The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether elevated D-dimer levels could predict mortality in patients with Covid-19. METHODS Patients with laboratory confirmed Covid-19 were retrospective enrolled in Wuhan Asia General Hospital from January 12, 2020 to March 15, 2020. D-dimer levels on admission, and death events were collected to calculate the optimum cutoff using receiver operating characteristic curve. According to the cutoff, the subjects were divided into two groups. Then the in-hospital mortality between two groups were compared to assess the predictive value of D-dimer level. RESULTS A total of 343 eligible patients were enrolled in the study. The optimum cutoff value of D-dimer to predict in-hospital mortality was 2.0 \u00B5g/ml with a sensitivity of 92.3% and a specificity of 83.3%. There were 67 patients with D-dimer\u22652.0 \u00B5g/ml, and 267 patients with D-dimer \u003C2.0 \u00B5g/ml on admission. 13 deaths occurred during hospitalization.

They are relatively safe to use in the upper airway and may reduce risk of SARS-CoV-2 aerosolization during upper airway mucosal surgery.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parhar, Harman S; Tasche, Kendall; Brody, Robert M; Weinstein, Gregory S; O\u0027Malley, Bert W; Shanti, Rabie M; Newman, Jason G","journal":"Head \u0026 neck","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.26200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32333619/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","risk of SARS","MERS-CoV","viral loads of coronaviruses","upper airway mucosal surgery","viral particles","coronaviruses responsible","querying topical preparations","PVP","risks of viral transmission","based preparations","effective virucidal activity","MEDLINE database review of articles","broad range of viruses","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","aerosolization","recent epidemics","PubMed","pandemic","METHODS","specific evidence","RESULTS Povidone-iodine","health care workers","CONCLUSIONS","solutions","COVID","objective"],"language":"en"},

A link between COVID-19 and multiorgan failure may be dependent on the fact that most COVID-19 patients are complicated by pneumonia, which is known to be associated with early changes of clotting and platelet activation and artery dysfunction; these changes may implicate in thrombotic-related events such as myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Recent data showed that myocardial injury compatible with coronary ischemia may be detectable in SARS-CoV-2 patients and laboratory data exploring clotting system suggest the presence of a hypercoagulation state. Thus, we performed a systematic review of COVID-19 literature reporting measures of clotting activation to assess if changes are detectable in this setting and their relationship with clinical severity. Furthermore, we discussed the biologic plausibility of the thrombotic risk in SARS-CoV-2 and the potential use of an antithrombotic treatment.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Violi, Francesco; Pastori, Daniele; Cangemi, Roberto; Pignatelli, Pasquale; Loffredo, Lorenzo","journal":"Thrombosis and haemostasis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1710317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32349133/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsxMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","early changes of clotting","clotting system","thrombotic risk","systematic review of COVID","high number of patients","literature reporting measures of clotting activation","platelet activation","myocardial infarction","laboratory data","antithrombotic treatment","Recent data","novel coronavirus","myocardial injury compatible","thrombotic-related events","elevated mortality risk","intensive care units treatment","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","mechanical ventilation","coronary ischemia","setting","presence","artery dysfunction","relationship","multiorgan failure","potential use","fact","ischemic stroke","biologic plausibility","clinical severity","hypercoagulation state","link","pneumonia"],"language":"en"},

METHODS We analyzed clinical characteristics of 18 severely or critically ill patients with COVID-19 undergoing tracheal intubation. The general demographic and clinical data of the patients including their age, gender, pre- intubation state of consciousness and the ventilation mode were recorded. The anesthesiologists performing the tracheal intubation procedure evaluated and recorded the tracheal intubation conditions of the patients. The changes in the vital signs of the patients before anesthesia induction and after intubation were recorded. RESULTS The average ages of these patients were 70.39\u00B18.02 years. Fifteen patients (83.33%) received non- invasive ventilation before tracheal intubation, and 13 patients (72.22%) were conscious before tracheal intubation. After induction of anesthesia, the blood pressure and heart rate of the patients decreased significantly (P \u003C 0.05). Most of the patients (94.44%) were in excellent or good conditions for tracheal intubation, and the first-attempt success rate of tracheal intubation was 100%. Five patients died within 3 weeks following the intubation. Tracheotomy was performed in one patient. Twelve patients were still on endotracheal mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit, and one of them received ECMO treatment due to poor oxygenation. A total of 16 experienced anesthesiologists participated in tracheal intubation, all with third-level protection during the operation, and no medical staff infection has been detected so far. CONCLUSIONS For patients with severe and critical COVID-19 and indications of tracheal intubation, we recommend early intubation with invasive respiratory support to improve the treatment efficacy and reduce the mortality. Anesthetic agents should be used carefully during tracheal intubation to ensure patients\u0027 safety. The medical staff should have a high-level protection during the intubation to maximally ensure their safety.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jiafang; Lu, Fan; Zhou, Mingxing; Qi, Zhong; Chen, Zhijun","journal":"Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.03.07; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376592/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsxMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ECMO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tracheal intubation conditions","tracheal intubation procedure","indications of tracheal intubation","early intubation","ill patients","attempt success rate of tracheal intubation","clinical characteristics of patients","pre- intubation state of consciousness","critical COVID","non- invasive ventilation","ventilation mode","anesthesia induction","induction of anesthesia","clinical data","endotracheal mechanical ventilation","medical staff infection","heart rate","treatment efficacy","ECMO treatment","experienced anesthesiologists","good conditions","high-level protection","patients\u0027 safety","invasive respiratory support","critical coronavirus disease","gender","blood pressure","operation","intensive care unit","vital signs","general demographic","poor oxygenation","CONCLUSIONS","changes","mortality","total","OBJECTIVE","METHODS","average ages","weeks","Anesthetic agents","Tracheotomy","years"],"language":"en"},

Design A prospective observational study where consecutive invasive procedures were studied over a period of 1 year and 8 months. The interventions were registered anonymously in an online database. Endpoints were success rate at first attempt, number of attempts, complications, level of supervision, and teamwork. Setting A 33-bedded mixed ICU. Subjects Advanced practice providers and medical residents. Interventions Registration of the performance of tracheal intubation, central venous and arterial access, tube thoracostomies, interhospital transportation, and electrical cardioversion. Measurement and Main Results A full-time advanced practice provider performed an average of 168 procedures and a medical resident an average of 68. The advanced practice provider inserted significant more radial, brachial, and femoral artery catheters (66% vs 74%, p = 0.17; 15% vs 12%, p = 0.14; 18% vs 14%, p = 0.14, respectively). The median number of attempts needed to successfully insert an arterial catheter was lower, and the success rate at first attempt was higher in the group treated by advanced practice providers (1.30 [interquartile range, 1-1.82] vs 1.53 [interquartile range, 1-2.27], p \u003C 0.0001; and 71% vs 54%, p \u003C 0.0001). The advanced practice providers inserted more central venous catheters (247 vs 177) with a lower median number of attempts (1.20 [interquartile range, 1-1.71] vs 1.33 [interquartile range, 1-1.86]) and a higher success rate at first attempt (81% vs 70%; p \u003C 0.005). The number of intubations by advanced practice providers was 143 and by medical residents was 115 with more supervision by the advanced practice provider (10% vs 0%; p = 0.01). Team performance, as reported by nursing staff, was higher during advanced practice provider procedures compared with medical resident procedures (median, 4.85 [interquartile range, 4.85-5] vs 4.73 [interquartile range, 4.22-5]). Other procedures were also more often performed by advanced practice providers. The complication rate in the advanced practice provider-treated patient group was lower than that in the medical resident group. Conclusions Advanced practice providers in critical care performed procedures safe and effectively when compared with medical residents.

In diatoms and green algae, plasma-membranes are moderately to highly permeable to CO2 but effectively impermeable to HCO3 - . Here, CO2 and HCO3 - membrane permeabilities were measured using an 18 O-exchange technique on two species of haptophyte algae, Emiliania huxleyi and Calcidiscus leptoporus, which showed that the plasma membranes of these species are also highly permeable to CO2 (0.006 to 0.02 cm \u00B7 s-1 ) but minimally permeable to HCO3 - . Increased temperature and CO2 generally increased CO2 membrane permeabilities in both species, possibly due to changes in lipid composition or CO2 channel proteins. Changes in CO2 membrane permeabilities showed no association with the density of calcium carbonate coccoliths surrounding the cell, which could potentially impede passage of compounds. Haptophyte plasma membrane permeabilities to CO2 were somewhat lower than those of diatoms but generally higher than membrane permeabilities of green algae. One caveat of these measurements is that the model used to interpret 18 O-exchange data assumes that carbonic anhydrase, which catalyzes 18 O-exchange, is homogeneously distributed in the cell. The implications of this assumption were tested by using a two-compartment model with an inhomogeneous distribution of carbonic anhydrase to simulate 18 O-exchange data and then inferring plasma-membrane CO2 permeabilities from the simulated data. This analysis showed that the inferred plasma-membrane CO2 permeabilities are minimal estimates but should be quite accurate under most conditions.","publish_time":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blanco-Ameijeiras, Sonia; Stoll, Heather M; Zhang, Hongrui; Hopkinson, Brian M","journal":"Journal of phycology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jpy.13017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418211/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjsyNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["increased CO2 membrane permeabilities","inferred plasma-membrane CO2 permeabilities","HCO3 - membrane permeabilities","function of CO2","Haptophyte plasma membrane permeabilities","membrane permeabilities of green algae","CO2 channel proteins","O-exchange data","plasma-membranes","plasma membranes","species of haptophyte algae","O-exchange technique","changes","simulated data","diatoms","cell","Increased temperature","inhomogeneous distribution of carbonic anhydrase","compartment model","Emiliania huxleyi","association","minimal estimates","Calcidiscus leptoporus","lipid composition","density of calcium carbonate coccoliths","mechanisms","inorganic carbon","photosynthesis","measurements","analysis","passage of compounds","implications","assumption","caveat","conditions"],"language":"en"},

Whereas this longstanding viewpoint has its genesis in the discovery of the original namesake prions as causative agents of several complex diseases, the underlying assumption of a strict disease basis for prions could not be further from the truth. Prions and the spectrum of functions they comprise, likely represent one of the largest paradigm shifts concerning molecular-encoded phenotypic diversity since identification of DNA as the principle molecule of heredity. The ability of prions to recruit similar proteins to alternate conformations may engender a reservoir of diversity supplementing the genetic diversity resulting from stochastic mutations of DNA and subsequent natural selection. Here we present several currently known prions and how many of their functions as well as modes of transmission are intricately linked to adaptation from an evolutionary perspective.

Haploidentical HSCT is an emerging modality with encouraging outcomes in several blood conditions. The present study aims to comprehensively assess the feasibility and safety of haploidentical HSCT in patients with severe and very severe AA. It is a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies related to haploidentical stem cell transplantation in idiopathic AA investigating rates of successful engraftment, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD), chronic GvHD (cGvHD), transplant-related mortality (TRM), and posttransplantation viral infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV]) in patients with AA. The effects of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) and nonmyeloablative conditioning (NMA), as well as various GvHD prophylaxis regimens on these outcomes were evaluated. In total 15 studies were identified, (577 patients, 58.9% males), successful engraftment was observed in 97.3% of patients (95% CI, 95.9-98.7) while grades II-IV aGvHD and cGvHD were reported in 26.6% and 25.0%, respectively. The pooled incidence of TRM was 6.7% per year (95% CI, 4.0-9.4). RIC regimens were associated with higher proportions of successful engraftment (97.7% vs 91.7%, P = 0.03) and aGvHD (29.5% vs 18.7%, P = 0.008) when compared with NMA regimens with no differences in cGvHD or mortality incidence. When compared with methotrexate-containing regimens and other regimens, posttransplant cyclophosphamide-containing regimens reduced the rates of aGvHD (28.6%, 27.8%, and 12.8%, respectively, P = 0.02), CMV viremia (55.7%, 38.6%, and 10.4%, respectively, P \u003C 0.001), and CMV disease in initially viremic patients (2.1%, 33.0%, and 0%, respectively, P \u003C 0.001).

Many hospitals have been overwhelmed by the large number of patients with COVID-19. Due to the shortage of equipment and personnel and the highly contagious nature of COVID-19, many other healthcare services are on hold. However, at Beijing Tiantan Hospital, a rapid response system has been in place so that routine care is not interrupted. We, therefore, would like to share our hospital-wide prevention and management policy during this pandemic to help other healthcare systems to function in this crisis. METHOD Tiantan hospital is one of the leading neuroscience institutions in the world. With 1650 beds, its annual inpatient admission exceeds 30 000 patients. Its COVID-19 rapid response policy was reviewed for its functionality. RESULTS There are nine key components of this policy: an incident management system; a comprehensive infection prevention and control, outpatient triage and flow system; a designated fever clinic; patient screening and administration; optimised surgical operations, enhanced nucleic acid testing; screening of returning employees; and a supervision and feedback system. In addition, a specific protocol was designed for treating patients with acute stroke. CONCLUSION A comprehensive policy is helpful to protect the employee from infection and to provide quality and uninterrupted care to all who need these, including patients with acute ischaemic stroke.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xiaoyan; Chen, Yu; Li, Zixiao; Wang, David; Wang, Yongjun","journal":"Stroke and vascular neurology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/svn-2020-000400; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32385131/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs0MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Beijing Tiantan Hospital"],"keyphrases":["flow system","management policy","comprehensive policy","rapid response system","feedback system","incident management system","rapid response policy","comprehensive infection prevention","hospital-wide prevention","pandemic","Beijing Tiantan Hospital","METHOD Tiantan hospital","large number of patients","contagious nature of COVID","healthcare systems","healthcare services","world","acute stroke","acute ischaemic stroke","patient screening","uninterrupted care","routine care","optimised surgical operations","administration","designated fever clinic","outpatient triage","control","nucleic acid testing","employees","place","personnel","annual inpatient admission","quality","leading neuroscience institutions","key components","beds","specific protocol","supervision","CONCLUSION","shortage of equipment","addition","RESULTS","hold","crisis","BACKGROUND","functionality","hospitals"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the impact of passive peritoneal drainage on achieving negative fluid balance and its ability to dispose of inflammatory cytokines. METHODS From September 2014 to November 2016, infants undergoing STAT category 3, 4, and 5 operations were randomized to receive or not receive intraoperative prophylactic peritoneal drain. We analyzed time to negative fluid balance and perioperative variables for each group. Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were measured from serum and peritoneal fluid in the passive peritoneal drainage group and serum in the control group postoperatively. RESULTS Infants were randomized to prophylactic passive peritoneal drain group (n = 13) and control (n = 12). The groups were not significantly different in pre- and postoperative peak lactate levels, postoperative length of stay, and mortality. Peritoneal drain patients reached time to negative fluid balance at a median of 1.42 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.00-2.91), whereas the control at 3.08 (IQR: 1.67-3.88; P = .043). Peritoneal drain patients had lower diuretic index at 72 hours, median of 2.86 (IQR: 1.21-4.94) versus 6.27 (IQR: 4.75-11.11; P = .006). Consistently, tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and interferon-\u03B3 were present at higher levels in peritoneal fluid than serum at 24 and 72 hours. However, serum cytokine levels in peritoneal drain and control group, at 24 and 72 hours postoperatively, did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS The prophylactic passive peritoneal drain patients reached negative fluid balance earlier and used less diuretic in early postoperative period. The serum cytokine levels did not differ significantly between groups at 24 and 72 hours postoperatively. However, there was no significant difference in mortality and postoperative length of stay.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pourmoghadam, Kamal K; Kubovec, Stacey; DeCampli, William M; Khallouq, Bertha Ben; Piggott, Kurt; Blanco, Carlos; Fakioglu, Harun; Kube, Alicia; Narasimhulu, Sukumar Suguna","journal":"World journal for pediatric \u0026 congenital heart surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2150135119888143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32093557/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs0NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["peritoneal fluid","prophylactic passive peritoneal drain group","passive peritoneal drainage group","prophylactic passive peritoneal drain patients","intraoperative prophylactic peritoneal drain","negative fluid balance","control group","impact of passive peritoneal drainage","IQR","hours","serum cytokine levels","postoperative length of stay","postoperative peak lactate levels","higher levels","risk of developing fluid overload","early postoperative period","median","mortality","time","BACKGROUND Infants","RESULTS Infants","groups","anti-inflammatory cytokines","lower diuretic index","inflammatory mediator release","interleukin","days","ability","CONCLUSIONS","tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","cardiopulmonary bypass","perioperative variables","interferon-\u03B3","interquartile range","significant difference","pilot study","STAT category","aim","operations","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

While novel vaccines and drugs that target SARS-CoV-2 are under development, this review provides information on therapeutics which are under clinical trials or are proposed to antagonize SARS-CoV-2. Based on the information gained from the responses to other RNA coronaviruses, including the strains that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronaviruses and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), drug repurposing might be a viable strategy. Since several antiviral therapies can inhibit viral replication cycles or relieve symptoms, mechanisms unique to RNA viruses will be important for the clinical development of antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.

They generate hypergraph languages from start hypergraphs via successive applications of context-sensitive fusion rules and multiplications of connected components, as well as a filtering mechanism to extract terminal hypergraphs from derived hypergraphs in a certain way. The application of a context-sensitive fusion rule consumes two complementarily labeled hyperedges and identifies corresponding attachment vertices provided that the context condition holds. In this paper, we show that the Post correspondence problem can be formulated very intuitively by such a grammar. Furthermore, we prove that these grammars can generate all recursively enumerable string languages (up to representation of strings as graphs) and are universal in this respect.","publish_time":"2020-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lye, Aaron","journal":"Language and Automata Theory and Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d695fd8696b44fdb691f603e9b4d46bb3d850af7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206639.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206639/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs1MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Context-sensitive fusion grammars","context-sensitive fusion rule","special case of context","successive applications of context","single positive context condition","negative context conditions","sensitive fusion rules","dependent fusion grammars","derived hypergraphs","terminal hypergraphs","hypergraph languages","finite sets of positive","enumerable string languages","multiplications of connected components","hyperedges","corresponding attachment vertices","representation of strings","filtering mechanism","certain way","Post correspondence problem","paper","respect"],"language":"en"},

The perception that there is paucity of evidence on the cost-effectiveness of public health programmes is seen as a barrier to policy change. The aim of this scoping review is to conduct a census of economic evaluations in primary prevention in order to identify and map the existing evidence. METHODS This review is an update of a prior census and will include full economic evaluations of primary prevention programmes conducted in a community-based setting that were published between 2014 and 2019. The search of electronic databases (MEDLINE and Embase, and NHS-EED for 2014) will be supplemented by a search for grey literature in OpenGrey and a search of the reference lists of reviews of economic evaluations identified in our searches. Retrieved citations will be imported into Covidence\u00AE and independently screened in a two-stage process by two reviewers (abstracts and full papers). Any disagreements on the eligibility of a citation will be resolved by discussion with a third reviewer. Included studies will then be categorised by one independent reviewer according to a four-part typology covering the type of health promotion intervention, the risk factor being tackled, the setting in which the intervention took place and the population most affected by the intervention. New to this version of the census, we will also document whether or not the intervention sets out specifically to address inequalities in health. DISCUSSION This review will produce an annotated bibliography of all economic evaluations plus a report summarising the current scope and content of the economic evidence (highlighting where it is plentiful and where it is lacking) and describing any changes in the type of economic evidence available for the various categories of disease prevention programmes since the last census. This will allow us to identify where future evaluative efforts should be focused to enhance the economic evidence base regarding primary prevention interventions.

In this country, a regular faculty development (FD) program aimed at training faculty in instructing (teaching and assessing) these CC had operated. However, leadership was not emphasized. In a new intervention module, the roles and associated responsibilities of clinical instructors to conduct, design, and lead CC-based education were emphasis. AIMS This follow-up explanatory case study compares the effectiveness of intervention module with that of the previous regular module. METHODS The regular group (n = 28) comprised clinical instructors who participated in the FD module during the 2013-2014 year while the intervention group (n = 28) was composed of 2015-2016 participants. Prior to the formal (hands-on) training, participants in the intervention group were asked to study the online materials of the regular module. These participants then received a 30-h hands-on training in conducting, designing, and leading skills. Finally, they prepared a 10-h reflective end-of-module presentation of their real-world practices. RESULTS Following the training, a higher degree improvement in participants self-reported familiarity with CC education, self-confidence in their ability to deliver CC education and sustained involve CC education were noted among the intervention FD group, compared with the regular FD group. In the intervention group, senior academicians (associate and full professor) are more substantially involved in designing and leading CC-based courses than junior academicians (lecturers and assistant professors). Among non-teaching award winners of in the intervention FD group, the follow-up degree of sustained involvement in delivering, designing and leading CC-based courses was significantly higher than that of the regular group. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated that leadership training in the intervention FD modules substantially motivated clinical instructors to become leaders in CC education.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Fa-Yauh; Yang, Ying-Ying; Huang, Chia-Chang; Huang, Ling-Ju; Chang, Ching-Chih; Liang, Jen-Feng; Huang, Shiau-Shian; Lee, Wei-Shin; Lu, Dai-Yin; Chuang, Chiao-Lin; Yang, Ling-Yu; Huang, Hui-Chun; Shulruf, Boaz; Chen, Chen-Huan; Kao, Shou-Yen","journal":"BMC medical education","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-020-02065-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32414406/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs4NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BACKGROUND The Accreditation Council","Graduate Medical Education","CC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["intervention group","CC education","intervention FD group","regular group","regular FD group","intervention FD modules","lead CC-based education","effectiveness of intervention module","new intervention module","leading CC-based courses","previous regular module","training faculty","module presentation","leadership training","Graduate Medical Education","regular faculty development","h hands-on training","junior academicians","associated responsibilities of clinical instructors","leading skills","participants self-reported familiarity","follow-up degree of sustained involvement","follow-up explanatory case study","higher degree improvement","junior medical trainees","senior academicians","h reflective end","non-teaching award winners","core competencies","ACGME","roles","program","primary care","general medicine","lecturers","self-confidence","Accreditation Council","design","ability","BACKGROUND","assistant professors","instructing","emphasis","year","online materials","real-world practices","country","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Scarce information is available in the literature about the migration of mycotoxins into the resulting beverage and/or the effects of the infusion procedure on the final mycotoxin contents. The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of the infusion process on mycotoxin contents during medicinal plant preparation. For this purpose, the contents of aflatoxins (AFs) [aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), aflatoxin B2 (AFB2), aflatoxin G1 (AFG1), aflatoxin G2 (AFG2)], zearalenone (ZEA), enniatins (ENNs) [enniatin B (ENNB), enniatin B1 (ENNB1), enniatin A (ENNA), enniatin A1 (ENNA1)] and beauvericin (BEA) were analyzed in 224 samples of medicinal plants and in their resulting beverages. The quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe extraction method (QuEChERS) was applied to the medicinal plants while the dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction procedure (DLLME) was applied to their infusions, and the mycotoxins were determined by liquid chromatography coupled to ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS-IT). The results revealed that ZEA, ENNB, ENNB1, AFB2, AFG1 and AFG2 were detected in the beverages with incidences of \u22646% and at concentrations from less than the limit of quantification (LOQ) to 82.2 \u03BCg/L. Mycotoxins reduction ranged from 74 to 100% after the infusion process.

Overall there is no consistent conclusion about whether intramedullary nailing alone, or intramedullary nails augmented with poller screws is more advantageous.We conducted a systematic review of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. Seventy-five records were identified, of which 13 met our inclusion criteria. In a systematic review we asked: (1) What is the proportion of nonunions with poller screw usage? (2) What is the proportion of malalignment, infection and secondary surgical procedures with poller screw usage? The overall outcome proportion across the studies was computed using the inverse variance method for pooling.Thirteen studies with a total of 371 participants and 376 fractures were included. Mean follow-up time was 21.1 months. Mean age of included patients was 40.0 years. Seven studies had heterogenous populations of nonunions and acute fractures. Four studies included only acute fractures and two studies examined nonunions only.The results of the present systematic review show a low complication rate of IM nailing augmented with poller screws in terms of nonunion (4%, CI: 0.03-0.07), coronal plane malunion (5%, CI: 0.03-0.08), deep (5%, CI: 0.03-0.11) and superficial (6%, CI: 0.03-0.11) infections, and secondary procedures (8%, CI: 0.04-0.18).When compared with the existing literature our review suggests intramedullary nailing with poller screws has lower rates of nonunion and coronal malalignment when compared with nailing alone.

These changes have occurred in parallel with systemic and structural changes in health care and higher education, both of which have experienced challenges with improving access and controlling costs, and have become a centerpiece of legislative and political discourse. At the same time, advances in technology have introduced new possibilities in education, with the emergence of online, blended, and \u0022flipped\u0022 learning models that supplement or replace face-to-face instruction with distance learning.

To date, there are no medical treatments for COVID-19 with proven effectiveness. Novel treatments and/or vaccines will take time to be developed and distributed to patients. In light of this, there has been growing interest in the use of existing medications, such as chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), as potential treatments of this disease. AIM To establish the current evidence for the effectiveness of CQ and HCQ in treating COVID-19. DESIGN \u0026 SETTING A rapid review of the literature was conducted. METHOD Electronic searches in PubMed and Google Scholar were conducted on 21 March 2020. A further search was conducted in Google for relevant literature on 28 March 2020. RESULTS There is limited evidence of in vitro activity of CQ/HCQ against SARS-CoV-2. A number of in vivo clinical trials are underway. The empirical data available from two of these trials reveal conflicting results. Both trials are characterised by small numbers of participants (n = 30 and n = 36) and suffer methodological limitations. No medium or long-term follow-up data is available. CONCLUSION At present, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether CQ/HCQ are safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.

Social network analysis was used to analyze the key organizations and their connections in crucial response tasks. RESULTS Three national health authorities (Central MERS Management Headquarters [CMMH], Korea Centers for Disease Control [KCDC], Ministry of Health and Welfare [MOHW]) led the response. CMMH, which did not appear in the government\u0027s response plans, played a significant role in all 3 networks. KCDC also was involved in all 3 networks, but was most prominent in the laboratory testing network. MOHW appeared only in the patient management network. Each health authority coordinated and collaborated with distinctive types of organizations in the networks, but unclear lines of responsibilities also were found.

Neurologists must weigh up the need to start or continue disease-modifying treatments against the risk of infection, the risk of complications from the infection, and the risk of multiple sclerosis activity. Since this is an unprecedented situation, most decisions are being made on the basis of a theoretical approach and the criteria of each neurologist. AIMS The aim of this study is conduct a literature search to collect available evidence on the relationship between disease-modifying therapies in multiple sclerosis and SARS-CoV-2 infection. This evidence, together with the experience of the authors in the management of patients with multiple sclerosis during the pandemic, will make it possible to offer some proposals for the treatment and follow-up of patients in this epidemiological context. DEVELOPMENT After the literature search and our experience in the management of patients, a number of proposals for treatment are established for each drug, which must necessarily be individualised for each patient, since, in these exceptional circumstances, their peculiarities can affect the prognosis.

Anticipating an unsustainable burden on the health service, the UK government introduced numerous legislative measures culminating in the Coronavirus Act, which interfere with existing legislation and rights. However, the existing standards and legal frameworks relevant to critical care clinicians are not extinguished but anticipated to adapt to a new context. This new context influences the standard of care that can be reasonably provided and yields numerous human rights considerations, for example in the use of restraints or the restrictions placed upon patients and visitors under the Infection Prevention and Control guidance. The changing landscape, has also highlighted previously unrecognised legal dilemmas. The perceived difficulties in the provision of PPE for employees pose a legal risk for trusts and a regulatory risk for clinicians. The spectre of rationing critical care poses a number of legal issues. Notably, the flux between clinical decisions based on best interests towards decisions explicitly based on resource considerations should be underpinned by an authoritative public policy decision to preserve legitimacy and lawfulness. Such a policy should be medically coherent, legally robust and ethically justified. The current crisis yields numerous challenges for clinicians aspiring to remain faithful to medico-legal and human rights principles developed over many decades, especially when such considerations could easily be dismissed. However, it is exactly at such times that these principles are needed the most and clinicians play a disproportionate role in safeguarding such principles for the most vulnerable.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coghlan, N; Archard, D; Sipanoun, P; Hayes, T; Baharlo, B","journal":"Anaesthesia","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.15147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32445581/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs5NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","PPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["critical care clinicians","legal risk","medico-legal","provision of critical care","numerous human rights considerations","human rights principles","standard of care","legal frameworks relevant","number of legal issues","unrecognised legal dilemmas","spectre of rationing critical care","numerous challenges","resource considerations","new context","numerous legislative measures","regulatory risk","clinical decisions","provision of PPE","existing standards","existing legislation","authoritative public policy decision","UK government","example","trusts","health service","Infection Prevention","visitors","patients","legitimacy","Coronavirus Act","best interests","employees","unprecedented challenge","restrictions","use of restraints","current crisis","decades","Control guidance","pandemic","unsustainable burden","lawfulness","perceived difficulties","flux","disproportionate role","changing landscape","COVID","times"],"language":"en"},

Given that the virus is transmitted via droplets, open airway procedures such as bronchoscopy pose a significant risk to health care workers (HCW). The goal of this guideline was to examine the current evidence on the role of bronchoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the optimal protection of patients and HCW. METHODS A group of approved panelists developed key clinical questions by using the PICO (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome) format that addressed specific topics on bronchoscopy related to COVID-19 infection and transmission. MEDLINE (via PubMed) was systematically searched for relevant literature and references were screened for inclusion. Validated evaluation tools were used to assess the quality of studies and to grade the level of evidence to support each recommendation. When evidence did not exist, suggestions were developed based on consensus using the modified Delphi process RESULTS: The systematic review and critical analysis of the literature based on six PICO questions resulted in six statements: one evidence-based graded recommendation and 5 ungraded consensus-based statements. CONCLUSIONS The evidence on the role of bronchoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic is sparse. To maximize protection of patients and HCW, bronchoscopy should be used sparingly in the evaluation and management of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infections. In an area where community transmission of COVID-19 infection is present, bronchoscopy should be deferred for non-urgent indications and, if necessary to perform, HCW should wear personal protective equipment while performing the procedure even on asymptomatic patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wahidi, Momen M; Shojaee, Samira; Lamb, Carla R; Ost, David; Maldonado, Fabien; Eapen, George; Caroff, Daniel A; Stevens, Michael P; Ouellette, Daniel R; Lilly, Craig; Gardner, Donna D; Glisinski, Kristen; Pennington, Kelly; Alalawi, Raed","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.04.036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32361152/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs0OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCW"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of bronchoscopy","HCW","confirmed COVID","community transmission of COVID","current evidence","level of evidence","management of patients","asymptomatic patients","optimal protection of patients","ungraded consensus-based statements","PICO questions","pandemic","significant risk","significant morbidity","graded recommendation","relevant literature","key clinical questions","Validated evaluation tools","systematic review","modified Delphi process RESULTS","group of approved panelists","health care workers","outcome","comparator","format","specific topics","open airway procedures","critical analysis","droplets","intervention","personal protective equipment","population","non-urgent indications","METHODS","references","guideline","BACKGROUND","coronavirus disease","infections","area","PubMed","quality of studies","inclusion","globe","mortality","suggestions","CONCLUSIONS","MEDLINE","goal"],"language":"en"},

Subsequently, there has been an increase in infections attributable to this virus throughout China and worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially named the infection coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus has been classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This appears to be a virus from Rhinolophus bats, but the intermediate host has not yet been identified. The mechanism of infection of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known; it appears to have affinity for cells located in the lower airways, where it replicates. The interhuman transmission of coronaviruses mainly occurs through saliva droplets and direct and indirect contact via surfaces. As of March 10, 2020, the number of cases worldwide was 113,702. Along with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 appears to cause a severe clinical picture in humans, ranging from mild malaise to death by sepsis/acute respiratory distress syndrome. The prognosis is worse in elderly patients with comorbidities. To date, there is no specific therapy for COVID-19. Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection implies strategies that limit the spread of the virus. WHO and other international and national bodies have developed continuously updated strategic objectives and provisions to contain the spread of the virus and infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gabutti, Giovanni; d\u0027Anchera, Erica; Sandri, Federica; Savio, Marta; Stefanati, Armando","journal":"Infectious diseases and therapy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40121-020-00295-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32270371/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs0OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["China","Middle Eastern"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","acute respiratory distress syndrome","COVID","infection coronavirus disease","Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome","Prevention of SARS","mechanism of infection","new coronavirus","spread","China","severe clinical picture","number of cases","cases of viral pneumonia","sepsis","death","saliva droplets","indirect contact","mild malaise","humans","MERS","elderly patients","strategic objectives","Rhinolophus bats","province of Hubei","infections attributable","national bodies","cells","interhuman transmission of coronaviruses","prognosis","comorbidities","intermediate host","surfaces","provisions","specific therapy","increase","strategies","lower airways","World Health Organization","affinity","date"],"language":"en"},

However, risk and clinical outcome stratification remain a great challenge. We aimed to find the potential biomarker to predict the effect of neoadjuvant CCRT on rectal cancer. METHODS We identified epiregulin (EREG) as the most significant predictive marker for neoadjuvant CCRT response from the published rectal cancer transcriptome data set GSE35452. We collected 172 biopsy specimens from rectal cancer patients who received neoadjuvant CCRT followed by radical proctectomy, performed EREG immunohistochemistry, and analyzed the H-scores. We further examined the correlations between the expression level of EREG and clinicopathological features, tumor regression grade, and survival, including disease-specific survival (DSS), locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS), and metastasis-free survival (MeFS). RESULTS High EREG expression was significantly related to early pretreatment (pre-Tx) and posttreatment (post-Tx) tumor status (T1, T2, p = 0.047 and p \u003C 0.001), pre-Tx and post-Tx negative nodal status (N0, p \u003C 0.001 and p = 0.004), less vascular and perineurial invasion (p = 0.015 and p = 0.023), and higher tumor regression grade (p \u003C 0.001). In the survival analysis, high EREG expression was significantly associated with better DSS (p \u003C 0.0001), LRFS (p = 0.0004), and MeFS (p \u003C 0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, high EREG expression remained prognostically significant for better DSS (p = 0.003; hazard ratio: 5.599). CONCLUSION These data suggest that EREG is a potential predictive marker and therapeutic target in rectal cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant CCRT.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Cheng-Yi; Hsieh, Pei-Ling; Chou, Chia-Lin; Yang, Ching-Chieh; Lee, Sung-Wei; Tian, Yu-Feng; Shiue, Yow-Ling; Li, Wan-Shan","journal":"Oncology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000506991; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408308/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs3NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CCRT","EREG","DSS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rectal cancer patients","expression level of EREG","EREG immunohistochemistry","RESULTS High EREG expression","neoadjuvant CCRT response","effect of neoadjuvant CCRT","survival analysis","pre-Tx","metastasis-free survival","disease-specific survival","tumor status","better DSS","neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy","published rectal cancer transcriptome data set GSE35452","locoregional recurrence-free survival","post-Tx negative nodal status","significant predictive marker","potential predictive marker","great proportion of patients","higher tumor regression grade","LRFS","MeFS","great challenge","advanced disease","multivariate analysis","potential biomarker","therapeutic target","clinicopathological features","posttreatment","N0","T1","clinical outcome stratification","early pretreatment","radical proctectomy","T2","downstaging","biopsy specimens","perineurial invasion","risk","correlations","hazard ratio","BACKGROUND","H-scores","surgery","METHODS","epiregulin","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

RT-PCR detects RNA, not infectious virus, thus its ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited. Infectivity is a critical determinant in informing public health guidelines/interventions. Our goal was to determine the relationship between E gene SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values from respiratory samples, symptom onset to test (STT) and infectivity in cell culture. METHODS In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we took SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed positive samples and determined their ability to infect Vero cell lines. RESULTS Ninety RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 positive samples were incubated on Vero cells. Twenty-six samples (28.9%) demonstrated viral growth. Median TCID50/ml was 1780 (282-8511). There was no growth in samples with a Ct \u003E 24 or STT \u003E 8 days. Multivariate logistic regression using positive viral culture as a binary predictor variable, STT and Ct demonstrated an odds ratio for positive viral culture of 0.64 (95% CI 0.49-0.84, p\u003C0.001) for every one unit increase in Ct. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for Ct vs. positive culture was OR 0.91 (95% CI 0.85-0.97, p\u003C0.001), with 97% specificity obtained at a Ct of \u003E24. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 Vero cell infectivity was only observed for RT-PCR Ct \u003C 24 and STT \u003C 8 days. Infectivity of patients with Ct \u003E24 and duration of symptoms \u003E8 days may be low. This information can inform public health policy and guide clinical, infection control and occupational health decisions. Further studies of larger size are needed.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bullard, Jared; Dust, Kerry; Funk, Duane; Strong, James E; Alexander, David; Garnett, Lauren; Boodman, Carl; Bello, Alexander; Hedley, Adam; Schiffman, Zachary; Doan, Kaylie; Bastien, Nathalie; Li, Yan; Van Caeseele, Paul G; Poliquin, Guillaume","journal":"Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa638; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32442256/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs3NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["STT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RT-PCR Ct","RT-PCR SARS-CoV","positive samples","positive culture","positive viral culture","BACKGROUND RT-PCR","STT","CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV","Vero cell infectivity","RT-PCR cycle threshold","cell culture","duration of infectivity","Infectivity of patients","E gene SARS-CoV","respiratory samples","viral growth","days","viral diseases","Vero cell lines","public health policy","public health guidelines","ability","Vero cells","occupational health decisions","duration of symptoms","values","infection control","binary predictor variable","characteristic curve","odds ratio","Area","receiver","symptom onset","relationship","critical determinant","Multivariate logistic regression","primary method","retrospective cross-sectional study","infectious virus","RNA","METHODS","interventions","information","RESULTS","unit increase","studies of larger size","Median TCID50","goal","specificity"],"language":"en"},

Aerosol drug delivery to the lungs is expected to be an interesting route of administration. However, due to the alterations of lung compliance caused by fibrosis, local delivery remains challenging. This work aimed to develop a practical, relevant and ethically less restricted ex vivo respiratory model of fibrotic lung for regional aerosol deposition studies. This model is composed of an Ear-Nose-Throat replica connected to a sealed enclosure containing an ex vivo porcine respiratory tract, which was modified to mimic the mechanical properties of fibrotic lung parenchyma - i.e. reduced compliance. Passive respiratory mechanics were measured. 81mKr scintigraphies were used to assess the homogeneity of gas-ventilation, while regional aerosol deposition was assessed with 99mTc-DTPA scintigraphies. We validated the procedure to induce modifications of lung parenchyma to obtain aimed variation of compliance. Compared to the healthy model, lung respiratory mechanics were modified to the same extent as IPF-suffering patients. 81mKr gas-ventilation and 99mTc-DTPA regional aerosol deposition showed results comparable to clinical studies, qualitatively. This ex vivo respiratory model could simulate lung fibrosis for aerosol regional deposition studies giving an interesting alternative to animal experiments, accelerating and facilitating preclinical studies before clinical trials.","publish_time":"2019-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Montigaud, Yoann; P\u00E9rinel-Ragey, Sophie; Plantier, Laurent; Leclerc, Lara; Goy, Cl\u00E9mence; Clotagatide, Anthony; Pr\u00E9v\u00F4t, Nathalie; Pourchez, J\u00E9r\u00E9mie","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-54479-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31784683/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs3NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung fibrosis","lung respiratory mechanics","regional aerosol deposition studies","aerosol regional deposition studies","respiratory model of fibrotic lung","mTc-DTPA regional aerosol deposition","alterations of lung compliance","modifications of lung parenchyma","Aerosol drug delivery","Passive respiratory mechanics","preclinical studies","healthy model","mechanical properties of fibrotic lung parenchyma","porcine respiratory tract","restricted ex","reduced compliance","mTc-DTPA scintigraphies","aimed variation of compliance","mKr gas-ventilation","mKr scintigraphies","Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis","interesting alternative","local delivery","clinical trials","homogeneity of gas","interesting route of administration","progressive disease","results comparable","sealed enclosure","Throat replica","animal experiments","unsatisfactory systemic treatments","extent","lungs","Ear-Nose","IPF-suffering patients","procedure","work"],"language":"en"},

The outbreak was traced to a seafood wholesale market and human to human transmission was confirmed. The rapid spread and the death toll of the new epidemic warrants immediate intervention. The intra-host genomic variability of SARS-CoV-2 plays a pivotal role in the development of effective antiviral agents and vaccines, but also in the design of accurate diagnostics. We analyzed NGS data derived from clinical samples of three Chinese patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, in order to identify small- and large-scale intra-host variations in the viral genome. We identified tens of low- or higher-frequency single nucleotide variations (SNVs) with variable density across the viral genome, affecting 7 out of 10 protein-coding viral genes. The majority of these SNVs corresponded to missense changes. The annotation of the identified SNVs but also of all currently circulating strain variations revealed colocalization of intra-host but also strain specific SNVs with primers and probes currently used in molecular diagnostics assays. Moreover, we de-novo assembled the viral genome, in order to isolate and validate intra-host structural variations and recombination breakpoints. The bioinformatics analysis disclosed genomic rearrangements over poly-A / poly-U regions located in ORF1ab and spike (S) gene, including a potential recombination hot-spot within S gene. Our results highlight the intra-host genomic diversity and plasticity of SARS-CoV-2, pointing out genomic regions that are prone to alterations. The isolated SNVs and genomic rearrangements, reflect the intra-patient capacity of the polymorphic quasispecies, which may arise rapidly during the outbreak, allowing immunological escape of the virus, offering resistance to anti-viral drugs and affecting the sensitivity of the molecular diagnostics assays.","publish_time":"2020-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karamitros, Timokratis; Papadopoulou, Gethsimani; Bousali, Maria; Mexias, Anastasios; Tsiodras, Sotiris; Mentis, Andreas","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3810476ef5ed580768a64183b27b21da7c474bc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.27.009480","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs1MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NGS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["intra-host genomic diversity","intra-host genomic variability of SARS","large-scale intra-host variations","intra-host structural variations","colocalization of intra-host","SARS-CoV","viral genome","genomic rearrangements","genomic regions","identified SNVs","strain variations","specific SNVs","isolated SNVs","intra-patient capacity","plasticity of SARS","anti-viral drugs","molecular diagnostics assays","S gene","protein-coding viral genes","order","poly-U regions","outbreak of atypical pneumonia","design of accurate diagnostics","higher-frequency single nucleotide variations","recombination breakpoints","human transmission","Coronavirus disease","novel coronavirus","potential recombination hot-spot","death toll","ORF1ab","sensitivity","probes","new epidemic warrants immediate intervention","development of effective antiviral agents","seafood wholesale market","variable density","clinical samples","vaccines","resistance","spike","Chinese patients","pivotal role","Wuhan city","Hubei province","China","polymorphic quasispecies","primers","bioinformatics analysis","results","immunological escape","NGS data","rapid spread","tens of low","COVID","alterations","de-novo","missense changes","majority","annotation"],"language":"en"},

Mass migration prior to the Chinese New Year may have accelerated the spread of COVID-19 across China. This analysis investigated the temporal relationship between daily outbound traffic from Wuhan and the incidence of COVID-19 in 31 Chinese provinces during January-February 2020. Methods: We collected incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases from National and Provincial Health Committee reports from January 10 to February 29, 2020. Volume of outbound traffic from Wuhan to other provinces was measured by Baidu Migration Index, a widely used metric that tracks migration based on cellphone location. We used cross-correlation function and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to examine time-lagged association between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence by province. Contributors to the provincial variation in the temporal associations were investigated. Additionally, we estimated the reduction in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases following the travel ban for Wuhan. Results: Cross-correlation function analyses suggested that the volume of outbound traffic from Wuhan was positively associated with COVID-19 incidence in all provinces, with correlation coefficients between 0.22-0.78 (all P\u003C0.05). Approximately 42% of provinces showed \u003C1 week of lag between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence, 39% with 1 week, and 19% with 2-3 weeks. Migration had more prolonged impacts in provinces closer to Wuhan and with more passenger influx from Wuhan, but affected economically advantaged provinces to a lesser extent. We further estimated that the travel ban may have prevented approximately 19,768 COVID-19 cases (95% CI: 13,589, 25,946) outside of Wuhan by February 29, 2020. Conclusions: Outflowing migration from Wuhan facilitated the COVID-19 transmission to other parts of China with varying time-lagged effects dependent on provincial characteristics. The travel ban led to a significant reduction in COVID-19 outside of Wuhan.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Zaixing; Fang, Ya","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e8a0e8f3e8ea28a1a106b657491daff625e95dab.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.15.20034199","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs1MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Provincial Health Committee"],"locations":["China","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["incidence of confirmed COVID","spread of COVID","cumulative incidence of COVID","city of Wuhan","traffic volume","Chinese provinces","Volume of outbound traffic","provinces closer","advantaged provinces","cases","daily outbound traffic","Mass migration","Outflowing migration","travel ban","Baidu Migration Index","Cross-correlation function analyses","provincial variation","provincial characteristics","correlation coefficients","time-lagged association","central Chinese hub","Chinese New Year","Provincial Health Committee reports","temporal relationship","parts of China","temporal associations","significant reduction","week of lag","varying time-lagged effects dependent","autoregressive integrated moving average","model","ARIMA","outbreak","prolonged impacts","transportation","industry","epicenter","Results","metric","transmission","coronavirus disease","passenger influx","analysis","lesser extent","Conclusions","cellphone location","Contributors","Methods","Background","weeks"],"language":"en"},

To predict the inflection points, i.e., inflection time (Tmax) \u0026 maximal infection number (Imax) of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), we adopted a trial and error strategy and explored a series of approaches from simple logistic modeling (that has an asymptomatic line) to sophisticated tipping point detection techniques for detecting phase transitions but failed to obtain satisfactory results. Method: Inspired by its success in diversity-time relationship (DTR), we apply the PLEC (power law with exponential cutoff) model for detecting the inflection points of COVID-19 outbreaks. The model was previously used to extend the classic species-time relationship (STR) for general DTR (Ma 2018), and it has two secondary parameters (computed from its 3 parameters including power law scaling parameter w, taper-off parameter d to overwhelm virtually exponential growth ultimately, and a parameter c related to initial infections): one that was originally used for estimating the potential or dark biodiversity is proposed to estimate the maximal infection number (Imax) and another is proposed to determine the corresponding inflection time point (Tmax). Results: We successfully estimated the inflection points [Imax, Tmax] for most provinces (\u2248 85%) in China with error rates \u003C5% in both Imax and Tmax. We also discussed the constraints and limitations of the proposed approach, including (i) sensitive to disruptive jumps, (ii) requiring sufficiently long datasets, and (iii) limited to unimodal outbreaks.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Zhanshan (Sam)","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a254698232742bed1123f469809485741756fe7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043893","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs1MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["inflection points of COVID","Imax","Tmax","corresponding inflection time point","diversity-time relationship","maximal infection number","parameter d","parameter c","classic species-time relationship","exponential cutoff","exponential growth","infection growths","unimodal outbreaks","proposed approach","power law scaling parameter w","general DTR","hallmarks of infectious disease outbreaks","error strategy","secondary parameters","error rates","satisfactory results","sophisticated tipping point detection techniques","taper","asymptomatic line","phase transitions","series of approaches","simple logistic modeling","PLEC","coronaviruses","success","novel coronavirus","sensitive","constraints","limitations","initial infections","Background","peaks","dark biodiversity","disruptive jumps","potential","China","trial","provinces","long datasets","Method"],"language":"en"},

In this way, we provide estimates of the infection risks, and likely loss of life, that arise from current incarceration practices. We provide estimates for in-custody deaths and show how the within-jail dynamics lead to spill-over risks, not only affecting the incarcerated people, but increasing the exposure, infection, and death rates for both corrections officers with whom they interact within the jail system, and the broader community beyond the justice system. We show that, given a typical jail-community dynamic, operating in a business as usual way will result in significant and rapid loss of life.

However, given that poor mental health is common in staff working in acute medicine, we aimed to estimate the additional burden of working directly with infected patients during epidemic and pandemic health emergencies. We completed a rapid review of the evidence and identified 74 relevant studies from outbreaks of COVID-19, Ebola, H1N1 influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Due to varying caseness criteria, a meta-analysis of prevalence was not possible. However, it was clear that levels of self-reported depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related symptoms were high, and somewhat higher in clinical staff working in high exposure roles. To assess the impact of high- versus low-exposure healthcare work more formally, we estimated the standardised mean difference (SMD) of scale means using a random effects meta-analysis. High exposure work was associated with only a small additional burden of acute mental health problems compared to low exposure work (anxiety: SMD=0.22, 95% CI 0.06 - 0.38; PTSD symptoms: SMD=0.21, 95% CI 0.01 - 0.4; depression: SMD=0.20, -0.07 - 0.47). This effect was potentially inflated by publication bias and there was a moderate risk of bias in the studies in the meta-analysis. A narrative review of candidate risk factors identified being a nurse, seeing colleagues infected, experiencing quarantine, non-voluntary role assignment, and experiencing stigma, as associated with particularly poor mental health outcomes. Protective factors included team and institutional support, use and faith in infection prevention measures, and a sense of professional duty and altruistic acceptance of risk. Notably, formal psychological support services were valued by frontline staff, although those with the highest burden of mental health difficulties were the least likely to request or receive support.","publish_time":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bell, V.; Wade, D.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/68731d531710ebaeef5e5000b59d35406225b7f9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.28.20082669v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs1NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["SMD","High exposure work","potential mental health impact","poor mental health outcomes","highest burden of mental health difficulties","small additional burden of acute mental health problems","pandemic health emergencies","frontline staff","low exposure work","impact of high","high exposure roles","frontline clinical staff","low-exposure healthcare work","meta-analysis of prevalence","anxiety","severe acute respiratory syndrome","PTSD symptoms","acute medicine","moderate risk of bias","institutional support","random effects meta-analysis","narrative review of candidate risk factors","altruistic acceptance of risk","global pandemic of SARS","Middle East respiratory syndrome","related symptoms","Protective factors","relevant studies","outbreaks of COVID","formal psychological support services","infected patients","publication bias","rapid review","levels of self-reported depression","posttraumatic stress disorder","MERS","H1N1 influenza","sense of professional duty","Ebola","scale","quarantine","non-voluntary role assignment","faith","concerns","infection prevention measures","varying caseness criteria","stigma","evidence","nurse","team","standardised mean difference","colleagues"],"language":"en"},

Patients who died from Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) often had comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive lung disease. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a crucial factor that facilitates SARS-CoV2 to bind and enter host cells. To date, no study has assessed the ACE2 expression in the lungs of patients with these diseases. Here, we analyzed over 700 lung transcriptome samples of patients with comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 and found that ACE2 was highly expressed in these patients, compared to control individuals. This finding suggests that patients with such comorbidities may have higher chances of developing severe COVID-19. We also found other genes, such as RAB1A, that can be important for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung. Correlation and network analyses revealed many potential regulators of ACE2 in the human lung, including genes related to histone modifications, such as HAT1, HDAC2, and KDM5B. In fact, epigenetic marks found in ACE2 locus were compatible to with those promoted by KDM5B.

This is particularly so when a large share of asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic patients escape testing, or when overwhelmed healthcare systems are forced to limit testing further to severe cases only. By leveraging data on COVID-19, we propose a novel way to estimate a disease\u0027s infected fatality rate, the true lethality of the disease, in the presence of sparse and partial information. We show that this is feasible when the disease has turned into a pandemic and data comes from a large number of countries, or regions within countries, as long as testing strategies vary sufficiently. For Italy, our method estimates an IFR of 1.1% (95% CI: 0.2% - 2.1%), which is strongly in line with other methods. At the global level, our method estimates an IFR of 1.6% (95% CI: 1.1% - 2.1%).

Most guidelines rely on Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores to maximize lives saved, but states have adopted different stances on whether to maximize long-term outcomes (life-years saved) by accounting for patient comorbidities. Methods: We compared 4 representative state guidelines with varying approaches to comorbidities and analyzed how CSC prioritization correlates with clinical outcomes. We included 27 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUs at Brigham and Women\u0027s Hospital from March 12 to April 3, 2020. We compared prioritization algorithms from New York, which assigns priority based on SOFA alone; Maryland, which uses SOFA plus severe comorbidities; Pennsylvania, which uses SOFA plus major and severe comorbidities; and Colorado, which uses SOFA plus a modified Charlson comorbidity index. Results: In pairwise comparisons across all possible pairs, we found that state guidelines frequently resulted in tie-breakers based on age or lottery: New York 100% of the time (100% resolved by lottery), Pennsylvania 86% of the time (18% by lottery), Maryland 93% of the time (35% by lottery), and Colorado: 32% of the time (10% by lottery). The prioritization algorithm with the strongest correlation with 14-day outcomes was Colorado (rs = -0.483. p = 0.011) followed by Maryland (rs = -0.394, p =0.042), Pennsylvania (rs = -0.382, p = 0.049), and New York (rs = 0). An alternative model using raw SOFA scores alone was moderately correlated with outcomes (rs = -0.448, p = 0.019). Conclusions: State guidelines for scarce resource allocation frequently resulted in identical priority scores, requiring tie-breakers based on age or lottery. These findings suggest that state CSC guidelines should be further assessed empirically to understand whether they meet their goals.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jezmir, J.

As of April 20, there have been more than 2.4 million confirmed cases with over 160,000 deaths. Extreme case surges coupled with challenges in forecasting the clinical course of affected patients have necessitated thoughtful resource allocation and early identification of high-risk patients. However, effective methods for achieving this are lacking. In this paper, we present a decision tree-based machine learning model trained on electronic health records from patients with confirmed COVID-19 at a single center within the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. We then externally validate our model by predicting the likelihood of critical event or death within various time intervals for patients after hospitalization at four other hospitals and achieve strong performance, notably predicting mortality at 1 week with an AUC-ROC of 0.84. Finally, we establish model interpretability by calculating SHAP scores to identify decisive features, including age, inflammatory markers (procalcitonin and LDH), and coagulation parameters (PT, PTT, D-Dimer). To our knowledge, this is one of the first models with external validation to both predict outcomes in COVID-19 patients with strong validation performance and identification of key contributors in outcome prediction that may assist clinicians in making effective patient management decisions.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vaid, A.; Somani, S.; Russak, A.

Using RNA seq datasets of virus infected lung cell lines A549 (infected with either SARS-CoV-2 or Influenza A virus (IAV)) and Calu3 (infected with either SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV), we present a detailed analysis of genes expression changes in response to each of these viral infections. Upregulation of the antiviral interferon signaling was observed with all three viral infections. However, upregulation of the cytokine/inflammatory processes, downregulation of mitochondrial organization and respiration processes, and perturbation in the autophagic processes were specifically observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, which were absent in IAV infected cells. Upregulation of the inflammatory processes was concordant with the gene expression signature of COVID-19 lungs and with inflammatory symptoms observed in severe cases of COVID-19 patients. Coexpression networks analysis also facilitated the identification of protein-protein interaction (PPI) subnetworks of genes in the inflammation and mitochondrial processes that were either coordinately up or downregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, respectively. Comparing the expression of marker genes of lung cell types from single cell RNA seq data with expression profile of A549 cells revealed that they likely represent the lung epithelial lineage cells.

Methods: The data was obtained between January 22 and April 21, 2020 from China records. The number of total cases and the number of total deaths were used for the calculations. For modelling Weibull, Negative Exponential, Von Bertalanffy, Janoscheck, Lundqvist-Korf and Sloboda models were used and AR, MA, ARMA, Holt, Brown and Damped models were used for time series. The determination coefficient (R2), Pseudo R2 and mean square error were used for nonlinear modelling as criteria for determining the model that best describes the number of cases, the number of total deaths and BIC (Bayesian Information Criteria) was used for time series. Results: According to our results, the Sloboda model among the growth curves and ARIMA (0,2,1) model among the times series models were most suitable models for modelling of the number of total cases. In addition Lundqvist-Korf model among the growth curves and Holt linear trend exponential smoothing model among the times series models were most suitable model for modelling of the number of total deaths. Our time series models forecast that the number of total cases will 83311 on 5 May and the number of total deaths will be 5273.

In this study, we focus on type I interferon (IFN) signaling in human epithelial cells and combine microfluidics, time-lapse microscopy, and computational modeling to investigate how the IFN-responsive regulatory network operates in single cells to process repetitive IFN stimulation. We found that IFN-\u03B1 pretreatments lead to opposite effects, priming versus desensitization, depending on the input durations. These effects are governed by a regulatory network composed of a fast-acting positive feedback loop and a delayed negative feedback loop, mediated by upregulation of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 (USP18). We further revealed that USP18 upregulation can only be initiated at the G1 and early S phases of cell cycle upon the treatment onset, resulting in heterogeneous and delayed induction kinetics in single cells. This cell cycle gating provides a temporal compartmentalization of feedback control processes, enabling duration-dependent desensitization to repetitive stimulations. Moreover, our results, highlighting the importance of IFN dynamics, may suggest time-based strategies for enhancing the effectiveness of IFN pretreatment in clinical applications against viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mudla, Anusorn; Jiang, Yanfei; Arimoto, Kei-ichiro; Xu, Bingxian; Rajesh, Adarsh; Ryan, Andy P; Wang, Wei; Daugherty, Matthew D; Zhang, Dong-Er; Hao, Nan","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.18.103101","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["single cells","repetitive IFN stimulation","IFN-responsive regulatory network","effectiveness of IFN pretreatment","IFN-\u03B1 pretreatments","importance of IFN dynamics","delayed negative feedback loop","positive feedback loop","human epithelial cells","USP18 upregulation","cell cycle gating","upregulation of ubiquitin","repetitive stimulations","opposite effects","temporal compartmentalization of feedback control processes","early S phases of cell cycle","duration-dependent desensitization","delayed induction kinetics","microfluidics","viruses","time-lapse microscopy","clinical applications","treatment onset","computational modeling","time-based strategies","hormones","G1","specific peptidase","extracellular signal factors","sophisticated molecular circuits","type","interferon","SARS-CoV","cytokines","input durations","results","varying fashion","study"],"language":"en"},

We also estimated the percentage reduction in effective contacts due to the social distancing measures imple-mented. Results: Early model estimates show that COVID-19 outbreak in South Africa had a basic reproductive number of 2.95 (95% credible interval [CrI] 2.83-3.33).

Since then, the outbreak has indeed spread across all continents, threatening the public health of numerous countries. Although the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of COVID-19 is relatively low when optimal level of healthcare is granted to the patients, the high percentage of severe cases developing severe pneumonia and thus requiring respiratory support is worryingly high, and could lead to a rapid saturation of Intensive Care Units (ICUs). To overcome this risk, most countries enacted COVID-19 containment measures. In this study, we use a Bayesian SEIR epidemiological model to perform a parametric regression over the COVID-19 outbreaks data in China, Italy, Belgium, and Spain, and estimate the effect of the containment measures on the basic reproduction ratio R_0. We find that the effect of these measures is detectable, but tends to be gradual, and that a progressive strengthening of these measures usually reduces the R_0 below 1, granting a decay of the outbreak. We also discuss the biases and inconsistencies present in the publicly available data on COVID-19 cases, providing an estimate for the actual number of cases in Italy on March 12, 2020.

To date, few data on immunologic features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported. Methods In this single-centre retrospective study, a total of 21 patients with pneumonia who were laboratory-confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan Tongji hospital were included from Dec 19, 2019 to Jan 27, 2020. The immunologic characteristics as well as their clinical, laboratory, radiological features were compared between 11 severe cases and 10 moderate cases. Results Of the 21 patients with COVID-19, only 4 (19%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. 7 (33.3%) patients had underlying conditions. The average age of severe and moderate cases was 63.9 and 51.4 years, 10 (90.9%) severe cases and 7 (70.0%) moderate cases were male. Common clinical manifestations including fever (100%, 100%), cough (70%, 90%), fatigue (100%, 70%) and myalgia (50%, 30%) in severe cases and moderate cases. PaO2/FiO2 ratio was significantly lower in severe cases (122.9) than moderate cases (366.2). Lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in severe cases (7000 million/L) than moderate cases (11000 million/L). Alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and ferritin were significantly higher in severe cases (41.4 U/L, 567.2 U/L, 135.2 mg/L and 1734.4 ug/L) than moderate cases (17.6 U/L, 234.4 U/L, 51.4 mg/L and 880.2 ug /L). IL-2R, TNF-\u03B1 and IL-10 concentrations on admission were significantly higher in severe cases (1202.4 pg/mL, 10.9 pg/mL and 10.9 pg/mL) than moderate cases (441.7 pg/mL, 7.5 pg/mL and 6.6 pg/mL). Absolute number of total T lymphocytes, CD4\u002BT cells and CD8\u002BT cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were significantly lower in severe cases (332.5, 185.6 and 124.3 million/L) than moderate cases (676.5, 359.2 and 272.0 million/L). The expressions of IFN-\u03B3 by CD4\u002BT cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.6%) than moderate cases (23.6%). Conclusion The SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly CD4\u002BT cells, resulting in significant decrease in number as well as IFN-\u03B3 production, which may be associated with disease severity. Together with clinical characteristics, early immunologic indicators including diminished T lymphocytes and elevated cytokines may serve as potential markers for prognosis in COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Guang; Wu, Di; Guo, Wei; Cao, Yong; Huang, Da; Wang, Hongwu; Wang, Tao; Zhang, Xiaoyun; Chen, Huilong; Yu, Haijing; Zhang, Xiaoping; Zhang, Minxia; Wu, Shiji; Song, Jianxin; Chen, Tao; Han, Meifang; Li, Shusheng; Luo, Xiaoping; Zhao, Jianping; Ning, Qin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4cfb1fc4fc53abbc1d4b0ca60276c6af6632c3c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023903","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Alanine"],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Wuhan Tongji"],"keyphrases":["severe cases","moderate cases","outbreak of pneumonia cases","pg","T cells","average age of severe","patients","diminished T lymphocytes","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Absolute number of total T lymphocytes","CD4","SARS-CoV","COVID","immunologic characteristics","clinical characteristics","immunologic features of Coronavirus Disease","IL","laboratory","early immunologic indicators","Common clinical manifestations","IFN-\u03B3 production","radiological features","expressions of IFN","disease severity","Wuhan Tongji hospital","high-sensitivity C-reactive protein","ferritin","lactate dehydrogenase levels","elevated cytokines","potential markers","data","single-centre retrospective study","admission","CD8","Alanine aminotransferase","significant decrease","FiO2 ratio","TNF-\u03B1","concentrations","infection","Huanan seafood market","history of exposure","Lymphocyte counts","Methods","fever","prognosis","PaO2","date","underlying conditions","Conclusion","Results","years","male","China","globe","Background","cough","fatigue","myalgia"],"language":"en"},

Iran was among the first countries that had to confront serious shortages in RT\u2212PCR testing for SARS\u2212CoV\u22122 and ventilators availabilities throughout the COVID\u221219 outbreak. This study aimed to investigate the clinical course of hospitalized COVID\u221219 patients with different rRT\u2212PCR test results during the first 3 weeks of the outbreak in Qazvin province, Iran. Methods \u2212For this retrospective cohort study, data of hospitalized patients primarily diagnosed as having COVID\u221219 in all 12 centers across the whole Qazvin province during Feb 20\u2212Mar 11, 2020 was analyzed. A multivariate logistic regression model was applied to assess the independent associates of death among COVID\u221219 patients. Results \u2212 998 patients (57% male, median age 54 years) with positive chest CT\u2212scan changes were included in this study. Among them, 558 patients were examined with rRT\u2212PCR test and 73.8% tested positive. Case fatality rate was 20.68% and 7.53% among test\u2212positive and test negative hospitalized patients, respectively. While only 5.2% of patients were ICU admitted, case fatality rates outside ICU were 17.70% and 4.65% in test-positive and test-negative non\u2212ICU admitted patients, correspondingly. The independent associates of death were age \u2265 70 years, testing positive with rRT\u2212PCR test, having immunodeficiency disorders and ICU admission. Conclusions \u2212 Hospitalized COVID\u221219 patients with mild symptoms despite positive chest CT changes and major comorbidities were more probable to have negative rRT\u2212PCR test result, hence lower case fatality rate and a more favorable outcome.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nemati, Saeed; Najari, Hamid Reza; Eftekharzadeh, Anita; Kazemifar, Amir Mohammad; Qandian, Ali; Fattahi, Pedram; Zokaei Nikoo, Maedeh; Leghaei, Shiva; Rouhollahi, Mohammad Reza","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.21.20074641v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["Iran"],"keyphrases":["test-positive","negative hospitalized patients","PCR test results","data of hospitalized patients","test-negative non\u2212ICU","negative rRT","PCR testing","positive chest CT changes","clinical course of hospitalized COVID","different rRT","ICU admission","case fatality rates","lower case fatality rate","years","independent associates of death","Qazvin province","outbreak","Iran","retrospective cohort study","scan changes","median age","mild symptoms","major comorbidities","immunodeficiency disorders","serious shortages","SARS","weeks","devastating challenge","pandemic","ventilators availabilities","male","favorable outcome","multivariate logistic regression model","healthcare systems","countries","Methods","centers","Conclusions","Background"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to estimate the total number of COVID-19 related infections, deaths, and hospitalizations in Iran under different physical distancing and isolation scenarios. Methods: We developed a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model, parameterized to the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran. We used the model to quantify the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran and assess the effectiveness of isolation and physical distancing under five different scenarios (A: 0% isolation, through E: 40% isolation of all infected cases). We used Monte-Carlo simulation to calculate the 95% uncertainty intervals (UI). Findings: Under scenario A, we estimated 5,196,000 (UI 1,753,000 - 10,220,000) infections to happen till mid-June with 966,000 (UI 467,800 - 1,702,000) hospitalizations and 111,000 (UI 53,400 - 200,000) deaths.

The Advanced Analytical Epidemic Diffusion Model (AAEDM) is a dynamic diffusion prediction model which is theoretically intuitive and its tractable closed formula could be easily adapted into versatile Bigdata driven analytics including the machine learning system. This dynamic model is still an analytical model but the periods of prediction are segmented for adapting the values from the dataset when the data is available. The epidemiologically vital parameters which effect on the AAEDM are also introduced in this paper. The evaluation of this theoretical model based on the Covid-19 data in Korea has been accomplished with relative fair future prediction accuracies. Although this analytical model has been designed from a basic exponential growth model, the performance of the AAEDM is competitive with other Bigdata based simulation models. Since the AAEDM is relatively simple and handy, anyone can use this model into analyzing outbreak situations in his daily life.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Song-Kyoo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f46cf86b59026a87d861238293d48541f4b1c70e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037838","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Advanced Analytical Epidemic Diffusion Model"],"locations":["Korea"],"keyphrases":["analytical model","dynamic model","theoretical model","advanced analytical epidemic diffusion model","dynamic diffusion prediction model","AAEDM","basic exponential growth model","epidemic growth","periods of prediction","status of epidemic impacts","data sciences","paper deals","relative fair future prediction accuracies","versatile Bigdata driven analytics","epidemiology","performance","machine learning system","pathology","business","Korea","outbreak situations","Covid","various topics","tractable closed formula","daily life","simulation models","dataset","vital parameters","effect","values","evaluation"],"language":"en"},

As of 20 March 2020, cases have been reported in 166 countries/regions, including cases of human-to-human transmission around the world. The proportions of this epidemics is probably one of the largest challenges faced by our interconnected modern societies. According to the current epidemiological reports, the large basic reproduction number, R_0 ~ 2.3, number of secondary cases produced by an infected individual in a population of susceptible individuals, as well as an asymptomatic period (up to 14 days) in which infectious individuals are undetectable without further analysis, pave the way for a major crisis of the national health capacity systems. Recent scientific reports have pointed out that the detected cases of COVID19 at young ages is strikingly short and that lethality is concentrated at large ages. Here we adapt a Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA) metapopulation mobility model to capture the spread of COVID-19. We propose a model that stratifies the population by ages, and account for the different incidences of the disease at each strata. The model is used to predict the incidence of the epidemics in a spatial population through time, permitting investigation of control measures. The model is applied to the current epidemic in Spain, using the estimates of the epidemiological parameters and the mobility and demographic census data of the national institute of statistics (INE). The results indicate that the peak of incidence will happen in the first half of April 2020 in absence of mobility restrictions. These results can be refined with improved estimates of epidemiological parameters, and can be adapted to precise mobility restrictions at the level of municipalities. The current estimates largely compromises the Spanish health capacity system, in particular that for intensive care units, from the end of March. However, the model allows for the scrutiny of containment measures that can be used for health authorities to forecast with accuracy their impact in prevalence of COVID--19. Here we show by testing different epidemic containment scenarios that we urge to enforce total lockdown to avoid a massive collapse of the Spanish national health system.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arenas, Alex; Cota, Wesley; Gomez-Gardenes, Jesus; G\u00F3mez, Sergio; Granell, Clara; Matamalas, Joan T.; Soriano-Panos, David; Steinegger, Benjamin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09c436fbb847311fac0d57ca07c8f90b50102efd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.21.20040022","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["metapopulation mobility model","current estimates","cases of human","Spanish national health system","current epidemiological reports","national health capacity systems","Spanish health capacity system","health authorities","current epidemic","absence of mobility restrictions","precise mobility restrictions","number of secondary cases","improved estimates of epidemiological parameters","spatial population","young ages","population of susceptible individuals","detected cases of COVID19","epidemics","disease","spread of COVID","prevalence of COVID","results","different epidemic containment scenarios","national institute of statistics","scrutiny of containment measures","infectious individuals","different incidences","human transmission","peak of incidence","investigation of control measures","Recent scientific reports","large basic reproduction number","MMCA","massive collapse","demographic census data","time","Microscopic Markov Chain Approach","infected individual","major crisis","accuracy","intensive care units","novel coronavirus","largest challenges","days","analysis","impact","account","interconnected modern societies","total lockdown","level of municipalities","SARS-CoV","end","way","Hubei","INE","regions","lethality","countries","Spain","asymptomatic period","mainland China","outbreak","strata","half","world","proportions"],"language":"en"},

Classical compartmental models must be modified and studied to correctly describe the effects of forced external actions to reduce the impact of the disease. In addition, data are often incomplete and heterogeneous, so a high degree of uncertainty must naturally be incorporated into the models. In this work we address both these aspects, through an optimal control formulation of the epidemiological model in presence of uncertain data. After the introduction of the optimal control problem, we formulate an instantaneous approximation of the control that allows us to derive new feedback controlled compartmental models capable of describing the epidemic peak reduction. The need for long-term interventions shows that alternative actions based on the social structure of the system can be as effective as the more expensive global strategy. The importance of the timing and intensity of interventions is particularly relevant in the case of uncertain parameters on the actual number of infected people.

Our present study proposes that the MALDI-ToF MS can be further used to screen functional and metabolic differences. While other studies applied the MALDI-ToF technique to identify subgroups within species, we investigated how various environmental factors could alter the unique bacterial signatures.

We aimed to conduct a rapid review of mother-to-child transmission of COVID-19 during breastfeeding. Methods: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane library, China Biology Medicine disc, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, and preprint articles up to March 2020. We included studies relevant to transmission through milk and respiratory droplets during breastfeeding of mothers with COVID-19, SARS, MERS and influenza. Two reviewers independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. Results: A total of 4481 records were identified in our literature search. Six studies (five case reports and one case series) involving 58 mothers (16 mothers with COVID-19, 42 mothers with influenza) and their infants proved eligible. Five case reports showed that the viral nucleic acid tests for all thirteen collected samples of breast milk from mothers with COVID-19 were negative. A case series of 42 influenza infected postpartum mothers taking precautions (hand hygiene and wearing masks) before breastfeeding showed that no neonates were infected with influenza during one-month of follow-up. Conclusions: The current evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid has not been detected in breast milk. The benefits of breastfeeding may outweigh the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in infants. Mothers with COVID-19 should take appropriate precautions to reduce the risk of transmission via droplets and close contact during breastfeeding.

Closely resembling with SARS CoV, the present strain has manifested exceptionally higher degree of spreadability, virulence and stability possibly due to some unidentified mutations. The viral spike glycoprotein is very likely to interact with host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmits its genetic materials and hijacks host machinery with extreme fidelity for self propagation. Few attempts have been made to develop a suitable vaccine or ACE2 blocker or virus-receptor inhibitor within this short period of time. Here, attempt was taken to develop some therapeutic and vaccination strategies with a comparison of spike glycoproteins among SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV-2. We verified their structure quality (SWISS-MODEL, Phyre2, Pymol) topology (ProFunc), motifs (MEME Suite, GLAM2Scan), gene ontology based conserved domain (InterPro database) and screened several epitopes (SVMTrip) of SARS CoV-2 based on their energetics, IC50 and antigenicity with regard to their possible glycosylation and MHC/paratopic binding (Vaxigen v2.0, HawkDock, ZDOCK Server) effects.

A possible role of glycosylation on epitopic region showed profound effects on epitopic recognition.

WEEKLY EXCESS DEATH RATES BY AGE AND SEX FOR SWEDEN.","doi":"10.1101/2020.05.10.20096909","pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":null,"license":"medrxiv","abstract":"Objectives: Mortality from Covid-19 is monitored in detail both within as well as between countries with different strategies against the virus. However, death counts and relative risks based on crude numbers can be misleading. Instead, age specific death rates should be used for comparability. Given the difficulty of ascertainment of Covid-19 specific deaths, excess all-cause mortality is currently more appropriate for comparisons. By estimating age- and sex-specific death rates we aim to get more accurate estimates of the excess mortality attributed to Covid-19, as well as the difference between men and women in Sweden. Design: We make use of Swedish register data about total weekly deaths, total population at risk, and estimate age- and sex-specific weekly death rates for 2020 and the 5 previous years. The data is provided by Statistics Sweden. Results: From the first week of April and onwards, the death rates at all ages above 60 are higher than those in previous years in Sweden. Persons above age 80 are dis-proportionally more affected, and men suffer higher levels of excess mortality than women at all ages with 75% higher death rates for males and 50% higher for females. Current excess mortality corresponds to a decline in remaining life expectancy of 3 years for men and 2 years for women. Conclusion: The Covid-19 pandemic has so far had a clear and consistent effect on total mortality in Sweden, with male death rates being comparably more affected. What consequences the pandemic will eventually have on mortality and life expectancy will depend on the progression of the pandemic, the extent that some of the deaths would have occurred in the absence of the pandemic, only somewhat later, the consequences for other health conditions, as well as the health care sector at large.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Modig, K.; Ebeling, M.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.10.20096909v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs4NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Statistics Sweden"],"locations":["Sweden"],"keyphrases":["higher death rates","age specific death rates","total mortality","sex-specific death rates","male death rates","sex-specific weekly death rates","higher levels of excess mortality","Current excess mortality","death counts","Covid","pandemic","specific deaths","excess all-cause mortality","women","previous years","total weekly deaths","Statistics Sweden","total population","ages","consequences","remaining life expectancy","health conditions","health care sector","use of Swedish register data","decline","relative risks","consistent effect","crude numbers","progression","accurate estimates","countries","different strategies","virus","extent","difficulty of ascertainment","difference","Design","females","comparisons","absence","Conclusion","Objectives","comparability","Results","Persons"],"language":"en"},

We consider the problem of estimating the infection sources and the infection regions (subsets of nodes infected by each source) in a network, based only on knowledge of which nodes are infected and their connections, and when the number of sources is unknown a priori. We derive estimators for the infection sources and their infection regions based on approximations of the infection sequences count. We prove that if there are at most two infection sources in a geometric tree, our estimator identifies the true source or sources with probability going to one as the number of infected nodes increases. When there are more than two infection sources, and when the maximum possible number of infection sources is known, we propose an algorithm with quadratic complexity to estimate the actual number and identities of the infection sources.

Because the COVID-19 outbreak has made comprehensive and profound impacts on the world, an accurate prediction of its epidemic trend is significant. Although many studies have predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend, most have used early-stage data and focused on Chinese cases. Methods: We first built models to predict daily numbers of cumulative confirmed cases (CCCs), new cases (NCs), and death cases (DCs) of COVID-19 in China based on data from January 20, 2020, to March 1, 2020. Based on these models, we built models to predict the epidemic trend across the world (outside China). We also built models to predict the epidemic trend in Italy, Spain, Germany, France, UK, and USA where COVID-19 is rapidly spreading. Findings: The COVID-19 outbreak will have peaked on February 22, 2020, in China and will peak on May 22, 2020, across the world. It will be basically under control in early April 2020 in China and end-August 2020 across the world. The total number of COVID-19 cases will reach around 89,000 in China and 6,126,000 across the world during the epidemic. Around 4,000 and 290,000 people will die of COVID-19 in China and across the world, respectively. The COVID-19 outbreak will have peaked recently in Italy and will peak in Spain, Germany, France, UK, and USA within two weeks.

While mathematical models have suggested the efficacy of social distancing to curb the spread of CoV-2, there is a lack of systematic studies to quantify the real-world efficacy of these approaches. Here, we quantify the spread rate of COVID19 before and after national social distancing measures were implemented in 26 nations and compare this to the changes in COVID19 spread rate over equivalent time periods in 27 nations that did not enact social distancing policies. We find that social distancing policies significantly reduced the COVID19 spread rate.

Title/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal (AGREE-II) were carried out by single reviewers. Results: A total of 17 relevant CPGs were identified, published in the USA (n=8), Canada (n=6), Australia (n=2), and the United Kingdom (n=1). All of the CPGs dealt with infection control in long-term care facilities (LTCF) and addressed various types of viral respiratory infections (e.g., influenza, COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome). Ten or more CPGs recommended the following infection control measures in LTCF: hand hygiene (n=13), wearing personal protective equipment (n=13), social distancing or isolation (n=13), disinfecting surfaces (n=12), droplet precautions (n=12), surveillance and evaluation (n=11), and using diagnostic testing to confirm illness (n=10). While only two or more CPGs recommended these infection control measures: policies and procedures for visitors, staff and/or residents (n=9), respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette (n=9), providing supplies (n=9), staff and/or residents education (n=8), increasing communication (n=6), consulting or notifying health professionals (n=6), appropriate ventilation practices (n=2), and cohorting equipment (n=2). Ten CPGs also addressed management of viral respiratory infections in LTCF and recommended antiviral chemoprophylaxis (n=10) and one CPG recommended early mobilization of residents.

We develop a compartmental model for assessing the community-wide impact of mask use by the general, asymptomatic public, a portion of which may be asymptomatically infectious. Model simulations, using data relevant to COVID-19 dynamics in the US states of New York and Washington, suggest that broad adoption of even relatively ineffective face masks may meaningfully reduce community transmission of COVID-19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, mask use decreases the effective transmission rate in nearly linear proportion to the product of mask effectiveness (as a fraction of potentially infectious contacts blocked) and coverage rate (as a fraction of the general population), while the impact on epidemiologic outcomes (death, hospitalizations) is highly nonlinear, indicating masks could synergize with other non-pharmaceutical measures. Masks are found to be useful with respect to both preventing illness in healthy persons and preventing asymptomatic transmission. Hypothetical mask adoption scenarios suggest that immediate near universal (80%) adoption of moderately (50%) effective masks could prevent on the order of 17--45% of projected deaths over two months in New York, while decreasing the peak daily death rate by 34--58%, absent other changes in epidemic dynamics. Our results suggest use of face masks by the general public is potentially of high value in curtailing community transmission and the burden of the pandemic. The community-wide benefits are likely to be greatest when face masks are used in conjunction with other non-pharmaceutical practices (such as social-distancing), and when adoption is nearly universal (nation-wide) and compliance is high.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eikenberry, Steffen E.; Mancuso, Marina; Iboi, Enahoro; Phan, Tin; Eikenberry, Keenan; Kuang, Yang; Kostelich, Eric; Gumel, Abba B.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d843c7173358c9cff118fbaf8f889677a08d6cfd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03251v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["New York","Washington"],"keyphrases":["use of face masks","Face mask use","effective masks","community transmission of COVID","ineffective face masks","general public","community-wide impact of mask use","curtailing community transmission","asymptomatic transmission","effective transmission rate","Hypothetical mask adoption scenarios","general population","asymptomatic public","broad adoption","product of mask effectiveness","community-wide benefits","coverage rate","peak daily death rate","fraction","peak hospitalizations","pandemic","non-pharmaceutical practices","non-pharmaceutical measures","US states of New York","high value","epidemic dynamics","Model simulations","projected deaths","infectious contacts","compartmental model","immediate near universal","linear proportion","Washington","illness","data relevant","conjunction","healthy persons","months","epidemiologic outcomes","burden","spread","social-distancing","respect","changes","results","compliance","order","potential","intervention"],"language":"en"},

We came up with a two-arm controlled study design to simulate the treated and the untreated (control group) group by applying two respective transition models to the empirical data on dynamics of the disease severity (Figure 2 of the original article7) that are classified into low- (no and low oxygen supplement), medium- (non-invasive ventilator and high oxygen supplement), and high-(ECMO and invasive ventilator) from enrolment until discharge, death or the end of follow-up.

Understanding what proportion of these patients require screening, who can be safely screened in community based models of care, and who requires an emergency departments to care for them is critical for workforce and infrastructure planning across the healthcare system, as well as public messaging campaigns. Methods: In this cross-sectional survey, we screened patients presenting to a SARS-CoV-2 screening clinic in a tertiary hospital Emergency Department in Melbourne, Australia. We assessed the proportion of patients who met screening criteria; self-reported symptom severity; reasons why they came to the ED for screening; views on community-based models of care; and sources of information accessed about COVID-19. Results: We included findings from 1846 patients who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) for COVID-19 screening from 18th to 30th March 2020. Most patients (55.3%) did not meet criteria for screening and most (57.6%) had mild or no (13.4%) symptoms. The main reason for coming to the ED was being referred by a telephone health service (31.3%) and 136 (7.4%) said they tried to contact their GP but could not get an appointment. Only 47 (2.6%) said they thought the disease was too specialized for their GP to manage. Patients accessed numerous information sources, commonly government websites (68.4%) and other websites (51.3%) for COVID-19 information.

The prefusion Spike protein (S) is a large trimeric protein where each protomer may be in a so-called Up state or Down state, depending on the configuration of its receptor binding domain (RBD). The Up state is believed to allow binding of the virion to ACE-2 receptors on human epithelial cells, whereas the Down state is believed to be relatively inactive or reduced in its binding behavior. We have performed detailed all-atom, dominant energy landscape mappings for noncovalent interactions (charge, partial charge, and van der Waals) of the SARS-Cov-2 Spike protein in its static prefusion state based on recent structural information. We included both interchain interactions and intrachain (domain) interactions in our mappings in order to determine any telling differences (different so-called \u201Cglue\u201D points or \u201Chot spots\u201D) between residues in the Up and Down state protomers. In general, the S2 or fusion machinery domain of S is relatively rigid with strong noncovalent interactions facilitated by helical secondary structures, whereas the S1 domain, which contains the RBD and N-terminal domain (NTD), is relatively more flexible and characterized by beta strand structural motifs. The S2 domain demonstrated no appreciable energetic differences between Up and Down protomers, including interchain as well as each protomer\u2019s intrachain, S1-S2 interactions. However, the S1 domain interactions across neighboring protomers, which include the RBD-NTD cross chain interactions, showed energetic differences between Up-Down and Down-Down neighboring protomers. Surprisingly, the Up-Down, RBD-NTD interactions were overall stronger and more numerous than the Down-Down cross chain interactions, including the appearance of the three residue sequence ALA520-PRO521-ALA522 associated with a turn structure in the RBD of the Up state. Additionally, our intrachain dominant energy mappings within each protomer, identified a significant \u201Cglue\u201D point or possible latch for the Down state protomer between the S1 subdomain, SD1 and the RBD domain of the same protomer that was completely missing in the Up state protomer analysis. Ironically, this dominant energetic interaction in the Down state protomer involved the backbone atoms of the same three residue sequence ALA520-PRO521-ALA522 of the RBD with the R-group of GLN564 in the SD1 domain. Thus, this same three residue sequence acts as a stabilizer of the RBD in the Up conformation through its interactions with its neighboring NTD chain and a kind of latch in the Down state conformation through its interactions with its own SD1 domain. The dominant interaction energy residues identified here are also conserved across reported variations of SARS-Cov-2, as well as the closely related virions SARS-Cov and the bat corona virus RatG13. However, these results are all based on static structure analysis and large scale dynamic simulations will be necessary to further investigate these findings. Nonetheless, static dominant energy landscape mappings represents a starting point for more detailed dynamic analyses and hopefully an improved understanding at the structure-function relationship of this highly complex protein.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peters, Michael H.; Bastidas, Oscar","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/adeacdba89a64dff08a54b5a5104e37f58056b7b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.12.091090","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RBD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RBD domain","state protomers","S1 domain interactions","RBD-NTD interactions","state conformation","state protomer analysis","interchain interactions","S2 domain","SD1 domain","static prefusion state","S1-S2 interactions","RBD-NTD cross chain interactions","strong noncovalent interactions","receptor binding domain","intrachain dominant energy mappings","fusion machinery domain of S","N-terminal domain","prefusion Spike protein","static dominant energy landscape mappings","neighboring protomers","dominant energetic interaction","neighboring NTD chain","dominant interaction energy residues","characteristic Spike protein","complex protein","static structure analysis","large trimeric protein","S1 subdomain","residue sequence ALA520-PRO521","related virions SARS-Cov","residue sequence acts","appreciable energetic differences","glue","ALA522","telling differences","turn structure","protomer\u2019s intrachain","reported variations of SARS","binding behavior","detailed dynamic analyses","structure-function relationship","large scale dynamic simulations","starting point","virion responsible","partial charge","possible latch","kind of latch","detailed all-atom","recent structural information","beta strand structural motifs","helical secondary structures","improved understanding","appearance","current world-wide pandemic Covid","receptors","points","bat corona virus RatG13","R-group","human epithelial cells","backbone atoms","hot spots","GLN564","Waals","stabilizer","order","configuration","surface","results","findings"],"language":"en"},

Methods Python 3.7.1 was used to write a SEIR class to model the epidemic procedure and a back propagation class to estimate the initial true infected number. The epidemic area in China was divided into three parts, Wuhan city, Hubei province (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) based on the different transmission pattern. A limitation factor for the medical resource was imposed to model the infected but not quarantined. Credible data source from Baidu Qianxi were used to assess the number of infected cases migrated from Wuhan to other areas. Results Basic reproduction number, R0, was 3.6 in the very early stage. The true infected number was 4508 in our model in Wuhan before January 22, 2020. By January 22 2020, it was estimated that 1764 infected cases migrated from Wuhan to other cities in Hubei province. Effective reproductive number, R, gradually decreased from 3.6 (Wuhan, stage 1), 3.4 (Hubei except Wuhan, stage 1) and 3.3 (China except Hubei, stage 1) to 0.67 (Wuhan, stage 4), 0.83 (Hubei except Wuhan, stage 2) and 0.63 (China except Hubei, stage 2), respectively. Especially after January 23, 2020 when Wuhan City was closed, the infected number showed a turning point in Wuhan.

In this Original Research article, we describe the conception, the analytical and clinical performances as well as the risk management of implementing the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip in a diagnostic decision algorithm. Materials and Methods: Development of the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip resulted in a ready-to-use ICT assay based on a membrane technology with colloidal gold nanoparticles using monoclonal antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highly conserved nucleoprotein antigen. Four hundred observations were recorded for the analytical performance study and thirty tests were analysed for the cross-reactivity study. The clinical performance study was performed in a retrospective multi-centric evaluation on aliquots of 328 nasopharyngeal samples. COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip results were compared with qRT-PCR as golden standard for COVID-19 diagnostics. Results: In the analytical performance study, the reproducibility showed a between-observer disagreement of 1.7%, a robustness of 98%, an overall satisfying user friendliness and no cross-reactivity with other virus-infected nasopharyngeal samples. In the clinical performance study performed in three different clinical laboratories we found an overall sensitivity and specificity of 57.6% and 99.5% respectively with an accuracy of 82.6%. The cut-off of the assay was found at Ct\u003C22. User-friendliness analysis and risk management assessment through Ishikawa diagram demonstrate that COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip may be implemented in clinical laboratories according to biosafety recommendations.

Although airway acidification occurs early in CF, whether transient acidification is sufficient to initiate mucus abnormalities is unknown. We studied mucus secretion and mucus transport in piglets forty-eight hours following an intra-airway acid challenge. Acid-challenged piglet airways were distinguished by increased mucin 5B (MUC5B) in the submucosal gland but decreased lung lavage fluid MUC5B, following in vivo cholinergic stimulation, suggesting a failure in submucosal gland secretion. Concomitantly, intrapulmonary airways were obstructed with glycoprotein rich material under both basal and methacholine-stimulated conditions. To mimic a CF-like environment, we also studied mucus secretion and transport under diminished bicarbonate and chloride transport conditions ex vivo. Cholinergic stimulation in acid-challenged piglet airways induced extensive mucus films, greater mucus strand formation, increased dilation of submucosal gland duct openings and decreased mucociliary transport. Finally, to elucidate potential mediators of acid-induced mucus defects, we investigated diminazene aceturate, a small molecule that inhibits the acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC). Diminazene aceturate restored surface MUC5B in acid-challenged piglet airways under basal conditions, mitigated acid-induced airway obstruction, and magnified the number of dilated submucosal gland duct openings. These findings suggest that even transient airway acidification early in life might have profound impacts on mucus secretion and transport properties. Further they highlight diminazene aceturate as an agent that might be beneficial in alleviating certain mucus defects in CF airway disease.

We applied this barcode to 4,000 additional genomes deposited between March 31st and April 15th and classified successfully 95.6% of the clades demonstrating the utility of this approach. An analysis of amino acid variation in SARS-CoV-2 ORFs provided evidence of substitution events in the viral proteins involved in both host-entry and genome replication. The systematic monitoring of dynamic changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes of circulating virus populations over time can guide therapeutic and prophylactic strategies to manage and contain the virus and, also, with available efficacious antivirals and vaccines, aid in the monitoring of circulating genetic diversity as we proceed towards elimination of the agent.

While the number of academically affiliated medical human rights programs has increased in recent years, there is still substantial unmet need for pro bono evaluations throughout the United States, especially for individuals in detention. Approach The Mount Sinai Human Rights Program launched its pilot Remote Evaluation Network in September 2019, with the aim to coordinate forensic mental health evaluations by telephone or video call for individuals who are unable to access in-person services. The authors recruited mental health clinicians from across the country, trained them in best practices in conducting forensic evaluations using telehealth platforms, and coordinated pro bono mental health evaluations of individuals seeking immigration relief. Remote forensic services have been a particularly relevant solution in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcomes The Remote Evaluation Network consists of seventeen active evaluators. From December 2019 to April 2020, the pilot program has coordinated fifteen forensic evaluations of individuals seeking asylum and other forms of protected immigration status in six different states. All clinicians participated in a training module on best practices in conducting forensic evaluations by telephone; respondents to optional pre-and-post-module surveys reported an increase in comfort level with conducting telephonic evaluations after participating in the module. Next Steps We will formally evaluate this pilot program\u0027s services by assessing the quality of medico-legal affidavits from telephonic evaluations, tracking legal outcomes and qualitative feedback from attorneys, and investigating the acceptability of telephonic mental health evaluations among legal professionals. Future directions include expansion to new geographies, including individuals affected by the Migrant Protection Protocols or \u0022Remain in Mexico\u0022 program.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Green, A.

The impact of the pandemic in low and middle income countries has the potential to worsen already strained access to surgical care. Timely assessment of surgical volumes in these countries remains challenging. Objective: To determine whether usage data from a globally used anesthesiology calculator mobile application can serve as a proxy for global surgical case volume and contribute to monitoring of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in World Bank low income countries where official data collection is not currently practical. Design: Subset of data from an ongoing observational cohort study of users of the application collected from October 1, 2018 to April 18, 2020. Setting: The mobile application is available from public sources; users download and use the application per their own clinical needs on personal mobile devices. Participants: No user data was excluded from the study. Exposure(s): Events with impacts on surgical case volumes, including weekends, holidays, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): It was previously noted that application usage was decreased on weekends and during winter holidays. We subsequently hypothesized that more detailed analysis would reveal impacts of country-specific or region-specific holidays on the volume of app use. Results: 4,300,975 data points from 92,878 unique users were analyzed. Physicians and other anesthesia providers comprised 85.8% of the study population. Application use was reduced on holidays and weekends and correlated with fluctuations in surgical volume. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with substantial reductions in app use globally and regionally. There was strong cross correlation between COVID-19 case count and reductions in app use. By country, there was a median global reduction in app use to 58% of baseline (interquartile range, 46%-75%). Application use in low-income continues to decline but in high-income countries has stabilized. Conclusions and Relevance: Application usage metadata provides a real-time indicator of surgical volume. This data may be used to identify impacted regions where disruptions to surgical care are disproportionate or prolonged. A dashboard for continuous visualization of these data has been deployed.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u0027Reilly-Shah, V. N.; Van Cleve, W.; Long, D. R.; Moll, V.; Evans, F.

Enzymatic attachment of complex oligosaccharides to proteins (glycosylation) is highly responsive to numerous (patho)physiological conditions and ageing, which is perhaps best exemplified on IgG. The prospect of immune age reduction, by reverting induced glycosylation changes through metabolic intervention, opens many possibilities. Herein, we have investigated whether weight loss interventions affect inflammation- and ageing-related glycosylation alterations, in a longitudinal cohort of bariatric-surgery patients. To support potential findings, BMI-related glycosylation changes were monitored in a longitudinal TwinsUK cohort. Methods IgG and plasma N-glycans were chromatographically profiled in 37 obese patients, subjected to low-calorie diet and then to bariatric surgery, across multiple timepoints. Similarly, plasma glycome was analysed in 1,680 TwinsUK participants and longitudinally monitored during a 20-year follow-up. Findings Low-calorie diet induced marked increase in low branched and significant decrease in highly branched, more complex plasma N-glycans - the change opposite to the one typically observed in inflammatory conditions. Bariatric surgery resulted in extensive, gradual alterations in IgG glycome, that accompanied progressive weight loss during one year follow-up. We observed significant increase in digalactosylated and sialylated, and substantial decrease in agalactosylated and core fucosylated IgG glycans. In general, such IgG glycan profile is associated with a younger biological age and reflects enhanced anti-inflammatory IgG potential. The TwinsUK cohort replicated weight loss-associated agalactosylation decrease and digalactosylation increase, estimated through BMI decrease over a 20-year period. Interpretation Altogether, these findings highlight that weight loss substantially affects both plasma and IgG N-glycosylation, resulting in improved biological and immune age.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Greto, V.

Such conformation is proposed as an early prefusion state for the SARS-CoV-2 spike that may broaden the knowledge of coronavirus and facilitate vaccine development.","publish_time":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Tingting; Zheng, Qingbing; Yu, Hai; Wu, Dinghui; Xue, Wenhui; Zhang, Yuyun; Huang, Xiaofen; Zhou, Lizhi; Zhang, Zhigang; Zha, Zhenghui; Chen, Tingting; Wang, Zhiping; Chen, Jie; Sun, Hui; Deng, Tingting; Wang, Yingbin; Chen, Yixin; Zhao, Qinjian; Zhang, Jun; Gu, Ying; Li, Shaowei; Xia, Ningshao","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1ccdb6a71a89b14490f0f1d533f3f4ec8afde0e8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.994152","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["RBD"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","S associate","S ectodomain","S trimer","S1 subunit","proteins","unique conformation","RBD","knowledge of coronavirus","classic prefusion conformation of coronaviruses","upper S1 region","Pandemic coronavirus disease","convalescent COVID","cryo-EM","versions of spike","emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","early prefusion state","Cryo-electron microscopy","lower position","receptor binding domain","\u00C5 proximal","homotrimer","analyses","solutions","substantial glycosylation","excellent antigenicity","viral membrane","insect cells","patient sera","vaccine development","monomer","efficacious vaccines","therapeutics"],"language":"en"},

As exploratory studies have suggested that interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels are elevated in cases of complicated COVID-19 and that the anti-IL-6 biologic tocilizumab may be beneficial, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the evidence in this field. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies investigating the immunological response in COVID-19 or its treatment with tocilizumab; additional grey literature searches were undertaken. Meta-analysis was undertaken using random effects models. Results: Eight published studies, three pre-prints, and five registered trials were eligible. Meta-analysis of mean IL-6 concentrations demonstrated 2.9-fold higher levels in patients with complicated COVID-19 compared with patients with non-complicated disease (six studies; n=1302; 95%CI, 1.17-7.19; I2=100%). A single non-randomized, single-arm study assessed tocilizumab in patients with severe COVID-19, demonstrating decreased oxygen requirements, resolution of radiographic abnormalities, and clinical improvement. No adverse events or deaths were observed. Conclusions: In patients with COVID-19, IL-6 levels are significantly elevated and associated with adverse clinical outcomes. While inhibition of IL-6 with tocilizumab appears to be efficacious and safe in preliminary investigation, the results of several ongoing clinical trials should be awaited to better define the role of tocilizumab in COVID-19 prior to routine clinical application.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coomes, E.

Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we studied 340 confirmed COVID-19 patients from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, including 310 discharged cases and 30 death cases. We analyzed their demographic, epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data and implemented our findings into an interactive, free access web application. Findings Baseline T lymphocyte Subsets differed significantly between the discharged cases and the death cases in two-sample t-tests: Total T cells (p \u003C 2.2e-16), Helper T cells (p \u003C 2.2e-16), Suppressor T cells (p = 1.8-14), and TH/TS (Helper/Suppressor ratio, p = 0.0066). Multivariate logistic regression model with death or discharge as the outcome resulted in the following significant predictors: age (OR 1.05, p 0.04), underlying disease status (OR 3.42, p 0.02), Helper T cells on the log scale (OR 0.22, p 0.00), and TH/TS on the log scale (OR 4.80, p 0.00). The McFadden pseudo R-squared for the logistic regression model is 0.35, suggesting the model has a fair predictive power. Interpretation While age and underlying diseases are known risk factors for poor prognosis, patients with a less damaged immune system at the time of hospitalization had higher chance of recovery. Close monitoring of the T lymphocyte subsets might provide valuable information of the patients condition change during the treatment process.

The need for effective control is exemplified during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, which has inflicted near to a thousand deaths as well as bankruptcies of airlines and related businesses. In this article, we examine the efficacy of control strategies on the propagation of infectious diseases based on removing connections within real world airline network with the associated economic and social costs taken into account through defining appropriate quantitative measures. We uncover the surprising results that removing less busy connections can be far more effective in hindering the spread of the disease than removing the more popular connections. Since disconnecting the less popular routes tend to incur less socio-economic cost, our finding suggests the possibility of trading minimal reduction in connectivity of an important hub with efficiencies in epidemic control. In particular, we demonstrate the performance of various local epidemic control strategies, and show how our approach can predict their cost effectiveness through the spreading control characteristics.","publish_time":"2012-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chung, N.

Results: The positive rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens and throat swabs were 76.9% and 44.2%, respectively. Sputum specimens showed a significantly higher positive rate than throat swabs in detecting viral nucleic acid using qRT-PCR assay (P=0.001). Conclusions: The detection rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens are significantly higher than throat swabs.

Understanding the fast evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy. Methods We collected individual information on 8,579 laboratory-confirmed cases from official publically sources reported outside Hubei in mainland China, as of February 17, 2020. We estimated the temporal variation of the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (Rt) at the provincial level. Results The median age of the cases was 44 years, with an increasing of cases in younger age groups and the elderly as the epidemic progressed. The delay from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4.4 days (95%CI: 0.0-14.0) until January 27 to 2.6 days (0.0-9.0) from January 28 to February 17. The mean incubation period was estimated at 5.2 days (1.8-12.4) and the mean serial interval at 5.1 days (1.3-11.6). The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside Hubei was highly variable, but consistently included a mix of case importations and local transmission. We estimate that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than three weeks with Rt reaching peaks between 1.40 (1.04-1.85) in Shenzhen City of Guangdong Province and 2.17 (1.69-2.76) in Shandong Province. In all the analyzed locations (n=10) Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold since the end of January. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the strict containment measures and movement restrictions in place may contribute to the interruption of local COVID-19 transmission outside Hubei Province. The shorter serial interval estimated here implies that transmissibility is not as high as initial estimates suggested.","publish_time":"2020-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Juanjuan; Litvinova, Maria; Wang, Wei; Wang, Yan; Deng, Xiaowei; Chen, Xinghui; Li, Mei; Zheng, Wen; Yi, Lan; Chen, Xinhua; Wu, Qianhui; Liang, Yuxia; Wang, Xiling; Yang, Juan; Sun, Kaiyuan; Longini, Ira M.; Halloran, M.

The key to understanding the biology and virus-host interactions of SARS-CoV-2 requires the knowledge of mutation and evolution of this virus at both inter- and intra-host levels. However, despite quite a few polymorphic sites identified among SARS-CoV-2 populations, intra-host variant spectra and their evolutionary dynamics remain mostly unknown. Here, using deep sequencing data, we achieved and characterized consensus genomes and intra-host genomic variants from 32 serial samples collected from eight patients with COVID-19. The 32 consensus genomes revealed the coexistence of different genotypes within the same patient. We further identified 40 intra-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs). Most (30/40) iSNVs presented in single patient, while ten iSNVs were found in at least two patients or identical to consensus variants. Comparison of allele frequencies of the iSNVs revealed genetic divergence between intra-host populations of the respiratory tract (RT) and gastrointestinal tract (GIT), mostly driven by bottleneck events among intra-host transmissions. Nonetheless, we observed a maintained viral genetic diversity within GIT, showing an increased population with accumulated mutations developed in the tissue-specific environments. The iSNVs identified here not only show spatial divergence of intra-host viral populations, but also provide new insights into the complex virus-host interactions.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yanqun; Wang, Daxi; Zhang, Lu; Sun, Wanying; Zhang, Zhaoyong; Chen, Weijun; Zhu, Airu; Huang, Yongbo; Xiao, Fei; Yao, Jinxiu; Gan, Mian; Li, Fang; luo, Ling; Huang, Xiaofang; Zhang, Yanjun; Wong, Sook-san; Cheng, Xinyi; Ji, Jingkai; Ou, Zhihua; Xiao, Minfeng; Li, Min; Li, Jiandong; Ren, Peidi; Deng, Ziqing; Zhong, Huanzi; Yang, Huanming; Wang, Jian; Xu, Xun; Song, Tie; Mok, Chris Ka Pun; Peiris, Malik; Zhong, Nanshan; Zhao, Jingxian; Li, Yimin; Li, Junhua; Zhao, Jincun","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4a752d1dd200649b7b1b7ab81fc5d4271da23a03.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.20.103549","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["intra-host populations","intra-host transmissions","intra-host levels","intra-host genomic variants","iSNVs","intra-host variant spectra","intra-host single nucleotide variants","virus-host interactions of SARS","spatial divergence of intra-host viral populations","complex virus-host interactions","consensus variants","SARS-CoV","genetic divergence","GIT","characterized consensus genomes","patients","single patient","respiratory tract","gastrointestinal tract","maintained viral genetic diversity","causative agent of COVID","serial samples","evolutionary dynamics","new insights","accumulated mutations","increased population","bottleneck events","coexistence of different genotypes","Comparison of allele frequencies","biology","death","tissue-specific environments","deep sequencing data","knowledge of mutation","polymorphic sites","official reports1","key","people"],"language":"en"},

However, it is currently unclear if results from different tests are comparable. Our goal was to evaluate the primer-probe sets used in four common diagnostic assays available on the World Health Organization (WHO) website. To facilitate this effort, we generated RNA transcripts to be used as assay standards and distributed them to other laboratories for internal validation. We then used (1) RNA transcript standards, (2) full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA, (3) pre-COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swabs, and (4) clinical samples from COVID-19 patients to determine analytical efficiency and sensitivity of the qRT-PCR primer-probe sets. We show that all primer-probe sets can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 at 500 virus copies per reaction, except for the RdRp-SARSr (Charite) confirmatory primer-probe set which has low sensitivity. Our findings characterize the limitations of currently used primer-probe sets and can assist other laboratories in selecting appropriate assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vogels, Chantal B.F.; Brito, Anderson F.; Wyllie, Anne Louise; Fauver, Joseph R; Ott, Isabel M.; Kalinich, Chaney C.; Petrone, Mary E.; Casanovas-Massana, Arnau; Muenker, M.

While all people are exposed to air pollution, older individuals tend to be disproportionally affected. As a result, there is growing concern about the public health impacts of air pollution as many countries undergo rapid population ageing. We investigated the spatial and temporal variation in the health economic cost of deaths attributable to ambient air pollution, and its interaction with population ageing from 2000 to 2016 at global and regional levels. Methods We developed an age-adjusted measure of the value of a statistical life year (VSLY) to estimate the health economic cost attributable to ambient PM2.5 pollution using the Global Burden of Disease 2017 data and country-level socioeconomic information. First, we estimated the global age- and cause-specific mortality and years of life lost (YLL) attributable to PM2.5 pollution using the global exposure mortality model (GEMM) and global estimates of exposure derived from ground monitoring, satellite retrievals and chemical transport model simulations at 0.1 by 0.1 degree (~11 km at the equator) resolution. Second, for each year between 2000 and 2016, we translated the YLL within each age-group into a health-related economic cost using a country-specific, age-adjusted measure of VSLY. Third, we decomposed the major driving factors that contributed to the temporal change in health costs related to PM2.5. Finally, we conducted a sensitivity test to analyze the variability of the estimated health costs to four alternative valuation measures. We identified the uncertainty intervals (UIs) from 1000 draws of the parameters and exposure-response functions by age, cause, country and year. All economic values are reported in 2011 purchasing-power-parity-adjusted US dollars. Findings Globally, 8.42 million (95% UI: 6.50, 10.52) deaths and 163.68 million (116.03, 219.44) YLL were attributable to ambient PM2.5 in 2016. The average attributable mortality for the older population was 12 times higher than for those younger than 60 years old. In 2016, the global health economic cost of ambient PM2.5 pollution for the older population was US$2.40 trillion (1.89, 2.93) accounting for 59% of the cost for the total population. The health cost for the older population alone was equivalent to 2.1% (1.7%, 2.6%) of global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2016. While the economic cost per capita for the older population was US$2739 (2160, 3345) in 2016, the cost per capita for the younger population was only US$268 (205, 335). From 2000 to 2016, the annual global health economic cost for the total population increased from US$2.37 trillion (1.88, 2.87) to US$4.09 trillion (3.19, 5.05). Decomposing the factors that contributed to the rise in health economic costs, we found that increases in GDP per capita, population ageing, population growth, age-specific mortality reduction, and PM2.5 exposure changed the total health economic cost by 77%, 21.2%, 15.6%, -41.1% and -0.2%, respectively. Compared to using an age-invariant VSLY or an age-invariant value of a statistical life (VSL), the estimates of the older population share of the total health economic cost using an age-adjusted VSLY was 2 and 18 percentage points lower, respectively. Interpretation The health economic cost borne by the older population almost doubled between 2000 and 2016, driven primarily by GDP growth, population ageing and population growth. Compared to younger individuals, air pollution leads to disproportionately higher health costs amongst the older population, even after accounting for their relatively shorter remaining life expectancy and increased disability. The age-specific estimates of health economic cost inform the optimal design of air pollution reduction strategies and allocation of healthcare resources. The positive relationship between age and economic costs suggests that countries with severe air pollution and rapid aging rates would particularly benefit from improving their air quality. In addition, strategies aimed at enhancing healthcare services, especially for the older population, may be beneficial for reducing the costs of ambient air pollution.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yin, H.; Brauer, M.; Zhang, J.; Cai, W.; Navrud, S.; Burnett, R.; Howard, C.; Deng, Z.; Kammen, D.

Abstract Introduction Recommendations for the management of patients with gynecological cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Material and method Recommendations based on the consensus conference model. Results In the case of a COVID-19 positive patient, surgical management should be postponed for at least 15 days. For cervical cancer, the place of surgery must be re-evaluated in relation to radiotherapy and Radio-Chemotherapy-Concomitant and the value of lymph node staging surgeries must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. For advanced ovarian cancers, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy should be favored even if primary cytoreduction surgery could be envisaged. It is lawful not to offer hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy during a COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of patients who must undergo interval surgery, it is possible to continue the chemotherapy and to offer surgery after 6 cycles of chemotherapy. For early stage endometrial cancer, in case of low and intermediate preoperative ESMO risk, hysterectomy with bilateral annexectomy associated with a sentinel lymph node procedure should be favored. It is possible to consider postponing surgery for 1 to 2 months in low-risk endometrial cancers (FIGO Ia stage on MRI and grade 1-2 endometrioid cancer on endometrial biopsy). For high ESMO risk, it ispossible to favor the MSKCC algorithm (combining PET-CT and sentinel lymph node biopsy) in order to omit pelvic and lumbar-aortic lymphadenectomies. Conclusion During COVID-19 pandemic, patients suffering from cancer should not lose life chance, while limiting the risks associated with the virus.","publish_time":"2020-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Akladios, C.; Azais, H.; Ballester, M.; Bendifallah, S.; Bolze, P.-A.; Bourdel, N.; Bricou, A.; Canlorbe, G.; Carcopino, X.; Chauvet, P.; Collinet, P.; Coutant, C.; Dabi, Y.; Dion, L.; Gauthier, T.; Graesslin, O.; Huchon, C.; Koskas, M.; Kridelka, F.; Lavoue, V.; Lecointre, L.; Mezzadri, M.; Mimoun, C.; Ouldamer, L.; Raimond, E.; Touboul, C.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c796fded41ebe8a847a8a680fbb7f6e18af694dc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468718920301306; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468718920301306","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["the management","the place","the value","Results In the case","patients with gynecological cancer during the COVID","in case","cancer gyn\u00E9cologique","endometrioid cancer","cervical cancer","cancer endom\u00E9trio\u00EFde","cancer du col","in order to","it is possible to continue the chemotherapy","p\u00E9riode de pand\u00E9mie COVID","Conclusion During COVID","while limiting the risks associated with the virus","to offer surgery after","it ispossible to favor the MSKCC algorithm","early stage endometrial cancer","cas de patiente positive COVID","cas des patientes","patients suffering from cancer should","surgery must be re","the consensus conference model","It is possible to consider postponing surgery","place de la chirurgie","radio-chimioth\u00E9rapie","cycles de chimioth\u00E9rapie","evaluated in relation to radiotherapy","to offer hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy during","risk endometrial cancers","sentinel lymph node procedure should be favored","months in low","case basis","mois de la chirurgie","chirurgie de cl\u00F4ture","chimioth\u00E9rapie hyperthermique","surgical management should be postponed","adjuvant chemotherapy should be favored even if primary cytoreduction surgery could be envisaged","It is lawful","high ESMO risk","lymph node staging surgeries must be reviewed","cas de risque ESMO pr\u00E9op\u00E9ratoire faible","sentinel lymph node biopsy","endometrial biopsy","patients who must undergo interval surgery","risques ESMO \u00E9lev\u00E9s","charge des patientes atteintes","intermediate preoperative ESMO risk","hysterectomy with bilateral annexectomy associated with","FIGO Ia stage","chance","advanced ovarian cancers","pandemic period","recommandations de prise","Abstract Introduction Recommendations","endom\u00E8tre de bas risque","positive patient","m\u00E9thode Recommandations","charge chirurgicale","R\u00E9sum\u00E9 Introduction","risques li\u00E9s","method Recommendations based","proc\u00E9dure du ganglion sentinelle","lose","combining PET","neo","pelvic","annexectomie bilat\u00E9rale associ\u00E9e","lumbar","int\u00E9r\u00EAt des chirurgies","stadification ganglionnaire","MRI","hyst\u00E9rectomie totale","mod\u00E8le des conf\u00E9rences","rapport","TDM","radioth\u00E9rapie","Material","IRM","R\u00E9sultats","aortic lymphadenectomies","cytor\u00E9duction premi\u00E8re","GS","Mat\u00E9riel","algorithme","days","adjuvante","lympahd\u00E9nectomies pelviennes","lomboaortiques","report","jours","ovaire","intervalle","biopsie endom\u00E9triale"],"language":"fr"},

Abstract The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (COVID-19) is affecting elderly people worldwide with greater incidence and severity. In Spain, 68% of all coronavirus hospitalizations correspond to those over 60 years of age. This work aims to highlight the evidence about the measures to be implemented through current and future guidelines. The need to prepare for action by implementing international protocols stand out. There is a trend towards biopsychosocial care of elderly people in all settings where they are, adapting care and personalizing decisions on hospital admissions, palliative care, among other criteria, to years adjusted to quality of life, as well as alternatives for monitoring and treatment of COVID-19 pathology and others existing in this population group. Measures to reduce the transmission of the virus through hygiene and social distancing are necessary, attending to biopsychosocial health of the elderly isolated.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the likely association between an individual\u0027s ancestry and the extent of COVID-19 manifestation employing Europeans as the case study. We employed 10,215 ancient and modern genomes across the globe assessing 597,573 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Pearson\u0027s correlation coefficient (r) between various ancestry proportions of European genomes and COVID-19 death/recovery ratio was calculated and its significance was statistically evaluated. We found significant positive correlation (p=0.03) between European Mesolithic hunter gatherers (WHG) ancestral fractions and COVID-19 death/recovery ratio and a marginally significant negative correlation (p=0.06) between Neolithic Iranian ancestry fractions and COVID-19 death/recovery ratio. We further identified 404 immune response related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by comparing publicly available 753 genomes from various European countries against 838 genomes from various Eastern Asian countries in a genome wide association study (GWAS). Prominently we identified that SNPs associated with Interferon stimulated antiviral response, Interferon-stimulated gene 15 mediated antiviral mechanism and 2\u0027-5\u0027 oligoadenylate synthase mediated antiviral response show large differences in allele frequencies between Europeans and East Asians. Overall, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the likely association between genetic ancestry and COVID-19 manifestation.

In humans, it binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with the help a structure on its surface called the S-spike. COVID-19 poses intriguing issues with imperative relevance to clinicians. The pathogenesis of GI symptoms, diabetes-associated mortality, and disease recurrence in COVID-19 are of particular relevance because they cannot be sufficiently explained from the existing knowledge of the viral diseases. Tissue specific variation of ACE2 expression in healthy individuals can help in understanding the pathophysiological basis the aforementioned collection of symptoms. Materials and Methods The data were downloaded from the Human Protein Atlas available at (https://www.proteinatlas.org/search/ACE2) and the tissue specific expression (both mRNA and protein) of ACE2 as yielded from the studies with RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was analyzed as a function of the various components of the digestive tract. A digestive system specific functional enrichment map of ACE2 gene was created using g:profiler (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost) utility and the data were visualized using Cytoscape software, version 3.7.2 (https://cytoscape.org/). Results The correlated expression (genomic and proteomic) of ACE2 (to which SARS-CoV-2 binds through the S-spike) was found to be enriched in the lower gastrointestinal tract (GIT) (highest in small intestine, followed by colon and rectum), and was undetectable in the upper GIT components: mouth cavity (tongue, oral mucosa, and salivary glands), esophagus, and stomach. High expression of ACE2 was noted in the glandular cells as well as in the enterocytes in the lining epithelium (including brush border epithelium). Among other digestive system organs, gallbladder (GB) showed high expression of ACE2 in glandular cells, while any protein expression was undetectable in liver and pancreas. Conclusions Based on the findings of this study and supportive evidence from the literature we propose that a SARS-CoV-2 binding with ACE2 mediates dysregulation of the sodium dependent nutrient transporters and hence may be a plausible basis for the digestive symptoms in COVID-19 patients. ACE2 mediated dysregulation of sodium dependent glucose transporter (SGLT1 or SLC5A1) in the intestinal epithelium also links it to the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus which can be a possible reason for the associated mortality in COVID-19 patients with diabetes. High expression of ACE2 in mucosal cells of the intestine and GB make these organs potential sites for the virus entry and replication. Continued replication of the virus at these ACE2 enriched sites may be a basis for the disease recurrence reported in some, thought to be cured, patients. Highlights SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor ACE2 expression is enriched in human intestine ACE2 regulates neutral amino acid (B0AT1) and glucose transporter (SGLT1) in intestinal epithelium Mucus secreted from GI cells may protect SARS-CoV-2 from harsh pH levels of the digestive juices Continued replication of SARS-CoV-2 in GI cells may cause disease recurrence Graphical Abstract","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Ashutosh; Faiq, Muneeb A.; Pareek, Vikas; Raza, Khursheed; Narayan, Ravi K.; Prasoon, Pranav; Kumar, Pavan; Kulandhasamy, Maheswari; Kumari, Chiman; Kant, Kamla; Singh, Himanshu N.; Qadri, Rizwana; Pandey, Sada N.; Kumar, Santosh","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6ef37731e49ce0e713330a4f14fd52c4ec66c14.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.040204","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GI","Graphical Abstract"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["High expression of ACE2","human intestine ACE2","binding receptor ACE2 expression","ACE2 enriched sites","protein expression","Tissue specific variation of ACE2 expression","replication of SARS","Highlights SARS-CoV","correlated expression","SARS-coronavirus","tissue specific expression","GI cells","digestive symptoms","glandular cells","digestive tract","ACE2 mediated dysregulation of sodium dependent glucose transporter","digestive system specific functional enrichment map of ACE2 gene","mucosal cells","digestive juices","digestive system organs","Introduction COVID","patients","pathogenesis of GI symptoms","lining epithelium","Continued replication","diabetes-associated mortality","intestinal epithelium Mucus","GB","SGLT1","small intestine","virus entry","pathophysiological basis","brush border epithelium","plausible basis","disease recurrence Graphical Abstract","data","pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus","S-spike","binds","help","Human Protein Atlas available","upper GIT components","organs potential sites","aforementioned collection of symptoms","sodium dependent nutrient transporters","positive sense single strand RNA virus","various components","RNA sequencing","imperative relevance","particular relevance","new strain of coronavirus","lower gastrointestinal tract","tongue","mouth cavity","B0AT1","neutral amino acid","oral mucosa","SLC5A1","gallbladder","harsh pH levels","salivary glands","intriguing issues","possible reason","healthy individuals","mRNA","findings","study","supportive evidence","IHC","immunohistochemistry","clinicians","literature","surface","studies","structure","liver","existing knowledge","viral diseases","esophagus","profiler","Cytoscape software","utility","colon","rectum","angiotensin","pancreas","enterocytes","version","stomach","Materials","Methods","enzyme","humans","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Predictor variables were R0 values established in the most recent literature (2.7 and 5.7), without lockdown and with coverages of 25%, 50%, and 90% for 21, 35, 70, and 140 days in 13 different scenarios for each R0, where individuals remained infected and transmitters for 14 days. We estimated model validity by applying an exponential model on the incidence curve with no lockdown, with growth rate coefficient observed in realistic scenarios. Pairwise comparisons were performed using Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni correction between peak amplitude, peak latency, and total number of cases for each R0 used. For R0=5.7, the flattening of the curve occurs only with long lockdown periods (70 and 140 days) with a 90% coverage. For R0=2.7, coverages of 25 and 50% also result in curve flattening and reduction of total cases, provided they occur for a long period (70 days or more).

Ours results demonstrate that the different official sources had a discrepancy of 209.23% between these data referring to the same period. There was also a 648.61% increase in SARS deaths in 2020, when compared to the average of previous years.

In conclusion, there is an underreporting of COVID-19 deaths in MG due to the unexplained excess of SARS deaths, Respiratory insufficiency and pneumonia compared to previous years.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alves, T.

Pakistani strain MT240479 (Gilgit1-Pak) was found in close proximity to MT184913 (CruiseA-USA), while the second Pakistani strain MT262993 (Manga-Pak) was neighboring to MT039887 (WI-USA) strain in the constructed cladogram in this article. Afterward, four whole genome SARS-nCoV2 strain sequences were taken for variant calling analysis, those who appeared nearest relative in the earlier cladogram constructed a week time ago. Among those two Pakistani strains each of 29,836 bases were compared against MT263429 from (WI-USA) of 29,889 bases and MT259229 (Wuhan-China) of 29,864 bases. We identified 31 variants in both Pakistani strains, (Manga-Pak vs USA=2del\u002B7SNPs, Manga-Pak vs Chinese=2del\u002B2SNPs, Gilgit1-Pak vs USA=10SNPs, Gilgit1-Pak vs Chinese=8SNPs), which caused alteration in ORF1ab, ORF1a and N genes with having functions of viral replication and translation, host innate immunity and viral capsid formation respectively. These novel variants are assumed to be liable for low mortality rate in Pakistan with 385 as compared to USA with 63,871 and China with 4,633 deaths by May 01, 2020. However functional effects of these variants need further confirmatory studies. Moreover, mutated N \u0026 ORF1a proteins in Pakistani strains were also analyzed by 3D structure modelling, which give another dimension of comparing these alterations at amino acid level. In a nutshell, these novel variants are assumed to be linked with reduced mortality of COVID-19 in Pakistan along with other influencing factors, these novel variants would also be useful to understand the virulence of this virus and to develop indigenous vaccines and therapeutics.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saif, Rashid; Mahmood, Tania; Ejaz, Aniqa","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aacf15584174ce5e41b81b43d08f36faffb5670f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.01.072942","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Gilgit1-Pak vs USA","Manga-Pak vs USA","SNPs","Pakistani strains","WI-USA","novel variants","Gilgit1-Pak vs Chinese","Manga-Pak vs Chinese","CruiseA-USA","Pakistani strain MT262993","Pakistani strain MT240479","bases","genome SARS-nCoV2 strain sequences","genome sequences","constructed cladogram","N genes","mutated N","ORF1a proteins","earlier cladogram","Wuhan-China","functions of viral replication","viral capsid formation","NCBI Virus database","low mortality rate","reduced mortality of COVID","host innate immunity","translation","close proximity","variant calling analysis","dimension","alterations","ORF1ab","MT184913","influencing factors","MT259229","MT039887","phylogenetic tree","amino acid level","D structure modelling","indigenous vaccines","week time","MT263429","functional effects","confirmatory studies","therapeutics","similarities","virulence","article","nutshell","deaths"],"language":"en"},

An initial step in estimating the impact of these changes is characterizing the patients, visits, and diagnoses for whom care is being delayed or deferred. Methods: We conducted an observational study, examining demographics and diagnoses for all patient visits to the ED of an urban Level-1 trauma center before and after the state declaration and compared them to visits from a similar period in 2019. We estimated the ratios of the before and after periods using Poisson regression, calculated the percent change with respect to 2019 for total ED visits, patient characteristics, and diagnoses, and then evaluated the interactions between each factor and the overall change in ED visits. Results: There was a significant 35.2% drop in overall ED visits after the state declaration. Disproportionate declines were seen in visits by pediatric and older patients, women, and Medicare recipients as well as for presentations of syncope, cerebrovascular accidents, urolithiasis, abdominal and back pain. Significantly disproportionate increases were seen in ED visits for potential symptoms of COVID-19, including URIs, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Conclusions: Patient concerns about health care settings and public health have significantly altered care-seeking during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall and differential declines in ED visits for certain demographic groups and disease processes should prompt efforts to encourage care-seeking and research to monitor for the morbidity and mortality that is likely to result from delayed or deferred care.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Westgard, B.

In this study, we describe the in vitro testing of CPZ against a SARS-CoV-2 isolate in monkey and human cells. We evidenced an antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 with an IC50 of \u223C10\u03BCM. Because of its high biodistribution in lung, saliva and brain, such IC50 measured in vitro may translate to CPZ dosage used in clinical routine. This extrapolation is in line with our observations of a higher prevalence of symptomatic and severe forms of COVID-19 infections among health care professionals compared to patients in psychiatric wards.

NP sampling requires the use of personal protective equipment that are in limited supply, is uncomfortable for the patient, and reduces clinical efficiency. This study explored the equivalency of patient-collected tongue, anterior nares (nasal), and mid-turbinate (MT) samples to health care worker-collected NP samples for detecting SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Patients presenting to five urgent care facilities with symptoms indicative of an upper respiratory infection provided self-collected samples from three anatomic sites along with a health care worker-collected NP sample. Using NP as the comparator, sensitivities and one-sided 95% confidence intervals for the tongue, nasal, and MT samples for detection of SARS-CoV-2 were calculated. Results: The sensitivity for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in patient-collected tongue, nasal, and mid-turbinate samples was 89.8% (95% CI: 80.2 -100.0), 94.0 (95% CI: 84.6-100.0) and 96.2 (95% CI: 87.7-100.0), respectively.

Conclusions: Patient-collected nasal and MT samples demonstrated high sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection using health care worker-collected NP samples as the comparator. Among patients testing positive with NP samples, nasal and MT Ct values demonstrated high correlations with those Ct values of the NP samples.

Risk models, public health experts and political leadership alike have given almost no attention to related, anticipated, and predictable societal and health impacts likely to result from behavioral responses to Covid-19 combined with the application of NPIs.

The evolution in time of the number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases of Covid-19 in China very well approximates a distribution of the type of the Error Function, that is, the integral of a normal, Gaussian distribution. We have then used such a function to study the potential evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy by performing a number of fits of the official data so far available. We then found a statistical prediction for the day in which the peak of the number of daily positive cases in Italy occurs, corresponding to the flex of the fit, i.e., to the change in sign of its second derivative (that is the change from acceleration to deceleration) as well as of the day in which a substantial attenuation of such number of daily cases is reached. We have then performed 150 Monte Carlo simulations in the attempt to have a more robust prediction of the day of the above-mentioned peak and of the day of the substantial decrease of the number of daily positive cases.

Since mid-March 2020, the number of confirmed cases has increased exponentially in the States, with 1.1 million confirmed cases, and 57.4 thousand deaths as of 30 April 2020. Even though some believe that this new lethal coronavirus does not show any partiality to the rich, previous epidemiological studies find that the poor in the US are more susceptible to the epidemics due to their limited access to preventive measures and crowded living conditions. In this study, we postulate that the rich is more susceptible to Covid-19 infection during the early stage before social distancing measures have been introduced. This may be attributed to the higher mobility (both inter- and intra-city), given their higher tendency to travel for business/education, and to more social interactions. However, we postulate after the lockdown/social distancing has been imposed, the infection among the rich may be reduced due to better living conditions. Further, the rich may be able to afford better medical treatment once infected, hence a relatively lower mortality. In contrast, without proper medical insurance coverage, the poor may be prevented from receiving timely and proper medical treatment, hence a higher mortality. Method: We will collect the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the US during the period of Jan 2020 to Apr 2020 from Johns Hopkins University, also the number of Covid-19 tests in the US from the health departments across the States. County-level socio-economic status (SES) including age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, education, occupation, employment status, immigration status, and housing price, will be collected from the US Census Bureau. State/county-level health conditions including the prevalence of chronic diseases will be collected from the US CDC. State/county-level movement data including international and domestic flights will be collected from the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics. We will also collect the periods of lockdown/social distancing. Regression models are constructed to examine the relationship between SES, and Covid-19 infection and mortality at the state/county-level before and after lockdown/social distancing, while accounting for Covid-19 testing capacities and co-morbidities. Expected Findings: We expect that there is a positive correlation between Covid-19 infection and SES at the state/county-level in the US before social distancing. In addition, we expect a negative correlation between Covid-19 mortality and SES.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Y.; Li, V. O. K.; Lam, J. C. K.; Guo, P.; Bai, R.; Fok, W. W.

A calibration process is executed through the solution of an inverse problem with the help of a Trust-Region-Reflective algorithm, used to determine the best parameter values that would fit the model response. The purpose of this study is to give a tentative prediction of the epidemic peak for Russia, Brazil, India and Bangladesh which could become the next COVID-19 hotspots in no time. Based on the publicly available epidemiological data from late January until 10 May, it has been estimated that the number of daily new symptomatic infectious cases for the above mentioned countries could reach the peak around the beginning of June with the peak size of {approx}15,774 symptomatic infectious cases in Russia, {approx}26,449 cases in Brazil, {approx}9,504 cases in India and {approx}2,209 cases in Bangladesh. Based on our analysis, the estimated value of the basic reproduction number (R0) as of May 11, 2020 was found to be {approx}4.234 in Russia, {approx}5.347 in Brazil, {approx}5.218 in India, {approx}4.649 in the United Kingdom and {approx}3.5 in Bangladesh. Moreover, with an aim to quantify the uncertainty of our model parameters, Latin hypercube sampling-partial rank correlation coefficient (LHS-PRCC) which is a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) method is applied which elucidates that, for Russia, the recovery rate of undetected asymptomatic carriers, the rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined and the transition rate from quarantined class to susceptible class are the most influential parameters, whereas the rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined and the inverse of the COVID-19 incubation period are highly sensitive parameters in Brazil, India, Bangladesh and the United Kingdom which could significantly affect the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. Our analysis also suggests that relaxing social distancing restrictions too quickly could exacerbate the epidemic outbreak in the above mentioned countries.","publish_time":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nabi, K.

This study shows that the addition of age and a minimal set of common blood tests taken in patients on admission to hospital significantly improves the National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) for risk-stratification of severe COVID disease. Objective: To supplement the NEWS2 score with a small number of easily obtained additional demographic, physiological and blood variables indicative of severity of COVID-19 infection. Design: Retrospective observational cohort with internal and temporal held-out external validation. Setting: Acute secondary care. Participants: 708 patients admitted to an acute multi-site UK NHS hospital with confirmed COVID-19 disease from 1st March to 5th April 2020. Intervention: Not applicable. Main outcome and measures: The primary outcome was patient status at 14 days after symptom onset categorised as severe disease (WHO-COVID-19 Outcomes Scales 6-8: i.e. transferred to intensive care unit or death). 218 of the 708 patients reached the primary end point. A range of physiological and blood biomarkers were assessed for their association with the primary outcome. Adjustments included age, gender, ethnicity and comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, heart, respiratory and kidney diseases). Results: NEWS2 total score was a weak predictor for severity of COVID-19 infection at 14 days (internally validated AUC = 0.628). The addition of age and common blood tests (CRP, neutrophil count, estimated GFR and albumin) provided substantial improvements to a risk stratification model but performance was still only moderate (AUC = 0.75). Common comorbidities hypertension, diabetes, heart, respiratory and kidney diseases have minor additional predictive value. Conclusions and relevance: Adding age and a minimal set of common blood parameters to NEWS2 improves the risk stratification of patients likely to develop severe COVID-19 outcomes. The addition of a few common parameters is likely to be much easier to implement in a short time-scale than a novel risk-scoring system.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carr, E.; Bendayan, R.; O\u0027Gallagher, K.; Bean, D.; Pickles, A.; Stahl, D.; Zakeri, R.; Searle, T.; Shek, A.; Kraljevic, Z.; Teo, J.

Genetic variants, such as polymorphisms of the GST gene and other genes, may increase the risk of experiencing such toxicity events. This systematic review and meta-analysis provides a comprehensive evaluation of the evidence base for associations between variants of the GST gene and other genes and toxicity outcomes related to anti-TB drugs. Methods We searched for relevant studies in MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, BIOSIS and Web of Science. We pooled effect estimates for each genotype on each outcome, and stratified all analyses by country. We qualitatively assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. Results We included data from 28 distinct cohorts of patients in the review. The methodological quality of included studies was variable, with several important areas of concern. For GSTM1, patients with the homozygous null genotype were significantly more likely to experience hepatotoxicity than patients with heterozygous or homozygous present genotype (odds ratio [OR]=1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15, 1.82). Moderate heterogeneity was observed in this analysis (I2=51.2%). No significant difference was observed for the GSTT1 null polymorphism. For the rs3814057 polymorphism of the PXR gene, both heterozygous genotype and homozygous mutant-type significantly increased hepatotoxicity risk compared with homozygous wild-type (heterozygous versus homozygous wild-type: OR=1.98, 95% CI 1.06, 3.69; I2=0%; homozygous mutant-type versus homozygous wild-type: OR=2.18, 95% CI 1.07, 4.44; I2=0%). Conclusions We found that it is challenging to perform robust synthesis of the evidence base for associations between GST and other genetic variants and toxicity related to anti-TB drugs. We identified significant associations between the GSTM1 null and PXR rs3814057 polymorphisms and ATDH. To the best of our knowledge, no meta-analyses on genetic variants other than variants of the NAT2, CYP2E1, GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes have been published.

However, current bioaerosol sampling approaches have reported low detection yields in sputum-positive TB cases. To increase the utility of bioaerosol sampling, we present advances in bioaerosol collection and Mtb identification that improve detection yields. Methods: A previously described Respiratory Aerosol Sampling Chamber (RASC) protocol, or \u0027RASC-1\u0027, was modified to incorporate liquid collection of bioaerosol using a high-flow wet-walled cyclone (RASC-2). Individuals with GeneXpert-positive pulmonary TB were sampled pre-treatment over 60-minutes. Putative Mtb bacilli were detected in collected fluid by fluorescence microscopy utilising DMN-Trehalose. Exhaled air and bioaerosol volumes were estimated using continuous CO2 monitoring and airborne particle counting, respectively. Mtb capture was calculated per exhaled air volume sampled and bioaerosol volume for RASC-1 (n=35) and for RASC-2 (n=21). Empty chamber samples were collected between patients as controls. Results: The optimised RASC-2 protocol sampled a median of 258.4L (IQR: 226.9-273.6) of exhaled air per patient compared with 27.5L (IQR: 23.6-30.3) for RASC-1 (p\u003C0.0001). Bioaerosol volume collection was estimated at 2.3nL (IQR: 1.1-3.6) for RASC-2 compared with 0.08nL (IQR: 0.05-0.10) for RASC-1 (p\u003C0.0001). The detection yield of viable Mtb improved from 43% (median 2 CFU, range: 1-14) to 95% (median 20.5 DMN-Trehalose positive bacilli, range: 2-155). These improvements represent a lowering of the limit of detection in the RASC-2 platform to 0.9 Mtb bacilli per 100L of exhaled air from 3.3 Mtb bacilli per 100L (RASC-1). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that technical improvements in particle collection together with sensitive detection enable rapid quantitation of viable Mtb in bioaerosols of sputum positive TB cases.

Dumfries and Galloway (D\u0026G) has seen fewer hospitalised cases than predicted. We wondered whether this might be related at least in part to population density. Methods We compared Covid-19 hospitalisation rates/100,000 population in D\u0026G with those of the other 10 mainland Scottish health boards. We chose two time points: 19th April which was the peak of the pandemic in Scotland and 15th May, seven and a half weeks after lockdown. We used chi square and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals to test for differences in hospitalisation rates and Pearson correlation coefficient to examine the relation between hospitalisation rates and population density. Population density for each health board was provided by National Records of Scotland. Results Hospitalisation in D\u0026G was 13.4/100,000 on 19th April, falling to 1.3/100,000 by 15th May. Corresponding hospitalisation rates in Greater Glasgow \u0026 Clyde (GGC) were 50.1/100,000 and 38.9/100,000. Compared to GGC, hospitalisation rates in D\u0026G were 3 times lower at peak (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.17, 0.42) and 30 times lower by 15th May (OR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01, 0.14). Hospitalisation rates for the other health boards lay in between values recorded for D\u0026G and GGC and fell in 10 of the 11 boards between these two dates. There was a positive association between hospitalisation rate and population density (r=0.756, p=0.007 on 19th April and r=0.840, p\u003C0.001 for 15th May). Conclusion We have confirmed there are large differences in Covid-19 hospitalisation rates across the 11 mainland Scottish health boards, that are in part related to population density. These data support a regional rather than one nation approach to easing Covid-19 restrictions.","publish_time":"2020-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rideout, A.; Murray, C.; Isles, C.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7e4e91f65cce26c36d9731cd062489e748fdded.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.22.20110163v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Galloway"],"organizations":["National Records","Greater Glasgow \u0026 Clyde","GGC"],"locations":["Dumfries","Scotland"],"keyphrases":["Corresponding hospitalisation rates","population density","Results Hospitalisation","mainland Scottish health boards","GGC","easing Covid","Background Covid","peak","times","large differences","National Records of Scotland","Greater Glasgow","Pearson correlation coefficient","odds ratios","Clyde","nation approach","confidence intervals","positive association","values","virus activity","fewer hospitalised cases","parts","chi square","restrictions","Dumfries","Galloway","half weeks","lockdown","United Kingdom","pandemic","Methods","time points","data","Conclusion","dates"],"language":"en"},

In this work we focus on the evolution of the COVID-19 in one of the most populous Brazilian states, namely the Rio de Janeiro state. The first case was reported in March 5, 2020, thus we have a considerable amount of available data to make a good analysis. We study the dynamics of COVID-19 through a Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) model with an additional mechanism that represents the implementation of public policies of social isolation. Based on the data collected from the Rio de Janeiro state Department of Health from March 5, 2020 through April 26, 2020, we observed that the implementation of social distancing policies changed the initial exponential growth to a sub-exponential one. The SIQR model with the above-mentioned mechanism is capable of reproducing the data of confirmed cases in Rio de Janeiro, and it explains how that change occurred. The model also predicts an important mitigation effect, namely the flattening effect, i.e., the considerably decrease of the maximum number of confirmed cases. Through the results of the model, this effect can be directly related to the social isolation policies. Finally, we consider the relaxation of such policies, and discuss about the ideal period of time to release people to return to their activities.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crokidakis, Nuno","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/458054c61e3953738cddf1b9cc4520ac5389c021.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077920303295; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920303295?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIQR"],"locations":["Rio de Janeiro"],"keyphrases":["social isolation policies","SIQR model","implementation of social distancing policies","implementation of public policies of social isolation","data of confirmed cases","available data","flattening effect","Janeiro state Department of Health","important mitigation effect","sub-exponential","above-mentioned mechanism","additional mechanism","maximum number of confirmed cases","dynamics of COVID","initial exponential growth","people","ideal period of time","populous Brazilian states","good analysis","evolution","Susceptible-Infectious","results","recent Coronavirus","work","activities","relaxation","world","change"],"language":"en"},

Their appropriate use and interpretation require accurate assay performance data. Method: We conducted an evaluation of 10 lateral flow assays (LFAs) and two ELISAs to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The specimen set comprised 130 plasma or serum samples from 80 symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive individuals; 108 pre-COVID-19 negative controls; and 52 recent samples from individuals who underwent respiratory viral testing but were not diagnosed with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Samples were blinded and LFA results were interpreted by two independent readers, using a standardized intensity scoring system. Results: Among specimens from SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive individuals, the percent seropositive increased with time interval, peaking at 81.8-100.0% in samples taken \u003E20 days after symptom onset. Test specificity ranged from 84.3-100.0% in pre-COVID-19 specimens. Specificity was higher when weak LFA bands were considered negative, but this decreased sensitivity. IgM detection was more variable than IgG, and detection was highest when IgM and IgG results were combined. Agreement between ELISAs and LFAs ranged from 75.8-94.8%. No consistent cross-reactivity was observed. Conclusion: Our evaluation showed heterogeneous assay performance. Reader training is key to reliable LFA performance, and can be tailored for survey goals. Informed use of serology will require evaluations covering the full spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infections, from asymptomatic and mild infection to severe disease, and later convalescence. Well-designed studies to elucidate the mechanisms and serological correlates of protective immunity will be crucial to guide rational clinical and public health policies.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Whitman, Jeffrey D.; Hiatt, Joseph; Mowery, Cody T.; Shy, Brian R.; Yu, Ruby; Yamamoto, Tori N.; Rathore, Ujjwal; Goldgof, Gregory M.; Whitty, Caroline; Woo, Jonathan M; Gallman, Antonia E.; Miller, Tyler E.; Levine, Andrew G.; Nguyen, David N.; Bapat, Sagar P.; Balcerek, Joanna; Bylsma, Sophia; Lyons, Ana M.; Li, Stacy; Wong, Allison Wai-yi; Gillis-Buck, Eva Mae; Steinhart, Zachary B.; Lee, Youjin; Apathy, Ryan; Lipke, Mitchell J.; Smith, Jennifer A.; Zheng, Tina; Boothby, Ian C.; Isaza, Erin; Chan, Jackie; Acenas, Dante D; Lee, Jinwoo; Macrae, Trisha A.; Kyaw, Than S.; Wu, David; Ng, Dianna L.; Gu, Wei; York, Vanessa A.; Eskandarian, Haig A.; Callaway, Perri C.; Warrier, Lakshmi; Moreno, Mary E.; Levan, Justine; Torres, Leonel; Farrington, Lila; Loudermilk, Rita; Koshal, Kanishka; Zorn, Kelsey C.; Garcia-Beltran, Wilfredo F.; Yang, Diane; Astudillo, Michael G.; Bernstein, Bradley E.; Gelfand, Jeffrey A.; Ryan, Edward T.; Charles, Richelle C.; Iafrate, A.

These actions were not coordinated at the national level, which raises the question of what might have happened if they were. It also creates an opportunity to use spatial and temporal variation to measure their effect with greater accuracy. Methods We combine publicly available data sources on the timing of stay-at-home orders and daily confirmed COVID-19 cases at the county level in the United States (N = 132,048). We then derive from the classic SIR model a two-way fixed-effects model and apply it to the data with controls for unmeasured differences between counties and over time. This enables us to estimate the effect of stay-at-home orders while accounting for local variation in factors like health systems and demographics, and temporal variation in national mitigation actions, access to tests, or exposure to media reports that could influence the course of the disease. Findings Mean county-level daily growth in COVID-19 infections peaked at 17.2% just before stay-at-home orders were issued. Two way fixed-effects regression estimates suggest that orders were associated with a 3.8 percentage point (95% CI 0.7 to 8.6) reduction in the growth rate after one week and an 8.6 percentage point (3.0 to 14.1) reduction after two weeks. By day 22 the reduction (18.2 percentage points, 12.3 to 24.0) had surpassed the growth at the peak, indicating that growth had turned negative and the number of new daily infections was beginning to decline. A hypothetical national stay-at-home order issued on March 13, 2020 when a national emergency was declared might have reduced cumulative county infections by 62.3%, and might have helped to reverse exponential growth in the disease by April 5. Interpretation Although stay-at-home orders impose great costs to society, delayed responses and piecemeal application of these orders generate similar costs without obtaining the full potential benefits suggested by this analysis. The results here suggest that a coordinated nationwide stay-at-home order may have reduced by hundreds of thousands the current number of infections and by thousands the total number of deaths from COVID-19. Future efforts in the United States and elsewhere to control pandemics should coordinate stay-at-home orders at the national level, especially for diseases for which local spread has already occurred and testing availability is delayed. Since stay-at-home orders reduce infection growth rates, early implementation when infection counts are still low would be most beneficial.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fowler, James H.; Hill, Seth J.; Obradovich, Nick; Levin, Remy","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ffc89e44a87368bb3ad64b4b20ca4f18e5241119.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063628","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs3NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["effect of stay-at-home orders","timing of stay-at-home orders","national level","county-level daily growth","hypothetical national stay-at-home order","county level","exponential growth","coordinated nationwide stay-at-home order","infection growth rates","United States","national emergency","reduction","number of new daily infections","daily confirmed COVID","current number of infections","national mitigation actions","cumulative county infections","temporal variation","local variation","coronavirus disease","percentage points","two-way fixed-effects model","total number of deaths","great costs","infection counts","similar costs","health systems","hundreds of thousands","local spread","delayed responses","classic SIR model","available data sources","public health authorities","effects regression estimates","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","society","tests","early implementation","piecemeal application","factors","access","demographics","accounting","hospitalizations","unmeasured differences","cases","counties","media reports","exposure","controls","SARS-CoV","transmission","diseases","Interpretation","Findings","pandemics","potential benefits","time","Methods","course","opportunity","Future efforts","testing availability","greater accuracy","analysis","results","day","question","peak","weeks","Background"],"language":"en"},

As countries reach the infection peak, it is planned to return a new normal under different coexistence conditions in order to reduce the economic effects produced by the total or partial closure of companies, universities, shops, etc. Under such circumstances, the use of mathematical models to evaluate the transmission risk of COVID-19 in various facilities represents an important tool in assisting authorities to make informed decisions. On the other hand, agent-based modeling is a relatively new approach to model complex systems composed of agents whose behavior is described using simple rules. Different from classical mathematical models (which consider a homogenous population), agent-based approaches model individuals with distinct characteristics and provide more realistic results. In this paper, an agent-based model to evaluate the COVID-19 transmission risks in facilities is presented. The proposed scheme has been designed to simulate the spatiotemporal transmission process. In the model, simulated agents make decisions depending on the programmed rules. Such rules correspond to spatial patterns and infection conditions under which agents interact to characterize the transmission process. The model also includes an individual profile for each agent, which defines its main social characteristics and health conditions used during its interactions. In general, this profile partially determines the behavior of the agent during its interactions with other individuals. Several hypothetical scenarios have been considered to show the performance of the proposed model. Experimental results have demonstrated that the simulations provide useful information to produce strategies for reducing the transmission risks of COVID-19 within the facilities.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cuevas, Erik","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8bc19d9b3b1fe959c9cbd01d2edbf7cb84eaa6b6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S001048252030192X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001048252030192X?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs3NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["proposed model","transmission risks of COVID","agent-based approaches model individuals","transmission risk of COVID","agent-based modeling","model complex systems","spatiotemporal transmission process","infection conditions","health conditions","different coexistence conditions","simulated agents","behavior","various facilities","countries","programmed rules","simple rules","interactions","use of mathematical models","classical mathematical models","distinct characteristics","new approach","informed decisions","infection peak","realistic results","individual profile","Experimental results","proposed scheme","main social characteristics","order","partial closure of companies","total","simulations","strategies","homogenous population","important tool","spatial patterns","shops","universities","economic effects","authorities","coronavirus disease","circumstances","rapid spread","useful information","hand","paper","global threat","performance","hypothetical scenarios","world"],"language":"en"},

Specialized chemosensory epithelial cells that express the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 5 (TRPM5) are found throughout the airways and intestinal epithelium and are involved in responses to viral infection. Herein we performed deep transcriptional profiling of olfactory epithelial cells sorted by flow cytometry based on the expression of fluorescent protein markers for olfactory sensory neurons and TRPM5. We find profuse expression of transcripts involved in inflammation, immunity and viral infection in TRPM5-expressing microvillous cells and olfactory sensory neurons.

URT specimens that tested negative by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR displayed higher GUSB RT-PCR cycle thresholds (CT) (P=0.070) than those testing positive (median, 30.7; range, 27.0-40.0, and median 29.7; range 25.5-36.8, respectively), this reflecting poorer cellularity. Receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve analysis indicated that a CT threshold of 31.2 discriminated best between positive and negative SARS CoV-2 RT-PCRs (area under a curve, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50-0.81; P=0.08).

There is a diverse range of SARS-CoV-2 detection rates in reported studies, with uncertainty as to the optimal sampling strategy for COVID-19 diagnosis and monitoring. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing respiratory sampling strategies for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The inclusion criteria were studies that assessed at least two respiratory sampling sites (oropharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal swab, and sputum) in participants with COVID-19. The percentage positive tests were compared between sampling modalities by constructing a Z-test assuming independence and using the standard errors obtained from the random effects meta-analysis. Findings: From 1039 total studies, we identified 11 studies that met our inclusion criteria, with SARS-CoV-2 testing results from a total of 3442 respiratory tract specimens. Compared to nasopharyngeal swab sampling, sputum testing resulted in significantly higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection while oropharyngeal swab testing had lower rates of viral RNA detection. Earlier sampling after symptom onset was associated with improved detection rates, but the differences in SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by sampling method was consistent regardless of the duration of symptoms. Interpretation: The results support sputum sampling as a primary method of COVID-19 diagnosis and monitoring, and highlight the importance of early testing after symptom onset to increase the rates of COVID-19 diagnosis.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mohammadi, A.; Esmaeilzadeh, E.; Li, Y.; Bosch, R.

Abstract A review of the evidence on epidemiology, risk factors, etiology and clinical-etiological profile of acute bronchiolitis is presented. The frequency estimates are very heterogeneous; in the population under two years the frequency of admission for bronchiolitis is between 1 and 3.5%, primary care consultations between 4 and 20% and emergency visits between 1 and 2%. The frequency of admissions for respiratory infection by respiratory syncytial virus in the risk population is: in premature infants \u226432 weeks of gestation between 4.4 and 18%, in patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia between 7.3 and 42%, and in infants with congenital heart disease between 1.6 and 9.8%. The main risk factors are: prematurity, chronic lung disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital heart disease and age less than 3\u20136 months at onset of the epidemic. Other factors are: older siblings or day care attendance, male gender, exposure to smoking, breastfeeding for less than 1\u20132 months and variables associated with lower socioeconomic status. Respiratory syncytial virus is the dominant etiological agent, constituting just over half the cases (median 56%; interval 27% to 73%). Other viruses implicated, in descending order of frequency, are rhinovirus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, influenza viruses, parainfluenza, enterovirus and bocavirus. In studies with genomic detection techniques, between 20 and 25% of cases the virus involved is not identified and between 9% and 27% of cases have viral co-infection. Although respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis shows more wheezing and retractions, longer duration of respiratory symptoms and oxygen therapy and are associated with lower use of antibiotics. This pattern is associated with the younger age of the patients and does not help us to predict the etiology. In general, the etiological identification is not useful for the management of patients. However, in young infants (\u003C3 months) with febrile bronchiolitis in the hospital environment, conservative management may help these patients and avoid diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.","publish_time":"2010-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ochoa Sangrador, C.; Gonz\u00E1lez de Dios, J.","journal":"Anales de Pediatr\u00EDa","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb123177b2d18f98c6cb4d26c3d1d3b88adc6136.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1695403310000020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1695403310000020","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs5MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["of cases the virus","enterovirus and bocavirus","not identified and between","and emergency visits between","wheezing and retractions","etiology and clinical","longer duration of respiratory symptoms and oxygen therapy and","and in infants with congenital heart","of antibiotics","and age less than","virus respiratorio sincitial","virus implicados","The frequency of admissions for respiratory infection by respiratory syncytial virus in the risk population","weeks of gestation between","of acute bronchiolitis","in descending order of frequency","in the population under two years the frequency of admission for bronchiolitis","months at onset of the epidemic","The main risk factors","in patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia between","months and variables associated with lower socioeconomic status","Abstract A review of the evidence on epidemiology","Although respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis shows","the dominant etiological agent","of cases have viral co","in premature infants","constituting just over half the cases","primary care consultations between","casos","trabajo respiratorio","Other factors","frecuencia de ingresos","poblaci\u00F3n de riesgo","menor edad","estimaciones de frecuencia","poblaci\u00F3n menor","bronquiolitis febriles","bronquiolitis aguda","with genomic detection","principales factores de riesgo","breastfeeding for less than","or bronchopulmonary dysplasia","dichos pacientes","parainfluenza","adenovirus","displasia broncopulmonar","metapneumovirus","etiolog\u00EDa","menor uso de antibi\u00F3ticos","variables asociadas","manejo conservador","coinfecci\u00F3n viral","older siblings or day care attendance","agente etiol\u00F3gico dominante","male gender","exposure","prematurity","very heterogeneous","smoking","prematuridad","chronic lung","rhinovirus","infecci\u00F3n respiratoria","sexo masculino","asistencia a guarder\u00EDa","datos","perfil cl\u00EDnico","rinovirus","implicated","mayor duraci\u00F3n de s\u00EDntomas","exposici\u00F3n a tabaco","cardiopat\u00EDas cong\u00E9nitas","enfermedad pulmonar","inicio","oxigenoterapia","cara","evidencia","epidemiolog\u00EDa","orden descendente","gripe","procedimientos diagn\u00F3stico","hermanos mayores","medio hospitalario","t\u00E9cnicas de detecci\u00F3n gen\u00F3mica","identificaci\u00F3n etiol\u00F3gica","bajo nivel socioecon\u00F3mico","presented","lactancia materna","revisi\u00F3n","epidemia inferior","mediana","lactantes peque\u00F1os","consultas","Atenci\u00F3n Primaria","general","semanas de gestaci\u00F3n","Resumen","estudios","mitad","intervalo","ni\u00F1os","Urgencias","cardi\u00F3patas","associated with the younger age of the patients and","the etiological identification","predict the etiology","not useful for the management of patients","bronchiolitis in the hospital environment","In general","conservative management may help these patients and avoid diagnostic and therapeutic","not help us","in young infants","months","This pattern","However"],"language":"es"},

Based on the simulation results, we recommend the following: (i) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift duration; (ii) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and the patients, e.g., less than 40 minutes for the whole day; (iii) increase the clean and safe space for social distancing, e.g., maximum of 10% crowd density, and if possible, implement compartmentalization of patients; and/or (iv) provide effective protective gears and facilities, e.g., 95% effective, that the frontline health care workers can use during their shift.

Much focus at the beginning of the UK\u0027s Covid-19 epidemic was directed to deficiencies in the national testing capacity. The quantity of tests may seem an important focus, but other characteristics are likely more germane. False positive tests are more probable than positive tests when the overall population has a low prevalence of the disease, even with highly accurate tests. Methods: We modify an SIR model to include quarantines states and test performance using publicly accessible estimates for the current situation. Three scenarios for cessation of lock-down measures are explored: (1) immediate end of lock-down measures, (2) continued lock-down with antibody testing based immunity passports, and (3) incremental relaxation of lock-down measures with active viral testing. Sensitivity, specifcity, prevalence and test capacity are modified for both active viral and antibody testing to determine their population level effect on the continuing epidemic. Findings: Diagnostic uncertainty can have a large effect on the epidemic dynamics of Covid-19 within the UK. The dynamics of the epidemic are more sensitive to test performance and targeting than test capacity. The quantity of tests is not a substitute for an effective strategy. Poorly targeted testing has the propensity to exacerbate the peak in infections. Interpretation: The assessment that \u0027no test is better than a bad test\u0027 is broadly supported by the present analysis. Antibody testing is unlikely to be a solution to the lock-down, regardless of test quality or capacity. A well designed active viral testing strategy combined with incremental relaxation of the lock-down measures is shown to be a potential strategy to restore some social activity whilst continuing to keep infections low.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gray, Nicholas; Calleja, Dominic; Wimbush, Alex; Miralles-Dolz, Enrique; Gray, Ander; De-Angelis, Marco; Derrer-Merk, Elfride; Oparaji, Bright Uchenna; Stepanov, Vladimir; Clearkin, Louis; Ferson, Scott","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef2437662b67cdda4429985f52c1db7384cd578f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.16.20067884v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs5MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["test capacity","antibody testing","measures","effective testing strategy","test performance","targeted testing","cessation of lock","national testing capacity","bad test","test quality","designed active viral testing strategy","incremental relaxation of lock","quantity of tests","accurate tests","continuing epidemic","effective strategy","immediate end of lock","False positive tests","epidemic dynamics of Covid","potential strategy","low prevalence","infections low","population level effect","overall population","large effect","UK\u0027s Covid","important focus","accessible estimates","quarantines states","SIR model","social activity","characteristics","Diagnostic uncertainty","propensity","disease","specifcity","substitute","deficiencies","immunity passports","current situation","beginning","assessment","Sensitivity","solution","Findings","Methods","peak","Background","scenarios","present analysis","Interpretation"],"language":"en"},

This survey study sought to identify practice changes, understand current personal protection equipment (PPE) use, and determine how caring for patients with COVID-19 differs for vascular surgeons practicing in states with high COVID-19 case numbers versus low case numbers. Methods A fourteen-question online survey regarding the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on vascular surgeons\u2019 current practice was sent to 365 vascular surgeons across the country via REDCap from 4/14/2020 to 4/21/2020 with responses closed on 4/23/2020. The survey response was analyzed with descriptive statistics. Further analyses were performed to evaluate whether responses from states with the highest number of COVID-19 cases (New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and California) differed from those with lower case numbers (all other states). Results A total of 121 vascular surgeon responded (30.6%) to the survey. All high-volume states were represented. The majority of vascular surgeons are reusing PPE The majority of respondents worked in an academic setting (81.5%) and were performing only urgent and emergent cases (80.5%) during preparation for the surge. This did not differ between high case and low COVID case states (p=0.285). High case states were less likely to perform a lower extremity intervention for critical limb ischemia (60.8% vs. 77.5%, p=0.046), but otherwise case types did not differ. Most attendings work with residents (90.8%) and limited their exposure to procedures on suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases (56.0%). Thirty-eight percent of attendings have been redeployed within the hospital to a vascular access service, and/or other service outside of vascular surgery. This was more frequent in high case volume states compared to low case volume states (p=0.039). The majority of vascular surgeons are reusing PPE (71.4%) and N95 masks (86.4%), and 21% of vascular surgeons feel that they do not have adequate PPE to perform clinical their duties. Conclusion The initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in reduced elective cases with primarily only urgent and emergent cases being performed. A minority of vascular surgeons have been redeployed outside of their specialty, however, this is more common among states with high case numbers. Adequate PPE remains an issue for almost a quarter of vascular surgeons who responded to this survey.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Latz, Christopher A.; Boitano, Laura T.; Png, C.

Extensive air-space opacities, subcutaneous emphysema and a small amount of pneumothorax were found in his chest X-ray scan. Echocardiography showed left ventricular enlargement with ejection fraction 20%. DIAGNOSIS This resident of Wuhan with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection had chronic pulmonary and cardiac diseases. Liver dysfunction, myocardial injury, and coagulation disorder were suggested by laboratory findings. Pneumonia, subcutaneous emphysema, and pneumothorax were confirmed with chest X-ray. Heart failure was revealed by echocardiography. INTERVENTIONS He was transferred to intensive care unit, where invasive ventilation was used for him during the whole hospitalization. Prone position ventilation, vasoconstrictor, antibacteria, and antiviral therapy were given. OUTCOMES He died on the twelfth day after admission. CONCLUSIONS Subcutaneous emphysema and pneumothorax may occur in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and chronic pulmonary disease. Chronic cardiac disease might be aggravated by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and develop heart failure.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiang, Chunlin; Wu, Gang","journal":"Medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000020208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32443345/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs5ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","pneumothorax","CONCLUSIONS Subcutaneous emphysema","pneumonia","PATIENT CONCERNS Subcutaneous emphysema","infection","uncommon complications of SARS","fatal case of SARS","chronic pulmonary disease","Chronic cardiac disease","Echocardiography","chest X-ray scan","Heart failure","bilateral chest walls","invasive ventilation","laboratory findings","cardiac diseases","Prone position ventilation","abdomen wall","neck","vasoconstrictor","antibacteria","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","groin area","coagulation disorder","scrotum","myocardial injury","left ventricular enlargement","Extensive air-space opacities","intensive care unit","ejection fraction","end","patients","Liver dysfunction","resident of Wuhan","antiviral therapy","DIAGNOSIS","day","year-old man","INTERVENTIONS","population","OUTCOMES","admission","world","INTRODUCTION","hospitalization"],"language":"en"},

The aim of the study was to validate three DSs (Hasegawa, Halls and Kawaguchi) and compare their ability to predict technical difficulty and postoperative outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients who underwent LLR from January 2006 to January 2019 were analyzed. Exclusion criteria were cyst fenestrations, thermal ablation, missing data for the computation of the DS and a follow-up \u003C 90 days. RESULTS The population comprised 300 patients. The DS distribution in the study population was: Halls low 55 (18.3%), moderate 82 (27.3%), high 111 (37%) and extremely high 52 (17.3%); Hasegawa low 130 (43.3%), medium 105 (35%) and high 65 (21.7%); Kawaguchi Grade I 194 (64.7%), Grade II 47 (15.7%) and Grade III 59 (19.7%). Hasegawa and Kawaguchi showed the strongest correlation (r = 0.798, p \u003C 0.001). Technical complexity, evaluated using the Pringle maneuver, Pringle time, blood loss and operative time, increased significantly with Hasegawa and Kawaguchi score classes (p \u003C 0.001 for all comparisons). None of the scores properly stratified postoperative complications. The highest Kawaguchi (23.7% grade III vs. 13.7% grades I and II, p = 0.057) and Hasegawa (24.6% high vs. 13.2% low/medium, p = 0.025) classes had a higher overall morbidity rate than medium-low ones. CONCLUSIONS Kawaguchi and Hasegawa scores predicted LLR\u0027s technical difficulty. None of the scores discriminated the postoperative complication risk of low classes compared with medium ones.","publish_time":"2020-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Russolillo, Nadia; Maina, Cecilia; Fleres, Francesco; Langella, Serena; Lo Tesoriere, Roberto; Ferrero, Alessandro","journal":"Surgical endoscopy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-07345-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31950272/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjsy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hasegawa","III"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Hasegawa low","Hasegawa scores","Kawaguchi Grade","medium-low ones","CONCLUSIONS Kawaguchi","Halls low","highest Kawaguchi","Kawaguchi score classes","LLR\u0027s technical difficulty","BACKGROUND Difficulty scores","medium ones","postoperative complication risk of low classes","Technical complexity","Pringle time","postoperative outcomes","DSs","study population","patients","stratified postoperative complications","Pringle maneuver","operative time","DS distribution","higher overall morbidity rate","thermal ablation","cyst fenestrations","blood loss","missing data","computation","Exclusion criteria","laparoscopic liver resection","strongest correlation","surgical safety","ability","follow-up","METHODS","MATERIALS","days","grades","aim","comparisons"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to examine the effect of radiation (method, dose, and dose rate) on the acid value (AV), peroxide value (PV), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) content, and fatty acid profile of fresh and freeze-dried largemouth bass fleshes. RESULTS The AV, PV and TBARS presented dose dependent increase in fish meat for both cobalt-60 (60 Co) and electron beam (EB) irradiation. With a 6 kGy of radiation, all measured indices in 60 Co group were significantly higher than those in EB group (P\u003C0.05 or P\u003C0.01). With a 3 kGy of radiation, the AV, PV and TBARS in 200 Gy/min dose rate group were significantly lower than those in 2 Gy/min and 80 Gy/min groups (P\u003C0.05). After 60 Co irradiation, the AV, PV and TBARS in most of fresh samples were significantly higher than those in freeze-dried samples (P\u003C0.01). And 60 Co radiation decreased the unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) content in fresh samples and increased the UFA content in freeze-dried samples. Our study indicated that 60 Co irradiation, particularly at a low dose rate, accelerated lipid oxidation in fish meat. A large amount of muscle moisture enhances the amount of UFA loss in fish meat during 60 Co irradiation. CONCLUSION Low dose (3 kGy) of EB irradiation, high dose rate (200 Gy/min) of 60 Co irradiation or freeze-drying treatment can alleviate the lipid oxidation of largemouth bass meat.

METHODS Constant, intermittent, and stepping-down SD strategies were modeled at 4 mean magnitudes (5%, 10 %, 15 % and 20 %), 2 time windows (40-days, 80-days), and 2 levels of personal caution (30 % and 50 %). RESULTS The stepping-down strategy was the best long-term SD strategy to minimize the peak number of active COVID-19 cases and associated deaths. The stepping-down strategy also resulted in a reduction in total time required to SD over a two-year period by 6.5 % compared to an intermittent or constant SD strategy. An 80-day SD time-window was statistically more effective in maintaining control over the COVID-19 pandemic than a 40-day window. However, the results were dependent upon 50 % of people being cautious (engaging in personal protection measures). CONCLUSION If people exercise caution while in public by protecting themselves (e.g., wearing a facemask, proper hand hygiene and avoid agglomeration) the magnitude and duration of SD necessary to maintain control over the pandemic can be reduced. Our models suggest that the most effective way to reduce SD over a two-year period is a stepping-down approach every 80 days. According to our model, this method would prevent a second peak and the number of intensive care units needed per day would be within the threshold of those currently available.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kennedy, Deanna M; Zambrano, Gustavo Jos\u00E9; Wang, Yiyu; Neto, Osmar Pinto","journal":"Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32442758/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SD strategies","stepping","constant SD strategy","day SD time-window","best long-term SD strategy","duration of SD necessary","days","day window","personal protection measures","peak number of active COVID","control","levels of personal caution","total time","two-year period","people","pandemic","time windows","results","effective way","METHODS Constant","number of intensive care units","agglomeration","cases","proper hand hygiene","social distancing","reduction","associated deaths","transmission dynamics","facemask","effects of continuous","approach","mean magnitudes","OBJECTIVES","models","threshold","CONCLUSION","public"],"language":"en"},

METHODS Between 2016 and 2019, a single surgeon performed RAPN for 128 patients with clinical T1a-b renal tumors at our institution, and the 70 most recent patients were included in this study to minimize the effects of surgical experience. PNF was defined as a fatty area around the kidney within the anatomical structures, including the lateroconal fascia, fusion fascia, psoas muscle, lumbar quadrate muscle and diaphragm, and its volume was calculated based on reconstructed three-dimensional computed tomography images using the SYNAPSE VINCENT system. RESULTS In this series, the trifecta and MIC (margin, ischemia and complications) score system outcomes were achieved in 69 (98.6%) and 64 patients (91.4%), respectively. The median PNF volume in the 70 patients was 166.05 cm3, which was significantly correlated with both the body mass index (BMI) and Mayo adhesive probability (MAP) score (correlation coefficient = 0.68 and 0.74, respectively). There was no significant difference in the R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score, PNF volume or console time during RAPN among 5 groups consisting of 14 consecutive patients. Of several factors examined, the console time was significantly affected by the sex, MAP score and PNF volume, and only the PNF volume was independently associated with the console time. CONCLUSION Even if performed by an experienced robotic surgeon beyond the initial learning curve, the PNF volume may influence the console time during RAPN.","publish_time":"2019-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Motoyama, Daisuke; Matsushita, Yuto; Watanabe, Hiromitsu; Tamura, Keita; Ito, Toshiki; Sugiyama, Takayuki; Otsuka, Atsushi; Miyake, Hideaki","journal":"BMC urology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12894-019-0567-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31830961/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjsxOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MIC","RAPN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["median PNF volume","RAPN","console time","MAP score","recent patients","consecutive patients","score system outcomes","nephrometry score","psoas muscle","lateroconal fascia","fusion fascia","single surgeon","lumbar quadrate muscle","SYNAPSE VINCENT system","perioperative outcomes of robot","experienced robotic surgeon","ischemia","initial learning curve","Mayo adhesive probability","reconstructed three-dimensional computed tomography images","BMI","complications","clinical T1a-b renal tumors","trifecta","margin","diaphragm","groups","sex","anatomical structures","impact of volumetry","perinephric fat","partial nephrectomy","kidney","body mass index","institution","study","fatty area","correlation coefficient","series","significant difference","effects of surgical experience","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","factors","CONCLUSION","cm3","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Mouse pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMECs) were used as a model of the microvascular endothelium and were stimulated with LPS. Renal function, renal inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS) expression, cellular apoptosis, plasma and renal levels of NO and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members (p38, ERK1/2, and JNK1/2) were examined. Moreover, a calpain inhibitor, calpastatin overexpression adenoviruses and MAPK inhibitors were used. Significant renal dysfunction was induced by LPS stimulation, and recovery was observed in TEK/Capn4-/- and Tg-CAST mice but not in LYZ/Capn4-/- mice. Endothelial Capn4 knockout also abrogated the LPS-induced increases in renal iNOS expression, caspase-3 activity and apoptosis and plasma and renal NO and ROS levels but did not obviously affect renal eNOS expression. Moreover, LPS increased both calpain and caspase-3 activity, and only the expression of iNOS in PMECs was accompanied by increased phosphorylation of p38 and JNK. Inhibiting calpain activity or p38 phosphorylation alleviated the increased iNOS expression, NO/ROS production, and cellular apoptosis induced by LPS. These results suggest that endothelial calpain plays a protective role in LPS-induced AKI by inhibiting p38 phosphorylation, thus attenuating iNOS expression and further decreasing NO and ROS overproduction-induced endothelial apoptosis.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Zhifeng; Ji, Jingjing; Zheng, Dong; Su, Lei; Peng, Tianqing; Tang, Jing","journal":"Experimental \u0026 molecular medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s12276-020-0426-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346126/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjszMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["AKI"],"organizations":["JNK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["renal iNOS expression","endothelial calpain","expression of iNOS","Endothelial Capn4 knockout","LPS-induced AKI","renal eNOS expression","endothelial apoptosis","LPS-induced increases","increased iNOS expression","renal levels","endothelial-specific Capn4 knockout","administration of LPS","LPS stimulation","calpain activity","Renal function","p38 phosphorylation","attenuating iNOS expression","role of calpain","increased phosphorylation of p38","endothelial NOS","myeloid-specific Capn4 knockout","Significant renal dysfunction","ROS levels","cellular apoptosis","endogenous calpain inhibitor","Tg-CAST mice","phosphorylation of mitogen","ROS production","ROS overproduction","renal inducible nitric oxide synthase","Mouse pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells","PMECs","plasma","LYZ","caspase","TEK","calpastatin overexpression adenoviruses","MAPK inhibitors","protective role","microvascular endothelium","activated protein kinase","family members","acute kidney injury","animal models of endotoxemia","reactive oxygen species","ERK1","lipopolysaccharide","pathway","recovery","results","JNK1"],"language":"en"},

The variations in the virus, and its co-infections with other enteric viruses, have contributed to the poor control of PEDV infection. In the current study, a broad epidemiological investigation of PEDV was carried out in 22 provinces or municipalities of China during 2015-2018. The enteric viruses causing co-infection with PEDV and the genetic diversity of the PEDV S1 gene were also analyzed. The results indicated that, of the 543 diarrhea samples, 66.85% (363/543) were positive for PEDV, and co-infection rates of PEDV with 13 enteric viruses ranged from 3.58% (13/363) to 81.55% (296/363). Among these enteric viruses, the signs of diarrhea induced by PEDV were potentially associated with co-infections with porcine enterovirus 9/10 (PEV) and torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV-2) (p\u003C0.05). The 147 PEDV strains identified in our study belong to Chinese pandemic strains and exhibited genetic diversity. The virulence-determining S1 proteins of PEDV pandemic strains were undergoing amino acid mutations, in which S58_S58insQGVN-N135dup-D158_I159del-like mutations were common patterns (97.28%, 143/147). When compared with 2011-2014 PEDV strains, the amino acid mutations of PEDV pandemic strains were mainly located in the N-terminal domain of S1 (S1-NTD), and 21 novel mutations occurred in 2017 and 2018. Furthermore, protein homology modeling showed that the mutations in pattern of insertion and deletion mutations of the S1 protein of PEDV pandemic strains may have caused structural changes on the surface of the S1 protein. These data provide a better understanding of the co-infection and genetic evolution of PEDV in China.","publish_time":"2019-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Su, Mingjun; Li, Chunqiu; Qi, Shanshan; Yang, Dan; Jiang, Ning; Yin, Baishuang; Guo, Donghua; Kong, Fanzhi; Yuan, Dongwei; Feng, Li; Sun, Dongbo","journal":"Transboundary and emerging diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31785090/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjszMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["PEDV strains","PEDV S1 gene","S1 protein of PEDV pandemic strains","S1 proteins of PEDV pandemic strains","co-infection rates of PEDV","genetic evolution of PEDV","amino acid mutations of PEDV pandemic strains","poor control of PEDV infection","broad epidemiological investigation of PEDV","enteric viruses","Chinese pandemic strains","deletion mutations","novel mutations","S1-NTD","co-infections","genetic diversity","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","N-terminal domain of S1","epizootic virus of swine","signs of diarrhea","municipalities of China","diarrhea samples","torque teno sus virus","protein homology modeling","current study","porcine enterovirus","PEV","substantial economic losses","pig industry","I159del","TTSuV","D158","pattern of insertion","structural changes","S58insQGVN-N135dup","better understanding","surface","countries","common patterns","provinces","virulence","data","variations","results"],"language":"en"},

Zinc is known to modulate antiviral and antibacterial immunity and regulate inflammatory response. Despite the lack of clinical data, certain indications suggest that modulation of zinc status may be beneficial in COVID\u201119. In vitro experiments demonstrate that Zn2\u002B possesses antiviral activity through inhibition of SARS\u2011CoV RNA polymerase. This effect may underlie therapeutic efficiency of chloroquine known to act as zinc ionophore. Indirect evidence also indicates that Zn2\u002B may decrease the activity of angiotensin\u2011converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), known to be the receptor for SARS\u2011CoV\u20112. Improved antiviral immunity by zinc may also occur through up\u2011regulation of interferon \u03B1 production and increasing its antiviral activity. Zinc possesses anti\u2011inflammatory activity by inhibiting NF\u2011\u03BAB signaling and modulation of regulatory T\u2011cell functions that may limit the cytokine storm in COVID\u201119. Improved Zn status may also reduce the risk of bacterial co\u2011infection by improving mucociliary clearance and barrier function of the respiratory epithelium, as well as direct antibacterial effects against S. pneumoniae. Zinc status is also tightly associated with risk factors for severe COVID\u201119 including ageing, immune deficiency, obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis, since these are known risk groups for zinc deficiency. Therefore, Zn may possess protective effect as preventive and adjuvant therapy of COVID\u201119 through reducing inflammation, improvement of mucociliary clearance, prevention of ventilator\u2011induced lung injury, modulation of antiviral and antibacterial immunity.

Effective contact tracing for potentially exposed healthcare workers (HCWs) is crucial for the prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks in the healthcare setting. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of contact tracing through real-time locating systems (RTLS) and electronic medical records (EMRs) review at the designated hospital for COVID-19 response in Singapore, during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Over a two-day study period, all admitted COVID-19 patients, their ward locations, and the HCWs rostered to each ward, were identified to determine the total number of potential contacts between COVID-19 patients and HCWs. The number of staff-patient contacts determined by EMR reviews, RTLS-based contact tracing, and a combination of both methods were evaluated. The use of EMR and RTLS-based contact tracing methods were further validated by comparing their sensitivity and specificity against self-reported staff-patient contacts by HCWs. RESULTS Of 796 potential staff-patient contacts (between 17 patients and 162 staff), 104(13.1%) were identified on both RTLS and EMR, 54(6.8%) by RTLS alone, 99(12.4%) by EMR alone, and 539(67.7%) not identified through either method. Compared to self-reported contacts, EMR reviews had a sensitivity of 47.2% and specificity of 77.9%, while RTLS had a sensitivity of 72.2% and specificity of 87.7%. The highest sensitivity was obtained by including all contacts identified by either RTLS or EMR (sensitivity 77.8%, specificity 73.4%).

In this study, the marine sponge-derived natural compounds 4,6-dibromo-2-(2\u0027,4\u0027-dibromophenoxy)phenol and 3,4,6-tribromo-2-(2\u0027,4\u0027-dibromophenoxy)phenol were found to exhibit broad antibacterial activity against medically relevant gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. The compounds were not only bactericidal against both replicating and stationary phase-persistent planktonic cells of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; they also killed biofilm-incorporated cells of both species while not affecting biofilm structural integrity. Moreover, these compounds were active against carbapenemase-producing Enterobacter sp. This simultaneous activity of compounds against different growth forms of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria is rare. Genome sequencing of spontaneous resistant mutants and proteome analysis suggest that resistance is mediated by downregulation of the bacterial EIIBC phosphotransferase components scrA and mtlA in MRSA likely leading to a lower uptake of the molecules. Due to their only moderate cytotoxicity against human cell lines, phenoxyphenols provide an interesting new scaffold for development of antimicrobial agents with activity against planktonic cells, persisters and biofilm-incoporated cells of ESKAPE pathogens.

After a single use, many of these materials are currently treated as waste, underutilizing their inherent chemical and energy value. In this study, energy-rich polyethylene (PE) macromolecules are catalytically transformed into value-added products by hydrogenolysis using well-dispersed Pt nanoparticles (NPs) supported on SrTiO3 perovskite nanocuboids by atomic layer deposition. Pt/SrTiO3 completely converts PE (M n = 8000-158,000 Da) or a single-use plastic bag (M n = 31,000 Da) into high-quality liquid products, such as lubricants and waxes, characterized by a narrow distribution of oligomeric chains, at 170 psi H2 and 300 \u00B0C under solvent-free conditions for reaction durations up to 96 h. The binding of PE onto the catalyst surface contributes to the number averaged molecular weight (M n) and the narrow polydispersity (\u0110) of the final liquid product. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance of 13C-enriched PE adsorption studies and density functional theory computations suggest that PE adsorption is more favorable on Pt sites than that on the SrTiO3 support.

Methods: 29 patients with 2019-ncov admitted to the isolation ward of Tongji hospital affiliated to Tongji medical college of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in January 2020 were selected as the study subjects. Clinical data were collected and the general information, clinical symptoms, blood test and CT imaging characteristics were analyzed. According to the relevant diagnostic criteria, the patients were divided into three groups: mild (15 cases), severe (9 cases) and critical (5 cases). The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and other markers in the serum of each group were detected, and the changes of these indicators of the three groups were compared and analyzed, as well as their relationship with the clinical classification of the disease. Results: (1) The main symptoms of 2019-nCoV pneumonia was fever (28/29) with or without respiratory and other systemic symptoms. Two patients died with underlying disease and co-bacterial infection, respectively. (2) The blood test of the patients showed normal or decreased white blood cell count (23/29), decreased lymphocyte count (20/29), increased hypersensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP) (27/29), and normal procalcitonin. In most patients, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was significantly increased (20/29), while albumin was decreased (15/29). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (Tbil), serum creatinine (Scr) and other items showed no significant changes. (3) CT findings of typical cases were single or multiple patchy ground glass shadows accompanied by septal thickening. When the disease progresses, the lesion increases and the scope expands, and the ground glass shadow coexists with the solid shadow or the stripe shadow. (4) There were statistically significant differences in the expression levels of interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) and IL-6 in the serum of the three groups (P\u003C0.05), among which the critical group was higher than the severe group and the severe group was higher than the mild group. However, there were no statistically significant differences in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03B1), IL-1, IL-8, IL-10, hs-CRP, lymphocyte count and LDH among the three groups (P\u003E0.05). Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia are similar to those of common viral pneumonia. High resolution CT is of great value in the differential diagnosis of this disease. The increased expression of IL-2R and IL-6 in serum is expected to predict the severity of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia and the prognosis of patients.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, L; Liu, H G; Liu, W; Liu, J; Liu, K; Shang, J; Deng, Y; Wei, S","journal":"Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2020.03.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32164089/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs0MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Alanine"],"organizations":["Huazhong University of Science and Technology"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nCoV pneumonia","increased expression of IL","severe group","serum creatinine","clinical symptoms","clinical characteristics","groups","serum inflammatory cytokines","mild group","critical group","prognosis of patients","serum lactate dehydrogenase","Clinical data","clinical classification","underlying disease","disease progresses","decreased lymphocyte count","blood test","expression levels of inflammatory cytokines","significant differences","significant changes","serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha","expression levels of interleukin","CT imaging characteristics","common viral pneumonia","CT findings of typical cases","white blood cell count","solid shadow","hs-CRP","LDH","main symptoms","severity","stripe shadow","systemic symptoms","High resolution CT","aspartate aminotransferase","Alanine aminotransferase","normal procalcitonin","multiple patchy ground glass shadows","isolation ward of Tongji hospital","Tongji medical college of Huazhong University of Science","AST","great value","Tbil","total bilirubin","general information","ALT","hypersensitive C reactive protein","TNF-\u03B1","receptor","correlation","markers","septal thickening","co-bacterial infection","novel coronavirus","differential diagnosis","items","Scr","Technology","scope","lesion","relevant diagnostic criteria","relationship","indicators","Objective","Conclusion","fever","study subjects","Results","Methods","albumin"],"language":"en"},

COVID-19 is predominantly caused by contact or droplet transmission attributed to relatively large respiratory particles which are subject to gravitational forces and travel only approximately one metre from the patient. Airborne transmission may occur if patient respiratory activity or medical procedures generate respiratory aerosols. These aerosols contain particles that may travel much longer distances and remain airborne longer, but their infective potential is uncertain. Contact, droplet and airborne transmission are each relevant during airway manoeuvres in infected patients, particularly during tracheal intubation. Personal protective equipment is an important component, but only one part, of a system protecting staff and other patients from COVID-19 cross-infection. Appropriate use significantly reduces risk of viral transmission. Personal protective equipment should logically be matched to the potential mode of viral transmission occurring during patient care - contact, droplet, or airborne. Recommendations from international organisations are broadly consistent, but equipment use is not. Only airborne precautions include a fitted high-filtration mask, and this should be reserved for aerosol-generating procedures. Uncertainty remains around certain details of personal protective equipment including use of hoods, mask type and the potential for re-use of equipment.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cook, T M","journal":"Anaesthesia","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.15071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32246849/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs0MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Airborne transmission","equipment use","droplet transmission","re-use of equipment","certain details of personal protective equipment","airborne precautions","COVID","potential mode of viral transmission","risk of viral transmission","use of hoods","respiratory aerosols","Appropriate use","patient respiratory activity","patient care - contact","large respiratory particles","infective potential","travel","infected patients","emotive subject","mask type","important component","medical procedures","longer distances","fitted high-filtration mask","airway manoeuvres","current coronavirus","gravitational forces","international organisations","Recommendations","tracheal intubation","Uncertainty","staff","metre","cross-infection","system","epidemic"],"language":"en"},

Fever (92.9%), dry cough (82.1%), and fatigue (64.3%) were the most common symptoms, followed by dyspnea (57.1%), anorexia (57.1%), diarrhea (42.9%), expectoration (25.0%), and nausea (21.4%). Fourteen patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The hemoglobin A1c level was similar between ICU and non-ICU patients. ICU patients had a higher respiratory rate, higher levels of random blood glucose, aspartate transaminase, bilirubin, creatine, N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide, troponin I, D-dimers, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, ferritin, interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, and IL-8 than non-ICU patients. Eleven of 14 ICU patients received noninvasive ventilation and 7 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation. Twelve patients died in the ICU group and no patients died in the nonICU group. Conclusion: ICU cases showed higher rates of organ failure and mortality than non-ICU cases. The poor outcomes of patients with diabetes and COVID-19 indicated that more supervision is required in these patients.

Parents are assumed to play an important role in influencing children\u0027s PA. Earlier reviews have mainly focused on parental modelling, encouragement, and support for PA, rather than the actual PA levels of parents. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to systematically summarize the evidence on the relationship between parent and child PA. METHODS Papers were identified using electronic databases and manual searches of reference lists. Papers reporting on associations between objectively measured child PA and at least one measure of parental PA were included. The quality of the papers was assessed using a modified version of the ROBINS-I tool. For interpretation of the results across studies, we produced albatross plots for all studies combined and by age-groups, sex of the parents, sex of the child, methodology of assessment of parental PA, and type of PA. RESULTS Thirty-nine papers were included with sample size of parent-child dyads ranging from 15 to 1267 (mean = 319 dyads, median = 227 dyads). The majority of studies were published from 2008 to 2018 and used accelerometry to assess PA. Most of the studies were classified as having moderate, serious, or critical risk of bias. The albatross plot for all studies combined showed that the clear majority of studies observed a positive relationship between parent and child PA. The plot suggested an average magnitude of correlation across studies to be around 0.13, and the overall impression was that this was fairly similar across child age-groups and gender of parent-child dyads. Studies using objective assessment of parental PA showed stronger relationship between parent and child PA compared with studies using self-report (average magnitude of correlation around 0.16 vs 0.04 respectively). No clear evidence was found for the strength of relationship being dependent on type of PA measure of parent and child (total PA, moderate-to-vigorous PA, steps), however, the relationship for light PA appeared weaker. CONCLUSION This systematic review showed that the clear majority of studies observed a weak positive relationship between parent and child PA regardless of age of the child, the gender of the parent-child dyad, and type of PA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A search of the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL, DARE, and PROSPERO databases was made on 5 November 2019 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCT) using intention-to-treat analysis to compare a paclitaxel-coated device to an uncoated device in PAD patients having clinical follow-up of at least 6 months. Half of the study population had to have CLTI or extractable data on the CLTI subgroup if \u003C50%. The search identified 11 trials having 1450 patients randomized to a paclitaxel-coated device (n=866) or an uncoated control (n=584). There were 1367 (94.3%) patients with CLTI (range 10-429). The single endpoint was all-cause mortality, which was analyzed by pooling the mortality data in a DerSimonian and Laird random effects model. Summary statistics are expressed as relative risk ratios (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS The mean follow-up was 25.6 months (range 6-60); 10 of 11 studies reported a minimum 12-month follow-up.

The release probability depends on action potential-evoked presynaptic Ca2\u002B entry, but also on the resting Ca2\u002B level. Whether these basic aspects of presynaptic calcium homeostasis show any consistent trend along the axonal path, and how they are controlled by local network activity, remains poorly understood. Here, we take advantage of the recently advanced FLIM-based method to monitor presynaptic Ca2\u002B with nanomolar sensitivity. We find that, in cortical pyramidal neurons, action potential- evoked calcium entry (range 10-300 nM), but not the resting Ca2\u002B level (range 10-100 nM), tends to increase with higher order of axonal branches. Blocking astroglial glutamate uptake reduces evoked Ca2\u002B entry but has little effect on resting Ca2\u002B whereas both appear boosted by the constitutive activation of group 1/2 metabotropic glutamate receptors. We find no consistent effect of transient somatic depolarisation or hyperpolarisation on presynaptic Ca2\u002B entry or its basal level.

However, it remains unclear whether compliance to exercise in supervised settings translates to long-term adherence to physical activity in real-world, unstructured environments. To our knowledge, no comprehensive review is available on compliance and/or adherence rates to either modes of exercise for insufficiently active individuals. Furthermore, it is unclear which training modality insufficiently active individuals comply and/or adhere more readily to. Based on these gaps, the following two questions will be addressed: (1) What are compliance and adherence rates to high-intensity interval training for insufficiently active adults aged 18-65 years and (2) How do compliance and adherence rates differ between high-intensity interval training and moderate-intensity continuous training? METHODS Both observational and experimental studies that report on compliance and/or adherence rates to high-intensity interval training will be included. Relevant studies will be retrieved from Medline, EMBASE, PsychINFO, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, and Web of Science using a pre-specified search strategy. Pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria will be used by two independent researchers to determine eligible studies. Of those meeting the inclusion criteria, data extraction and narrative synthesis will be completed, and where applicable, random-effects meta-analyses will be computed to compare compliance and adherence rates between high-intensity interval training and moderate-intensity continuous training. Meta-regressions and sensitivity analyses will be used to further explore factors that could influence aggregate effect sizes. Risk of bias will be assessed using established tools by the Cochrane association, and quality assessment of the cumulative evidence will be assessed using the GRADE approach. DISCUSSION Results from this study may have the potential to inform future physical activity recommendations and guidelines on the ideal mode of exercise for the general population. This review will add to the body of literature on the feasibility of high-intensity interval training for an insufficiently active population, conclusively addressing the ongoing debate of whether it is an appropriate exercise choice for this demographic. With this new information, individuals working towards a healthier lifestyle through physical activity engagement may be better equipped to make an evidence-based decision.

Physicians administered a survey-based questionnaire to SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with the aim of assessing symptoms, focusing on OD and GD. Two groups were studied: patients hospitalized at ASST Spedali Civili University Hospital of Brescia (A); home-quarantined subjects (B). RESULTS A total of 508 patients were enrolled: 295 in Group A and 213 in Group B. Mean age (\u00B1SD) was 55\u00B115 years; 56% were men. Overall, OD and GD were present in 56% (95% CI 51-60%) and 63% (59-67%) of cases, respectively. In Group A, the prevalence of OD and GD was 44% (38-50%) and 52% (46-58%). In Group B, the prevalence of OD and GD was 72% (65-79%) and 79% (73-84%). In the entire cohort, total loss of olfaction and taste was reported in 64% and 60% of cases, respectively. OD and GD occurred as the first symptom in 10% and 11% of cases; in the remaining cases, they occurred after a mean of 4\u00B13 days following the first symptom.

METHODS A systematic review with network meta-analysis, surface under the cumulative ranking analysis and stochastic multicriteria acceptability analyses were performed. Searches were conducted in Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science without limits for time-frame or language. Randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy or safety of any PDE5i compared to a placebo or to other PDE5i in males with erectile disfunction were included. RESULTS Overall, 184 articles representing 179 randomized controlled trials (50,620 patients) were included. All PDE5i were significantly more efficient than placebo. Sildenafil 25 mg was statistically superior to all interventions in enhancing IIEF (with a 98% probability of being the most effective treatment), followed by sildenafil 50 mg (80% of probability). Taladafil 10 mg and 20 mg also presented good profiles (73% and 76%, respectively). Avanafil and lodenafil were less effective interventions. Mirodenafil 150 mg was the treatment that caused more adverse events, especially flushing and headaches. Sildenafil 100 mg was more related to visual disorders, while vardenafil and udenafil were more prone to cause nasal congestion. CONCLUSION Sildenafil at low doses and tadalafil should be the first therapeutic options. Avanafil, lodenafil and mirodenafil use are hardly justified given the lack of expressive efficacy or high rates of adverse events.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Madeira, Camilla R; Tonin, Fernanda S; Fachi, Mariana M; Borba, Helena H; Ferreira, Vinicius L; Leonart, Leticia P; Bonetti, Aline F; Moritz, Rogerio P; Trindade, Angela C L B; Gon\u00E7alves, Alan G; Fernandez-Llimos, Fernando; Pontarolo, Roberto","journal":"World journal of urology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00345-020-03233-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388784/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs3NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Taladafil"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PDE5i","CONCLUSION Sildenafil","safety","Randomized controlled trials","Avanafil","lodenafil","effective treatment","effective interventions","placebo","probability","lack of expressive efficacy","high rates of adverse events","erectile dysfunction","erectile disfunction","mirodenafil use","cumulative ranking analysis","network meta-analysis","surface","limits","tadalafil","stochastic multicriteria acceptability analyses","Web of Science","systematic review","udenafil","vardenafil","Scopus","inhibitors","phosphodiesterase type","time-frame","Pubmed","visual disorders","METHODS","low doses","benefit-risk ratio","articles","males","language","IIEF","patients","nasal congestion","therapeutic options","Searches","headaches","good profiles","PURPOSE","RESULTS","Taladafil"],"language":"en"},

Similar scenarios play out when an institution\u0027s systems fail, or when local or regional disasters occur. In these situations, it becomes necessary to use one or more alternative care sites (ACS). Situated in a variety of non-healthcare structures, ACS may be used for ambulatory, acute, subacute, or chronic care. Developing alternative care facilities is the disaster-planning step that moves communities from talking to doing. This commitment pays real dividends if a disaster of any magnitude strikes. This paper discusses the basic criteria for selecting, establishing and ultimately closing an ACS, difficulties of administration, staffing, security, and providing basic supplies and equipment.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Iserson, Kenneth V","journal":"The western journal of emergency medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2020.4.47552; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302285/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs4MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ACS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACS","alternative care facilities","alternative care sites","chronic care","healthcare system","basic supplies","basic criteria","disaster-planning step","variety of non-healthcare structures","limited surge capacity","pandemic","security","staffing","difficulties of administration","institution\u0027s systems","real dividends","commitment","communities","ambulatory","Similar scenarios","current COVID","magnitude strikes","regional disasters","paper","equipment","situations"],"language":"en"},

As cellular mechanisms of taste learning, long-term potentiation (LTP) at glutamatergic synapses is well studied. However, little is known about long-term changes of synaptic efficacy at GABAergic synapses in the insular cortex. Here, we examined the synaptic mechanisms of long-term plasticity at GABAergic synapses in layer V pyramidal neurons of the mouse insular cortex. In response to a prolonged high-frequency stimulation (HFS), GABAergic synapses displayed endocannabinod (eCB)-mediated long-term depression (LTDGABA). When cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB1Rs) were blocked by a CB1R antagonist, the same stimuli caused LTP at GABAergic synapses (LTPGABA) which was mediated by production of nitric oxide (NO) via activation of NMDA receptors. Intriguingly, NO signaling was necessary for the induction of LTDGABA. In the presence of leptin which blocks CB1 signaling, the prolonged HFS caused LTPGABA which was mediated by NO signaling. These results indicate that long-term plasticity at GABAergic synapses in the insular cortex can be modulated by combined effects of eCB and NO signaling. These forms of GABAergic synaptic plasticity in the insular cortex may be crucial synaptic mechanisms in taste learning.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Toyoda, Hiroki","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64236-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346039/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs4NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LTP","NMDA","LTDGABA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GABAergic synapses","synaptic mechanisms of long-term plasticity","mouse insular cortex","forms of GABAergic synaptic plasticity","glutamatergic synapses","long-term potentiation","long-term depression","long-term changes of synaptic efficacy","crucial synaptic mechanisms","cellular mechanisms of taste learning","prolonged HFS","LTPGABA","induction of LTDGABA","combined effects of eCB","activation of NMDA receptors","prolonged high-frequency stimulation","layer V pyramidal neurons","stimuli","pivotal roles","endocannabinod","production of nitric oxide","CB1R antagonist","CB1Rs","response","results","presence of leptin","cannabinoid"],"language":"en"},

We developed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for P. infestans and compared this assay to conventional PCR, real-time LAMP, and droplet digital PCR for detection of P. infestans. The LAMP assay was specific for P. infestans on potato and tomato and did not amplify other potato- or tomato-infecting Phytophthora species or other fungal and bacterial pathogens that infect potato and tomato. The detection threshold for SYBR Green LAMP and real-time LAMP read with hydroxynaphthol blue and Eva Green was 1 pg/\u00B5l. In contrast, detection by conventional PCR was 10 pg/\u00B5l. Droplet digital PCR had the lowest detection threshold (100 fg/\u00B5l). We adapted the LAMP assay using SYBR Green and a mobile reader (mReader) for use in the field. Detection limits were 584 fg/\u00B5l for SYBR Green LAMP read on the mReader, which was more sensitive than visualization with the human eye. The mobile platform records geospatial coordinates and data from positive pathogen detections can be directly uploaded to a cloud database. Data can then be integrated into disease surveillance networks.

The results indicated an average PEDV-positive rate of 38.04% (70/184) and more-pronounced disease severity in diarrheic pigs (48.76%; 59/121) than in non-diarrheic pigs (17.46%; 11/63). Phylogenetic and sequence analysis demonstrated that 14 representative PEDV strains from 14 swine farms belonged to the G2 group (G2-a and G2-b subgroups) and displayed a high degree of genetic variation. In particular, two out of the 14 PEDV strains were found to have unique indels in the S1 gene.

A three-dimensional structural prediction revealed that these unique insertions might lengthen the loop on the surface or increase the likelihood of the surface protein being phosphorylated at 388Y, thereby affecting the virulence or pathogenicity of PEDV. Collectively, the data show that PED remains a severe threat to the pig industry and that variant PEDV stains are circulating in China.

Early detection with fast and sensitive assays and timely intervention are crucial for interrupting the spread of the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2). Using a mismatch-tolerant amplification technique, we developed a simple, rapid, sensitive and visual reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection based on its N gene. The assay has a high specificity and sensitivity, and robust reproducibility, and its results can be monitored using a real-time PCR machine or visualized via colorimetric change from red to yellow. The limit of detection (LOD) of the assay is 118.6 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA per 25 \u03BCL reaction. The reaction can be completed within 30 min for real-time fluorescence monitoring, or 40 min for visual detection when the template input is more than 200 copies per 25 \u03BCL reaction. To evaluate the viability of the assay, a comparison between the RT-LAMP and a commercial RT-qPCR assay was made using 56 clinical samples. The SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP assay showed perfect agreement in detection with the RT-qPCR assay.

An audiovisual online streaming system was tested, allowing a neurointerventional specialist located at a neurovascular center to supervise and instruct a thrombectomy performed at a distant hospital without being physically present (remote streaming support [RESS]). METHODS In total, 36 thrombectomy procedures were performed on a Mentice endovascular simulator by six radiologists not specialized in neurointerventions. Each radiologist was challenged with six different endovascular simulation scenarios under alternating conventional local support (specialist inside the room [LOS]) and RESS, which was performed using an advanced live streaming platform. RESULTS Both support modes led to a median of 2 attempts (interquartile range [IQR] 2.0-2.0 each) until successful recanalization. There was no statistically significant difference in time from first catheter insertion to recanalization between LOS (median 24.9 min, IQR 21.0-31.5 min) and RESS (23.9 min, IQR 21.7-28.7 min, p = 0.89). The percentage of thrombi covered by the stent-retriever and average speed when retrieving the stent-retriever (3.7 mm/s, IQR 3.25-5.35 mm/s vs. 3.6 mm/sec, IQR 2.5-4.7) were similar in both groups. Fluoroscopy time did not differ (19.0 min, IQR 16.9-23.5 min vs. 19.9 min, IQR 15.9-23.5 min) with a trend towards increased median amounts of contrast medium used under RESS (62.9 ml vs. 43.1 ml; p = 0.055). CONCLUSION This study confirmed the feasibility of RESS for thrombectomy procedures in a simulated environment. This serves as basis for future studies planned to analyze the effectiveness of RESS in a real-world environment and to test if it improves the learning curve of interventionalists with limited thrombectomy experience in remote areas.","publish_time":"2019-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bechstein, Matthias; Buhk, Jan-Hendrik; Fr\u00F6lich, Andreas Maximilian; Broocks, Gabriel; Hanning, Uta; Erler, Martin; An\u0111elkovi\u0107, Milan; Debeljak, Dragan; Fiehler, Jens; Goebell, Einar","journal":"Clinical neuroradiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-019-00870-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31863121/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RESS","IQR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IQR","thrombectomy procedures","effectiveness of RESS","feasibility of RESS","expeditious thrombectomy","remote streaming support","limited thrombectomy experience","LOS","stent-retriever","alternating conventional local support","remote areas","neurointerventional specialists","audiovisual online streaming system","simulated environment","advanced live streaming platform","real-world environment","Fluoroscopy time","successful recanalization","increased median amounts of contrast medium","Mentice endovascular simulator","different endovascular simulation scenarios","catheter insertion","learning curve of interventionalists","room","average speed","radiologists","trend","regions","attempts","interquartile range","PURPOSE Stroke patients","significant difference","distant hospital","neurovascular center","future studies","study","METHODS","total","percentage of thrombi","basis","CONCLUSION","modes","sec","RESULTS","groups","neurointerventions"],"language":"en"},

Case Fatality Rates (CFR) could be somewhat unreliable because the estimation of total case numbers is limited by several factors, including insufficient testing and limitations in test kits and materials, such as NP swabs and PPE for testers. Sero prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may help in more accurate estimations of the total number of cases. Nevertheless, the disparity in the differences in the total number of fatalities between Italy and China suggests investigation into several factors, such as demographics, sociological interactions, availability of medical equipment (ICU beds and PPE), variants in immune proteins (e.g., HLA, IFNs), past immunity to related CoVs, and mutations in SARS-CoV-2, could impact survival of severe COVID-19 illness survival and the number of case fatalities.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rubino, Salvatore; Kelvin, Nikki; Bermejo-Martin, Jes\u00FAs F; Kelvin, David","journal":"Journal of infection in developing countries","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.12734; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32235086/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsxMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NP","PPE"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["number of case fatalities","total number of fatalities","total number of cases","number of diagnosed cases","Italy","China","estimation of total case numbers","PPE","factors","SARS-CoV","Case Fatality Rates","survival of severe COVID","illness survival","Sero prevalence of SARS","availability of medical equipment","limitations","ICU beds","test kits","sociological interactions","HLA","materials","variants","insufficient testing","past immunity","NP swabs","immune proteins","accurate estimations","IFNs","CoVs","demographics","CFR","mutations","antibodies","differences","investigation","testers","month","disparity"],"language":"en"},

Will healthcare workers and support staff fulfill their duty to treat in the face of high risks? Will institutional and government leaders at all levels do the right things to help alleviate healthcare workers risks and fears? Will physicians be willing to make hard, resource-allocation decisions if they cannot first husband or improvise alternatives?With our healthcare facilities and governments unprepared for this inevitable disaster, front-line doctors, advanced providers, nurses, EMS, and support personnel struggle with acute shortages of equipment-both to treat patients and protect themselves. With their personal and possibly their family\u0027s lives and health at risk, they must weigh the option of continuing to work or retreat to safety. This decision, made daily, is based on professional and personal values, how they perceive existing risks-including available protective measures, and their perception of the level and transparency of information they receive. Often, while clinicians get this information, support personnel do not, leading to absenteeism and deteriorating healthcare services. Leadership can use good risk communication (complete, widely transmitted, and transparent) to align healthcare workers\u0027 risk perceptions with reality. They also can address the common problems healthcare workers must overcome to continue working (ie, risk mitigation techniques). Physicians, if they cannot sufficiently husband or improvise lifesaving resources, will have to face difficult triage decisions. Ideally, they will use a predetermined plan, probably based on the principles of Utilitarianism (maximizing the greatest good) and derived from professional and community input. Unfortunately, none of these plans is optimal.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Iserson, Kenneth V","journal":"The western journal of emergency medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2020.4.47549; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302284/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsxNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EMS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["healthcare facilities","support personnel struggle","healthcare workers\u0027 risk perceptions","common problems healthcare workers","deteriorating healthcare services","support staff","good risk communication","existing risks","risk mitigation techniques","clinicians","face of high risks","husband","physicians","personal values","transparency of information","resource-allocation decisions","difficult triage decisions","inevitable disaster","nurses","front-line doctors","advanced providers","governments unprepared","levels","available protective measures","acute shortages of equipment","responsibilities","right things","pandemic","family\u0027s lives","absenteeism","reality","duty","government leaders","current COVID","principles of Utilitarianism","Leadership","alternatives","ethical issues","community input","fears","predetermined plan","lifesaving resources","plans","patients","option","safety"],"language":"en"},

METHODS Systematic review of the literature. Pooled prevalence estimates by care setting and clinical or radiological diagnostic criteria were calculated and plotted [PROSPERO ID: CRD42018109640]. RESULTS In total, 41 papers reporting on 55 study samples were included. The overall risk of bias was considered high in two-thirds of the papers. The mean prevalence, based on a clinical diagnosis of LSS in the general population, was 11% (95% CI 4-18%), 25% (95% CI 19-32%) in patients from primary care, 29% (95% CI 22-36%) in patients from secondary care and 39% (95% CI 39-39%) in patients from mixed primary and secondary care. Evaluating the presence of LSS based on radiological diagnosis, the pooled prevalence was 11% (95% CI 5-18%) in the asymptomatic population, 38% (95% CI - 10 to 85%) in the general population, 15% (95% CI 13-18%) in patients from primary care, 32% (95% CI 22-41%) in patients from secondary care and 21% (95% CI 16-26%) in a mixed population from primary and secondary care. CONCLUSIONS The mean prevalence estimates based on clinical diagnoses vary between 11 and 39%, and the estimates based on radiological diagnoses similarly vary between 11 and 38%.

The suggestion is based on the hypothesis that ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may favor the entry and diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 virus into the human cells. ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may increase the expression of ACE2 receptors, which are the sites of viral entry into the human organism. ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous, although they are extremely abundant on the cell surface of type 2 pneumocytes. Type 2 pneumocytes are small cylindrical alveolar cells located in close vicinity to pulmonary capillaries and responsible for the synthesis of alveolar surfactant, which is known to facilitate gas exchanges. The increased expression of ACE2 for effect of ACE-inhibitors and ARBs can be detected by increased production of angiotensin1-7 and mRNA related to ACE2. There is the fear that the increased expression of ACE2 induced by ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may ultimately facilitate the entry and diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, there is no clinical evidence to support this hypothesis. Furthermore, available data are conflicting and some counter-intuitive findings suggest that ARBs may be beneficial, not harmful. Indeed, studies conducted in different laboratories demonstrated that ACE2 receptors show a down-regulation (i.e. the opposite of what would happen with ACE-inhibitors and ARBs) for effect of their interaction with the virus. In animal studies, down-regulation of ACE2 has been found as prevalent in the pulmonary areas infected by virus, but not in the surrounding areas. In these studies, virus-induced ACE2 down-regulation would lead to a reduced formation of angiotensin1-7 (because ACE2 degrades angiotensin II into angiotensin1-7) with consequent accumulation of angiotensin II. The excess angiotensin II would favor pulmonary edema and inflammation, a phenomenon directly associated with angiotensin II levels, along with worsening in pulmonary function. Such detrimental effects have been blocked by ARBs in experimental models. In the light of the above considerations, it is reasonable to conclude that the suggestion to discontinue ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in all patients with the aim of preventing or limiting the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 virus is not based on clinical evidence. Conversely, experimental studies suggest that ARBs might be useful in these patients to limit pulmonary damage through the inhibition of type 1 angiotensin II receptors. Controlled clinical studies in this area are eagerly awaited. This review discusses facts and theories on the potential impact of ACE-inhibitors and ARBs in the setting of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Verdecchia, Paolo; Reboldi, Gianpaolo; Cavallini, Claudio; Mazzotta, Giovanni; Angeli, Fabio","journal":"Giornale italiano di cardiologia","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1714/3343.33127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32310915/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsyMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ARBs","ACE-inhibitors","regulation of ACE2","virus-induced ACE2","expression of ACE2 receptors","effect of ACE","SARS-CoV","increased expression of ACE2","diffusion of SARS","excess angiotensin","clinical studies","pulmonary areas","experimental studies","potential impact of ACE","pulmonary capillaries","pulmonary edema","pulmonary damage","pulmonary function","consequent accumulation of angiotensin","animal studies","current pandemic of SARS","clinical evidence","increased production of angiotensin1","inhibition of type","pneumocytes","human cells","patients","hypothesis","suggestion","cell surface of type","sites of viral entry","reduced formation of angiotensin1","small cylindrical alveolar cells","human organism","surrounding areas","experimental models","synthesis of alveolar surfactant","close vicinity","theories","counter-intuitive findings","phenomenon","receptor blockers","facts","worsening","levels","different laboratories","setting","enzyme","available data","inflammation","mRNA","aim","fear","interaction","considerations","review","detrimental effects","opposite","gas exchanges","light","Authors"],"language":"en"},

The burden of RSV infection in adults, particularly in the older age group, is increasingly recognised. However, RSV disease burden and molecular epidemiology in the World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Region (WPR) has not been reviewed systematically. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the epidemiological aspects of RSV (incidence, prevalence, seasonality and hospitalisation status) and the associated molecular data in the WPRO countries. Methods A systematic search was conducted in international literature databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science) to identify RSV-related publications from January 2000 to October 2017 in the WPR countries. Results A total of 196 studies from 15 WPR countries were included. The positivity rate for RSV among respiratory tract infection patients was 16.73% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 15.12%-18.4%). The RSV-positive cases were mostly found in hospitalised compared with outpatients (18.28% vs 11.54%, P \u003C 0.001), and children compared with adults (20.72% vs 1.87%, P \u003C 0.001). The seasonality of RSV in the WPR countries follows the latitude, with the peak of RSV season occurring in the winter in temperate countries, and during the rainy season in tropical countries. The molecular epidemiology pattern of RSV in WPR countries was similar to the global pattern, with NA1 (RSV A) and BA (RSV B) being the predominant genotypes. Conclusions The available data on RSV are limited in several countries within the WPR, with most data focusing on children and hospitalised patients. Further studies and surveillance, incorporating laboratory testing, are needed to determine the burden of RSV infection in the WPR countries.","publish_time":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pangesti, Krisna N A; El Ghany, Moataz Abd; Kesson, Alison M; Hill-Cawthorne, Grant A","journal":"Journal of global health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.09.020431; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31893034/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsyMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","World Health Organization","Western Pacific Region"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["seasonality of RSV","WPR countries","RSV B","burden of RSV infection","RSV disease burden","peak of RSV season","epidemiological aspects of RSV","RSV-related publications","RSV-positive cases","molecular epidemiology pattern of RSV","temperate countries","WPRO countries","tropical countries","associated molecular data","respiratory tract infection patients","available data","adults","studies","younger children","hospitalised patients","vs","global pattern","rainy season","systematic search","systematic review","Background Respiratory syncytial virus","EMBASE","World Health Organization","MEDLINE","international literature databases","bronchiolitis","hospitalisation status","incidence","prevalence","Scopus","leading cause of viral pneumonia","Western Pacific Region","Web of Science","positivity rate","NA1","winter","older age group","latitude","surveillance","laboratory testing","predominant genotypes","Conclusions","confidence interval","aim","Methods","total","outpatients"],"language":"en"},

However, the precise effects of travel restrictions on the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 remain unknown. Here we combine a global network mobility model with a local epidemiology model to simulate and predict the outbreak dynamics and outbreak control of COVID-19 across Europe.

Our simulations show that mobility networks of air travel can predict the emerging global diffusion pattern of a pandemic at the early stages of the outbreak.

Nineteen (83%) ablated nodules were located in segments VI, VII and VIII, and one nodule was in segment I. Median size of nodules was 15 mm (10-21). No deaths occurred. Six patients (38%) experienced complications, among them only one was subsequent to the thermal ablation. Ablative minimal margin was \u22655 mm for 19 (83%) nodules.

Health care personnel (HCP) are essential workers defined as paid and unpaid persons serving in health care settings who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials (3). During February 12-April 9, among 315,531 COVID-19 cases reported to CDC using a standardized form, 49,370 (16%) included data on whether the patient was a health care worker in the United States; including 9,282 (19%) who were identified as HCP. Among HCP patients with data available, the median age was 42 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 32-54 years), 6,603 (73%) were female, and 1,779 (38%) reported at least one underlying health condition. Among HCP patients with data on health care, household, and community exposures, 780 (55%) reported contact with a COVID-19 patient only in health care settings. Although 4,336 (92%) HCP patients reported having at least one symptom among fever, cough, or shortness of breath, the remaining 8% did not report any of these symptoms. Most HCP with COVID-19 (6,760, 90%) were not hospitalized; however, severe outcomes, including 27 deaths, occurred across all age groups; deaths most frequently occurred in HCP aged \u226565 years. These preliminary findings highlight that whether HCP acquire infection at work or in the community, it is necessary to protect the health and safety of this essential national workforce.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"MMWR.

Those progressing to advanced liver disease often experience persistent pain and poor pain relief. There is presently limited guidance for the management of pain and associated symptoms in this population. The current literature lacks attention on how physical, psychological and social domains of liver disease modulate the pain experience. In this paper, we outline our scoping review protocol to systematically review the literature from academic bibliographic databases and grey sources to identify and map the biopsychosocial factors associated with pain in adults with advanced liver disease. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Arksey and O\u0027Malley\u0027s methodology, and Tricco et al\u0027s Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews, will guide the process for this scoping review. The literature search will include electronic and hand-searching methods using scholarly and grey sources. Scholarly databases include Medline, Embase, Allied and Complementary Medicine and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. Grey databases will focus on research studies not captured in the scholarly databases including those by government agencies and professional organisations. Two members of the research team will independently screen the resulting publications following specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Quality appraisal of the included research studies will employ the use of the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool version 2018. Data collection and extraction of study characteristics will use a data extraction tool developed iteratively by the research team. Analysis of the factors associated with pain outcomes will be mapped and described according to the domains of the biopsychosocial model of pain. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The scoping review involves analysis of the published literature on pain and advanced liver disease and does not require ethics approval. The results will be shared with expert stakeholders to help establish clinical significance. We will disseminate the findings through publication in a scholarly journal: local, provincial, national and international scientific and professional conferences.

In this study, we evaluated the hypomethylating agent azacitidine (AZA) for its potential as a novel therapeutic in preclinical models of brain metastasis of breast cancer. We used the parental triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 (231) cells and their brain colonizing counterpart (231Br) to ascertain phenotypic differences in response to AZA. We observed that 231Br cells have higher metastatic potential compared to 231 cells. With regard to therapeutic value, the AZA IC50 value in 231Br cells is significantly lower than that in parental cells (P \u003C .01). AZA treatment increased apoptosis and inhibited the Wnt signaling transduction pathway, angiogenesis, and cell metastatic capacity to a significantly higher extent in the 231Br line. AZA treatment in mice with experimental brain metastases significantly reduced tumor burden (P = .0112) and increased survival (P = .0026) compared to vehicle. Lastly, we observed a decreased expression of keratin 18 (an epithelial maker) in 231Br cells due to hypermethylation, elucidating a potential mechanism of action of AZA in treating brain metastases from breast cancer.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Butler, Christopher; Sprowls, Samuel; Szalai, Gabor; Arsiwala, Tasneem; Saralkar, Pushkar; Straight, Benjamin; Hatcher, Shea; Tyree, Evan; Yost, Michael; Kohler, William J; Wolff, Benjamin; Putnam, Emily; Lockman, Paul; Liu, Tuoen","journal":"Translational oncology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranon.2020.100775; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408199/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjszNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AZA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Br cells","parental cells","experimental brain metastases","symptomatic brain metastases","AZA IC50 value","Breast cancer patients","Br line","AZA treatment increased apoptosis","preclinical models of brain metastasis of breast cancer","higher metastatic potential","therapeutic value","parental triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB","potential mechanism of action","higher extent","increased survival","cell metastatic capacity","poor prognosis","reduced tumor burden","angiogenesis","Wnt","mice","current chemotherapeutic agents","transduction pathway","epithelial maker","hypomethylating agent azacitidine","phenotypic differences","hypermethylation","decreased expression of keratin","response","regard","counterpart","study","vehicle"],"language":"en"},

However, little is known about the physiological responses of this species to environmental extremes under field conditions. This study aimed to establish the efficacy of surgically implanted thermal radio transmitters and data loggers to measure the body temperature of free-ranging koalas across a range of environmental conditions and ambient temperatures. Five free-ranging koalas in southeast Queensland were implanted with thermal transmitters and data loggers waxed together as a single package. Body temperatures were recorded for variable periods ranging from 3 to 12 months. Diurnal rhythms in body temperature were detected irrespective of season. The long-term diurnal body temperature peak for all koalas occurred between 16:00 and 17:00 h and body temperature was 36.7-36.9 \u00B0C, the long-term nadir occurred between 07:00 and 08:00 h and body temperature was 35.4-35.7 \u00B0C. Koala body temperatures as low as 34.2 \u00B0C and as high as 39.0 \u00B0C were recorded. Thermolability became apparent when ambient temperatures were outside the deduced thermal neutral zone for koalas (14.5-24.5 \u00B0C): heat was accumulated during the day and dissipated during the cool of the night. While this study is the first to report on body temperature of free-ranging koalas in their normal behavioural context, further investigations are necessary to determine the physiological boundaries of the thermal niche for this species, in order to better equip models that will more accurately predict the impacts of climate change on koalas.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adam, D; Johnston, S D; Beard, L; Nicolson, V; Gaughan, J B; Lisle, A T; FitzGibbon, S; Barth, B J; Gillett, A; Grigg, G; Ellis, W","journal":"International journal of biometeorology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00484-020-01907-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388686/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs0MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Queensland"],"keyphrases":["koalas","body temperature of free","Koala body temperatures","long-term diurnal body temperature peak","thermal transmitters","ambient temperatures","thermal niche","implanted thermal radio transmitters","data loggers","species","study","deduced thermal neutral zone","range of environmental conditions","impacts of climate change","result of climate change","environmental extremes","field conditions","southeast Queensland","physiological boundaries","physiological responses","Diurnal rhythms","long-term nadir","investigations","frequency","normal behavioural context","efficacy","intensity","duration of heatwaves","Phascolarctos cinereus","variable periods","drought","order","distribution","Thermolability","single package","day","season","night","models","months"],"language":"en"},

To understand the relationships among these unique features and the transcriptional adaptation of the organism to CO, we performed a transcriptome analysis of C. maritimus KKC1 grown under 100% CO and N2 conditions. Of its 3114 genes, 58 and 32 genes were significantly upregulated and downregulated in the presence of CO, respectively. A cooS-ech gene cluster, an \u0022orphan\u0022 cooS gene, and bidirectional hyd genes were upregulated under CO, whereas hydrogen-uptake hyd genes were downregulated. Transcriptional changes in anaerobic respiratory genes supported the broad usage of electron acceptors in C. maritimus KKC1 under CO metabolism. Overall, the majority of the differentially expressed genes were oxidoreductase-like genes, suggesting metabolic adaptation to the cellular redox change upon CO oxidation. Moreover, our results suggest a transcriptional response mechanism to CO that involves multiple transcription factors, as well as a CO-responsive transcriptional activator (CooA). Our findings shed light on the diverse mechanisms for transcriptional and metabolic adaptations to CO in CO-utilizing and hydrogen-evolving bacteria.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Inoue, Masao; Izumihara, Hikaru; Fukuyama, Yuto; Omae, Kimiho; Yoshida, Takashi; Sako, Yoshihiko","journal":"Extremophiles : life under extreme conditions","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00792-020-01175-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388815/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs0MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["100% CO","CO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cooS genes","bidirectional hyd genes","anaerobic respiratory genes","hydrogen-uptake hyd genes","transcriptional adaptation","Transcriptional changes","transcriptional response mechanism","Calderihabitans maritimus KKC1","CO-responsive transcriptional activator","CO-utilizing","hydrogen-evolving bacteria","hydrogen-evolving bacterium","oxidation","cooS-ech gene cluster","variety of electron acceptors","metabolic adaptations","broad usage of electron acceptors","diverse mechanisms","orphan","cellular redox change","dehydrogenases","light","unique features","CooA","NiFe","carbon monoxide","multiple transcription factors","findings","results","transcriptome analysis of","oxidoreductase","relationships","metabolism","organism","N2 conditions","majority","presence"],"language":"en"},

We report on the extent of testing and test results during the month of March in NYS, along with risk factors, outcomes, and household prevalence among initial cases subject to in-depth investigations. METHODS Specimen collection for COVID-19 testing was conducted in healthcare settings, community-based collection sites, and by home testing teams. Information on demographics, risk factors, and hospital outcomes of cases was obtained through epidemiological investigations and an electronic medical records match, and summarized descriptively. Active testing of initial case\u0027s households enabled estimation of household prevalence. RESULTS During March In NYS, outside of New York City, a total of 47,326 persons tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, out of 141,495 tests (33% test-positive), with the highest number of cases located in the metropolitan region counties. Among 229 initial cases diagnosed through March 12, by March 30 13% were hospitalized and 2% died.

Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to investigate the spread of RGs in a fish-duck pond and the RGs and bacterial community of fish intestines. Five fish tanks, including a control tank and four experimental tanks (duck manure, duck manure \u002B cefotaxime, duck manure \u002B As, and duck manure \u002B cefotaxime \u002B As), were tested for 100 days. The results showed that duck manure increased both the diversity and relative abundance of RGs in fish intestines, and the addition of stress factors (cefotaxime, As) increased the relative abundance of RGs by one to two orders of magnitude. The stress-inducing effect of cefotaxime was greater than that of As. Tetracycline resistance genes were more sensitive to stress factors and were the predominant RGs in fish intestines. RGs in duck manure preferentially spread from the water to biofilm and then to fish intestines, whereas co-stress of cefotaxime and As obviously promoted the spread of RGs to fish intestines. In comparison to the control tank, duck manure and stress factors significantly changed the bacterial community of fish intestines. Correlation analysis also revealed that arsB, MOX, tetA and sul1 were significantly correlated with intI1 (P \u003C 0.01), which hinted a potentially dissemination risk of RGs in fish intestines. These findings provide a theoretical basis for further investigating the dissemination of RGs in integrated culture systems and for evaluating the ecological risk of antibiotic and As use in aquaculture.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Min; Xu, Yanbin; Ouyang, Pengqian; Ling, Jiayin; Cai, Qiujie; Du, Qingping; Zheng, Li","journal":"The Science of the total environment","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138693; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408202/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South China"],"keyphrases":["duck manure","spread of RGs","fish-duck pond","dissemination of RGs","predominant RGs","fish tanks","bacterial community of fish intestines","dissemination risk of RGs","relative abundance of RGs","co-stress of cefotaxime","addition of stress factors","effect of cefotaxime","control tank","integrated culture systems","widespread culture mode","Tetracycline resistance genes","experimental tanks","ecological risk of antibiotic","South China","arsB","diversity","sul1","MOX","water","tetA","theoretical basis","present study","comparison","biofilm","Correlation analysis","circulation system","intI1","nutrients","findings","aim","results","orders of magnitude","aquaculture","days"],"language":"en"},

Simple bedside prognostic scores can help immensely in predicting the outcome. MATERIALS AND METHOD A total of 721 patients, from 5 of our previous studies, were included. With primary outcome measure as death, a prognostic model was derived using binary logistic regression. The model was assessed using discrimination and calibration, and internally validated using the bootstrap method. A bedside prognostic score was derived by rounding of the regression coefficients to the nearest integers. RESULTS A total of 126 (17.48%) patients died. The final model found that higher age, stage III disease, baseline MBI \u2264 12, papilledema and hydrocephalus were significant predictors of death. The final model showed good discrimination as evident by an AUC = 83.1% (95% confidence interval 79.5%-86.7%, P \u003C .001) and good calibration (Hosmer and Lemeshow test P = .579). The model remained valid after internal validation by boot strapping. A simple bedside score with the acronym MASH-P to denote variables baseline MBI (M), age (A), stage (S), hydrocephalus (H) and papilledema (P), was thus derived. The score can range from 0 to 10. Higher the score, higher is the probability of death; a score of 0 carries a predicted probability of just 1.7% while a score of 10 corresponds to a predicted probability of 65%. An electronic ready reckoner has also been developed to aid prognostication on the go. CONCLUSION MASH-P is a simple prognostic scoring model that can be used at bedside and aid in decision making as well as counselling.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rizvi, Imran; Malhotra, Hardeep Singh; Garg, Ravindra Kumar; Kumar, Neeraj","journal":"Journal of the neurological sciences","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2020.116877; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408191/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjsxMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Tuberculous"],"organizations":["MBI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prognostic model","simple bedside score","final model","simple prognostic scoring model","Simple bedside prognostic scores","probability of death","acronym MASH-P","CONCLUSION MASH-P","higher age","predicted probability","Lemeshow test P","hydrocephalus","good calibration","stage","good discrimination","papilledema","baseline MBI","poor outcome","patients","total","aid","significant predictors of death","primary outcome measure","regression coefficients","bootstrap method","binary logistic regression","internal validation","Hosmer","disease","boot strapping","variables","nearest integers","AUC","decision","BACKGROUND Tuberculous meningitis","electronic ready reckoner","MATERIALS","previous studies","confidence interval","counselling","prognostication"],"language":"en"},

Low-cost optical sensors for PM measurement are desirable for monitoring exposure closer to the personal level and particularly suited for developing spatiotemporally dense city sensor networks. However, questions remain over the accuracy and reliability of the data they produce, particularly regarding the influence of environmental parameters such as humidity and temperature, and with varying PM sources and concentration profiles. In this study, eight units each of five different models of commercially available low-cost optical PM sensors (40 individual sensors in total) were tested under controlled laboratory conditions, against higher-grade instruments for: lower limit of detection, response time, responses to sharp pollution spikes lasting \u003C1 min , and the impact of differing humidity and PM source. All sensors detected the spikes generated with a varied range of performances depending on the model and presenting different sensitivity mainly to sources of pollution and to size distributions with a lesser impact of humidity. The sensitivity to particle size distribution indicates that the sensors may provide additional information to PM mass concentrations. It is concluded that improved performance in field monitoring campaigns, including tracking sources of pollution, could be achieved by using a combination of some of the different models to take advantage of the additional information made available by their differential response.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bulot, Florentin Michel Jacques; Russell, Hugo Savill; Rezaei, Mohsen; Johnson, Matthew Stanley; Ossont, Steven James Johnston; Morris, Andrew Kevin Richard; Basford, Philip James; Easton, Natasha Hazel Celeste; Foster, Gavin Lee; Loxham, Matthew; Cox, Simon James","journal":"Sensors","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/s20082219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32326452/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjsxNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PM measurement","available low-cost optical PM sensors","varying PM sources","Low-cost optical sensors","individual sensors","PM mass concentrations","different models","different sensitivity","tracking sources of pollution","additional information","sharp pollution spikes","lesser impact of humidity","impact of differing humidity","monitoring exposure closer","response time","size distributions","differential response","field monitoring campaigns","particle size distribution","influence of environmental parameters","key environmental risk factor","higher-grade instruments","lower limit of detection","responses","temperature","diseases","personal level","total","advantage","controlled laboratory conditions","improved performance","Airborne particulate matter","concentration profiles","dense city sensor networks","cardiovascular system","varied range of performances","accuracy","reliability","units","premature deaths","year","questions","data","combination","study"],"language":"en"},

We presented here a robust gene expression-based molecular classification of IDH wild-type diffuse LGG into two subtypes with distinct biological and clinical features. A discovery cohort of 49 IDH wild-type diffuse LGGs from Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) was subjected to clustering and function analysis. 73 tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were used to validate our findings. Consensus clustering of transcriptional data uncovered concordant classification of two robust and prognostically significant subtypes of IDH wild-type LGG. Sub1, associated with poorer outcomes, was characterized by significantly higher immune, cytolytic scores, M2 macrophages and up-regulation of immune exhaustion markers; while Sub2 who had elevated lymphocytes and plasma cells showed relatively favorable survival. Somatic alteration analysis revealed Sub1 showed more frequently deleted regions, such as locus of CDKN2A/CDKN2B, DMRTA1, C9orf53 and MTAP. Furthermore, we developed and validated a five-gene signature for better application of this acquired stratification.

Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a noninvasive imaging modality, which combines a camera with a spectroscope and allows quantitative imaging of tissue oxygenation. Our group developed a software to overlay HSI images onto the operative field, obtaining HSI-based enhanced reality (HYPER). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy of HYPER to identify the demarcation line after a left vascular inflow occlusion during an anatomical left hepatectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS In the porcine model (n = 3), the left branches of the hepatic pedicle were ligated. Before and after vascular occlusion, HSI images based on tissue oxygenation (StO2), obtained through the Near-Infrared index (NIR index), were regularly acquired and superimposed onto RGB video. The demarcation line was marked on the liver surface with electrocautery according to HYPER. Local lactates were measured on blood samples from the liver surface in both ischemic and perfused segments using a strip-based device. At the same areas, confocal endomicroscopy was performed. RESULTS After ligation, HSI demonstrated a significantly lower oxygenation (NIR index) in the left medial lobe (LML) (0.27% \u00B1 0.21) when compared to the right medial lobe (RML) (58.60% \u00B1 12.08; p = 0.0015). Capillary lactates were significantly higher (3.07 mmol/L \u00B1 0.84 vs. 1.33 \u00B1 0.71 mmol/L; p = 0.0356) in the LML versus RML, respectively. Concordantly, confocal videos demonstrated the absence of blood flow in the LML and normal perfusion in the RML. CONCLUSIONS HYPER has made it possible to correctly identify the demarcation line and quantify surface liver oxygenation. HYPER could be an intraoperative tool to guide perfusion-based demarcation line assessment and segmentation.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Urade, Takeshi; Felli, Eric; Barberio, Manuel; Al-Taher, Mahdi; Felli, Emanuele; Goffin, Laurent; Agnus, Vincent; Ettorre, Giuseppe Maria; Marescaux, Jacques; Mutter, Didier; Diana, Michele","journal":"Surgical endoscopy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07586-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32342212/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjsxODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["surface liver oxygenation","HSI images","liver surface","perfusion-based demarcation line assessment","LML","accuracy of HYPER","CONCLUSIONS HYPER","RML","left medial lobe","left branches","NIR index","quantitative imaging of tissue oxygenation","lower oxygenation","left vascular inflow occlusion","non-ischemic liver parenchyma","vascular occlusion","anatomical left hepatectomy","Hyperspectral imaging","strip-based device","mmol","Near-Infrared index","noninvasive imaging modality","right medial lobe","blood samples","normal perfusion","confocal videos","Local lactates","Capillary lactates","confocal endomicroscopy","absence of blood flow","perfused segments","operative field","intraoperative tool","BACKGROUND Clinical evaluation","METHODS","porcine model","camera","spectroscope","StO2","segmentation","enhanced reality","present study","MATERIALS","hepatic pedicle","ligation","software","electrocautery","aim","areas","RESULTS","group","RGB video"],"language":"en"},

AICD is thought to progress through the activation of the extrinsic Fas/FasL pathway of cell death, leading to cytochrome-C release through caspase-8 and Bid activation. We recently described that, early upon AICD induction, mitochondria undergo structural alterations, which are required to promote cytochrome-C release and execute cell death. Here, we found that such alterations do not depend on the Fas/FasL pathway, which is instead only lately activated to amplify the cell death cascade. Instead, such alterations are primarily dependent on the MAPK proteins JNK1 and ERK1/2, which, in turn, regulate the activity of the pro-fission protein Drp1 and the pro-apoptotic factor Bim. The latter regulates cristae disassembly and cooperate with Drp1 to mediate the Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeabilization (MOMP), leading to cytochrome-C release. Interestingly, we found that Bim is also downregulated in T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) cells, this alteration favouring their escape from AICD-mediated control.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Simula, Luca; Corrado, Mauro; Accordi, Benedetta; Di Rita, Anthea; Nazio, Francesca; Antonucci, Ylenia; Di Daniele, Arianna; Caicci, Federico; Caruana, Ignazio; Soriano, Maria Eugenia; Pigazzi, Martina; Locatelli, Franco; Cecconi, Francesco; Campello, Silvia","journal":"Cell death and differentiation","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41418-020-0540-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346136/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjsyMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AICD","MAPK","Mitochondrial Outer Membrane"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell death cascade","FasL pathway of cell death","Activation-Induced Cell Death","cytochrome-C release","shutdown T-cell response","AICD induction","T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia","AICD-mediated control","Bid activation","structural alterations","pro-fission protein Drp1","extrinsic Fas","pro-apoptotic factor Bim","stimulation-dependent form of apoptosis","organism","MOMP","escape","activity","Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeabilization","caspase","MAPK proteins JNK1","cells","source of inflammation","ERK1","progress","generation of immune memory","cristae disassembly","turn"],"language":"en"},

To support a guideline on COVID-19 management, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 and other severe respiratory viral infections. METHODS In March 2020, we searched international and Chinese biomedical literature databases, clinical trial registries and prepublication sources for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized studies comparing patients receiving and not receiving convalescent plasma. We included patients with acute coronavirus, influenza and Ebola virus infections. We conducted a meta-analysis using random-effects models and assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULTS Of 1099 unique records, 6 studies were eligible, and none of these included patients with COVID-19. One nonrandomized study (n = 40) on convalescent plasma in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) provided uninformative results regarding mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] CI 0.01 to 1.70). Pooled estimates from 4 RCTs on influenza (n = 572) showed no convincing effects on deaths (4 RCTs, RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.81), complete recovery (2 RCTs, odds ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.64) or length of stay (3 RCTs, mean difference -1.62, 95% CI -3.82 to 0.58, d). The quality of evidence was very low for all efficacy outcomes. Convalescent plasma caused few or no serious adverse events in influenza RCTs (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.29, low-quality evidence). INTERPRETATION Studies of non- COVID-19 severe respiratory viral infections provide indirect, very low-quality evidence that raises the possibility that convalescent plasma has minimal or no benefit in the treatment of COVID-19 and low-quality evidence that it does not cause serious adverse events.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Devasenapathy, Niveditha; Ye, Zhikang; Loeb, Mark; Fang, Fang; Najafabadi, Borna Tadayon; Xiao, Yingqi; Couban, Rachel; B\u00E9gin, Philippe; Guyatt, Gordon","journal":"CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l\u0027Association medicale canadienne","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.200642; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32444482/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs0Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["efficacy of convalescent plasma","influenza RCTs","meta-analysis of convalescent plasma","low-quality evidence","treatment of COVID","quality of evidence","severe respiratory viral infections","RR","INTERPRETATION Studies of non- COVID","severe coronavirus disease","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","acute coronavirus","nonrandomized studies","included patients","serious adverse events","Ebola virus infections","uninformative results","convincing effects","efficacy outcomes","nonrandomized study","random-effects models","clinical trial registries","prepublication sources","SARS-CoV","Chinese biomedical literature databases","randomized controlled trials","mortality","relative risk","systematic review","Evaluation","Development","Grading of Recommendations Assessment","benefit","possibility","odds ratio","confidence interval","management","unique records","complete recovery","mean difference","deaths","safety","length of stay","GRADE","BACKGROUND","Pooled estimates","approach","guideline","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS This single-institution retrospective study investigated 47 cases of bone tumors treated by MWA from June 2015 to June 2018. The study included 26 patients (55.3%) with benign bone tumors and 21 patients (44.7%) with malignant bone tumors. The tumors were located in the spine or sacrum (15, 31.9%), the upper extremities (6, 12.8%), the lower extremities (17, 36.2%) and the pelvis (9, 19.1%). Outcomes regarding clinical efficacy, including pain relief, quality of life, and intervention-related complications, were evaluated before and after MWA using the visual analog scale (VAS) and the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) scoring system. RESULTS Of the 47 patients included in this study, all of them completed follow-up examinations, with a mean follow-up duration of 4.8 \u00B1 1.6 months (range, 2-9 months). Significantly improved VAS and SF-36 scores were recorded after the initial treatment (P\u003C0.001), suggesting that almost 100% of patients experienced pain relief and an improved quality of life following surgery. No major intervention-related complications (e.g., serious neurovascular injury or infection) occurred during or after the treatment. We recorded only three minor posttreatment complications (6.4%, 3/47), which were related to thermal injury that caused myofasciitis and affected wound healing. CONCLUSION In our study, the short-term efficacy of MWA was considerably favorable, with a relatively low rate of complications. Our results also showed that MWA was effective for pain relief and improved patients\u0027 quality of life, making it a feasible treatment alternative for bone tumors.","publish_time":"2019-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Min-Hao; Xiao, Ling-Fei; Yan, Fei-Fei; Chen, Shi-Liang; Zhang, Chong; Lei, Jun; Deng, Zhou-Ming","journal":"Cancer imaging : the official publication of the International Cancer Imaging Society","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40644-019-0275-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31849340/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs1NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MWA","Short-Form Health Survey","VAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of bone tumors","cases of bone tumors","benign bone tumors","malignant bone tumors","pain relief","short-term efficacy of MWA","present study","improved patients\u0027 quality of life","improved VAS","major intervention-related complications","initial treatment","improved quality of life following surgery","clinical efficacy","single-institution retrospective study","SF","feasible treatment alternative","low rate of complications","minor posttreatment complications","months","RESULTS","short-term clinical performance","follow-up examinations","thermal injury","upper extremities","lower extremities","mean follow-up duration","serious neurovascular injury","safety of percutaneous microwave ablation","techniques","item Short-Form Health Survey","scores","myofasciitis","METHODS","visual analog scale","infection","Outcomes","wound healing","range","OBJECTIVE","spine","CONCLUSION","sacrum","system","pelvis"],"language":"en"},

Detailed data on demographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions, and clinical outcomes for persons hospitalized with COVID-19 are needed to inform prevention strategies and community-specific intervention messages. For this report, CDC, the Georgia Department of Public Health, and eight Georgia hospitals (seven in metropolitan Atlanta and one in southern Georgia) summarized medical record-abstracted data for hospitalized adult patients with laboratory-confirmed* COVID-19 who were admitted during March 2020. Among 305 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 61.6% were aged \u003C65 years, 50.5% were female, and 83.2% with known race/ethnicity were non-Hispanic black (black). Over a quarter of patients (26.2%) did not have conditions thought to put them at higher risk for severe disease, including being aged \u226565 years. The proportion of hospitalized patients who were black was higher than expected based on overall hospital admissions. In an adjusted time-to-event analysis, black patients were not more likely than were nonblack patients to receive invasive mechanical ventilation\u2020 (IMV) or to die during hospitalization (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.35-1.13). Given the overrepresentation of black patients within this hospitalized cohort, it is important for public health officials to ensure that prevention activities prioritize communities and racial/ethnic groups most affected by COVID-19. Clinicians and public officials should be aware that all adults, regardless of underlying conditions or age, are at risk for serious illness from COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gold, Jeremy A W; Wong, Karen K; Szablewski, Christine M; Patel, Priti R; Rossow, John; da Silva, Juliana; Natarajan, Pavithra; Morris, Sapna Bamrah; Fanfair, Robyn Neblett; Rogers-Brown, Jessica; Bruce, Beau B; Browning, Sean D; Hernandez-Romieu, Alfonso C; Furukawa, Nathan W; Kang, Mohleen; Evans, Mary E; Oosmanally, Nadine; Tobin-D\u0027Angelo, Melissa; Drenzek, Cherie; Murphy, David J; Hollberg, Julie; Blum, James M; Jansen, Robert; Wright, David W; Sewell, William M; Owens, Jack D; Lefkove, Benjamin; Brown, Frank W; Burton, Deron C; Uyeki, Timothy M; Bialek, Stephanie R; Jackson, Brendan R","journal":"MMWR.

Morbidities investigation includes a process of excluding other possible options until certain suspected cases are confirmed. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study, we formulated a model under the authorization of the Saudi Ministry of Health to accurately identify cases among admitted suspected cases depending on specific signs and symptoms. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used for confirmation of the positive cases. RESULTS The results showed that the number of patients with combined symptoms of fever/sore throat and fever/cough/SOB was significantly higher in confirmed cases than in non-confirmed cases (p\u003C0.05). Besides, the number of confirmed MERS-CoV cases was significantly higher among cases included in the study than excluded cases. It was also clearly demonstrated that fever combined with other symptoms represents 60% of the confirmed cases, which is significantly higher than for cases with other combined symptoms (p\u003C0.0001).

Despite a plethora of information on the Internet, there is little supporting evidence and no human studies. The risk of multiplex ventilation is that ventilation and PEEP effects are largely uncontrollable and depend on the difference between patient resistance, (R) and compliance (C). It is not clear whether volume control or pressure control is safer or more effective. We designed a simulation-based study to allow complete control over the relevant variables to determine the effects of various degrees of RC imbalance on tidal volume (VT), end-expiratory lung volume (VEE), and imputed pH. METHODS Two separate breathing simulators were ventilated with a ventilator using pressure control (PC) and volume control (VC) breaths. Evidence-based lung models simulated a range of differences in R and C (six pairs of simulated patients). Differences in VT, VEE, and imputed pH were recorded. RESULTS Depending on differences in R and C, differences in VT ranged from 1% (equal R and C) to 79%. Differences in VEE ranged from 2% to 109%. Differences in pH ranged from 0% to 5%. Failure due to excessive tidal volume (\u003E 8 mL/kg) did not occur. Failure due to excessive VEE difference (\u003E 10%) was evident in 50% of patient pairs. There was no difference in failure rate between VC and PC. CONCLUSIONS These experiments confirmed the potential for markedly different ventilation and oxygenation for patients with uneven respiratory system impedances during multiplex ventilation. Three critical problems must be solved to minimize risk: (1) partitioning of inspiratory flow from the ventilator individually between the two patients, (2) measurement of VT delivered to each patient, and (3) provision for individual PEEP. We provide suggestions for solving these problems.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chatburn, Robert L; Branson, Richard D; Hatipo\u011Flu, Umur","journal":"Respiratory care","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.07882; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32345741/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs3NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["volume control","pressure control","range of differences","risk of multiplex ventilation","complete control","different ventilation","excessive tidal volume","excessive VEE difference","pairs of simulated patients","multiple patients","measurement of VT","equal R","patient pairs","imputed pH","end-expiratory lung volume","PC","PEEP effects","VC","failure rate","patient resistance","Evidence-based lung models","individual PEEP","critical problems","little supporting evidence","simulation-based study","effects of various degrees of RC imbalance","oxygenation","uneven respiratory system impedances","mechanical ventilators","Internet","potential","overwhelming demand","relevant variables","BACKGROUND","human studies","separate breathing simulators","partitioning of inspiratory flow","METHODS","experiments","COVID","provision","compliance","breaths","plethora of information","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","suggestions"],"language":"en"},

Currently there are no targeted therapeutics and effective treatment options remain very limited. In order to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, we initiated a program of combined structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening to identify new drug leads that target the COVID-19 virus main protease (Mpro). Mpro is a key CoV enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive drug target for this virus5,6. Here, we identified a mechanism-based inhibitor, N3, by computer-aided drug design and subsequently determined the crystal structure of COVID-19 virus Mpro in complex with this compound. Next, through a combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed over 10,000 compounds including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and other pharmacologically active compounds as inhibitors of Mpro. Six of these compounds inhibited Mpro with IC50 values ranging from 0.67 to 21.4 \u03BCM. Ebselen also exhibited promising antiviral activity in cell-based assays. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening strategy, which can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new infectious diseases for which no specific drugs or vaccines are available.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jin, Zhenming; Du, Xiaoyu; Xu, Yechun; Deng, Yongqiang; Liu, Meiqin; Zhao, Yao; Zhang, Bing; Li, Xiaofeng; Zhang, Leike; Peng, Chao; Duan, Yinkai; Yu, Jing; Wang, Lin; Yang, Kailin; Liu, Fengjiang; Jiang, Rendi; Yang, Xinglou; You, Tian; Liu, Xiaoce; Yang, Xiuna; Bai, Fang; Liu, Hong; Liu, Xiang; Guddat, Luke W; Xu, Wenqing; Xiao, Gengfu; Qin, Chengfeng; Shi, Zhengli; Jiang, Hualiang; Rao, Zihe; Yang, Haitao","journal":"Nature","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2223-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32272481/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs3OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virtual drug screening","drug candidates","new drug leads","virus Mpro","attractive drug target","inhibitors of Mpro","lead compounds","computer-aided drug design","rapid discovery of drug leads","high-throughput screening","screening strategy","active compounds","crystal structure of COVID","clinical potential","clinical trials","clinical use","new coronavirus","combination of structure","new infectious diseases","virus main protease","program of combined structure","cell-based assays","mechanism-based inhibitor","specific drugs","approved drugs","viral replication","key CoV enzyme","viral pneumonia outbreak","response","N3","promising antiviral activity","effective treatment options","pivotal role","transcription","targeted therapeutics","complex","etiological agent responsible","IC50 values","Ebselen","Wuhan1","vaccines","efficacy","virus5","results","order","\u03BCM"],"language":"en"},

The core principle underlying the methodology is the recognition that synergistic relationships, characterised by mutual trust and respect, between affected communities and official institutions provide the most effective means of addressing outbreak situations. METHODS The methodological approach and lessons learned were derived from four qualitative case studies including (i) two tick-borne disease events (Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever in Spain, 2016, and tick-borne encephalitis in the Netherlands, 2016); and (ii) two outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis (norovirus in Iceland, 2017, and verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli [VTEC] in Ireland, 2018). An after-event qualitative case study approach was taken using mixed methods. The studies were conducted in collaboration with the respective national public health authorities in the affected countries by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The analysis focused on the specific actions undertaken by the participating countries\u0027 public health and other authorities in relation to community engagement, as well as the view from the perspective of affected communities. RESULTS Lessons highlight the critical importance of collaborating with ECDC National Focal Points during preparation and planning and with anthropological experts. Field work for each case study was conducted over one working week, which although limiting the number of individuals and institutions involved, still allowed for rich data collection due to the close collaboration with local authorities. The methodology enabled efficient extraction of synergies between authorities and communities. Implementing the methodology required a reflexivity among fieldworkers that ackowledges that different versions of reality can co-exist in the social domain. The method allowed for potential generalisability across studies. Issues of extra attention included insider-outsider perspectives, politically sensitivity of findings, and how to deal with ethical and language issues. CONCLUSIONS The overall objective of the assessment is to identify synergies between institutional decision-making bodies and community actors and networks before, during and after an outbreak response to a given public health emergency. The methodology is generic and could be applied to a range of public health emergencies, zoonotic or otherwise.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Vries, Daniel H; Kinsman, John; Takacs, Judit; Tsolova, Svetla; Ciotti, Massimo","journal":"BMC health services research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-05298-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32393259/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs4MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control","ECDC National Focal Points"],"locations":["Iceland"],"keyphrases":["respective national public health authorities","perspective of affected communities","participatory methodology","qualitative case studies","participating countries\u0027 public health","given public health emergency","range of public health emergencies","synergistic collaboration","local authorities","affected countries","tick-borne disease events","infectious disease outbreak events","Disease Prevention","close collaboration","relevant official institutions","outbreak response","outbreak situations","event qualitative case study approach","ECDC National Focal Points","synergistic relationships","community actors","community engagement","methodological approach","tick-borne encephalitis","RESULTS Lessons","mixed methods","language issues","efficient extraction of synergies","Issues of extra attention","preparation","Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever","insider-outsider perspectives","planning","Spain","institutional decision-making bodies","European Centre","critical importance","different versions of reality","mutual trust","ackowledges","assessment","fieldworkers","Control","effective means","investigation","specific actions","norovirus","Escherichia coli","VTEC","Iceland","verocytotoxin","networks","rich data collection","reflexivity","recognition","view","outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis","sensitivity of findings","CONCLUSIONS","overall objective","Ireland","anthropological experts","potential generalisability","working week","BACKGROUND","paper","Field work","social domain","number of individuals","core principle","analysis","Netherlands"],"language":"en"},

The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the cell via ACE2. ACE2 is a component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) which has an important counterregulatory effect on the classical ACE-dependent pathway. Several antihypertensives increase ACE2 expression or activity, leading to concern that this may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry and worsen COVID-19 disease. However, ACE2 is protective against lung injury while ANG II (which is catabolised by ACE2) is associated with lung injury both in mice and humans. We propose that medications which inhibit the RAS ACE-dependent pathway may be beneficial in treating COVID-19 and should be explored in animal models and clinical trials. Here we give an overview of the RAS pathway with respect to COVID-19 and argue that strategies which manipulate this pathway might reduce the destructive lung manifestations of COVID-19 and improve patient outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sturrock, Beattie Rh; Milne, Kate; Chevassut, Timothy Jt","journal":"Clinical medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmed.2020-0146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32414711/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs4ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ANG II","RAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RAS pathway","ACE2 expression","SARS-CoV","RAS ACE-dependent pathway","destructive lung manifestations of COVID","life-threatening lung injury","classical ACE-dependent pathway","disease","important counterregulatory effect","renin-angiotensin system","fatigue","activity","component","virus","respect","entry","animal models","clinical trials","cough","fever","concern","antihypertensives","mice","humans","overview","cell","infection","patient outcomes","medications","strategies","patients"],"language":"en"},

Methods We retrospectively analyzed all primary spontaneous pneumothorax patients who underwent treatment at Gangnam Severance Hospital between August 2014 and May 2018. Results A total of 279 patients were divided into 2 groups: the conventional group (n=236) and the Thoracic Egg group (n=43). Of the 236 patients in the conventional group, 100 were excluded because they underwent surgery during the study period. The efficacy and cost were compared between the 2 groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups regarding recurrence (conventional group, 36 patients [26.5%]; Thoracic Egg group, 15 patients [29.4%]; p=0.287). However, the Egg group had statistically significantly lower mean medical expenses than the conventional group (433,413 Korean won and 522,146 Korean won, respectively; p\u003C0.001).

According to the Fifth Edition of the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines by the National Health Commission, the patients were divided into common type, severe type and critical type. The imaging characteristics including the lung sides of the lesions, lung segment involved, lesion distribution, and lesion number and density were compared among the patients with different clinical types of COVID-19. RESULTS Seventy-seven of the patients had common type, 18 had severe type and 7 had critical type of COVID-19. The main clinical manifestations included fever, cough and fatigue. Severe and critical types were more frequently seen in elderly patients, who were more prone to show such symptoms as asthenia, breathing difficulty and dyspnea. Two patients presented with no obvious abnormality in the first CT examinations; in the remaining 100 patients, 89.0% had bilateral lung lesions, 16.0% had diffuse lesions, involving a mean of 6.56\u00B14.22 lung segments.

This is partly because of inconsistencies in testing and death reporting standards across countries. Our purpose is to provide accurate estimates which do not rely on testing and death count data directly but only use population level statistics. Methods: We collected demographic and death records data from the Italian Institute of Statistics. We focus on the area in Italy that experienced the initial outbreak of COVID-19 and estimated a Bayesian model fitting age-stratified mortality data from 2020 and previous years. We also assessed the sensitivity of our estimates to alternative assumptions on the proportion of population infected. Findings: We estimate an overall infection fatality rate of 1.29% (95% credible interval [CrI] 0.89 - 2.01), as well as large differences by age, with a low infection fatality rate of 0.05% for under 60 year old (CrI 0-.19) and a substantially higher 4.25% (CrI 3.01-6.39) for people above 60 years of age. In our sensitivity analysis, we found that even under extreme assumptions, our method delivered useful information. For instance, even if only 10% of the population were infected, the infection fatality rate would not rise above 0.2% for people under 60. Interpretation: Our empirical estimates based on population level data show a sharp difference in fatality rates between young and old people and firmly rule out overall fatality ratios below 0.5% in populations with more than 30% over 60 years old.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rinaldi, Gianluca; Paradisi, Matteo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee051463c7f6538465035105d6a56c697c36c097.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.18.20070912v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs1MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Institute of Statistics"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["overall infection fatality rate","infection fatality ratio","fatality rates","low infection fatality rate","population level data","overall fatality ratios","years of age","old people","years old","CrI","death records data","death count data","population level statistics","proportion of population","testing","empirical estimates","accurate estimates","previous years","year old","Bayesian model fitting age-stratified mortality data","death reporting standards","alternative assumptions","extreme assumptions","sensitivity analysis","Italian Institute of Statistics","initial outbreak of COVID","sharp difference","inconsistencies","countries","months","disease","useful information","Italy","large differences","area","pandemic","Background","coronavirus","credible interval","purpose","Methods","Interpretation","populations","Findings","instance"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study is to better understand the pathogenic mechanisms underlying COVID-19, deciphering the carbohydrate-mediated interactions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We studied the carbohydrate-binding receptors that could be important for viral entry and for immune-modulatory responses, and we studied the interactions of the spike protein with the host lung microbiota. Exploring solid-phase immunoassays, we evaluated the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and a library of 12 different human carbohydrate-binding proteins (C-type lectins and Siglecs) involved in binding, triggering and modulation of innate and adaptive immune-responses. We revealed a specific binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the receptors DC-SIGN, MGL, Siglec-9 and Siglec-10 that are all expressed on myeloid immune cells. In addition, because the lung microbiota can promote or modulate viral infection, we studied the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and a library of Streptococcus pneumoniae capsular polysaccharides, as well as other bacterial glyco-conjugates. We show specific binding of the spike protein to different S. pneumoniae capsular polysaccharides (serotypes 19F and 23F but not to serotype 14). Moreover we demonstrated a specific binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the lipopolysaccharide from the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one of the leading cause of acute nosocomial infections and pneumonia. Interestingly, we identified rhamnosylated epitopes as one of the discriminating structures in lung microbiota to bind SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. In conclusion, we revealed novel ACE2-independent carbohydrate-mediated interactions with immune modulating lectins expressed on myeloid cells, as well as host lung microbiota glyco-conjugates. Our results identified new molecular pathways using host lectins and signalling, that may contribute to viral infection and subsequent immune exacerbation. Moreover we identified specific rhamnosylated epitopes in lung microbiota to bind SARS-CoV-2, providing a hypothetical link between the presence of specific lung microbiota and SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chiodo, Fabrizio; Bruijns, Sven C.M.; Rodriguez, Ernesto; Li, R.J.

Against this backdrop, the authors of this study investigate which offerings industrial customers are most likely to purchase as the pandemic progresses. Drawing on positive decision theory and empirically investigating 31,353 sales opportunities across 57 countries, the authors show that the coronavirus pandemic significantly decreases industrial customers\u0027 purchase probability, especially for high-priced offerings. In countries with low uncertainty avoidance and strong long-term orientation (e.g., China, India, Singapore), purchase probability is less affected by the pandemic. The coronavirus pandemic even increases purchase probability for offerings with low prices in countries where cultures are simultaneously uncertainty-avoidant and short-term oriented (e.g., Argentina, Brazil, Mexico). This is presumably because customers safeguard their operations in the face of impending supply shortages. Consequently, this helps suppliers focus on the right sales opportunities to secure their business during exogenous global shocks such as the coronavirus pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Habel, Johannes; Jarotschkin, Viktor; Schmitz, Bianca; Eggert, Andreas; Pl\u00F6tner, Olaf","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0deb3b8105a55740da4c28d729075c77e7e00b0a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019850120304351; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019850120304351?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs1NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Argentina","Brazil","Mexico"],"keyphrases":["coronavirus pandemic","pandemic progresses","countries","industrial customers\u0027 purchase probability","offerings industrial customers","industrial suppliers","right sales opportunities","open sales opportunities","business","high-priced offerings","authors","low uncertainty avoidance","low prices","uncertainty-avoidant","suppliers focus","strong long-term orientation","China","India","cultures","study","exogenous global shocks","Argentina","face of impending supply shortages","operations","Singapore","Brazil","positive decision theory","onset","Mexico","backdrop","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

While many countries were affected, regions with an older population and weaker public health interventions tended to suffer more morbidity and mortality. Here we model and quantify the age-specific incidence of COVID-19 in four pandemic cities under different interventions. Methods We developed an age-specific and multiple-stage susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-hospitalized-quarantined-dead (SEIR-HQD) dynamical systems model expanded from the more basic SEIR model by incorporating location- and age-specific contact matrices to estimate the outcomes of COVID-19. Utilizing latest estimates of epidemiological parameters and demographic data, we model the potential effects of various interventions in four representative cities with different population structures - New York, Los Angeles, Daegu and Nairobi. We compared the effects of different interventions in the age-structure populations specific to each city. These policy options are then applied to determine the potential for effective containment. We model these dynamic policy scenarios to assess the risks of less-stringent social distancing, as has been proposed by those arguing to enhance economic activity over public health and safety. Finally, we explored the health impacts of different policy action timelines to understand the benefits of early interventions. Findings We find the spread of COVID-19 to be dramatically different in the regions modeled, with the primary drivers the variation of population age structures, and the dynamics of interactions of the younger demographics, whose higher interaction rates can lead to increasing transmission rates across these communities. A city with younger citizens may also have fewer hospitalized cases and deaths. Our modeling quantifies the value of early interventions, which avoided an additional 5%, 16%, 37% and 43% of the infections in Daegu, Nairobi, New York and Los Angeles, respectively, compared to what has been observed in the four cities. The finding is clear: in the absence of pharmaceutical options, delaying strict social policy interventions has resulted in substantial public health cost. This modeling can, and will, be applied to other cities and regions, and conducted in conjunction with other health insults, such as exposure to air pollution. Critically, we find that school closures, working from home, and reduction in other mobility were most beneficial for younger population (0-19 years old), middle-age (20-59 years old) population and older population (60 years and older), respectively across each city. Specifically, school closure avoided 25%, 18%, 16% and 12% of the infections for the population under 20 years old in Daegu, Los Angeles, New York and Nairobi, respectively. A 50% and 80% population working from home policy avoids 8% and 15% of the infections. Reduction in mobility was more effective than the working from home strategy. Any single social distancing policy if enacted alone can delay the spread of COVID-19 but was unable to totally suppress the infection. Coordinated policy action can be highly effective. Increasing the quarantine rate to 10% of infectious cases was more effective than strict social distancing alone in this study, although together they can suppress 80% of the epidemic. A combination of moderate social distancing and quarantine strategies was able to avoid 99% of the infections. Interpretation Moderate social distancing together with high quarantine rates was effective in each of the four cities. COVID-19 caused more deaths and hospitalization in cities with an ageing population than those with a younger population. However, in the cities with a younger population, there is a clear need to implement a social distancing strategy that is even more strict due to the higher transmission rates among younger people. Cities with more older people should prepare more hospital beds and healthcare facilities to save people who are in critical conditions. Cities with ageing population should take targeted action for the elderly to avoid the severe impacts on the vulnerable populations. Increasing quarantine rate is an effective strategy to avoid the substantial infection while also does not influence the economy fiercely. We recommend countries or regions experiencing, or likely to experience the rapid spread of COVID-19, to implement combination of multiple strategies in the early stage of the breakout which can avoid over 90% of infected cases.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yin, H.; Liu, Z.; Kammen, D.

Our inspection is motivated by the renormalization group (RG) framework. Here we propose the RG-inspired logistic function of the form \u03B1E(t) = a(1 \u002B ec(t-t0))-n as an epidemic strength function with n being asymmetry in the modified logistic function. We perform the non-linear least-squares analysis with data from various countries. The uncertainty for model parameters is computed using the squared root of the corresponding diagonal components of the covariance matrix. We carefully divide countries under consideration into 2 categories based on the estimation of the inflection point: the maturing phase and the growth-dominated phase. We observe that long-term estimations of cumulative infected cases of countries in the maturing phase for both n=1 and n\u2260 1 are close to each other. We find from the value of root mean squared error (RMSE) that the RG-inspired logistic model with n\u2260 1 is slightly preferable in this category. We also argue that n determines the characteristic of the epidemic at an early stage. However, in the second category, the estimated asymptotic number of cumulative infected cases contain rather large uncertainty. Therefore, in the growth-dominated phase, we focus on using n\u2260 1 for countries in this phase. Some of them are in an early stage of an epidemic with an insufficient amount of data leading to a large uncertainty on parameter fits. In terms of the accuracy of the size estimation, the results do strongly depend on limitations on data collection and the epidemic phase for each country.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pongkitivanichkul, Chakrit; Samart, Daris; Tangphati, Takol; Koomhin, Phanit; Pimton, Pimchanok; Dam-O, Punsiri; Payaka, Apirak; Channuie, Phongpichit","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/98e5d8963ec99952da4e0888a64546e052bd661f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.28.20044339","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs1NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epidemic phase","maturing phase","epidemic data of cumulative infected cases","growth-dominated phase","epidemic strength function","various countries","long-term estimations of cumulative infected cases of countries","data collection","large uncertainty","logistic model","modified logistic function","estimated asymptotic number of cumulative infected cases","squared root","early stage","category","squared error","value of root","size estimation","model parameters","t-t0","asymmetry","corresponding diagonal components","squares analysis","covariance matrix","renormalization group","RMSE","form \u03B1E","limitations","inflection point","accuracy","results","framework","parameter fits","categories","characteristic","terms","inspection","consideration","country"],"language":"en"},

To this end, phylogenomic approaches leverage accumulating genomic mutations as barcodes to track the evolutionary history of the virus and can benefit from the surge of sequences deposited in public databases. Yet, such methods typically rely on consensus sequences representing the dominant virus lineage, whereas a complex sublineage architecture is often observed within single hosts. Furthermore, most approaches do not account for variants accumulation processes and might produce inaccurate results in condition of limited sampling, as witnessed in most countries currently affected by the epidemics. We here introduce a new framework for the characterization of viral (sub)lineage evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which considers both clonal and intra-host minor variants and exploits the achievements of cancer evolution research to account for mutation accumulation and uncertainty in the data. The application of our approach to 18 SARS-CoV-2 samples for which raw sequencing data are available reveals a high-resolution phylogenomic model, which confirms and improves recent findings on viral types and highlights the existence of patterns of co-occurrence of minor variants, uncovering likely infection paths among hosts harboring the same viral lineage. Our findings confirm a significant increase of genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in time, which is reflected in minor variants, and show that standard methods may struggle when handling datasets with important sampling limitations. Importantly, our framework allows to pinpoint minor variants that might be positively selected across distinct lineages and regions of the viral genome under purifying selection, thus driving the design of treatments and vaccines. In particular, minor variant g.29039A\u003EU, detected in multiple viral lineages and validated on an independent dataset, shows that SARS-CoV-2 can lose its main Nucleocapsid immunogenic epitopes, raising concerns about the effectiveness of vaccines targeting the C-terminus of this protein. To conclude, we advocate the use of our framework in combination with data-driven epidemiological models, to deliver a high-precision platform for pathogen detection, surveillance and analysis.","publish_time":"2020-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ramazzotti, Daniele; Angaroni, Fabrizio; Maspero, Davide; Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo; Antoniotti, Marco; Graudenzi, Alex; Piazza, Rocco","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95aed45ab40a7af4d7935e01c77173b3864a6ee5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.22.044404","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs1NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","evolution of SARS","co-occurrence of minor variants","lineage evolution","viral types","viral genome","characterization of viral","transmission of SARS","intra-host minor variants","variants accumulation processes","multiple viral lineages","dominant virus lineage","significant increase of genomic diversity of SARS","account","new framework","raw sequencing data","phylogenomic approaches leverage","reliable epidemiological models","genomic mutations","mutation accumulation","achievements of cancer evolution research","consensus sequences","surge of sequences","distinct lineages","standard methods","effectiveness of vaccines","single hosts","recent findings","high-resolution phylogenomic model","important sampling limitations","condition of limited sampling","inaccurate results","pathogen detection","concerns","handling datasets","barcodes","likely infection paths","high-precision platform","surveillance","complex sublineage architecture","regions","existence of patterns","combination","samples","main Nucleocapsid immunogenic epitopes","purifying selection","global cross-discipline effort","uncertainty","independent dataset","C-terminus","evolutionary history","analysis","design of treatments","public databases","diffusion","time","protein","countries","use","application","epidemics"],"language":"en"},

These sdAbs revealed binding kinetics with the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 0.7~33 nM.

Population-based serosurveys provide one avenue for estimating infection rates and monitoring the progression of the epidemic, overcoming many of these limitations. Methods: Taking advantage of a pool of adult participants from population-representative surveys conducted in Geneva, Switzerland, we implemented a study consisting of 8 weekly serosurveys among these participants and their household members older than 5 years. We tested each participant for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Euroimmun AG, Lubeck, Germany). We estimated seroprevalence using a Bayesian regression model taking into account test performance and adjusting for the age and sex of Geneva\u0027s population. Results: In the first three weeks, we enrolled 1335 participants coming from 633 households, with 16% \u003C20 years of age and 53.6% female, a distribution similar to that of Geneva. In the first week, we estimated a seroprevalence of 3.1% (95% CI 0.2-5.99, n=343). This increased to 6.1% (95% CI 2.6-9.33, n=416) in the second, and to 9.7% (95% CI 6.1-13.11, n=576) in the third week. We found that 5-19 year-olds (6.0%, 95% CI 2.3-10.2%) had similar seroprevalence to 20-49 year olds (8.5%, 95%CI 4.99-11.7), while significantly lower seroprevalence was observed among those 50 and older (3.7%, 95% CI 0.99-6.0, p=0.0008). Interpretation: Assuming that the presence of IgG antibodies is at least in the short-term associated with immunity, these results highlight that the epidemic is far from burning out simply due to herd immunity. Further, no differences in seroprevalence between children and middle age adults are observed. These results must be considered as Switzerland and the world look towards easing restrictions aimed at curbing transmission.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stringhini, S.; Wisniak, A.; Piumatti, G.; Azman, A.

Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of 2019-nCoV. We used data on air travel volumes departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of introduction per country. We determined the countries capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulation Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, with the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing the most to their risk. Findings: Countries at the highest importation risk (Egypt, Algeria, Republic of South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, Kenya) have variable capacity and high vulnerability. Three clusters of countries are identified that share the same exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and Beijing, respectively. Interpretation: Several countries in Africa are stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with 2019-nCoV importations. Resources and intensified surveillance and capacity capacity should be urgently prioritized towards countries at moderate risk that may be ill-prepared to face the importation and to limit onward transmission.","publish_time":"2020-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gilbert, Marius; Pullano, Giulia; Pinotti, Francesco; Valdano, Eugenio; Poletto, Chiara; Boelle, Pierre-Yves; D\u0027Ortenzio, Eric; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan; Eholie, Serge Paul; Altmann, Mathias; Gutierrez, Bernardo; Kraemer, Moritz U.

One barrier to widespread testing has been a paucity of traditional respiratory viral swab collection kits relative to the demand. Whether other sample collection kits, such as widely available MRSA nasal swabs can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. Methods: We compared simultaneous nasal MRSA swabs (COPAN ESwabs 480C flocked nasal swab in 1mL of liquid Amies medium) and virals wabs (BD H192(07) flexible mini-tip flocked nasopharyngeal swabs in 3mL Universal Transport Medium) for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing using Simplexa COVID-19 Direct assay on patients over a 4-day period. When the results were discordant, the viral swab sample was run again on the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay. Results: Of the 81 included samples, there were 19 positives and 62 negatives in viral media and 18 positives and 63 negative in the MRSA swabs. Amongst all included samples, there was concordance between the COPAN ESwabs 480C and the viral swabs in 78 (96.3%). Conclusion: We found a high rate of concordance in test results between COPAN ESwabs 480C in Amies solution and BD H192(07) nasopharyngeal swabs in in 3 mL of Universal Viral Transport medium viral media. Clinicians and laboratories should feel better informed and assured using COPAN ESwabs 480C to help in the diagnosis of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Federman, D.

The SARS-CoV-2 was found to be closely related to the SARS-CoV, based on the genomic analysis. The Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 protein (ACE2) utilized by the SARS-CoV as a receptor was found to facilitate the infection of SARS-CoV-2 as well, initiated by the binding of the spike protein to the human ACE2. Using homology modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods, we report here the detailed structure of the ACE2 in complex with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The predicted model is highly consistent with the experimentally determined complex structures. Plausible binding modes between human ACE2 and the RBD were revealed from all-atom MD simulations. The simulation data further revealed critical residues at the complex interface and provided more details about the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and human ACE2. Two mutants mimicking rat ACE2 were modeled to study the mutation effects on RBD binding to ACE2. The simulations showed that the N-terminal helix and the K353 of the human ACE2 alter the binding modes of the CoV2-RBD to the ACE2.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lupala, Cecylia S.; Li, Xuanxuan; Lei, Jian; Chen, Hong; Qi, Jianxun; Liu, Haiguang; Su, Xiao-dong","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e31a311e160a1814381ec2660e59bd6e7065f47.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.005561","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["RBD"],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","human ACE2","RBD binding","rat ACE2","infection of SARS","CoV2-RBD","Plausible binding modes","receptor binding domain","spike protein","complex interface","complex structures","simulation methods","all-atom MD simulations","simulation data","molecular dynamics","critical residues","K353","mutation effects","COVID","pneumonia","homology modeling","N-terminal helix","details","detailed structure","end","outbreak","causal pathogen","Angiotensin","enzyme","novel coronavirus","interactions","Wuhan","China","predicted model","genomic analysis","mutants"],"language":"en"},

We summarized and compared the guidelines published by national and international societies/organizations on facemasks and respirators to prevent COVID-19 in healthcare settings. Methods From the 1st January to the 2nd April 2020, guidelines published in four countries (France, Germany, United States, United Kingdom), and two international organizations (US and European Center for Diseases Control, and World Health Organization) were reviewed to analyze the mask and respirators recommended as PPE for the care of patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. Guidelines were eligible for analysis if they (1) included specific guidelines, (2) were written for HCP protection, (3) targeting healthcare settings. The strategy recommended for optimizing supplies and overcoming shortages was collected. Observations The guidelines publication process on respiratory protections varied greatly across countries. Some referred to a unique guide whereas others saw the issue of multiple recommendations by various societies and organization. In term of chronology, most guidelines were published in March with either downgraded (US and European CDC), relatively stable (WHO, Germany, and UK), or a mixing of high and low level equipment (France). The recommendation of respirators was universally recommended for aerosol generating procedures (AGP) across countries, although the type of respirators and what constituted an AGP was variable. Some guidance maintained the use of N95/99 for all contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases (i.e. Germany) whereas others, recommended a surgical mask (i.e. WHO, UK, France). The strategies to overcome shortage of respiratory protection equipment were based on minimizing the need and rationalizing the use, but also prolonging their use, reusing them after cleaning/sterilization, or using cloth masks. Conclusions Stable and consistent guidelines inside and across countries, clearly detailing the respiratory protection type, and the circumstances in which they need to be used may prevent the confusion among frontline staff, and avoid shortage.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Birgand, Gabriel; Mutters, Nico T.; Otter, Jonathan; Eichel, Vanessa M.; Lepelletier, Didier; Morgan, Daniel J.; Lucet, Jean Christophe","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.23.20077230v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["European Center for Diseases Control","World Health Organization","PPE","HCP","European CDC","UK","AGP"],"locations":["Germany","United States","France"],"keyphrases":["specific guidelines","countries","Introduction Consistent guidelines","respiratory protection type","guidelines publication process","shortage of respiratory protection equipment","France","Germany","type of respirators","respiratory protections","HCP protection","confirmed COVID","healthcare settings","recommendation of respirators","international societies","international organizations","healthcare professionals","AGP","UK","use of N95","need","United Kingdom","European Center","various societies","United States","European CDC","frontline staff","care of patients","Conclusions Stable","surgical mask","low level equipment","World Health Organization","Diseases Control","improved global supply chains","issue of multiple recommendations","mixing of high","facemasks","contact","cases","PPE","Observations","sterilization","cleaning","aerosol","procedures","circumstances","strategies","cloth masks","supplies","unique guide","confusion","guidance","analysis","term of chronology","outbreak","strategy","shortages","Methods"],"language":"en"},

First evidence from China suggests that HCWs are at risk for anxiety and depression. However, generalizability to western countries is limited. The current study aimed at exploring HCWs mental health during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Switzerland. In addition, we conducted a network analysis to investigate the independent effect of risk and protective factors on HCWs mental health and their interplay. Methods: In an exploratory, cross-sectional, nation-wide online survey, we assessed demographics, work characteristics, COVID-19 exposure, and anxiety, depression, and burnout in 857 physicians and 553 nurses during the pandemic in Switzerland. At the time of data collection, Switzerland had among the highest per capita rate of COVID-19 cases in the world. Results: Overall symptom levels of anxiety, depression, and burnout were elevated. Women, nurses, frontline staff and HCWs exposed to COVID-19 patients reported more symptoms than their peers. However, these effects were all small and, in the network analysis, most of them did not remain significant after controlling for the other factors. Whereas COVID-19 exposure was only partially associated with mental health, perceived support by the employer independently predicted anxiety and burnout. Conclusions: Our finding that HCWs had elevated levels of anxiety, depression, and burnout underscores the importance to systematically monitor HCWs mental health during this ongoing pandemic. Because perceived support and mental health impairments were negatively related, we encourage the implementation of supportive measures for HCWs well-being during this crisis.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weilenmann, S.; Ernst, J.; Petry, H.; Sazpinar, O.; Pfaltz, M.

Italy, the Western country with most COVID-19 related deaths, was the first to implement drastic containment measures in early March, 2020. Since then most other European countries, the USA, Canada and Australia, have implemented similar restrictions, ranging from school closures, banning of recreational activities and large events, to complete lockdown. Such limitations, and softer promotion of social distancing, may be more effective in one society than in another due to cultural or political differences. It is therefore important to evaluate the effectiveness of these initiatives by analyzing country-specific COVID-19 data. We propose to model COVID-19 dynamics with a SIQR (susceptible - infectious - quarantined - recovered) model, since confirmed positive cases are isolated and do not transmit the disease. We provide an explicit formula that is easily implemented and permits us to fit official COVID-19 data in a series of Western countries. We found excellent agreement with data-driven estimation of the day-of-change in disease dynamics and the dates when official interventions were introduced. Our analysis predicts that for most countries only the more drastic restrictions have reduced virus spreading. Further, we predict that the number of unidentified COVID-19-positive individuals at the beginning of the epidemic is \u223C10 times the number of confirmed cases. Our results provide important insight for future planning of non-pharmacological interventions aiming to contain spreading of COVID-19 and similar diseases.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pedersen, Morten Gram; Meneghini, Matteo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce77d82036e9d3fdf087a23854299f31373991f8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.20057075","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["official COVID","model COVID","country-specific COVID","number of unidentified COVID","disease dynamics","Western country","similar restrictions","official interventions","drastic restrictions","positive cases","series of Western countries","European countries","number of confirmed cases","data-driven estimation","important insight","positive individuals","similar diseases","drastic containment measures","future planning of non-pharmacological interventions","recreational activities","large events","school closures","Canada","day","dates","softer promotion of social distancing","epidemic","results","USA","excellent agreement","Australia","change","times","SIQR","initiatives","complete lockdown","limitations","susceptible - infectious","beginning","effectiveness","related deaths","political differences","society","virus","Italy","impact","pandemic","explicit formula","analysis","world"],"language":"en"},

Here we describe a novel point-mutated allele (shani) of mouse Spata22 that we isolated in a forward genetic screen. shani mutant mice phenocopy Spata22-null and Meiob-null mice: mutant cells appear to form DSBs and initiate meiotic recombination, but are unable to complete DSB repair, leading to meiotic prophase arrest, apoptosis and sterility. shani mutants show precocious loss of DMC1 foci and improper accumulation of BLM-positive recombination foci, reinforcing the requirement of SPATA22-MEIOB for the proper progression of meiotic recombination events. The shani mutation lies within a Spata22 coding exon and molecular characterization shows that it leads to incorrect splicing of the Spata22 mRNA, ultimately resulting in no detectable SPATA22 protein. We propose that the shani mutation alters an exonic splicing enhancer element (ESE) within the Spata22 transcript. The affected DNA nucleotide is conserved in most tetrapods examined, suggesting that the splicing regulation we describe here may be a conserved feature of Spata22 regulation.","publish_time":"2020-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petrillo, Cynthia; Barroca, Vilma; Ribeiro, Jonathan; Lailler, Nathalie; Livera, Gabriel; Keeney, Scott; Martini, Emmanuelle; Jain, Devanshi","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/276c16dd4bc0d50bbeb0bcfc6e6bf68ce1cfa828.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.04.934042","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["requirement of SPATA22","Spata22 mRNA","mouse Spata22","Spata22 transcript","Spata22 coding exon","detectable SPATA22 protein","shani mutant mice phenocopy Spata22-null","shani mutation","conserved feature of Spata22 regulation","shani mutants","positive recombination foci","proper progression of meiotic recombination events","splicing regulation","Meiob-null mice","meiotic prophase arrest","DSBs","incorrect splicing","proper repair of double","mutant cells","complete DSB repair","precocious loss of DMC1 foci","improper accumulation of BLM","strand breaks","functional collaborator","direct binding partner","ESE","exonic","enhancer element","novel point-mutated allele","molecular characterization","apoptosis","sterility","chromosome","segregation","tetrapods","affected DNA nucleotide","meiosis","genetic screen"],"language":"en"},

However, pandemics are still part of our modern world, as we continue to have pandemics as devastating as HIV and as alarming as severe acute respiratory syndrome, Ebola and the Middle East respiratory syndrome. The Covid-19 epidemic with 0-exponential contamination curves reaching 3 million confirmed cases should not have come as a surprise, nor should it have been the last pandemic in the world. In this article, we try to summarize the lost opportunities as well as the lessons learned, hoping that we can do better in the future. The objective of this study is to relate the situation of Covid-19 in African countries with those of the countries most affected by the pandemic. It also allows us to verify how, according to the observed situation, the African ecosystem seems to be much more resilient compared to that of other continents where the number of deaths is in the thousands. To verify this, the diagnosed morbidity and mortality reported for different states of the world are compared to the ages of life and the average annual temperature of these states. The results show that the less dramatic balance of the African continent compared to other continents is partly linked to the relatively high temperatures on the continent but also to the relatively young character of its population.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Faye, C.; Wade, C.; Dione, I.

To uncover the sources of SARS-CoV-2 introductions and patterns of spread within the U.S., we sequenced nine viral genomes from early reported COVID-19 patients in Connecticut. Our phylogenetic analysis places the majority of these genomes with viruses sequenced from Washington state. By coupling our genomic data with domestic and international travel patterns, we show that early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Connecticut was likely driven by domestic introductions. Moreover, the risk of domestic importation to Connecticut exceeded that of international importation by mid-March regardless of our estimated impacts of federal travel restrictions.

Grounded on the complex networks approach, cities are here represented as nodes and the flows as weighted edges - these geographical graphs, (geo)graphs, are handled in a Geographical Information System. We adopt the IBGE database from 2016, which contains the weekly flow of people between cities in terrestrial vehicles. The present work aims to investigate the correspondences of the networks\u0027 measures, like strength, degree, and betweenness with the emergence of cities with confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Brazil, and special attention is given to the state of Sao Paulo. We show that the results are better when certain thresholds are applied to the networks\u0027 flows to neglect the lowest-frequency travels. The correspondences presented statistical significance for most measures up to a certain period. Until the end of April, the best matchings are with the strength measure (total flow related to a node/city) under a high flow threshold in the Sao Paulo state, when the most connected cities are reached. After this stage, the lower thresholds become more suitable, indicating a possible signature of the outbreak interiorization process. Surprisingly, some countryside cities such as Campina Grande (state of Paraiba), Feira de Santana (state of Bahia), and Caruaru (state of Pernambuco) have higher strengths than some states\u0027 capitals. Furthermore, some cities from the Sao Paulo state such as Presidente Prudente and Ribeirao Preto are captured in the top-rank positions of all the analyzed network measures under different flow thresholds.

To minimize clinical development time our methods validate vaccines with multiple peptide presentation algorithms to increase the probability that a vaccine will be effective. We optimize an objective function that is based on the presentation likelihood of a diverse set of vaccine peptides conditioned on a target population HLA haplotype distribution and expected epitope drift.

Its fast spreading to other provinces in China and overseas is very likely causing a pandemic. Since the novel coronavirus has been reported to be capable of endangering thousands of lives, it is extremely important to find out how the coronavirus is transmitted in human organs. Apart from fever and respiratory complications, gastrointestinal symptoms are observed in some patients with 2019-nCoV but the significance remains undetermined. The cell receptor angiotensin covering enzyme II (ACE2), which is the major receptor of SARS-nCoV, has been reported to be a cellular entry receptor of 2019-nCoV as well. Here, to more precisely explore the potential pathogen transmission route of the 2019-nCoV infections in the gastrointestinal tract, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the colon tissue of healthy adults and colorectal cancer patients of our cohort and other databases. The data indicates that ACE2 is mainly expressed in epithelial cells of the colon. The expression of ACE2 is gradually increased from healthy control, adenoma to colorectal cancer patients in our cohort as well as in the external Asian datasets. According to the expression profile of ACE2 in colon epithelial cells, we speculate adenoma and colorectal cancer patients are more likely to be infected with 2019-nCoV than healthy people. Our data may provide a theoretical basis for the classification and management of future 2019-nCoV susceptibility people in clinical application.","publish_time":"2020-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, H.; Xuan, B.; Yan, Y.; Zhu, X.; Shen, C.; Zhao, G.; Ji, L.; Xu, D.; Xiong, H.; Yu, T.; Li, X.; Liu, Q.; Chen, Y.; Cui, Y.; Hong, J.; Fang, J.-Y.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f207428f4c6b54605480c3cbd1c0d33f70721d33.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.02.15.20023457v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs3NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan China","China"],"keyphrases":["nCoV infections","expression of ACE2","colorectal cancer patients","expression profile of ACE2","nCoV susceptibility people","ACE2 RNA expression profile","healthy people","novel coronavirus","colon epithelial cells","colon tissue of healthy adults","adenoma","healthy control","cohort","cell receptor angiotensin","major receptor of SARS","cellular entry receptor","respiratory complications","Wuhan China","gastrointestinal symptoms","gastrointestinal tract","numerous acute respiratory syndrome cases","management of future","classification","theoretical basis","fever","clinical application","enzyme","potential pathogen transmission route","capable of endangering thousands of lives","fast spreading","provinces","external Asian datasets","human organs","significance","databases","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

Countries have adopted disparate policies in tackling the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. For example, South Korea started a vigorous campaign to suppress the virus by testing patients with respiratory symptoms and tracing and isolating all their contacts, and many European countries are trying to slow down the spread of the virus with varying degrees of shutdowns. There is clearly a need for a model that can realistically simulate different policy actions and their impacts on the disease and health care capacity in a country or a region. Specifically, there is a need to identify destructive policies, i.e. policies that are, based on scientific knowledge, worse than an alternative and should not be implemented. Methods. We developed an agent-based model (REINA) using Python and accelerated it by the Cython optimising static compiler. It follows a population over time at individual level at different stages of the disease and estimates the number of patients in hospitals and in intensive care. It estimates death rates and counts based on the treatment available. Any number of interventions can be added on the timeline from a selection including e.g. physical isolation, testing and tracing, and controlling the amount of cases entering the area. The model has open source code and runs online. Results. The model uses the demographics of the Helsinki University Hospital region (1.6 million inhabitants). A mitigation strategy aims to slow down the spread of the epidemic to maintain the hospital capacity by implementing mobility restrictions. A suppression strategy initially consists of the same restrictions but also aggressive testing, tracing, and isolating all coronavirus positive patients and their contacts. The modelling starting point is 2020-02-18. The strategies follow the actual situation until 2020-04-06 and then diverge. The default mitigation scenario with variable 30\u221240% mobility reduction appears to delay the peak of the epidemic (as intended) but not suppress the disease. In the suppression strategy, active testing and tracing of patients with symptoms and their contacts is implemented in addition to 20\u221225% mobility reduction. This results in a reduction of the cumulative number of infected individuals from 820 000 to 80 000 and the number of deaths from 6000 to only 640, when compared with the mitigation strategy (during the first year of the epidemic). Discussion. The agent-based model (REINA) can be used to simulate epidemic outcomes for various types of policy actions on a timeline. Our results lend support to the strategy of combining comprehensive testing, contact tracing and targeted isolation measures with social isolation measures. While social isolation is important in the early stages to prevent explosive growth, relying on social isolation alone (the mitigation strategy) appears to be a destructive policy. The open-source nature of the model facilitates rapid further development. The flexibility of the modelling logic supports the future implementation of several already identified refinements in terms of more realistic population models and new types of more specific policy interventions. Improving estimates of epidemic parameters will make it possible to improve modelling accuracy further.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tuomisto, Jouni T; Yrj\u00F6l\u00E4, Juha; Kolehmainen, Mikko; Bonsdorff, Juhani; Pekkanen, Jami; Tikkanen, Tero","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1fdcb519802d1fec8d0092426bcf24b612a4b6ca.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.20047498","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs3NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Helsinki University Hospital"],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["mitigation strategy","tracing of patients","testing patients","number of patients","suppression strategy","agent-based model","social isolation measures","physical isolation","comprehensive testing","active testing","aggressive testing","disease","destructive policy","contacts","epidemic outcomes","mobility reduction","number of interventions","estimates of epidemic parameters","Results","targeted isolation measures","different policy actions","mobility restrictions","destructive policies","number of deaths","coronavirus positive patients","specific policy interventions","various types of policy actions","different stages","hospital capacity","REINA","disparate policies","timeline","modelling logic","default mitigation scenario","spread","modelling accuracy","need","cumulative number of infected individuals","health care capacity","open-source nature","open source code","new types","early stages","respiratory symptoms","Helsinki University Hospital region","intensive care","coronavirus pandemic","European countries","realistic population models","impacts","individual level","refinements","vigorous campaign","demographics","explosive growth","South Korea","terms","future implementation","COVID","country","hospitals","Python","varying degrees of shutdowns","scientific knowledge","Cython","example","inhabitants","selection","support","peak","year","strategies","actual situation","static compiler","flexibility","development","addition","death rates","treatment available","cases","area","point","Discussion","Background","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Given these roles and their relevance in the health professions, we sought to understand the methods and strategies used in the development of existing competency frameworks. Methods The Arksey and O\u0027Malley framework was applied to undertake this scoping review. Six electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Scopus, and ERIC) and three grey literature sources (greylit.org, Trove and Google Scholar) were searched using keywords related to competency frameworks. Studies of all types were included that described the development of a competency framework in a healthcare profession. Studies were screened for inclusion, and data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Data synthesis was both quantitative and qualitative. Results Among 5,710 citations, 190 were selected for analysis. The majority of studies were conducted in medicine and nursing professions. Group techniques were utilised in 140 studies (74%), literature reviews were conducted in 112 (59%), and 81 (43%) outlined some form of stakeholder deliberation. We found a significant degree of diversity in methodological strategies, inconsistent adherence to existing guidance on the selection of methods, who was involved, and based on the variation we observed in timeframes, form, choice, sequence, combination, function, application and reporting of methods and strategies, there is no apparent gold standard or standardised approach to competency framework development. Conclusions This review observed significant variation within the conduct and reporting of the competency framework development process. Such variation is a cause for concern, potentially resulting in the development of frameworks that may not have captured the complexities of clinical practice, which are therefore of limited value to the profession, and may unwillingly create and legitimise artificial outcomes. The results of this review suggest there is a need for improved guidance in the process for developing and reporting competency frameworks.","publish_time":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Batt, A.

To genotype/subtype the CCoV strains and assess the occurrence of single or multiple CCoV infections, RT-PCR of the S gene was performed, and 25/30 CCoV-positive strains amplified with one or two primer pairs. For 17/25 samples, single infections were detected as follows: six CCoV-I, nine CCoV-IIa and two CCoV-IIb. Eight samples were positive for more than one genotype/subtype as follows: seven CCoV-I/IIa and one CCoV-I/IIb. Sequence analysis revealed that the CCoV-I and IIa strains shared high genetic similarity to each other and to the prototypes. The Brazilian strains of CCoV-IIb displayed an aminoacid insertion that was also described in CCoV-IIb-UCD-1 and TGEV strains. Among the 25 CCoV-positive puppies, five had a fatal outcome, all but one of which were cases of mixed infection.

Currently, the spread of local epidemics has been basically blocked. The import of overseas epidemics has become the main form of growth in China\u0027s new epidemic. As an important international transportation hub in China, Shanghai is one of the regions with the highest risk of imported cases abroad. Due to imported of overseas cases are affected by the international epidemic trend. The traditional infectious disease model is difficult to accurately predict the cumulative trend of cumulative cases in the Shanghai areas. It is also difficult to accurately evaluate the effectiveness of the international traffic blockade. In this situation, this study takes Shanghai as an example to propose a new type of infectious disease prediction model. The model first uses the sparse graph model to analyze the international epidemic spread network to find countries and regions related to Shanghai. Next, multiple regression models were used to fit the existing COV-19 growth data in Shanghai. Finally, the model can predict the growth curve of Shanghai\u0027s epidemic without blocking traffic. The results show that the control measures taken by Shanghai are very effective. At present, more and more countries and regions will face the current situation in Shanghai. We recommend that other countries and regions learn from Shanghai\u0027s successful experience in preventing overseas imports in order to fully prepare for epidemic prevention and control.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dang, Q.; Rui, M.; Yong, L.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4c4433bcf85699083023bb717f1e9d95c55f64a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.13.20100164v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs3OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Shanghai"],"keyphrases":["regions","Shanghai areas","international epidemic trend","international epidemic spread network","countries","epidemic prevention","overseas cases","growth curve of Shanghai\u0027s epidemic","China\u0027s new epidemic","traditional infectious disease model","sparse graph model","international traffic blockade","cumulative trend of cumulative cases","new type of infectious disease prediction model","growth data","overseas imports","import of overseas epidemics","spread of local epidemics","important international transportation hub","highest risk of imported cases","main form of growth","control measures","current situation","Shanghai\u0027s successful experience","order","Wuhan","Hubei Province","existing COV","example","effectiveness","study","multiple regression models","results","COVID","present"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Government websites from countries with minimum 1000 cases in adults and children on April 13, 2020 were searched to find the number of cases confirmed in children, the age range, and the number leading to hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death. A systematic literature search was performed April 13, 2020 to find additional data from cases series. RESULTS: Data on pediatric cases were available from government websites for 23 of the 70 countries with minimum 1000 cases by April 13, 2020. Of 424 978 cases in these 23 countries, 8113 (1.9%) occurred in children. Nine publications provided data from 4251 cases in 4 additional countries. Combining data from the websites and the publications, 330 of 2361 cases required admission (14%). The ICU admission rate was 2.2 % of confirmed cases (44 of 2031) and 7.2% of admitted children (23 of 318). Death was reported for 15 cases. CONCLUSION: Children accounted for 1.9% of confirmed cases. The true incidence of pediatric infection and disease will only be known once testing is expanded to individuals with less severe or no symptoms. Admission rates vary from 0.3 to 10% of confirmed cases (presumably varying with the threshold for testing) with about 7% of admitted children requiring ICU care.

One month later, the number of new hospitalizations and ICU admissions had reached a plateau and were beginning a slow descent. We developed a spatialized, deterministic, age-structured, and compartmental SARS-CoV-2 transmission model able to reproduce the pre-lockdown dynamic of the epidemic in each of the 13 French metropolitan regions. Thanks to this model, we estimate, at regional and national levels, the total number of hospitalizations, ICU admissions, hospital beds requirements (hospitalization and ICU), and hospital deaths which may have been prevented by this massive and unprecedented intervention in France. If no control measures had been set up, between March 19 and April 19 2020, our analysis shows that almost 23% of the French population would have been affected by COVID-19 (14.8 million individuals). Hence, the French lockdown prevented 587,730 hospitalizations and 140,320 ICU admissions at the national level. The total number of ICU beds required to treat patients in critical conditions would have been 104,550, far higher than the maximum French ICU capacity. This first month of lockdown also permitted to avoid 61,739 hospital deaths, corresponding to a 83.5% reduction of the total number of predicted deaths. Our analysis shows that in absence of any control measures, the COVID-19 epidemic would have had a critical morbidity and mortality burden in France, overwhelming in a matter of weeks French hospital capacities.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roux, Jonathan; Massonnaud, Cl\u00E9ment; Cr\u00E9pey, Pascal","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ae762af12cb789e59d389b9e343cd68b5c3ddef.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.22.20075705v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs4MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["French lockdown","ICU admissions","total number of ICU beds","maximum French ICU capacity","French authorities","hospital deaths","French population","total number of hospitalizations","COVID","month of lockdown","total number of predicted deaths","number of new hospitalizations","French metropolitan regions","matter of weeks French hospital capacities","hospital beds requirements","pre-lockdown dynamic","large scale lockdown","France","epidemic wave","control measures","analysis","critical morbidity","national levels","critical conditions","transmission model able","compartmental SARS-CoV","age-structured","entertainment activities","food retailers","country","mortality burden","plateau","patients","healthcare institutions","unprecedented intervention","absence","reduction","slow descent","Thanks","individuals"],"language":"en"},

As of 24 January 2020, with 23 exported cases, and estimating the growth rate from 8 December 2019 (scenario 1) and using the data since growth of exported cases (scenario 2), the cumulative incidence in China was estimated at 5433 cases (95% confidence interval (CI): 3883, 7160) and 17780 cases (95% CI: 9646, 28724), respectively.

Viral infections including SARS-CoV are associated with increased levels of reactive oxygen species, disturbances of Ca\u002B\u002B caused by unfolded protein response (UPR) mediated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and is due to the exploitation of virus\u0027s own protein i.e., viroporins into the host cells. Several clinical trials are on-going including testing Remdesivir (anti-viral), Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine derivatives (anti-malarial drugs) etc. Unfortunately, each drug has specific limitations. Herein, we review the viral protein involvement to activate ER stress transducers (IRE-1, PERK, ATF-6) and their downstream signals; and evaluate combination therapies for COVID-19 mediated ER stress alterations. Melatonin is an immunoregulator, anti-pyretic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and ER stress modulator during viral infections. It enhances protective mechanisms for respiratory tract disorders. Andrographolide, isolated from Andrographis paniculata, has versatile biological activities including immunomodulation and determining SARS-CoV-2 binding site.

This retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate whether SARS-CoV-2 case-fatality rate decreased with time, adjusting for main potential confounders. Methods and findings We included all SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects diagnosed in Ferrara and Pescara provinces, Italy. Information were collected from local registries, clinical charts, and electronic health records. We compared the case-fatality rate of the subjects diagnosed during April and March, 2020. We used Cox proportional hazards analysis and random-effect logistic regression, adjusting for age, gender, hypertension, type II diabetes, major cardiovascular diseases (CVD), chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), cancer and renal disease. The sample included 1946 subjects (mean age 58.8y; 45.7% males). 177 persons deceased, after a mean of 11.7 days of follow-up. From March to April, the case-fatality rate significantly decreased in the total sample (10.8% versus 6.0%; p\u003C0.001), and in any subgroup of patients. Large reductions of the lethality were observed among the elderly (from 30.0% to 13.4%), and subjects with hypertension (23.0% to 12.1%), diabetes (30.3% to 8.4%), CVD (31.5% to 12.1%), COPD (29.7% to 11.4%), and renal disease (32.3% to 11.5%). In April, the adjusted hazard ratio of death was 0.42 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.29-0.60). The mean age of those who died substantially increased from March (77.9y) to April (86.9y).

Predicting the surge in capacity has proved difficult due to the requirement of a subtle combination of diverse expertise and difficult choices to be made on selecting robust measures of critical care utilization, and parsimonious epidemic modelling which account for changing government measures. We modelled the required surge capacity of ICU beds in Italy exclusively for COVID-19 patients at epidemic peak. Because new measures were imposed by the Italian government, suspending nearly all non-essential sectors of the economy, we included the potential impacts of these new measures. The modelling considered those hospitalized and home isolated as quarantined, mimicking conditions on the ground. The percentage of patients in intensive care (out of the daily active confirmed cases) required for our calculations were chosen based on clinical relevance and robustness, and this number was consistently on average 9.9% from February 24 to March 6, 2020. Five different scenarios were produced (two positive and three negative). Under most positive scenarios, in which R0 is reduced below 1 (i.e., 0.71), the number of daily active confirmed cases will peak at nearly 89 000 by the early days of April and the total number of intensive care beds exclusively dedicated to COVID-19 patients required in Italy estimated at 8791. Worst scenarios produce unmanageable numbers. Our results suggest that the decisive moment for Italy has come. Jointly reinforcement by the government of the measures approved so far, including home confinement, but even more important the full commitment of the civil society in respecting home confinement, social distancing and hygiene will be key in the next days. Yet, even under the best circumstances, intensive care capacity will need to get closer to 9000 units in the country to avoid preventable mortality. So far, only strong measures were effective in Italy, as shown by our modelling, and this may offer an opportunity to European countries to accelerate their interventions.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rodriguez Llanes, Jose Manuel; Castro Delgado, Rafael; Pedersen, Morten Gram; Arcos Gonzalez, Pedro; Meneghini, Matteo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad6fca5f399ea00ba6b7fa295276be4312804bfa.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050237","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs4NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["intensive care capacity","Italy","new measures","strong measures","changing government measures","total number of intensive care beds","robust measures of critical care utilization","Italian government","needs of patients","percentage of patients","positive scenarios","required surge capacity of ICU beds","number of daily active confirmed cases","COVID","parsimonious epidemic modelling","respecting home confinement","Europe threats Italian capacity","epidemic peak","Worst scenarios","different scenarios","difficult choices","early days","current spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","social distancing","civil society","pneumonia","account","subtle combination of diverse expertise","economy","derived complications","concomitant disease","SARS-CoV","hygiene","country","commitment","requirement","key","non-essential sectors","calculations","potential impacts","best circumstances","clinical relevance","national health systems","European countries","conditions","units","unmanageable numbers","robustness","decisive moment","preventable mortality","opportunity","interventions","ground","results","R0","reinforcement","average"],"language":"en"},

It is caused by a novel coronavirus (n-CoV) generally distinguished as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has exploited human vulnerabilities to coronavirus outbreak. SARS-CoV-2 promotes fatal chronic respiratory disease followed by multiple organ failure which ultimately puts an end to human life. No proven vaccine for n-CoV is available till date in spite of significant research efforts worldwide. International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has reached to a consensus that the virus SARS-CoV-2 is highly genetically similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak of 2003. It has been reported that SARS-CoV has \u223C89% genetic similarities with n-CoV. With this hypothesis, the current work focuses on the identification of spreader nodes in SARS-CoV protein interaction network. Various network characteristics like edge ratio, neighborhood density and node weight have been explored for defining a new feature spreadability index by virtue of which spreader nodes and edges are identified. The selected top spreader nodes having high spreadability index have been also validated by Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) disease model. Initially, the proposed method is applied on a synthetic protein interaction network followed by SARS-CoV-human protein interaction network. Hence, key spreader nodes and edges (ranked edges) are unmasked in SARS-CoV proteins and its connected level 1 and level 2 human proteins. The new network attribute spreadability index along with generated SIS values of selected top spreader nodes when compared with the other network centrality based methodologies like Degree centrality (DC), Closeness centrality (CC), Local average centrality (LAC) and Betweeness centrality (BC) is found to perform relatively better than the existing-state-of-art.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saha, Sovan; Chatterjee, Piyali; Basu, Subhadip; Nasipuri, Mita","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/863d70aaabd531163163ac042df449f9f362e5ed.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.12.038216","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs4Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["International Committee"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV proteins","n-CoV","virus SARS-CoV","SARS-CoV protein interaction network","network centrality","human protein interaction network","identification of spreader nodes","key spreader nodes","coronavirus outbreak","synthetic protein interaction network","Closeness centrality","Degree centrality","Betweeness centrality","new network attribute spreadability index","commencement of coronavirus disease","novel coronavirus","edges","human proteins","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","Various network characteristics","human vulnerabilities","human life","Local average centrality","high spreadability index","new feature spreadability index","fatal chronic respiratory disease","disease model","generated SIS values of selected","connected level","Susceptible-Infected","edge ratio","date","virtue","neighborhood density","LAC","DC","multiple organ failure","spite of significant research efforts","methodologies","node weight","Taxonomy of Viruses","ICTV","end","COVID","consensus","genetic similarities","International Committee","current work","proven vaccine","BC","proposed method","existing-state","hypothesis","entire world","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

Methods: A community cohort study was conducted with adults aged [\u2265]18 years recruited through a mainstream and social media campaign between 3/4/20-30/4/20. Consenting participants completed an online survey measuring depression, anxiety and stress and explanatory variables hypothesised to be related to these mental health outcomes.

The model is calibrated on the evidence of internationally imported cases before the implementation of the travel quarantine of Wuhan. By assuming a generation time of 7.5 days, the reproduction number is estimated to be 2.4 [90% CI 2.2-2.6]. The median estimate for number of cases before the travel ban implementation on January 23, 2020 is 58,956 [90% CI 40,759 - 87,471] in Wuhan and 3,491 [90% CI 1,924 - 7,360] in other locations in Mainland China. The model shows that as of January 23, most Chinese cities had already received a considerable number of infected cases, and the travel quarantine delays the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days. The travel quarantine has a more marked effect at the international scale, where we estimate the number of case importations to be reduced by 80% until the end of February.

To examine the safety profiles of these medications, we systematically evaluated the adverse events (AEs) of these medications from published randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE, and the ClinicalTrials.gov for all the RCTs comparing CQ or HCQ with placebo or other active agents, published before March 31, 2020. The random-effects or fixed-effects models were used to pool the risk estimates relative ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the outcomes. Results: The literature search yielded 23 and 17 studies for CQ and HCQ, respectively, that satisfied our inclusion criteria. Of these studies, we performed meta-analysis on the ones that were placebo-controlled, which included 6 studies for CQ and 14 studies for HCQ. We did not limit our analysis to published reports involving viral treatment alone; data also included the usage of either CQ or HCQ for the treatment of other diseases. The trials for the CQ consisted of a total of 2,137 participants (n=1,077 CQ, n=1,060 placebo), while the trials for HCQ involved 1,096 participants (n=558 HCQ and n=538 placebo). The overall mild or total AEs were statistically higher comparing CQ or HCQ to placebo. The AEs were further categorized into four groups and analyses revealed that neurologic, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and ophthalmic AEs were higher in participants taking CQ compared to placebo. Although this was not evident in HCQ treated groups, further analyses suggested that there were more AEs attributed to other organ system that were not included in the categorized meta-analyses. Additionally, meta-regression analyses revealed that total AEs was affected by dosage for the CQ group. Conclusions: Taken together, we found that participants taking either CQ or HCQ have more AEs than participants taking placebo.

We collected clinical and biological data, as well as CT scan images and radiology reports from 1,003 coronavirus-infected patients from two French hospitals. Radiologists\u0027 manual CT annotations were also available. We first identified 11 clinical variables and 3 types of radiologist-reported features significantly associated with prognosis. Next, focusing on the CT images, we trained deep learning models to automatically segment the scans and reproduce radiologists\u0027 annotations. We also built CT image-based deep learning models that predicted severity better than models based on the radiologists\u0027 scan reports. Finally, we showed that including CT scan features alongside the clinical and biological data yielded more accurate predictions than using clinical and biological data only. These findings show that CT scans provide insightful early predictors of severity.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lassau, N.; Ammari, S.; Chouzenoux, E.; Gortais, H.; Herent, P.; Devilder, M.; Soliman, S.; Meyrignac, O.; Talabard, M.-P.; Lamarque, J.-P.; Dubois, R.; Loiseau, N.; Trichelair, P.; Bendjebbar, E.; Garcia, G.; Balleyguier, C.; Merad, M.; Stoclin, A.; Jegou, S.; Griscelli, F.; Tetelboum, N.; Li, Y.; Verma, S.; Terris, M.; Dardouri, T.; Gupta, K.; Neacsu, A.; Chemouni, F.; Sefta, M.; Jehanno, P.; Bousaid, I.; Boursin, Y.; Planchet, E.; Azoulay, M.; Dachary, J.; Brulport, F.; Gonzalez, A.; Dehaene, O.; Schiratti, J.-B.; Schutte, K.; Pesquet, J.-C.; Talbot, H.; Pronier, E.; Wainrib, G.; Clozel, T.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/005aa3503919dcc7f016ff60c0cf86417e26ed8f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.14.20101972v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs5MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Intensive Care Units","CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CT scans","CT images","CT scan images","CT scan features","biological data","Radiologists\u0027 manual CT annotations","radiologists\u0027 scan reports","clinical variables","radiologists\u0027 annotations","deep learning models","insightful early predictors of severity","identification of early predictors of severity","radiology reports","accurate predictions","coronavirus-infected patients","tremendous pressure","hospitalized patients1","SARS-COV","pandemic","Intensive Care Units","public health priority","types of radiologist","severe cases","French hospitals","findings","prognosis"],"language":"en"},

Methods: In this retrospective, multicenter cohort study, we consecutively included all adult inpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and pre-existing cirrhosis that had been discharged or had died by 24 March 2020 from 16 designated hospitals in China. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiographic findings on admission, treatment, complications during hospitalization and clinical outcomes were collected and compared between survivors and non-survivors. Findings: Twenty-one patients were included in this study, of whom 16 were cured and 5 died in hospital. Seventeen patients had compensated cirrhosis and hepatitis B virus infection was the most common etiology. Lymphocyte and platelet counts were lower, and direct bilirubin levels were higher in patients who died than those who survived (p= 0.040, 0.032, and 0.006, respectively). Acute respiratory distress syndrome and secondary infection were both the most frequently observed complications. Only one patient developed acute on chronic liver failure. Of the 5 non-survivors, all patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and 2 patients progressed to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

Abstract Introduction The introduction of molecular techniques has enabled better understanding of the etiology of respiratory tract infections in children. The objective of the study was to analyze viral coinfection and its relationship to clinical severity. Methods Hospitalized pediatric patients with a clinical diagnosis of respiratory infection were studied during the period between 2009-2010. Clinical and epidemiological data, duration of hospitalization, need for oxygen therapy, bacterial coinfection and need for mechanical ventilation were collected. Etiology was studied by multiplex PCR and low-density microarrays for 19 viruses. Results A total of 385 patients were positive, 44.94% under 12 months. The most frequently detected viruses were RSV-B: 139, rhinovirus: 114, RSV-A: 111, influenza A H1N1-2009: 93 and bocavirus: 77. Coinfection was detected in 61.81%, 36.36% with 2 viruses, 16.10% and 9.35% with 3 to 4 or more. Coinfection was higher in 2009 with 69.79 vs. 53.88% in 2010. Rhinovirus/RSV-B on 10 times and RSV-A/RSV-B on 5 times were the most detected coinfections. Hospitalization decreased with greater number of viruses (P\u003C0,001). Oxygen therapy was required by 26.75% (one virus was detected in 55.34% of cases). A larger number of viruses resulted in less need for oxygen (P\u003C0,001). Ten cases required mechanical ventilation, 4 patients with bacterial coinfection and 5 with viral coinfection (P=0,69). Conclusions An inverse relationship was found between the number of viruses detected in nasopharyngeal aspirate, the need for oxygen therapy and hospitalization days. More epidemiological studies and improved quantitative detection techniques are needed to define the role of viral coinfections in respiratory disease and its correlation with the clinical severity.","publish_time":"2015-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mart\u00EDnez-Roig, A.; Salvad\u00F3, M.; Caballero-Rabasco, M.

However, there is a lack of epidemiological tools to guide effective public policy development. Here we present epidemiological evidence that SARS-CoV-2 S type exited Wuhan or other epicenters in China earlier than L type and conferred partial resistance to the virus on infected populations. Analysis of regional disparities in incidence has revealed that a sharp decline in influenza epidemics is a useful surrogate indicator for the undocumented spread of SARS-CoV-2. The biggest concern in the world is knowing when herd immunity has been achieved and scheduling a time to regain the living activities of each country. This study provides a useful tool to guide the development of local policies to contain the virus.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kamikubo, Yasuhiko; Takahashi, Atsushi","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c0d7f424dcf4a6c95e506ef3a3b80f2ae861fa2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043679","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs5Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","outbreak of SARS coronavirus","undocumented spread of SARS","China","S type exited Wuhan","useful tool","epidemiological evidence","useful surrogate indicator","lack of epidemiological tools","development of local policies","effective public policy development","worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease","influenza epidemics","epicenters","incidence","sharp decline","partial resistance","infected populations","living activities","Analysis of regional disparities","COVID","biggest concern","herd immunity","time","country","study"],"language":"en"},

In this regard, several potential treatments have been proposed, mainly on the basis of promising results obtained in preclinical models. However, at present, no treatment yet reached validation to be used in the clinical practice, although several drugs are currently tested in clinical trials for their ability to improve muscle metabolism in cancer patients. Along this line, the results obtained in both experimental and clinical studies clearly show that cachexia can be effectively approached by a multidirectional strategy targeting nutrition, inflammation, catabolism, and inactivity at the same time.

They frequently occur between related host species and often rely on the pathogen evolving adaptations that increase their fitness in the novel host species. To investigate genetic changes in novel hosts, we experimentally evolved replicate lineages of an RNA virus (Drosophila C Virus) in 19 different species of Drosophilidae and deep sequenced the viral genomes. We found a strong pattern of parallel evolution, where viral lineages from the same host were genetically more similar to each other than to lineages from other host species. When we compared viruses that had evolved in different host species, we found that parallel genetic changes were more likely to occur if the two host species were closely related. This suggests that when a virus adapts to one host it might also become better adapted to closely related host species. This may explain in part why host shifts tend to occur between related species, and may mean that when a new pathogen appears in a given species, closely related species may become vulnerable to the new disease.","publish_time":"2018-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Longdon, Ben; Day, Jonathan P.; Alves, Joel M.; Smith, Sophia C.

Objectives: this study evaluated the frequency and viral load (VL) of RSV in nasal swab samples of individuals with different risk factors for acquiring infection in a university hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: We included 196 symptomatic children and their 192 asymptomatic caregivers, 70 symptomatic and 95 asymptomatic HCWs, 43 samples from symptomatic HIV\u2010positive outpatients, and 100 samples of asymptomatic HIV patients in the period of 2009\u20102013. RESULTS: RSV infection was detected in 10.1% (70/696) of samples, 4.4% (17/387) of asymptomatic patients, and 17.1% (53/309) from symptomatic patients. (P \u003C .0001). The VL of symptomatic patients (4.7 log copies/mL) was significantly higher compared to asymptomatic patients (2.3 log copies/mL).

A close contact with an infected child at home was an important risk to RSV acquisition [OR 22.6 (95% CI 4.8\u2010106.7)].

A quantitative LAMP (qLAMP) assay using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based probe was assessed by grape growers in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. Custom impaction spore samplers were placed at a research vineyard and six commercial vineyard locations, and were tested bi-weekly by the lab and by growers.

Quantification by a quantitative PCR assay was assumed correct to compare the lab and grower qLAMP assay quantification. Growers were able to conduct and interpret qLAMP results; however, the Erysiphe necator inoculum quantification was unreliable using the beta-Smart-DART devices. The qLAMP assay developed was sensitive to one spore in early testing of the assay, but decreased to \u003E20 spores by the end of the trial.

Unlike bacteria and fungi, which produce distinct volatile metabolic signatures associated with innate differences in both primary and secondary metabolic processes, viruses are wholly reliant on the metabolic machinery of infected cells for replication and propagation. In the present study, the ability of volatile metabolites to discriminate between respiratory cells infected and uninfected with virus, in vitro, was investigated. Two important respiratory viruses, namely respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza A virus (IAV), were evaluated. Data were analyzed using three different machine learning algorithms (random forest (RF), linear support vector machines (linear SVM), and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)), with volatile metabolites identified from a training set used to predict sample classifications in a validation set. The discriminatory performances of RF, linear SVM, and PLS-DA were comparable for the comparison of IAV-infected versus uninfected cells, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) between 0.78 and 0.82, while RF and linear SVM demonstrated superior performance in the classification of RSV-infected versus uninfected cells (AUROCs between 0.80 and 0.84) relative to PLS-DA (0.61). A subset of discriminatory features were assigned putative compound identifications, with an overabundance of hydrocarbons observed in both RSV- and IAV-infected cell cultures relative to uninfected controls. This finding is consistent with increased oxidative stress, a process associated with viral infection of respiratory cells.","publish_time":"2018-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Purcaro, Giorgia; Rees, Christiaan A; Wieland-Alter, Wendy F; Schneider, Mark J; Wang, Xi; Stefanuto, Pierre-Hugues; Wright, Peter F; Enelow, Richard I; Hill, Jane E","journal":"J Breath Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/186fa1c35cc687d9c59b234f8327a881ec960658.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5912890.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5912890/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozk5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SVM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["uninfected cells","linear SVM","metabolic machinery of infected cells","PLS-DA","viral infection of respiratory cells","respiratory syncytial virus","important respiratory viruses","ability of volatile metabolites","uninfected controls","IAV-infected cell cultures relative","distinct volatile metabolic signatures","discriminatory performances of RF","classification of RSV","fungi","comparison of IAV","bacteria","AUROCs","linear support vector machines","secondary metabolic processes","training set","validation set","subset of discriminatory features","random forest","innate differences","detection","different machine learning algorithms","superior performance","putative compound identifications","increased oxidative stress","identification of pathogenic microorganisms","sample classifications","receiver","squares-discriminant analysis","investigation","area","replication","influenza","potential biomarkers","finding","characteristic curves","overabundance of hydrocarbons","present study","propagation","Data"],"language":"en"},

A retrospective chart review was performed for all patients transplanted at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics from January 1995 to December 2013 (n = 561). We identified 6 recipients whose clinical course was complicated by AFOP. All recipients were found to have AFOP on lung biopsy or at post-mortem examination, and 5 of the 6 patients suffered progressive allograft dysfunction that led to fatal outcome. Only 1 of the 6 patients stabilised with augmented immunosuppression and had subsequent improvement and stabilisation of allograft function. We could not clearly identify any specific cause of AFOP, such as drug toxicity or infection. Lung transplantation can be complicated by lung injury with an AFOP pattern on histopathologic examination of lung biopsy specimens. The presence of an AFOP pattern was associated with irreversible decline in lung function that was refractory to therapeutic interventions in 5 of our 6 cases and was associated with severe allograft dysfunction and death in these 5 individuals. AFOP should be considered as a potential diagnosis when lung transplant recipients develop progressive decline in lung function that is consistent with a clinical diagnosis of chronic lung allograft dysfunction.","publish_time":"2015-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meyer, Keith C.; Bierach, Jennifer; Kanne, Jeffrey; Torrealba, Jose R.; De Oliveira, Nilto C.","journal":"Pneumonia (Nathan)","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5922339.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5922339/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzEwMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["University of Wisconsin Hospital","AFOP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung function","lung transplant recipients","AFOP pattern","complication of lung transplantation","clinical diagnosis of chronic lung allograft dysfunction","histopathologic variant of acute lung injury","histopathologic examination of lung biopsy specimens","progressive allograft dysfunction","specific cause of AFOP","patients","stabilisation of allograft function","severe allograft dysfunction","progressive decline","infection","irreversible decline","potential diagnosis","clinical course","post-mortem examination","subsequent improvement","refractory","augmented immunosuppression","therapeutic interventions","death","pneumonia","University of Wisconsin Hospital","drug toxicity","fatal outcome","Clinics","cases","retrospective chart review","inflammatory disorders","individuals","presence"],"language":"en"},

Methods: We analysed biochemical indices and lymphocyte subpopulation in COVID-19 patients, and compare these data from non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases. Correlation analysis was performed between leukocyte subgroups count and biochemical indexes in COVID-19 patients. Results: The study enrolled 110 patients, comprising 88 COVID-19 patients and 22 non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases. We observed significant differences, including abnormal biochemical indices (CRP, LDH, AST, eGFR, and sodium ion concentration) and reduced lymphocyte subsets count, between the COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19-caused pneumonia cases. Correlation analysis indicates that the count for lymphocyte subsets-but not that for neutrophils and monocytes-exhibits a significant negative correlation with biochemical indices relating to organ injury, in the COVID-19 infected patients. Conclusions: The study indicates significantly different clinical features between 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-caused and non-2019-nCoV-caused pneumonia, especially in terms of lymphocytopenia and organ injury.

This disease is initiated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and uncontrolled cytokine storm, but it remains unknown as to whether a robust antibody response is related to clinical deterioration and poor outcome in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were determined by chemiluminescence analysis (CLIA) in COVID-19 patients from a single center in Wuhan. Median IgG and IgM levels in acute and convalescent-phase sera (within 35 days) for all included patients were calculated and compared among severe and nonsevere patients. Immune response phenotyping based on late IgG levels and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was characterized to stratify patients with different disease severities and outcome. Laboratory parameters in patients with different immune response phenotypes and disease severities were analyzed. Findings: A total of 222 patients were included in this study. IgG was first detected on day 4 of illness, and its peak levels occurred in the fourth week. Severe cases were more frequently found in patients with high IgG levels, compared to those who with low IgG levels (51.8% versus 32.3%; p=0.008). Severity rates for patients with NLRhiIgGhi, NLRhiIgGlo, NLRloIgGhi, and NLRloIgGlo phenotype was 72.3%, 48.5%, 33.3%, and 15.6%, respectively (p\u003C0.0001). Furthermore, severe patients with NLRhiIgGhi, NLRhiIgGlo had higher proinflammatory cytokines levels including IL-2, IL-6 and IL-10, and decreased CD4\u002B T cell count compared to those with NLRloIgGlo phenotype (p\u003C0.05). Recovery rate for severe patients with NLRhiIgGhi, NLRhiIgGlo, NLRloIgGhi, and NLRloIgGlo phenotype was 58.8% (20/34), 68.8% (11/16), 80.0% (4/5), and 100% (12/12), respectively (p=0.0592). Dead cases only occurred in NLRhiIgGhi and NLRhiIgGlo phenotypes. Interpretation: COVID-19 severity is associated with increased IgG response, and an immune response phenotyping based on late IgG response and NLR could act as a simple complementary tool to discriminate between severe and nonsevere COVID-19 patients, and further predict their clinical outcome.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Bicheng; Zhou, Xiaoyang; Zhu, Chengliang; Feng, Fan; Qiu, Yanru; Feng, Jia; Jia, Qingzhu; Song, Qibin; Zhu, Bo; Wang, Jun","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/778d1abeb8f189d090a447ee27e7ab5b7836a34e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.12.20035048","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NLRhiIgGhi"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nonsevere patients","included patients","late IgG response","late IgG levels","increased IgG response","high IgG levels","low IgG levels","Median IgG","NLRhiIgGhi","IgM levels","Severe cases","Immune response phenotyping","coronavirus disease","peak levels","nonsevere COVID","different immune response phenotypes","NLRhiIgGlo phenotypes","different disease severities","NLRloIgGlo phenotype","robust antibody response","emerging respiratory disease","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","clinical outcome","higher proinflammatory cytokines levels","NLRloIgGhi","poor outcome","Anti-SARS-CoV","IgM antibodies","clinical deterioration","Laboratory parameters","Severity rates","Dead cases","T cell count","decreased CD4","chemiluminescence analysis","neutrophil","convalescent-phase sera","simple complementary tool","days","CLIA","Recovery rate","lymphocyte ratio","single center","uncontrolled cytokine storm","Methods","illness","Wuhan","Background","week","Findings","total","Interpretation","study","world"],"language":"en"},

Abstract In general, respiratory infections are benign and self-limiting, but occasionally they can cause severe symptoms and become a major cause of mortality and morbidity, especially in the more vulnerable population groups. Flu epidemics occur annually, and there can be pandemics every few years, such as those caused by types H1N1 or H3N2. The main clinical manifestations are respiratory symptoms associated with fever, and complications such as pneumonia can arise. Nasopharyngeal swab and RT-PCR should be performed to confirm the diagnosis, which can yield results for other viruses as well. Treatment is generally symptomatic, reserving neuraminidase inhibitors for the more serious cases. The best preventive measure is annual vaccination of the population at risk. The coronavirus is also particularly relevant, due to its potential prognostic implications, and the respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus should be borne in mind in children.","publish_time":"2018-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pintos Pascual, I.; Mu\u00F1ez Rubio, E.; Alarc\u00F3n Tom\u00E1s, A.; Ramos Mart\u00EDnez, A.","journal":"Medicine - Programa de Formaci\u00F3n M\u00E9dica Continuada Acreditado","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e46da2250294c939c596c78205be2673b0446b8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304541218301173; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304541218301173","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["The coronavirus","especially in the","and the respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus should be borne in mind in children","inhibitors for the","benign and self","confirm the diagnosis","of mortality and morbidity","Nasopharyngeal swab and RT","and complications such as pneumonia can arise","The main clinical manifestations","The best preventive measure","Abstract In general","severe symptoms and become a major","and there can be pandemics every few years","virus sincitial respiratorio","annual vaccination of the population at risk","PCR should be performed","respiratory infections","as well","tratamiento","but occasionally they can","which can yield results for other","H1N1 or H3N2","respiratory symptoms associated with fever","such as those caused by","realizaci\u00F3n de RT","cuadros graves","tipos H1N1","infecciones respiratorias","grupos de poblaci\u00F3n","poblaci\u00F3n de riesgo","vulnerable population groups","infecciones benignas autolimitadas","its potential prognostic implications","due","limiting","reserving","also particularly relevant","Flu epidemics occur annually","vacunaci\u00F3n anual","generally symptomatic","sintomatolog\u00EDa respiratoria asociada a fiebre","causa importante","posibles implicaciones pron\u00F3sticas","edad infantil","ocasiones","cuenta","obtenci\u00F3n de exudado nasofar\u00EDngeo","serious cases","morbilidad","cl\u00EDnica fundamental","mejor medida preventiva","inhibidores","casos","especial relevancia","forma epid\u00E9mica","complicaciones","mortalidad","Treatment","resultados","confirmaci\u00F3n diagn\u00F3stica","gripe","pandemias","neuraminidasa","neumon\u00EDa"],"language":"es"},

The burden of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been geographically disproportionate. Certain weather factors and population characteristics are thought to drive transmission, but studies examining these factors are limited. We aimed to identify weather, sociodemographic, and geographic drivers of COVID-19 at the global scale using a comprehensive collection of country/territory-level data, and to use discovered associations to estimate the timing of community transmission. Methods. We examined COVID-19 cases and deaths reported up to May 2, 2020 across 205 countries and territories in relation to weather data collected from capital cities for the eight weeks prior to and four weeks after the date of the first reported case, as well as country/territory-level population, geographic, and planetary data. We performed univariable and multivariable regression modeling and odds ratio analyses to investigate associations with COVID-19 cases, deaths, and epidemic growth rate. We also conducted maximum likelihood analysis to estimate the timing of initial community spread. Findings. Lower temperature (p\u003C0.0001), lower humidity (p=0.006), higher altitude (p=0.0080), higher percentage of urban population (p\u003C0.0001), increased air travelers (p=0.00019), and higher prevalence of obesity (p\u003C0.0001) were strong independent predictors of national COVID-19 incidence, mortality, and epidemic growth rate. Temperature at 5-7 weeks before the first reported case best predicted epidemic growth, suggesting that significant community transmission was occurring on average 1-2 months prior to detection. Interpretation. The results of this ecologic analysis demonstrate that global COVID-19 burden and timing of country-level epidemic growth can be predicted by weather and population factors. In particular, we find that cool, dry, and higher altitude environments, as well as more urban and obese populations, may be conducive to more rapid epidemic spread.

Patchy virological testing has hampered interpretation of confirmed case counts, and unknown rates of asymptomatic and mild infections make it challenging to develop evidence-based public health policies. Serological tests that identify past infection can be used to estimate cumulative incidence, but the relative accuracy and robustness of various sampling strategies has been unclear. Here, we used a flexible framework that integrates uncertainty from test characteristics, sample size, and heterogeneity in seroprevalence across tested subpopulations to compare estimates from sampling schemes. Using the same framework and making the assumption that serological positivity indicates immune protection, we propagated these estimates and uncertainty through dynamical models to assess the uncertainty in the epidemiological parameters needed to evaluate public health interventions. We examined the relative accuracy of convenience samples versus structured surveys to estimate population seroprevalence, and found that sampling schemes informed by demographics and contact networks outperform uniform sampling. The framework can be adapted to optimize the design of serological surveys given particular test characteristics and capacity, population demography, sampling strategy, and modeling approach, and can be tailored to support decision-making around introducing or removing interventions.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Larremore, Daniel B; Fosdick, Bailey K; Bubar, Kate M; Zhang, Sam; Kissler, Stephen M; Metcalf, C.

Results: Among individuals in the outpatient and inpatient cohorts, 31.9% and 29.8%, respectively, used ACE inhibitors and 32.3% and 28.1% used ARBs. In the outpatient study, over a median 30.0 (19.0 - 40.0) days after testing positive, 12.7% were hospitalized for COVID-19. In propensity score-matched analyses, neither ACE inhibitors (HR, 0.77 [0.53, 1.13], P = 0.18), nor ARBs (HR, 0.88 [0.61, 1.26], P = 0.48), were significantly associated with risk of hospitalization. In analyses stratified by insurance group, ACE inhibitors, but not ARBs, were associated with a significant lower risk of hospitalization in the Medicare group (HR, 0.61 [0.41, 0.93], P = 0.02), but not the commercially insured group (HR: 2.14 [0.82, 5.60], P = 0.12; P-interaction 0.09). In the inpatient study, 14.2% died, 59.5% survived to discharge, and 26.3% had an ongoing hospitalization. In propensity score-matched analyses, neither use of ACE inhibitor (0.97 [0.81, 1.16]; P = 0.74) nor ARB (1.15 [0.95, 1.38]; P = 0.15) was associated with risk of in-hospital mortality, in total or in the stratified analyses. Conclusions: The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was not associated with the risk of hospitalization or mortality among those infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, there was a nearly 40% lower risk of hospitalization with the use of ACE inhibitors in the Medicare population. This finding merits a clinical trial to evaluate the potential role of ACE inhibitors in reducing the risk of hospitalization among older individuals, who are at an elevated risk of adverse outcomes with the infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khera, R.; Clark, C.; Lu, Y.; Guo, Y.; Ren, S.; Truax, B.; Spatz, E.

Psychological Distress (PD) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder have been reported after traumatic events, but the specific effect of pandemics is not well known. The aim of this study was to assess PD in France, a country where COVID-19 had such a dramatic impact that it required a country-wide lockdown. Patients and methods We recruited patients in 4 groups of chatbot users followed for breast cancer, asthma, depression and migraine. We used the Psychological Distress Index (PDI), a validated scale to measure PD during traumatic events, and correlated PD risk with patients characteristics in order to better identify the one who were the most at-risk. Results The study included 1771 participants. 91.25% (1616) were female with a mean age of 32.8 years (SD=13,71), 7.96% (141) were male with a mean age of 28.0 years (SD=8,14). In total, 38.06% (674) of the respondents had psychological distress (PDI [\u2265]15). An ANOVA analysis showed that sex (p=0.00132), unemployment (p=7.16x10-6) and depression (p=7.49x10-7) were significantly associated with a higher PDI score. Patients using their smartphone or computer more than one hour a day also had a higher PDI score (p=0.02588). Conclusion Prevalence of PD in at-risk patients is high. These patients are also at increased risk to develop Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Specific steps should be implemented to monitor and prevent PD through dedicated mental health policies if we want to limit the public health impact of COVID-19 in time.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chaix, B.; Delamon, G.; Guillemasse, A.; Brouard, B.; Bibault, J.-E.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce7da6a7b3aa1edf89040b3f54d85f4b0b7b2654.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.10.20093161v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Psychological Distress","PDI"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["at-risk patients","patients characteristics","correlated PD risk","traumatic events","Conclusion Prevalence of PD","higher PDI score","Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder","Psychological Distress Index","mean age","depression","public health impact of COVID","years","SD","study","increased risk","dramatic impact","Specific steps","country-wide lockdown","specific effect of pandemics","dedicated mental health policies","breast cancer","groups of chatbot users","asthma","day","validated scale","spread","hour","novel coronavirus disease","computer","France","migraine","ANOVA analysis","sex","smartphone","16x10","unemployment","methods","respondents","people","world","lockdowns","female","time","49x10","Introduction","participants","aim","total"],"language":"en"},

An appropriate immune response mediates protection, whereas an overwhelming immune response has been associated with immune-mediated pathogenesis in viral infections. The current study explored the general and SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular and humoral immune status in patients with different COVID-19 severities. Methods: In this prospective study, we included 53 patients with moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 manifestations comparing their quantitative, phenotypic, and functional characteristics of circulating immune cells, SARS-CoV-2 antigen specific T-cells, and humoral immunity. Results: Significantly diminished frequencies of CD8\u002BT-cells, CD4\u002B and CD8\u002BT-cell subsets with activated differentiated memory/effector phenotype and migratory capacity were found in circulation in patients with severe and/or critical COVID-19 as compared to patients with moderate disease. Importantly, the improvement of the clinical courses from severe to moderate was accompanied by an improvement in the T-cell subset alterations. Furthermore, we surprisingly observed a detectable SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cell response in all three groups after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 S-protein overlapping peptide pool already at the first visit. Of note, patients with a critical COVID-19 demonstrated a stronger response of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cells producing Th1 associated inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, clear correlation between antibody titers and SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4\u002B frequencies underscore the role of specific immunity in disease progression. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that depletion of activated memory phenotype circulating T-cells and a strong SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular and humoral immunity are associated with COVID-19 disease severity. This counter-intuitive finding may have important implications for diagnostic, therapeutic and prophylactic COVID-19 management.","publish_time":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anft, M.; Paniskaki, K.; Blazquez-Navarro, A.; Doevelaar, A.

Currently, data on changes in sexual behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak are limited. Aim The present study aimed to obtain a preliminary understanding of the changes in people\u2019s sexual behavior, as a result of the pandemic and explore the context in which they manifest. Methods A convenience sample of 270 men and 189 women who completed an online survey consisting of 12 items plus an additional question were included in the study. Outcomes The study outcomes were obtained using a study-specific questionnaire to assess the changes in people\u2019s sexual behavior. Results While there was a wide range of individual responses, our results showed that 44% of participants reported a decrease in the number of sexual partners and about 37% of participants reported a decrease in sexual frequency. Multiple regression analysis showed that age, partner relationship and sexual desire were closely related to sexual frequency. In addition, we found that most individuals with risky sexual experiences had a rapid reduction in risky sexual behavior. Clinical Implications The current findings contribute to identifying another potential health implication associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and report preliminary evidence of the need to provide potential interventions for the population. Strength \u0026 Limitations This study is the first to perform a preliminary exploration of sexual behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak. The generalizability of the results is limited, given that only a small convenience sample was used.

Studies in severely ill individuals have identified robust cellular and humoral immune responses against the virus. Asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 has also been described, but it is unknown whether this is sufficient to produce antibody responses. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study recruiting 554 health care workers from University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust who were at work and asymptomatic. Participants were tested for current infection with SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab for real-time polymerase chain reaction and for seroconversion by the measurement of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antibodies by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Results were interpreted in the context of previous, self-reported symptoms of illness consistent with COVID-19. Results The point prevalence of infection with SARS-CoV-2, determined by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on nasopharnygeal swab was 2.39% (n=13/544). Serum was available on 516 participants. The overall rate of seroconversion in the cohort was 24.4% (n=126/516). Individuals who had previously experienced a symptomatic illness consistent with COVID-19 had significantly greater seroconversion rates than those who had remained asymptomatic (37.5% vs 17.1%, {chi}2 =21.1034, p\u003C0.0001). In the week preceding peak COVID-19-related mortality at UHBFT, seroconversion rates amongst those who were suffering from symptomatic illnesses peaked at 77.8%. Prior symptomatic illness generated quantitatively higher antibody responses than asymptomatic seroconversion. Seroconversion rates were highest amongst those working in housekeeping (34.5%), acute medicine (33.3%) and general internal medicine (30.3%) with lower rates observed in participants working in intensive care (14.8%) and emergency medicine (13.3%). Conclusions In a large cross-sectional seroprevalence study of health-care workers, we demonstrate that asymptomatic seroconversion occurs, however prior symptomatic illness is associated with quantitatively higher antibody responses. The identification that the potential for seroconversion in health-care workers can associate differentially with certain hospital departments may inform future infection control and occupational health practices.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shields, A.

A mechanistic understanding of the impact of bats\u2019 virus hosting capacities, including uniquely constitutive immune pathways, on cellular-scale viral dynamics is needed to elucidate zoonotic emergence. We carried out virus infectivity assays on bat cell lines expressing induced and constitutive immune phenotypes, then developed a theoretical model of our in vitro system, which we fit to empirical data. Best fit models recapitulated expected immune phenotypes for representative cell lines, supporting robust antiviral defenses in bat cells that correlated with higher estimates for within-host viral propagation rates. In general, heightened immune responses limit pathogen-induced cellular morbidity, which can facilitate the establishment of rapidly-propagating persistent infections within-host. Rapidly-replicating viruses that have evolved with bat immune systems will likely cause enhanced virulence following emergence into secondary hosts with immune systems that diverge from those unique to bats.","publish_time":"2019-07-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brook, Cara E.; Boots, Mike; Chandran, Kartik; Dobson, Andrew P.; Drosten, Christian; Graham, Andrea L.; Grenfell, Bryan T.; M\u00FCller, Marcel A.; Ng, Melinda; Wang, Lin-Fa; van Leeuwen, Anieke","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/32c2e402c3c88c3024a4dec3d78ba67c24f89ca6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/696195","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bat immune systems","constitutive immune phenotypes","expected immune phenotypes","constitutive immune pathways","bat cell lines","heightened immune responses limit pathogen","bat cells","zoonotic emergence","Bats host virulent zoonotic viruses","representative cell lines","host viral propagation rates","cellular morbidity","cellular-scale viral dynamics","virus infectivity assays","Best fit models","impact of bats\u2019 virus hosting capacities","robust antiviral defenses","enhanced virulence","secondary hosts","higher estimates","disease","mechanistic understanding","theoretical model","establishment","persistent infections","empirical data"],"language":"en"},

Population migration data combined with officially reported data were used to estimate model parameters, and then calculated the daily exported infected individuals by estimating the daily infected ratio and daily susceptible population size.

It remains unclear about the distribution and transmission risks of SARS-CoV-2 in outdoor environment despite its threats to healthy people and communities. Here, we investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in 73 specimens from outdoor environment of three hospitals in Wuhan. We found SARS-CoV-2 in soils (205-550 copies/g), wastewaters (255 to 1.9x104 copies/L) and aerosols (285-1130 copies/m3) in locations close to departments receiving COVID-19 patients or in wastewater treatment sectors, which revealed significant viral spill-over in hospital outdoor environment that was possibly via respiratory droplets from patients or airborne aerosols from wastewater containing SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in other areas or on surfaces with regular disinfection. Soils eventually behave as viral receptors through deposition and potentially a secondary source spreading SARS-CoV-2 for a prolonged time.

Though children are at comparatively lower risk compared to adults, the Indian population has a large young demographic that is likely to be at higher risk due to exposure to pollution, malnutrition and poor access to medical care. We aimed to quantify the potential impact of COVID-19 on Indias child population. Methods: We combined district family household survey data with data from the COVID-19 outbreak in China to analyze the potential impact of COVID-19 on children under the age of 5, under three different scenarios; each of which assumed the prevalence of infection to be 0.5%, 1%, or 5%. Results: We find that in the lowest prevalence scenario, across the most populous 18 Indian states, asymptomatic, non-hospitalized symptomatic and hospitalized symptomatic cases could reach 87,200, 412,900 and 31,900, respectively. In a moderate prevalence scenario, these figures reach 174,500, 825,800, and 63,800, and in the worst case, high prevalence scenario these cases could climb as high as 872,200, 4,128,900 and 319,700.

The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the functional receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells. In particular, the interaction of viral spike proteins with ACE2 is a critical step in the viral replication cycle. The receptor binding domain of the viral spike proteins and ACE2 have several cysteine residues. In this study, the role of thiol-disulfide balance on the interactions between SARS-CoV/CoV-2 spike proteins and ACE2 was investigated using molecular dynamic simulations. The study revealed that the binding affinity was significantly impaired when all the disulfide bonds of both ACE2 and SARS-CoV/CoV-2 spike proteins were reduced to thiol groups. The impact on the binding affinity was less severe when the disulfide bridges of only one of the binding partners were reduced to thiols.

AKI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the United States is not well-described. Objective: To provide information about frequency, outcomes and recovery associated with AKI and dialysis in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Design: Observational, retrospective study. Setting: Admitted to hospital between February 27 and April 15, 2020. Participants: Patients aged [\u2265]18 years with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 Exposures: AKI (peak serum creatinine increase of 0.3 mg/dL or 50% above baseline). Main Outcomes and Measures: Frequency of AKI and dialysis requirement, AKI recovery, and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with mortality. We also trained and tested a machine learning model for predicting dialysis requirement with independent validation. Results: A total of 3,235 hospitalized patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. AKI occurred in 1406 (46%) patients overall and 280 (20%) with AKI required renal replacement therapy. The incidence of AKI (admission plus new cases) in patients admitted to the intensive care unit was 68% (553 of 815). In the entire cohort, the proportion with stages 1, 2, and 3 AKI were 35%, 20%, 45%, respectively. In those needing intensive care, the respective proportions were 20%, 17%, 63%, and 34% received acute renal replacement therapy. Independent predictors of severe AKI were chronic kidney disease, systolic blood pressure, and potassium at baseline. In-hospital mortality in patients with AKI was 41% overall and 52% in intensive care. The aOR for mortality associated with AKI was 9.6 (95% CI 7.4-12.3) overall and 20.9 (95% CI 11.7-37.3) in patients receiving intensive care. 56% of patients with AKI who were discharged alive recovered kidney function back to baseline. The area under the curve (AUC) for the machine learned predictive model using baseline features for dialysis requirement was 0.79 in a validation test. Conclusions and Relevance: AKI is common in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, associated with worse mortality, and the majority of patients that survive do not recover kidney function. A machine-learned model using admission features had good performance for dialysis prediction and could be used for resource allocation.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, L.; Chaudhary, K.; Saha, A.; Chauhan, K.; Vaid, A.; Baweja, M.; Campbell, K.; Chun, N.; Chung, M.; Deshpande, P.; Farouk, S.

We have summarized in detail the management strategies implemented by the Chinese governments during the outbreaks. By considering three scenarios for the outbreak development, we simulated the facemasks availability from late-December 2019 to late-April 2020 and estimated the duration of sufficient facemask supplies. Our findings showed that if the COVID-19 outbreak occurred only in Wuhan city or Hubei province, facemask shortage would not appear with the existing public health measures. However, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, a shortage of facemask could be substantial assuming no alternative public health measures. Supplies of facemasks in the whole of China would have been sufficient for both healthcare workers and the general population if the COVID-19 outbreak only occurred in Wuhan city or Hubei province. However, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, facemask supplies in China could last for 5 days if under the existing public health measures and a shortage of 853 million facemasks is expected by 30 Apr 2020. Assuming a gradually decreased import volume, we estimated that dramatic increase in productivity (42.7 times of the usual level) is needed to mitigate the facemask crisis by the end of April. In light of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, a shortage of facemasks and other medical resources can considerably compromise the efficacy of public health measures. Effective public health measures should also consider the adequacy and affordability of medical resources. Global collaboration should be strengthened to prevent the development of a global pandemic from a regional epidemic via easing the medical resources crisis in the affected countries.","publish_time":"2020-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Huailiang; Huang, Jian; Zhang, Casper JP; He, Zonglin; Ming, Wai-kit","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2cfe7a4cc1fceed0ad7ffbd6244a61e0b2c3ac8b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.11.20020735","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsyODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Wuhan","Hubei"],"keyphrases":["China","facemask shortage","shortage of facemasks","outbreak development","existing public health measures","alternative public health measures","efficacy of public health measures","facemask crisis","Effective public health measures","COVID","Supplies of facemasks","duration of sufficient facemask supplies","medical resources crisis","facemasks availability","affordability of medical resources","Wuhan city","Hubei province","global pandemic","Global collaboration","regional epidemic","times","novel coronavirus pneumonia","adequacy","dramatic increase","general population","Chinese governments","productivity","healthcare workers","affected countries","days","decreased import volume","management strategies","study","usual level","knowledge","outbreaks","end","scenarios","light","best","findings"],"language":"en"},

Methods: A sample of 5,198 respondents in the United States (80% population representative, 20% oversample of hotspot areas in New York City, Seattle, New Orleans, and Detroit) was conducted from March 29th to April 13th to measure differences in knowledge, beliefs and behavior regarding COVID-19. Linear regression was used to understand racial, geographic, political, and socioeconomic differences in COVID-19 reported incidence knowledge, and behaviors after adjusting for state-specific and survey date fixed effects. Results: The largest differences in COVID-19 knowledge and behaviors are associated with race/ethnicity, gender, and age. African-Americans, men, and people \u003C55 years old are less likely to know how the disease is spread, less likely to know symptoms of COVID-19, wash their hands less frequently, and leave the home more often. Differences by income, political orientation, and living in a hotspot area are much smaller. Conclusions: There are wide gaps in COVID-19 reported incidence, knowledge regarding disease spread and symptoms, and in social distancing behavior. The findings suggest more effort is needed to increase accurate information and encourage appropriate behaviors among minority communities, men, and younger people.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cutler, D.; Stantcheva, S.; Alsan, M.; Yang, D.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0a6b394b5a79bffb799b72a53059382bd8cc301.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.15.20095927v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","New Orleans"],"keyphrases":["symptoms of COVID","large differences","socioeconomic differences","largest differences","reported incidence knowledge","appropriate behaviors","men","United States","beliefs","race","disease","New Orleans","health information","accurate information","limited data","political orientation","younger people","New York City","oversample of hotspot areas","social distancing behavior","Seattle","hospitalizations","minority communities","state-specific","mortality","survey date fixed effects","pandemic","population representative","wide gaps","respondents","ethnicity","years old","effort","gender","geography","Detroit","different exposure","income","Abstract Background","Results","African-Americans","Linear regression","risk","Methods","age","Conclusions","findings","hands","home"],"language":"en"},

Methods: We used the model proposed by Bommer and Vollmer to assess the quality of official case records. The infection fatality rates were taken from Verity et al (2020). Age distribution of the population for India and states are taken from the Census of India (2011). Reported number of deaths and SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases from https://www.covid19india.org. The reported numbers of samples tests were collected from the reports of the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). Results: The findings suggest that India is detecting just 3.6% of the total number of infections with a huge variation across its states. Among 13 states which have more than 100 COVID-19 cases, the detection rate varies from 81.9% (of 410 estimated infections) in Kerala to 0.8% (of 35487 estimated infections) in Madhya Pradesh and 2.4% (of 7431 estimated infections) in Gujarat. Conclusion: As the study reports a lower number of deaths and higher recovery rates in the states with a high detection rate, thus suggest that India must enhance its testing capacity and go for widespread testing. Late detection puts patients in greater need of mechanical ventilation and ICU care, which imposes greater costs on the health system. The country should also adopt population-level random testing to assess the prevalence of the infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goli, Srinivas; James, K.S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8faef058c3285747d30fb18a1cbfa803ac3736c8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059014","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Vollmer"],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["India","Kerala","Madhya Pradesh"],"keyphrases":["states","estimated infections","low number of infections","total number of infections","Census of India","lower number of deaths","SARS-CoV","population-level random testing","Late detection","testing capacity","population size","widespread testing","high detection rate","reports","infection fatality rates","greater costs","confirmed cases","higher recovery rates","greater need of mechanical ventilation","reported numbers of samples tests","ICU care","patients","Indian Council","outbreak","Medical Research","huge variation","Vollmer","ICMR","prevalence","study","quality of official case records","Verity et","model","Bommer","health system","Rationale","Age distribution","Madhya Pradesh","COVID","Background","country","Results","findings","Kerala","Gujarat","definite answers","Methods","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Facing unprecedented risks in the markets, people have increasing needs to find a safe haven for their investments. Given that the nature of this crisis is a combination of multiple problems, it is substantially different from all other financial crises known to us. It is therefore urgent to re-evaluate the safe-haven role of some traditional asset types, namely, gold, cryptocurrency, foreign exchange and commodities. This paper introduces a sequential monitoring procedure to detect changes in the left-quantiles of asset returns, and to assess whether a tail change in the equity index can be offset by introducing a safe-haven asset into a simple mean-variance portfolio. The sample studied covers a training period between August\u2013December 2019 and a testing period of December 2019\u2013March 2020. Furthermore, we calculate the cross-quantilogram between pair-wise asset returns and compare their directional predictability on left-quantiles in both normal market conditions and the COVID-19 period. The main results show that the role of safe haven becomes less effective for most of the assets considered in this paper, while gold and soybean commodity futures remain robust as safe-haven assets during this pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ji, Qiang; Zhang, Dayong; Zhao, Yuqian","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee73c30eb46c6a7cdae27f44b4bdf16531545a75.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1057521920301708; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521920301708?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["safe-haven role","role of safe haven","safe-haven assets","asset returns","gold","left-quantiles","traditional asset types","pair-wise asset","pandemic","paper","training period","testing period","financial crises","ongoing COVID","global financial system","soybean commodity futures","cryptocurrency","changes","normal market conditions","simple mean-variance portfolio","directional predictability","sequential monitoring procedure","crisis","markets","people","combination of multiple problems","foreign exchange","great turmoil","needs","cross-quantilogram","tail change","equity index","unprecedented risks","commodities","main results","nature","sample","investments"],"language":"en"},

The notion that the first wave of infection is close to its peak begs the question of whether future peaks or second waves are likely. We sought to determine the current size of the effective (i.e. susceptible) population for seven European countries - to estimate immunity levels following this first wave. We compare these numbers to the total population sizes of these countries, in order to investigate the potential for future peaks. Methods: We used Bayesian model inversion to estimate epidemic parameters from the reported case and death rates from seven countries using data from late January 2020 to April 5th 2020. Two distinct generative model types were employed: first a continuous time dynamical-systems implementation of a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model and second: a partially observable Markov Decision Process (MDP) or hidden Markov model (HMM) implementation of an SEIR model. Both models parameterise the size of the initial susceptible population (S0), as well as epidemic parameters. Parameter estimation (data fitting) was performed using a standard Bayesian scheme (variational Laplace) designed to allow for latent unobservable states and uncertainty in model parameters. Results: Both models recapitulated the dynamics of transmissions and disease as given by case and death rates. The peaks of the current waves were predicted to be in the past for four countries (Italy, Spain, Germany and Switzerland) and to emerge in 0.5-2 weeks in Ireland and 1-3 weeks in the UK. For France one model estimated the peak within the past week and the other in the future in two weeks. Crucially, Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of S0 for each country indicated effective population sizes of below 20% (of total population size), under both the continuous time and HMM models. Using for all countries, with a Bayesian weighted average across all seven countries and both models, we estimated that 6.4% of the total population would be immune. From the two models the maximum percentage of the effective population was estimated at 19.6% of the total population for the UK, 16.7% for Ireland, 11.4% for Italy, 12.8% for Spain, 18.8% for France, 4.7% for Germany and 12.9% for Switzerland. Conclusion: Our results indicate that after the current wave, a large proportion of the total population will remain without immunity. This suggests that in the absence of strong seasonal effects, new medications or more comprehensive contact tracing, a further set of epidemic waves in different geographic centres are likely. These findings may have implications for exit strategies from any lockdown stage.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moran, Rosalyn J; Fagerholm, Erik D; Daunizeau, Jean; Cullen, Maell; Richardson, Mark P; Williams, Steven; Turkheimer, Federico; Leech, Rob; Friston, Karl","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/47c7c20bcc96d83b1c72ce444d240d82c813ed53.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.20060426","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Markov"],"organizations":["SEIR","UK"],"locations":["Ireland","France","Germany","Switzerland"],"keyphrases":["total population sizes","model parameters","models","effective population sizes","European countries","SEIR model","initial susceptible population","Bayesian model inversion","hidden Markov model","epidemic parameters","current waves","future peaks","current size","weeks","distinct generative model types","set of epidemic waves","daily case numbers","reported case","death rates","Italy","wave of infection","Germany","Spain","Results","Switzerland","Ireland","France","UK","standard Bayesian scheme","Bayesian weighted average","continuous time dynamical-systems implementation","estimates of S0","data fitting","maximum percentage","immunity levels","past week","observable Markov Decision Process","new medications","MDP","negative rate of growth","comprehensive contact tracing","stringent social distancing measures","different geographic centres","exit strategies","absence of strong seasonal effects","latent unobservable states","uncertainty","country","large proportion","variational Laplace","implications","Background","posteriori","MAP","disease","dynamics of transmissions","question","order","lockdown stage","novel coronavirus","findings","Parameter estimation","potential","Methods","notion","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

A safe and effective vaccine is desperately needed to prevent the continued spread of SARS-CoV-2; yet, rational vaccine design efforts are currently hampered by the lack of knowledge regarding viral epitopes targeted during an immune response, and the need for more in-depth knowledge on betacoronavirus immunology. To that end, we developed a computational workflow using a series of open-source algorithms and webtools to analyze the proteome of SARS-CoV-2 and identify putative T cell and B cell epitopes. Using increasingly stringent selection criteria to select peptides with significant HLA promiscuity and predicted antigenicity, we identified 41 potential T cell epitopes (5 HLA class I, 36 HLA class II) and 6 potential B cell epitopes, respectively. Docking analysis and binding predictions demonstrated enrichment for peptide binding to HLA-B (class I) and HLA-DRB1 (class II) molecules. Overlays of predicted B cell epitopes with the structure of the viral spike (S) glycoprotein revealed that 4 of 6 epitopes were located in the receptor-binding domain of the S protein. To our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively analyze all 10 (structural, non-structural and accessory) proteins from SARS-CoV-2 using predictive algorithms to identify potential targets for vaccine development. Significance Statement The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 recently emerged from China, rapidly spreading and ushering in a global pandemic. Despite intensive research efforts, our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 immunology and the proteins targeted by the immune response remains relatively limited, making it difficult to rationally design candidate vaccines. We employed a suite of bioinformatic tools, computational algorithms, and structural modeling to comprehensively analyze the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome for potential T cell and B cell epitopes. Utilizing a set of stringent selection criteria to filter peptide epitopes, we identified 41 T cell epitopes (5 HLA class I, 36 HLA class II) and 6 B cell epitopes that could serve as promising targets for peptide-based vaccine development against this emerging global pathogen.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crooke, Stephen N.; Ovsyannikova, Inna G.; Kennedy, Richard B.; Poland, Gregory A.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/84cf24bf280b9bd0d99067175a4490c58df1370c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.093757","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HLA"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["potential B cell epitopes","potential T cell epitopes","HLA class","HLA-B","peptide epitopes","viral epitopes","Overlays of predicted B cell epitopes","knowledge of SARS","entire SARS-CoV","putative T cell","proteome of SARS","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","HLA-DRB1","continued spread of SARS","potential targets","peptide binding","significant HLA promiscuity","computational algorithms","peptide-based vaccine development","effective vaccine","in-depth knowledge","lack of knowledge","rational vaccine design efforts","binding predictions","predictive algorithms","source algorithms","proteins","immune response","global pandemic","China","set of stringent selection criteria","receptor-binding domain","predicted antigenicity","promising targets","computational workflow","viral spike","structural modeling","S protein","betacoronavirus immunology","influenza pandemic","emerging global pathogen","intensive research efforts","peptides","structure","enrichment","series of open","need","webtools","accessory","infecting millions of people","societal disruption","Significance Statement","suite of bioinformatic tools","glycoprotein","level","globe","analysis","candidate vaccines","end","molecules","study"],"language":"en"},

Therefore it was aimed to develop a machine learning method for the detection of viral epidemics by analyzing X-ray images. In this study, images belonging to 6 situations, including coronavirus images, are classified. Since the number of images in the dataset is deficient and unbalanced, it is more convenient to analyze these images with hand-crafted feature extraction methods. For this purpose, firstly, all the images in the dataset are extracted with the help of four feature extraction algorithms. These extracted features are combined in raw form. The unbalanced data problem is eliminated by producing feature vectors with the SMOTE algorithm. Finally, the feature vector is reduced in size by using a stacked auto-encoder and principal component analysis to remove interconnected features in the feature vector. According to the obtained results, it is seen that the proposed method has leveraging performance, especially in order to make the diagnosis of COVID-19 in a short time and effectively.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ozturk, Saban; Ozkaya, Umut; Barstugan, Mucahid","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/04a548ac23887bab6f10c13545a365b9fdb20803.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.20048868","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["X-ray images","coronavirus images","number of images","feature vectors","feature extraction algorithms","diagnosis of COVID","hand-crafted feature extraction methods","extracted features","dataset","obtained results","interconnected features","accurate diagnoses","clinical diagnoses","proposed method","wrong test results","machine learning method","unbalanced data problem","preliminary diagnosis of suspicious cases","principal component analysis","long duration of pathological laboratory tests","detection of viral epidemics","stacked auto-encoder","researchers","effective interventions","Computed Tomography","size","help","situations","daily life","performance","spread","Corona Virus","raw form","SMOTE algorithm","order","different fields","information","short time","study","Necessary screenings","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Design and setting: An online sample of 1404 healthy individuals was collected through the authors\u0027 networks with residents and popular media in Bangladesh. The survey was conducted between March 27, 2020, and April 7, 2020, following the Bangladesh government\u0027s lockdown announcement. Method: A questionnaire comprising the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) and sociodemographic information was posted to an online survey. Results: The mean wellbeing value was 38.4 (standard deviation, 11.2), indicating a lower mental health level exist in adults. Also, the mean wellbeing score for males was 39.0 (10.8) units compared to females with scores 37.0 (11.2), and the highest scores for government workers was 41.2 (11.8). Unemployment (35.6) or business employees (35.5) have a lower level of mental health. In the lockout days, the elderly population of age 50 years and above had high day-to-day variation of wellbeing scores. After confounding adjustment in multivariable linear regression models, there found a better wellbeing scores for males (estimate=1.79, 95% CI=0.5, 3.1), and government-workers (estimate=5.86, 95% CI=2.2, 9.5). Moreover, the never-married female had significantly higher well-being score compared to married women (estimate=3.31, 95% CI=1.0, 5.7). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with low mental wellbeing that indicates depression in our study. Suggestions for improvement will be implemented to promote the mental health to women, unemployed and business communities. Older people 50 years of age and over reported a greater day-to-day variation in their mental health. The married women with their decreased mental wellbeing should be given special consideration. The research will help let clinicians and policymakers decide where the measures can be implemented to improve their mental health during and after this pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hossain, A.; Ali, M.; Rahaman Khan, H.; Ahsan, G.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.14.20102210v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Bangladesh"],"keyphrases":["decreased mental wellbeing","low mental wellbeing","lower mental health level","lower level of mental health","level of positive mental health","better wellbeing scores","Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale","mean wellbeing score","mean wellbeing value","high day-to-day variation of wellbeing scores","married women","estimate","highest scores","healthy population","years of age","married female","COVID","government workers","government-workers","pandemic","online survey","Bangladesh government\u0027s lockdown announcement","elderly population of age","greater day-to-day variation","healthy individuals","online sample","business employees","business communities","higher well-being score","beginning of nationwide lockdown","WEMWBS","authors\u0027 networks","residents","popular media","sociodemographic information","questionnaire","multivariable linear regression models","adjustment","depression","adults","lockout days","standard deviation","special consideration","clinicians","policymakers","profile","Older people","units","Results","research","measures","Method","Unemployment","Design","females","Conclusion","study","Suggestions","improvement","Background"],"language":"en"},

However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV. Drug repurposing, represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%) among the six other known pathogenic HCoVs. Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and known HCoV-host interactions in the human protein-protein interactome, we computationally identified 135 putative repurposable drugs for the potential prevention and treatment of HCoVs. In addition, we prioritized 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (including melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that were further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. Finally, we showcased three potential drug combinations (including sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the Complementary Exposure pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human protein-protein interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations toward future clinical trials for HCoVs.","publish_time":"2020-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Yadi; Hou, Yuan; Shen, Jiayu; Huang, Yin; Martin, William; Cheng, Feixiong","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/21100aba41a4bfb48d7dc37f1bf5dbb38bf3867a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020263","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["potential drug combinations","human protein-protein interactome network","human protein-protein interaction network","enrichment analyses of drug","network proximity analyses of drug targets","potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs","HCoV-host interactome","effective drugs","novo drug discovery","nCoV","existing drugs","effective drug discovery strategy","SARS-CoV","putative repurposable drugs","HCoV-host subnetwork","antiviral drug repurposing methodology","known HCoV-host interactions","Human Coronaviruses","potential prevention","MERS-CoV","treatment of HCoVs","rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs","human cell lines","known pathogenic HCoVs","HCoV-induced transcriptomics data","powerful network-based methodologies","melatonin","novel coronavirus","mercaptopurine","Phylogenetic analyses","sirolimus","study","systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform","Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","sequence identities","highest nucleotide sequence identity","gene signatures","future clinical trials","interplay","separate neighborhoods","global epidemics","dactinomycin","high morbidity","mortality","emodin","Complementary Exposure pattern","conserved regions","cost","genomes","nucleocapsid proteins","toremifene","time","summary","envelope","addition"],"language":"en"},

When Italy is used as prior in the prediction, which the US data resemble the most, the cases in the US will exceed 300,000 by the beginning of April unless strong measures are adopted.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Ziyue; Guo, Wensheng","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e3aafde5f8122763f92982f5b4361bab68348a63.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.28.20044578","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs0MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["US"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["prediction of US cases","observed US data","reference country","prior reference","prior information","particular country","different countries","epidemic progressing","different population sizes","accounting","empirical Bayesian time series framework","United States","policy responses","resultant forecast","researchers","parametric extrapolations","beginning","Covid","strong measures","history","interventions","reality","similarity","number","trajectories","outbreaks","Italy"],"language":"en"},

Although, SARS-Cov-2 primarily causes lung infection through binding of ACE2 receptors present on the alveolar epithelial cells, yet it was recently reported that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in the faeces of infected patients. Interestingly, the intestinal epithelial cells particularly the enterocytes of the small intestine also express ACE2 receptors. Role of the gut microbiota in influencing lung diseases has been well articulated. It is also known that respiratory virus infection causes perturbations in the gut microbiota. Diet, environmental factors and genetics play an important role in shaping gut microbiota which can influence immunity. Gut microbiota diversity is decreased in old age and Covid-19 has been mainly fatal in elderly patients which again points to the role the gut microbiota may play in this disease. Improving gut microbiota profile by personalized nutrition and supplementation known to improve immunity can be one of the prophylactic ways by which the impact of this disease can be minimized in old people and immune-compromised patients. More trials may be initiated to see the effect of co-supplementation of personalized functional food including prebiotics/probiotics along with current therapies.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dhar, Debojyoti; Mohanty, Abhishek","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b9067a47f6152825cdda476b2e828bf66848cb6c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170220304603; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170220304603?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs0NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gut microbiota profile","Gut microbiota diversity","SARS-CoV","lung infection","important role","lung diseases","elderly patients","immunity","express ACE2 receptors","alveolar epithelial cells","intestinal epithelial cells","immune-compromised patients","faeces of infected patients","personalized nutrition","binding of ACE2 receptors present","old people","old age","Abstract Covid","effect of co-supplementation of personalized functional food","respiratory virus infection","understanding of infectious diseases","prebiotics","probiotics","enterocytes","points","small intestine","genetics","perturbations","environmental factors","implications","world","major pandemic","Diet","current therapies","impact","RNA","prophylactic ways","trials"],"language":"en"},

Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit (1). In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR], Spanish Society of Emergency [SEMES], Spanish Society of Anesthesiology, Reanimation, and Pain [SEDAR]) with experience in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections, including SARS, as well as sepsis and ARDS. The document provides clinical recommendations for the noninvasive respiratory support (noninvasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy with nasal cannula) in any patient with suspected or confirmed presentation of COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure.This consensus guidance should serve as a foundation for optimized supportive care to ensure the best possible chance for survival and to allow for reliable comparison of investigational therapeutic interventions as part of randomized controlled trials.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"G\u00F3mez, C\u00E9sar Cinesi; Rodr\u00EDguez, \u00D3scar Pe\u00F1uelas; Torn\u00E9, Manel Luj\u00E1n; Santaolalla, Carlos Egea; Jim\u00E9nez, Juan Fernando Masa; Fern\u00E1ndez, Javier Garc\u00EDa; Manuel Carratal\u00E1 Perales, Jos\u00E9; Heili-Frades, Sarah B\u00E9atrice; Monreal, Miquel Ferrer; de Andr\u00E9s Nilsson, Jos\u00E9 M; Arias, Eva Lista; Rocamora, Juan Luis S\u00E1nchez; Ignacio Garrote, Jos\u00E9; Serrano, Miguel J Zamorano; Mart\u00EDnez, M\u00F3nica Gonz\u00E1lez; Mu\u00F1oz, Eva Farrero; Andr\u00E9s, Olga Mediano San; Cervera, Gemma Rialp; Serra, Arantxa Mas; Mart\u00EDnez, Gonzalo Hern\u00E1ndez; de Haro L\u00F3pez, Candelaria; Gas, Oriol Roca; Roca, Ricard Ferrer; Berrocal, Antonio Romero; Ortola, Carlos Ferrando","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/195df6d5998318f2f32183fc197efb88c82cde6c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0210569120300942; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0210569120300942?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs0NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","Intensive Care Medicine","ARDS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Spanish Society of Emergency","Spanish Society of Pulmonologists","Spanish Society of Anesthesiology","Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine","noninvasive respiratory support","acute respiratory failure","respiratory tract infection","spanish scientific societies","intensive care unit","confirmed presentation of COVID","oxygen support","multidisciplinary panel of health care providers","optimized supportive care","acute respiratory distress syndrome","sepsis","ARDS","severe disease","consensus document","new infection","clinical management of patients","World Health Organization","Summary Coronavirus disease","noninvasive ventilation","clinical recommendations","social emergency","multiorgan failure","consensus guidance","emergent coronavirus","severe cases","high flow oxygen therapy","SEMICYUC","nasal cannula","reliable comparison of investigational therapeutic interventions","SEMES","SEPAR","survival","best possible chance","experience","foundation","septic shock","Reanimation","randomized controlled trials","Pain","evidence-informed guidelines","admission","hospitalization","SEDAR","SARS","viral infections","global pandemic","uncomplicated illness","Wuhan","China","people"],"language":"en"},

Older age and elevated d-dimer are reported risk factors for Covid-19. However, whether early radiographic change is a predictor of fatality remains unknown. We retrospectively reviewed records of all laboratory-confirmed patients admitted to a quarantine unit at Tongji Hospital, a large regional hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 31 and March 5, 2020. The Tongji Hospital ethics committee approved this study. A total of 128 patients were admitted. 102 patients were confirmed to have severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection using RNA detection. As of March 20, 82 confirmed patients were discharged, 15 died, and 5 remained hospitalized. The median age was 57 years (range, 27 - 85), 59 (58%) were male, and 44 (43%) patients had a comorbidity. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea. When compared with survivors, non-survivors were older and more likely to have lymphopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), elevated d-dimer, and increased hypersensitive troponin I. In a multivariate regression model that included these predictors, older age and elevated LDH were independent risk factors for fatality. Twenty-one survivors and 11 non-survivors had CT scans within the first week. We used severity score to quantify the extent of lung opacification as described in the Supplementary Appendix. The total severity score and number of involved lung lobes within the first week were significantly greater in non-survivors compared to survivors . Using univariate logistic regression analysis, higher total severity score ([\u2265]15) (odds ratio 53, 95% CI 3-369; p = 0.003), and more involved lung lobes (5 involved lobes) (9, 2-53; p = 0.016) in CT images within the first week were significantly associated with fatality. Moreover, in this subset of patients with CT data within the first week, higher total severity score was the only independent risk factor in a multivariate analysis incorporated the predictors discussed above (older age, lymphocytopenia, elevated LDH, elevated d-dimer, and increased troponin I). For survivors with serial CT scans performed over four weeks, total severity score peaked in the second week. This report suggests that the extent of lung lesions in early CT images is a potential predictor of poor outcome of Covid-19. This will help clinicians to identify the patients with poor prognosis at early stage.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, K.; Chen, D.; Chen, S.; Feng, Y.; Chang, C.; Wang, Z.; Wang, N.; Zhen, G.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0829dddf617cecfe5949718bbab4a2514f066244.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.23.20041673v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Tongji Hospital","LDH","CT"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["confirmed patients","non-survivors","elevated LDH","higher total severity score","elevated d-dimer","Older age","subset of patients","early CT images","CT data","involved lobes","number of involved lung lobes","elevated lactate dehydrogenase","serial CT scans","predictor of fatality","median age","independent risk factors","extent of lung lesions","extent of lung opacification","multivariate analysis","predictors","increased troponin","early stage","confirmed cases of coronavirus disease","potential predictor of poor outcome of Covid","Tongji Hospital ethics committee","large regional hospital","multivariate regression model","increased hypersensitive troponin","early radiographic change","univariate logistic regression analysis","poor prognosis","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","lymphopenia","weeks","lymphocytopenia","SARS-CoV","quarantine unit","fever","cough","infection","Wuhan","China","study","common symptoms","years","range","laboratory","RNA detection","Supplementary Appendix","reviewed records","odds ratio","dyspnea","report","clinicians","deaths","comorbidity","male"],"language":"en"},

Up to March 11, 2020, 2019-nCov thoroughly broke out in Italy with over 10,000 confirmed cases notwithstanding the gradually block of the country since March 9, 2020. Estimation of possible infection population and prospective suggestion of handling spread based on exist data are of crucial importance. Considering of the biology parameters obtained based on Chinese clinical data in Wuhan, other scholars\u0027 work and real spread feature of 2019-nCov in Italy, we built a more applicable model called SEIJR with log-normal distributed time delay to forecast the trend of spreading. Adopting Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), we estimated the early period average spreading velocity (0) and conducted inversion analysis of time point (T0) when the virus first hit the Italy. Based on fixed 0 and T0, we then obtained the average spreading velocity 1 after the lock by PSO. For the aim of offering expeditious advice, we generated the prediction trends with different which we considered would be helpful in addressing the infection. Not only solved the complex, nondifferentiable equation of epidemic model, our research also performs well in inversion analysis based on PSO which conveys informative outcomes for further discussion on precatious action. To conclude, the first day of spread is around February 1, 2020 with the early period average spreading velocity 0=0.330 which is higher than most cities in China except Wuhan.

Design: Retrospective cohort study with data extracted from the electronic records of patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to our institution. Setting: Suburban general hospital serving the most populous London borough. Participants: The first 450 inpatients admitted to our hospital with swab-confirmed COVID-19 infection. Primary outcome: The primary outcome measure was death during the index hospital admission. Results: The median (IQR) age was 72 (56, 83), with 150 (33%) over 80 years old and 60% male. Presenting clinical and biochemical features were consistent with those reported elsewhere. The ethnic breakdown of patients admitted was similar to that of our underlying local population with no excess of BAME deaths. Inpatient mortality was high at 38%. Patients over 80 presented earlier in their disease course and were significantly less likely to present with the typical features of cough, breathlessness and fever. Cardiac co-morbidity and markers of cardiac dysfunction were more common, but not those of bacterial infection. Mortality was significantly higher in this group (60% vs 28%, p \u003C0.001). 31 (7%) of patients were classified as having hospital-onset COVID-19 infection. The peak of hospital-onset infections occurred at the same time as the overall peak of admitted infections. Despite being older and more frail, the outcomes for this cohort were no worse. Conclusions: Inpatient mortality was high, especially among the over-80s, who were more likely to present atypically. The ethnic composition of our caseload was similar to the underlying population. While a significant number of patients presented with COVID-19 while already in hospital, their outcomes were no worse.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brill, S.

During the initial epidemic in England, virus testing for older adults was restricted to symptomatic hospitalized patients. We aimed to estimate associations between pre-existing diagnoses and COVID-19 status, in a large community cohort. Methods: UK Biobank (England) participants assessed 2006 to 2010, followed in hospital discharge records to 2017. Demographic and pre-existing common diagnoses association tested with COVID-19 status (16th March to 14th April 2020) in logistic models, adjusted for demographics, study site and other diagnoses. Results: There were 274,356 participants aged 65\u002B, including 448 (0.16%) hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Common co-morbidities in patients were hypertension (58.5%), coronary heart disease (CHD, 21.1%), history of fall or fragility fractures (30.6%), and type 2 diabetes (19.6%). However, in adjusted models, COVID-19 patients were more likely than other participants to have pre-existing dementia (OR=3.07 95% CI 1.71 to 5.50), COPD (OR= 1.82 CI 1.33 to 2.49), depression (OR=1.81 CI 1.36 to 2.40), type 2 diabetes (OR=1.70 CI 1.30 to 2.21), chronic kidney disease and atrial fibrillation. Hypertension was modestly associated (OR=1.29 CI 1.04 to 1.59), but CHD (OR=0.92 CI 0.71 to 1.20) prevalence was similar in COVID-19 patients and other participants.

Screening for testing has been based on symptoms typically observed in inpatients, yet outpatient symptom complexes may differ. Methods: Classification and regression trees (CART) recursive partitioning created a decision tree classifying enrollees into laboratory-confirmed cases and non-cases. Demographic and symptom data from patients ages 18-87 years who were enrolled from March 29-April 26, 2020 were included. Presence or absence of SARSCoV2 was the target variable. Results: Of 736 tested, 55 were positive for SARS-CoV2. Cases significantly more often reported chills, loss of taste/smell, diarrhea, fever, nausea/vomiting and contact with a COVID-19 case, but less frequently reported shortness of breath and sore throat. A 7-terminal node tree with a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 53%, and an AUC of 78% was developed. The positive predictive value for this tree was 14% while the negative predictive value was 99%. Almost half (44%) of the participants could be ruled out as likely non-cases without testing. Discussion: Among those referred for testing, negative responses to three questions could classify about half of tested persons with low risk for SARS-CoV2 and would save limited testing resources. These questions are: was the patient in contact with a COVID-19 case? Has the patient experienced 1) a loss of taste or smell; or 2) nausea or vomiting? The outpatient symptoms of COVID-19 appear to be broader than the well-known inpatient syndrome.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zimmerman, R. K.; Nowalk, M.

As the growth of infection slows, decisions regarding easing of lockdown restrictions are required, keeping in view the capacity of the health-care system. In this paper, we quantify the impact of a multi-phased release of the population from lockdown. Using the SIR model for epidemic spread, we design and implement a method to determine the earliest time of release from lockdown restrictions, constrained by a specified threshold on the subsequent peaks of infection. Trade-offs between the threshold and the earliest times of removing lockdown restrictions are illustrated.

A low-threshold screening regimen was implemented to determine the prevalence and clinical presentation of COVID-19 among HCWs in these two hospitals. Methods HCWs who suffered from fever or respiratory symptoms were voluntarily tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR on oropharyngeal samples. Structured interviews were conducted to document symptoms for all HCWs with confirmed COVID-19. Findings Thirteen-hundred fifty-three (14%) of 9,705 HCWs employed were tested, 86 (6%) of whom were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Most HCWs suffered from relatively mild disease and only 46 (53%) reported fever. Seventy-nine (92%) HCWs met a case definition of fever and/or coughing and/or shortness of breath. None of the HCWs identified through the screening reported a travel history to China or Northern Italy, and 3 (3%) reported to have been exposed to an inpatient known with COVID-19 prior to the onset of symptoms. Interpretation Within two weeks after the first Dutch case was detected, a substantial proportion of HCWs with fever or respiratory symptoms were infected with SARS-CoV-2, probably caused by acquisition of the virus in the community during the early phase of local spread.

The serious limitations of using crude rates for comparisons are sometimes overlooked. In this paper we examined to what extent the age distribution of the cases is responsible for the differences in CFRs between countries. Methods Data on COVID-19 were extracted from the reports of individual countries. Overall and age-specific CFRs were available for six countries. The CFRs by country were adjusted for age using the direct method, using the combined age-specific number of cases of all six countries as the standard population. Findings The age distribution of the cases varied widely between countries. The crude CFRs varied between 1.6% and 11%. The differences in the age-specific CFRs were much smaller and the age-adjusted rates were much closer than the crude rates. The ratio of the crude CFR for the country with the highest to that with the lowest, was reduced substantially from 7.4 to 2.3 for the age-adjusted rates. Conclusions The age structure of the cases dramatically impacts on the differences in the crude CFRs between countries. Adjusting for age substantially reduces this variation. Other factors such as the differences in the definition of the denominators, the definition of a case and the standard of healthcare are likely to account for much of the residual variation.

The purpose of our study is to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient outcomes and the healthcare system in Ontario, Canada. Methods: We developed an individual-level simulation to model the flow of COVID-19 patients through the Ontario healthcare system. We simulated different combined scenarios of epidemic trajectory and healthcare capacity. Outcomes include numbers of patients needing admission to the ward, Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and requiring ventilation; days to resource depletion; and numbers of patients awaiting resources and deaths associated with limited access to resources. Findings: We demonstrate that with effective early public health measures system resources need not be depleted. For scenarios considering late or ineffective implementation of physical distancing, health system resources would be depleted within 14-26 days. Resource depletion was also avoided or delayed with aggressive measures to rapidly increase ICU, ventilator, and acute care hospital capacity. Interpretation: We found that without aggressive physical distancing measures the Ontario healthcare system would have been inadequately equipped to manage the expected number of patients with COVID-19, despite the rapid capacity increase. This overall lack of resources would have led to an increase in mortality. By slowing the spread of the disease via ongoing public health measures and having increased healthcare capacity, Ontario may have avoided catastrophic stresses to its health care system.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barrett, Kali; Khan, Yasin A; Mac, Stephen; Ximenes, Raphael; Naimark, David MJ; Sander, Beate","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.19.20071712v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Intensive Care Unit","ICU"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["Ontario healthcare system","health system resources","health care system","increased healthcare capacity","healthcare systems","effective early public health measures system resources","numbers of patients","aggressive measures","ongoing public health measures","rapid capacity increase","flow of COVID","overall lack of resources","acute care hospital capacity","ICU","aggressive physical distancing","expected number of patients","days","Resource depletion","Intensive Care Unit","ineffective implementation of physical distancing","patient outcomes","global spread of coronavirus disease","different combined scenarios of epidemic trajectory","ward","admission","ventilator","deaths","catastrophic stresses","pandemic","significant strain","limited access","individual-level simulation","Background","impact","jurisdictions","ventilation","Canada","study","purpose","Methods","Findings","Interpretation","mortality"],"language":"en"},

Methods: In this retrospective single center study, we finally included 245 consecutive patients who confirmed COVID 19 in Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital from January 1 to February 29. Cases were classified as either discharged or dead. Demographic, clinical and laboratory datas were registered, two different nutritional indices were calculated: (i)the Controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score; (ii) prognostic nutritional index (PNI). We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to explore the relationship between nutritional indices and hospital death . Results: 212 of them were discharged and 33 of them died. In hospital mortality was signifcantly higher in the severe group of PNI than in the moderate and normal groups. It was also significantly worse in the severe CONUT group than in the moderate, mild , and normal CONUT groups.

Using the UK as a case study,we construct a stochastic branching process model for the virus transmission, embedded on a network interaction model encoding mobility patterns in the UK. The network model is based on commuter data from the 2011 census, a catchment area model for schools, and a phenomenological model for mobility and interactions outside of work, school, and the home.We show that for outbreak scenarios where contact-tracing and moderate social distancing alone provide suppression but do not contain the spread, targeted lockdowns or mass-testing interventions at the level of individual communities (with just a few thousand inhabitants) can be effective at containing outbreaks. For spatially targeted mass-testing, a moderate increase in testing capacity would be required (typically\u003C40000 additional tests per day), while for local lockdowns we find that only a small fraction (typically\u003C0.1%) of the population needs to be locked down at any one time (assuming that one third of transmission occurs in the home, at work or school, and out in the wider community respectively). The efficacy of spatially targeted interventions is contingent on an appreciable fraction of transmission events occurring within (relative to across)communities. Confirming the efficacy of community-level interventions therefore calls for detailed investigation of spatial transmission patterns for SARS-CoV-2, accounting for sub-community-scale transmission dynamics, and changes in mobility patterns due to the presence of other containment measures (such as social distancing and travel restrictions).","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alsing, J.; Kirk, T.; Usher, N.; Crowley, P.

However, COVID-19 is spreading in different rates at different countries. Here, we tested the effect of three classes of predictors, i.e., socioeconomic, climatic and transport, on the rate of daily increase of COVID-19. We found that global connections, represented by countries importance in the global air transportation network, is the main explanation for the growth rate of COVID-19 in different countries. Climate, geographic distance and socioeconomics did not affect this big picture analysis. Geographic distance and climate were significant barriers in the past but were surpassed by the human engine that allowed us to colonize almost every corner on Earth. Based on our global analysis, the global network of air transportation could lead to a worst-case scenario of synchronous global pandemic if board control measures in international airports were not taken and are not sustained during this pandemic. Despite all limitations of a global analysis, our results indicate that the current claims that the growth rate of COVID-19 may be lower in tropical countries should be taken very carefully, at risk to disturb well-established and effective policy of social isolation that may help to avoid higher mortality rates due to collapse of national health systems. This is the case of Brazil, a well-connected tropical country that presents the second highest increase rate of COVID-19 and might experience a serious case of human-induced disasters if decision makers take into consideration unsupported claims of the growth rate of COVID-19 might be lower in tropical countries.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coelho, Marco Tulio Pacheco; Rodrigues, Joao Fabricio Mota; Medina, Anderson Matos; Scalco, Paulo; Terribile, Levi Carina; Vilela, Bruno; Diniz-Filho, Jose Alexandre Felizola; Dobrovolski, Ricardo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c9306850b5da6412d800d19643c80d3dc3af2dc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.20050773","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs3NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["growth rate of COVID","global analysis","different countries","tropical countries","highest increase rate of COVID","rate of daily increase of COVID","pandemic state of COVID","global connections","global air transportation network","global network of air transportation","countries importance","different rates","worst-case scenario of synchronous global pandemic","Climate","geographic distance","serious case of human","well-connected tropical country","big picture analysis","current claims","case of Brazil","human engine","consideration unsupported claims","higher mortality rates","board control measures","decision makers","induced disasters","main explanation","socioeconomics","significant barriers","effective policy of social isolation","collapse of national health systems","international airports","results","classes of predictors","world","quarantine","risk","unprecedented economic crisis","SARS CoV","limitations","corner","Earth"],"language":"en"},

Heterogeneity in transmission risk is a known phenomenon in infectious diseases and was also seen in SARS and MERS outbreaks since 2003. The pandemic has led countries to control the pandemic spread using unprecedented severe mitigation strategies that include quarantine and lock-down. This has has been highly successful in terms of halting the spread, but had enormous socioeconomic cost. We set out to theoretically explore whether a model that includes the phenomenon of superspreaders may guide us towards a cost-effective mitigation strategy. Methods: We developed an agent-based model that includes persons that spread the disease far more readily than other persons. This allow us to investigate effect of containment strategies in both a random SEIR like scenario, and in a transmission model that work with structured society. Our model considered even contact patterns in three settings: home, work and a category of \u0022other\u0022 settings representing diffuse social contacts. We introduced superspreaders either as a fixed proportion of the population, or as a broad spectrum of infectivity. For each choice, the model was then calibrated to an overall realistic daily growth rate of 23 percentage. As sensitivity analyses we varied the fraction of superspreaders as well the distribution of their infectivity. To compare the simulation findings for each mitigation scenario we considered the maximum daily ICU utility. Results: As expected, without mitigation imposed, the inclusion of superspreaders does not meaningfully change the epidemic trajectory. However when introducing mitigation strategies imposed on each of the three settings, we find that the presence of superspreaders made a substantial difference. The simulations demonstrate that the best strategy is to focus on limiting contacts in the other category. This in particular suggests that limiting diffuse social contacts in settings such as bars, transportation, restaurants, parties, concerts and lecture halls is far more effective than limiting the same amount of contact events in the home and work setting. Conclusions: To appreciate effect of heterogeneity in various social spheres we need to rethink disease transmission models. Doing so, we found that wide distribution of infectivity favours strategies that reduces the max, while leaving the typical behaviour undisturbed. We found that most workplaces may be opened without much influence on the epidemic, while one could snuff out transmission with an effective avoidance of other contacts. Interestingly, including a consideration of superspreaders can help explain the dramatic success of even moderate lock-down strategies as that practiced in Denmark and Sweden. And it points to the need to avoid mass gatherings until either flock immunity has been achieved or an effective vaccine is available.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sneppen, K.; Simonsen, L.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b3fe6ea0fd2eae1578167597bf9391e8d58cdb3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.17.20104745v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs3NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","MERS","ICU"],"locations":["Denmark","Sweden"],"keyphrases":["settings","phenomenon of superspreaders","mitigation scenario","presence of superspreaders","fraction of superspreaders","inclusion of superspreaders","consideration of superspreaders","unprecedented severe mitigation strategies","pandemic spread","diffuse social contacts","effect of containment strategies","cost-effective mitigation strategy","transmission risk","wide distribution of infectivity favours strategies","disease transmission models","agent-based model","home","global pandemic","effect of heterogeneity","effective avoidance","effective vaccine","persons","contact events","work setting","category","need","various social spheres","broad spectrum of infectivity","known phenomenon","moderate lock","superspreader events","best strategy","epidemic trajectory","emerging SARS-CoV","maximum daily ICU utility","overall realistic daily growth rate","parties","bars","concerts","restaurants","transportation","virus","quarantine","lecture halls","population","mass gatherings","percentage","infectious diseases","random SEIR","dramatic success","flock immunity","Background","enormous socioeconomic cost","fixed proportion","substantial difference","simulation findings","structured society","countries","patterns","typical behaviour undisturbed","influence","simulations","MERS outbreaks","terms","Conclusions","Denmark","workplaces","Sweden","sensitivity","Methods","choice","Results"],"language":"en"},

Yet, as there is no treatment nor a vaccine that was approved so far, universal safety precautions (USPs) and mitigating strategies are the only way to deal with this emergency crisis. However, knowledge and beliefs towards USPs among the general public in countries such as India with a large population are lacking. Methods: A prospective, cross-sectional, web-based online survey was conducted among the general public in India during March 2020. A 20-items self-administered survey questionnaire was developed and randomly distributed among the public using google document forms through social media networks. Descriptive statistics were used in representing the study characteristics, and the Chi-square test was used in assessing the associations among the study variables with a p-value of \u003C 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: Of 1287 participants, 1117 have given their consent of willingness and completed the questionnaire with a response rate of 86.8%. The mean age of the study participants was 28.8 \u00B1 10.9 years, where the majority of them belong to the age category \u003C25 years, and sex was equally distributed. Based upon the socio-demographic information, the majority were post-graduates (32.9%), professional job holders (45%) and belonged to the upper-middle (40%) economic class. Overall, the knowledge and beliefs towards USPs and mitigating strategies among participants varied between moderate to high, with statistically significant associations with their socio-demographic characteristics. Conclusions: Although the knowledge and beliefs of the general public in India towards USPs are encouraging, there is a need for long-term educational interventions as the dynamics and severity of COVID-19 have been changing day-by-day rapidly. The findings of this study could guide the public health authorities in making and implementing decisions to combat this pandemic.

It has been proved that host-cell-expressed CD147 could bind spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and involve in host cell invasion. Antibody against CD147 could block the infection of SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of meplazumab, a humanized anti-CD147 antibody, as add-on therapy in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: All patients received recommended strategy from Diagnosis and Treatment for 2019 Novel Coronavirus Diseases released by National Health Commission of China. Eligible patients were add-on administered 10 mg meplazumab intravenously at days 1, 2, and 5. Patients hospitalized in the same period were observed as concurrent control. The endpoints include virological clearance rate, case severity, chest radiographic, and laboratory test. This trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of Institution at the Tangdu hospital, and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT 04275245. Findings:17 patients were enrolled and assigned to meplazumab group between Feb 3, 2020 and Feb 10, 2020. 11 hospitalized patients served as concurrent control. Baseline characteristics were generally balanced across two groups. Compared to control group, meplazumab treatment significantly improved the discharged (p=0.006) and case severity (p=0.021) in critical and severe patients. The time to virus negative in meplazumab group was reduced than that in control group (median 3, 95%CI[1.5-4.5] vs. 13, [6.5-19.5]; p=0.014, HR=0.37, 95%CI[0.155-0.833]). The percentages of patients recovered to the normal lymphocyte count and CRP concentration were also increased remarkably and rapidly in meplazumab group. No adverse effect was found in meplazumab-treated patients. Interpretation:Meplazumab efficiently improved the recovery of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with a favorable safety profile.

Abstract Introduction: The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection has led to a radical reorganization of healthcare resources. Surgical Departments need to adapt to this change. Patients and methods: We performed a prospective descriptive observational study of the incidence of COVID-19 in patients and surgeons of a General Surgical Department in a high prevalence area, between the 1st and 31st of March 2020. Results: Patients: The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in elective surgery patients was 7% (mean age 59.5 years). All survived. Of 36 patients who underwent emergency surgery, two of them were SARS-CoV-2 positive and one was clinically highly suspicious of COVID-19 (11.1%). All three patients died of respiratory failure (mean age 81 years). Surgeons: There were a total of 12 confirmed SARS-CoV-2\u002B cases among the surgical department staff (24.4%) (8 out of 34 consultants and 4 out of 15 residents). Healthcare activity: The average number of daily emergency surgical interventions declined from 3.6 in February to 1.16 in March. 42% of the patients who underwent emergency surgery had peritonitis upon presentation. Conclusions: The fast pace of COVID-19 pandemia, should alert surgical departments of the need of adopting early measures to ensure the safety of patients and staff.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u00C1lvarez Gallego, M; Gort\u00E1zar de las Casas, S; Pascual Miguel\u00E1\u00F1ez, I; Rubio-P\u00E9rez, I; Barrag\u00E1n Serrano, C; \u00C1lvarez Pe\u00F1a, E; D\u00EDaz Dom\u00EDnguez, J","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d6566d0324d2edba9753338a91d89eb21de3d57.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009739X20301068; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009739X20301068?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs4NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["out of","The incidence of SARS","st of March","The rapid spread of SARS","ensure the safety of patients and staff","two of them were SARS","should alert surgical departments of the need of adopting early","There were a total of","radical reorganization of healthcare","We performed a prospective descriptive observational study of the incidence of COVID","between the","The fast","casos SARS","in patients and surgeons of a General Surgical Department in a high prevalence area","Patients and methods","pacientes intervenidos","All three patients died of respiratory failure","and one was clinically highly suspicious of COVID","of the patients who underwent emergency surgery had peritonitis upon presentation","casos de COVID","confirmed SARS","The average number of daily emergency surgical interventions declined from","pacientes programados","among the surgical department staff","st and","infection in elective surgery patients was","consultants and","in March","servicios de Cirug\u00EDa General","in February","Surgical Departments need","poblaci\u00F3n general","Servicio de Cirug\u00EDa General","cirujanos","aumento de casos","alta incidencia de infecci\u00F3n","years","edad media era","Healthcare activity","radical reorganizaci\u00F3n","All survived","primeras medidas de aislamiento","medidas de forma precoz","pandemia","n\u00FAmero medio","nivel regional","\u00E1rea","led","Abstract Introduction","recursos sanitarios","estudio observacional descriptivo prospectivo","r\u00E1pida expansi\u00F3n","insuficiencia respiratoria","entrada","necesidad","intervenciones quir\u00FArgicas urgentes","exposici\u00F3n de profesionales","vigor","hospitalizaci\u00F3n","Aparato Digestivo","adapt","residents","Conclusions","urgencia","Results","Actividad asistencial","cuadros evolucionados","Resumen Introducci\u00F3n","change","seguridad","m\u00E9todos","contagio","Conclusiones","Resultados","adjuntos","residentes","cambio","planta"],"language":"es"},

We analysed an outbreak involving three non-associated families in Restaurant X in Guangzhou, China, and assessed the possibility of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and characterize the associated environmental conditions. Methods: We collected epidemiological data, obtained a video record and a patron seating-arrangement from the restaurant, and measured the dispersion of a warm tracer gas as a surrogate for exhaled droplets from the suspected index patient. Computer simulations were performed to simulate the spread of fine exhaled droplets. We compared the in-room location of subsequently infected cases and spread of the simulated virus-laden aerosol tracer. The ventilation rate was measured using the tracer decay method. Results: Three families (A, B, C), 10 members of which were subsequently found to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 at this time, or previously, ate lunch at Restaurant X on Chinese New Year\u0027s Eve (January 24, 2020) at three neighboring tables. Subsequently, three members of family B and two members of family C became infected with SARS-CoV-2, whereas none of the waiters or 68 patrons at the remaining 15 tables became infected. During this occasion, the ventilation rate was 0.75-1.04 L/s per person. No close contact or fomite contact was observed, aside from back-to-back sitting by some patrons. Our results show that the infection distribution is consistent with a spread pattern representative of exhaled virus-laden aerosols. Conclusions: Aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 due to poor ventilation may explain the community spread of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yuguo; Qian, Hua; Hang, Jian; Chen, Xuguang; Hong, Ling; Liang, Peng; Li, Jiansen; Xiao, Shenglan; Wei, Jianjian; Liu, Li; Kang, Min","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb68c8658bb181bb7e84f6a34145b3a95c22361a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.16.20067728v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs4NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","possibility of aerosol transmission of SARS","Restaurant X","spread of fine exhaled droplets","infected cases","ventilation rate","members of family C","members of family B","simulated virus-laden aerosol tracer","spread pattern representative of exhaled virus-laden aerosols","poor ventilation","patrons","Results","warm tracer gas","non-associated families","tracer decay method","role of aerosols","close contact","fomite contact","neighboring tables","associated environmental conditions","surrogate","video record","Chinese New Year\u0027s Eve","lunch","Guangzhou","patron seating-arrangement","infection distribution","suspected index patient","epidemiological data","China","dispersion","community","room location","outbreak","Conclusions","Methods","waiters","Background","time","occasion","Computer simulations","person","COVID"],"language":"en"},

Lung injury has been reported as the major outcome of COVID-19 infection. However, liver damage has also been considered to occur in severe cases. Current meta-analysis of retrospective studies was done to summarize available findings on the association between liver injury and severity of COVID-19 infection. Methods: Online databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane Library were searched to detect relevant publications up to 1 April 2020, using relevant keywords. To pool data, a fixed- or random-effects model was used depending on the heterogeneity between studies. Furthermore, publication bias test and sensitivity analysis were also done. Results: In total, 20 retrospective studies with 3,428 COVID-19 infected patients (severe cases = 1,455 and mild cases = 1,973), were included in this meta-analysis.

We report an optimised pipeline for faecal host DNA analysis from the point-of-collection to droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) absolute quantification of host-specific gene targets. We evaluated multiple methods for preservation and isolation of host DNA from stool to identify the highest performing methods. To quantify host DNA even if present in partially degraded form, we developed sensitive, human-specific short-amplicon ddPCR assays targeting repetitive nuclear genomic elements (LINE-1) and mitochondrial genes. We validated the ability of these optimised methods to perform absolute quantification of host DNA in 200 stool DNA extracts from samples that were serially collected from three healthy individuals and three hospitalised patients. These specimens allowed assessment of host DNA day-to-day variability in stool specimens with widely varying physical characteristics (i.e., Bristol scores).

We analyze steady states of various multi-state disease propagation models with heterogeneous contact rates. In many models, heterogeneity simply decreases epidemic thresholds. However, in models with competing pathogens and mutation, coexistence of different pathogens for small infection rates requires network-independent conditions in addition to heterogeneity in contact rates.

Currently there is no proven treatment for COVID-19 and there is an urgent need for the development of vaccines and therapeutics. Coronavirus spike glycoproteins play a critical role in coronavirus entry into the host cells, as they provide host cell recognition and membrane fusion between virus and host cell. Thus, they emerged as popular and promising drug targets. Crystal structures of spike protein in its closed and open states were resolved very recently in March 2020. These structures comprise 77% of the sequence and provide almost the complete protein structure. Based on down and up positions of receptor binding domain (RBD), spike protein can be in a receptor inaccessible closed or receptor accessible open state, respectively. Starting from closed and open state crystal structures, and also 16 intermediate conformations, an extensive set of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in the presence of explicit water and ions were performed. Simulations show that in its down position, RBD has significantly lower mobility compared to its up position; probably caused by the 6 interdomain salt bridges of RBD in down position compared to 3 in up position. Free energy landscapes based on MD simulations revealed a semi-open state located between closed and open states. Minimum energy pathway between down and up positions comprised a gradual salt bridge switching mechanism. Furthermore, although significantly lower than open state, ACE2 binding surface of RBD contained a partial solvent accessibility in its closed state.","publish_time":"2020-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gur, Mert; Taka, Elhan; Yilmaz, Sema Zeynep; Kilinc, Ceren; Aktas, Umut; Golcuk, Mert","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7205aa607d57283e21ee6a24e2ce329a34a6de38.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.047324","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs5Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["RBD"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["closed state","semi-open state","open state crystal structures","open states","receptor accessible open state","receptor inaccessible closed","Crystal structures of spike protein","MD simulations","Coronavirus spike glycoproteins","ACE2 binding surface of RBD","positions of receptor binding domain","host cell recognition","host cells","coronavirus entry","interdomain salt bridges of RBD","novel coronavirus","complete protein structure","lower mobility","disease COVID","gradual salt bridge","Free energy landscapes","Minimum energy pathway","extensive set of all-atom molecular dynamics","membrane fusion","critical role","partial solvent accessibility","intermediate conformations","presence of explicit water","development of vaccines","SARS-CoV","promising drug targets","urgent need","mechanism","sequence","therapeutics","proven treatment","recorded appearance","infections","deaths"],"language":"en"},

To date, many epidemic projections and policies addressing COVID-19 have been designed without seroprevalence data to inform epidemic parameters. We measured the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County. Methods On 4/3-4/4, 2020, we tested county residents for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using a lateral flow immunoassay. Participants were recruited using Facebook ads targeting a representative sample of the county by demographic and geographic characteristics. We report the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a sample of 3,330 people, adjusting for zip code, sex, and race/ethnicity. We also adjust for test performance characteristics using 3 different estimates: (i) the test manufacturer\u0027s data, (ii) a sample of 37 positive and 30 negative controls tested at Stanford, and (iii) a combination of both. Results The unadjusted prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County was 1.5% (exact binomial 95CI 1.11-1.97%), and the population-weighted prevalence was 2.81% (95CI 2.24-3.37%). Under the three scenarios for test performance characteristics, the population prevalence of COVID-19 in Santa Clara ranged from 2.49% (95CI 1.80-3.17%) to 4.16% (2.58-5.70%). These prevalence estimates represent a range between 48,000 and 81,000 people infected in Santa Clara County by early April, 50-85-fold more than the number of confirmed cases. Conclusions The population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Santa Clara County implies that the infection is much more widespread than indicated by the number of confirmed cases. Population prevalence estimates can now be used to calibrate epidemic and mortality projections.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bendavid, Eran; Mulaney, Bianca; Sood, Neeraj; Shah, Soleil; Ling, Emilia; Bromley-Dulfano, Rebecca; Lai, Cara; Weissberg, Zoe; Saavedra, Rodrigo; Tedrow, James; Tversky, Dona; Bogan, Andrew; Kupiec, Thomas; Eichner, Daniel; Gupta, Ribhav; Ioannidis, John; Bhattacharya, Jay","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bfac9aa59484812c0903029ae8f72446a2a07f44.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.20062463","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs1MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Stanford","Santa Clara County"],"locations":["Santa Clara"],"keyphrases":["Santa Clara County","population prevalence of SARS","SARS-CoV","population prevalence of COVID","Population prevalence estimates","unadjusted prevalence of antibodies","population-weighted prevalence","county residents","seroprevalence of antibodies","test performance characteristics","epidemic projections","geographic characteristics","representative sample","people","test manufacturer\u0027s data","different estimates","epidemic parameters","seroprevalence data","number of confirmed cases","mortality projections","demographic","sex","race","zip code","pressing health","Facebook ads","policies","infection","negative controls","exact binomial","social concern","date","scenarios","range","Conclusions","lateral flow immunoassay","Stanford","ethnicity","Participants","fold","Background","Methods","combination"],"language":"en"},

Based on the method of traditional positional weight matrix trained by the peptides around cleavage sites, the present method also sufficiently considers the length conservation of non-structural proteins cleaved by the 3C-like proteinase and papain-like proteinase to reduce the false positive prediction rate. The improved system, ZCURVE_CoV 2.0, has been run for each of the 24 completely sequenced coronavirus genomes in GenBank.

The rapid, sensitive and specific diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 by fast and unambiguous testing is widely recognized to be critical in responding the current outbreak. Since the current testing capacity by conventional PCR based methods is insufficient because of shortages of supplies such as RNA extraction kits and PCR reagents, alternative and/or complementary testing assays should be developed. Here, we exploit the potential of targeted mass spectrometry based proteomic technologies to solve the current issue of insufficient SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing capacity. We have assessed the limit of detection by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) on an Orbitrap Eclipse mass spectrometer for target tryptic peptides of several SARS-CoV-2 proteins from a sample of virus infected Vero cells. For Nucleocapsid protein the limit of detection was found to be in the mid-attomole range (0.9 \u00D7 10\u221212 g), which would theoretically correspond to approximately 10,000 SARS-CoV-2 particles, under the assumption that all viral proteins are assembled in macromolecular virus particles. Whether or not this sensitivity is sufficient to play a role in SARS-CoV-2 detection in patient material such as swabs or body fluids largely depends on the amount of viral proteins present in such samples and is subject of further research. If yes, mass spectrometry based methods could serve as a complementary protein based diagnostic tool and further steps should be focused on sample preparation protocols and on improvements in sample throughput.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bezstarosti, Karel; Lamers, Mart M.; Haagmans, Bart L.; Demmers, Jeroen A.

The identification of synergistic drug combinations, however, is challenging. Detailed understanding of antibiotic mechanisms can address this issue by facilitating the rational design of improved combination therapies. Here, using diverse biochemical and genetic assays, we reveal the molecular mechanisms of niclosamide, a clinically-approved salicylanilide compound, and demonstrate its potential for Gram-negative combination therapies. We discovered that Gram-negative bacteria possess two innate resistance mechanisms that reduce their niclosamide susceptibility: a primary mechanism mediated by multidrug efflux pumps and a secondary mechanism of nitroreduction. When efflux was compromised, niclosamide became a potent antibiotic, dissipating the proton motive force (PMF), increasing oxidative stress and reducing ATP production to cause cell death. These insights guided the identification of diverse compounds that synergized with salicylanilides when co-administered (efflux inhibitors, membrane permeabilizers, and antibiotics that are expelled by PMF-dependent efflux), thus suggesting that salicylanilide compounds may have broad utility in combination therapies. We validate these findings in vivo using a murine abscess model, where we show that niclosamide synergizes with the membrane permeabilizing antibiotic colistin against high-density infections of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative clinical isolates. We further demonstrate that enhanced nitroreductase activity is a potential route to adaptive niclosamide resistance but show that this causes collateral susceptibility to clinical nitro-prodrug antibiotics. Thus, we highlight how mechanistic understanding of mode of action, innate/adaptive resistance, and synergy can rationally guide the discovery, development and stewardship of novel combination therapies. Importance There is a critical need for more effective treatments to combat multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections. Combination therapies are a promising strategy, especially when these enable existing clinical drugs to be repurposed as antibiotics. We reveal the mechanisms of action and basis of innate Gram-negative resistance for the anthelmintic drug niclosamide, and subsequently exploit this information to demonstrate that niclosamide and analogs kill Gram-negative bacteria when combined with antibiotics that inhibit drug efflux or permeabilize membranes. We confirm the synergistic potential of niclosamide in vitro against a diverse range of recalcitrant Gram-negative clinical isolates, and in vivo in a mouse abscess model. We also demonstrate that nitroreductases can confer resistance to niclosamide, but show that evolution of these enzymes for enhanced niclosamide resistance confers a collateral sensitivity to other clinical antibiotics. Our results highlight how detailed mechanistic understanding can accelerate the evaluation and implementation of new combination therapies.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Copp, Janine N.; Pletzer, Daniel; Brown, Alistair S.; Van der Heijden, Joris; Miton, Charlotte M.; Edgar, Rebecca J.; Rich, Michelle H.; Little, Rory F; Williams, Elsie M.; Hancock, Robert E.W.; Tokuriki, Nobuhiko; Ackerley, David F.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.23.058875","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs2MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ATP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Gram-negative combination therapies","enhanced niclosamide resistance","adaptive niclosamide resistance","niclosamide susceptibility","molecular mechanisms of niclosamide","synergistic potential of niclosamide","clinical antibiotics","anthelmintic drug niclosamide","multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria","resistant Gram-negative clinical isolates","basis of innate Gram-negative resistance","innate resistance mechanisms","multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections","adaptive resistance","combination therapy","stewardship of novel combination therapies","implementation of new combination therapies","multidrug efflux pumps","diverse range of recalcitrant Gram-negative clinical isolates","rational design of improved combination therapies","efflux inhibitors","mechanisms of action","Detailed understanding of antibiotic mechanisms","clinical nitro-prodrug antibiotics","existing clinical drugs","PMF-dependent efflux","high-density infections of multidrug","identification of diverse compounds","detailed mechanistic understanding","potential route","collateral susceptibility","potent antibiotic","salicylanilide compounds","mechanistic understanding of mode","identification of synergistic drug combinations","membrane permeabilizing antibiotic colistin","co-administration of multiple drugs","murine abscess model","mouse abscess model","membrane permeabilizers","primary mechanism","collateral sensitivity","promising strategy","enhanced nitroreductase activity","secondary mechanism of nitroreduction","approved salicylanilide compound","evaluation","salicylanilides","effective treatments","ATP production","proton motive force","development","broad utility","oxidative stress","genetic assays","critical need","discovery","issue","enzymes","evolution","analogs","cell death","findings","synergy","results","insights","information","avenue","Importance","membranes","nitroreductases"],"language":"en"},

It affects every country without considering country\u0027s race, nationality and economic status. This paper aims at analysing primarily the current situations of Bangladesh and predicting infections and deaths for moderated term intervals by a proposed projection technique called Infection Trajectory-Pathway Strategy (ITPS) and for short term intervals prediction for total infections, deaths along with total number of severe patients and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients by polynomial regression modeling approach. Since April 7, Bangladesh has started to face critical situations as the number of infections has accelerated very fast in the following days. However, the fatality rate decreases considerably from 15.7 on April 1 to 4.9 on April 14, which is still high among the south asian countries. Of the 1012 cases reported on April 14, almost 70\\% are the male, 42\\% are from the capital Dhaka. We have found that the potential pathway of infections for Bangldesh would be the similar pathways that are experienced by Austria, Netherlands, Israel, France and United Kingdom. These countries are ahead a number of weeks and days in terms of infection cases since their 100-th confirmed cases. Our proposed projection method ITPS suggests that by May 10, Bangladesh will cross 12000 incidences and 720 deaths which, by May 16 will be 27000 and 1644 respectively. On the other hand, the regression model suggests that by the end of April, total number of infections, deaths, severe patients and ICU patients will be 5780, 347, 775, and 694 respectively.

As a consequence the Balearic Islands remained almost fully isolated due to the closing of airports and ports, These isolation measures and the home-based confinement have led to a low incidence of COVID-19 in this region. We propose a compartmental model for the spread of COVID-19 including five compartments (Susceptible, Latent, Infected, Diseased, and Recovered), and the mobility between municipalities. The model parameters are calibrated with the temporal series of confirmed cases provided by the Spanish Ministry of Health. After calibration, the proposed model captures the trend of the official confirmed cases before and after the lockdown. We show that the estimated number of cases depends strongly on the initial dates of the local outbreak onset and the number of imported cases before the lockdown. Our estimations indicate that the population has not reached the level of herd immunization necessary to prevent future outbreaks. While the low incidence, in comparison to mainland Spain, has prevented the saturation of the health system, this low incidence translates into low immunization rates, therefore facilitating the propagation of new outbreaks that could lead to secondary waves of COVID-19 in the region. These findings warn about scenarios regarding after-lockdown-policies and the risk of second outbreaks, emphasize the need for widespread testing, and could potentially be extrapolated to other insular and continental regions.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eguiluz, V.

We used a combination of classic epidemiological methods, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning (for predictive modeling), to analyse the electronic health records (EHRs) of patients with COVID-19. We explored the unstructured free text in the EHRs within the SESCAM Healthcare Network (Castilla La-Mancha, Spain) from the entire population with available EHRs (1,364,924 patients) from January 1st to March 29th, 2020.

A total of 10,504 patients with a clinical or PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified, 52.5% males, with a mean age of 58.2 and S.D. 19.7 years. Upon admission, the most common symptoms were cough, fever, and dyspnoea, but all in less than half of cases. Overall, 6% of hospitalized patients required ICU admission. Using a machine-learning, data-driven algorithm we identified that a combination of age, fever, and tachypnoea was the most parsimonious predictor of ICU admission: those younger than 56 years, without tachypnoea, and temperature \u003C39 C, (or \u003E39 C without respiratory crackles), were free of ICU admission. On the contrary, COVID-19 patients aged 40 to 79 years were likely to be admitted to the ICU if they had tachypnoea and delayed their visit to the ER after being seen in primary care.

Developing high throughput diagnostics which does not involve handling of infectious material becomes imperative in the case of pandemics such as the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV2. Methods: A protein microarray technology was used to detect the plurality of antibody response to four novel antigens namely S1 glycoprotein, Receptor binding domain (RBD), S2 glycoprotein and Nucleoprotein of the novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV2 using serum samples. A DBS card was additionally used to compare its performance with a venipuncture-based serum separator tube (SST) draw. Results: The three main subclasses of antibodies IgM, IgA and IgG were analyzed to see the variations in immune responses in the affected population and compared to their microbial RT-PCR based NP swab results. The clinical sensitivity and specificity were determined to be 98.1% and 98.6%. In the matrix comparison study, which would enable patients to test without risk of transmitting the virus, DBS matched with higher than 98% accuracy to a venipuncture-based SST collection. Conclusion: Multiplex testing enables higher sensitivity and specificity which is essential while establishing exposure on a population scale. This flexible platform along with a discrete collection methodology would be crucial and broadly useful to scale up testing in current and future pandemics. Minimum sample volume that can be collected using DBS cards can be processed in this multiplex pillar plate format enabling the capacity to provide the reliability of high throughput analyzers while having the ease of collection similar to rapid tests.

Our comparison is based on a computerized simulation integrating accumulated SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological knowledge. Our results stress the importance of immediate on-symptom isolation of suspected cases and household members, and the beneficial effects of prompt testing capacity. Our findings expose significant epidemic-suppression differences among strategies with seemingly similar economic cost stressing the importance of not just the portion of population and business that is released, but also the pattern. The most effective building blocks are the ones that integrate several base strategies - they allow to release large portions of the population while still achieving diminishing viral spread. However, it may come with a price on somewhat more complex schemes. For example, our simulations indicate that dividing the population into two groups completely released except for taking turns on a long weekend (Fri-Tue) self-isolation once every two weeks, while protecting the 5% most sensitive population would reduce R below 1 even if ten percent of the population does not follow it. We further simulate the contrasting approach of a stratified population release in a hope to achieve herd immunity, which for the time being seems inferior to other suggested building blocks. Knowing the tradeoff between building blocks could help optimize exit strategies to be more effective and suitable for a particular area or country, while maximizing human life as well as economic value. Given our results, we believe that pandemic can be controlled within a reasonable amount of time and at a reasonable socio-economic burden.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barkan, Elad; Shilo, Smadar; Talmor-Barkan, Yeela","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/191639f626c9a0e2c8e2cc680ebc23e81e2a354f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.23.20072850","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["portion of population","sensitive population","effective building blocks","suggested building blocks","stratified population release","exit strategies","various exit strategy building blocks","base strategies","time","pandemic","results","accumulated SARS-CoV","current SARS-CoV","importance of immediate","self-isolation","economic value","similar economic cost","reasonable socio-economic burden","symptom isolation of suspected cases","key measures","household members","significant epidemic-suppression differences","country","computerized simulation","hope","beneficial effects of prompt testing capacity","ones","human life","particular area","findings","contrasting approach","herd immunity","epidemiological knowledge","turns","diminishing viral spread","long weekend","large portions","price","complex schemes","comparison","weeks","simulations","groups","percent","business","tradeoff","example","improvements","pattern"],"language":"en"},

In this report we describe the Brazilian epidemic using three epidemiological measures: the number of infections, the number of deaths and the reproduction number. Our modelling framework requires sufficient death data to estimate trends, and we therefore limit our analysis to 16 states that have experienced a total of more than fifty deaths. The distribution of deaths among states is highly heterogeneous, with 5 states---Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Ceara, Pernambuco and Amazonas---accounting for 81% of deaths reported to date. In these states, we estimate that the percentage of people that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 3.3% (95% CI: 2.8%-3.7%) in Sao Paulo to 10.6% (95% CI: 8.8%-12.1%) in Amazonas. The reproduction number (a measure of transmission intensity) at the start of the epidemic meant that an infected individual would infect three or four others on average. Following non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school closures and decreases in population mobility, we show that the reproduction number has dropped substantially in each state. However, for all 16 states we study, we estimate with high confidence that the reproduction number remains above 1. A reproduction number above 1 means that the epidemic is not yet controlled and will continue to grow. These trends are in stark contrast to other major COVID-19 epidemics in Europe and Asia where enforced lockdowns have successfully driven the reproduction number below 1. While the Brazilian epidemic is still relatively nascent on a national scale, our results suggest that further action is needed to limit spread and prevent health system overload.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mellan, T.

We reported characteristics of patients with COVID-19 during epidemic ongoing outbreak in Wuhan. Methods Data of COVID-19 patients with clinical outcome in a designated hospital in Wuhan, were retrospectively collected from electronic medical records. Characteristics were compared between patients who died or recovered, and between patients with different disease severity. Results By Feb 25, 2020, 403 patients were enrolled, 100 died and 303 recovered. Most of non-survivors tended to be males, old aged, or with chronic diseases. Duration from illness onset to admission was 9 (7-12) days. Patients with severe or critical illness had more days from onset to admission compared to those with ordinary illness. Lymphopenia, anemia, hypoproteinemia, and abnormal serum sodium were presented in 52.6%, 54.6%, 69.8%, and 21.8% cases, respectively. Patients who died or with severe/critical illness showed increased white blood cell and neutrophil count, serum total bilirubin, creatinine, hypersensitive troponin I, D-dimer, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein, and decreased red blood cell, lymphocyte, platelet count, and serum albumin on admission compared to those who recovered or with ordinary illness. Complications of acute organ injury and secondary infection were common in patients with COVID-19, especially in non-survivors. Conclusions Multiple homeostasis disturbances were common in patients with severe or critical illness at admission. Early support should be provided, especially for old men with chronic disease, which is vital to control disease progression and reduce mortality of COVID-19 during epidemic ongoing outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luo, Xiaomin; Xia, Hongxia; Yang, Weize; Wang, Benchao; Guo, Tangxi; Xiong, Jun; Jiang, Zongping; Liu, Yu; Yan, Xiaojie; Zhou, Wei; Ye, Lu; Zhang, Bicheng","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/91b95074a7523331cbe8d85e1afea2422261875e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.19.20033175","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["characteristics of patients","critical illness","illness onset","admission","ordinary illness","Wuhan","mortality of COVID","serum albumin","Methods Data of COVID","disease progression","epidemic ongoing outbreak","days","non-survivors","red blood cell","serum total bilirubin","abnormal serum sodium","different disease severity","neutrophil count","platelet count","increased white blood cell","old men","chronic diseases","creatinine","secondary infection","hypersensitive troponin","lymphocyte","clinical outcome","Complications of acute organ injury","procalcitonin","D-dimer","C-reactive protein","hypoproteinemia","Conclusions Multiple homeostasis disturbances","designated hospital","anemia","males","deaths","Duration","electronic medical records","Lymphopenia","China","SARS-CoV","Early support","Background","Results","cases"],"language":"en"},

However, the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on global mental health were not thoroughly investigated yet, and studies that report the mental health risks of COVID-19 are still scarce. Objectives This study aimed to assess the level of psychological distress among university students in Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated national measures. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online self-administered questionnaire, The survey comprised of questions about (i) sociodemographic information, (ii) the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), (iii) coping activities , and (iv) the students most serious concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results A total of 381 completed questionnaires were included in the analysis. Female participants slightly predominated the sample (n=199, 52.2%). The respondents aged 18-38 years (mean 22.6 years, SD: 3.16). The total K10 distress scores had a mean of 34.2 (SD:9.4). However, the mean of total K10 distress scores had no significant association with gender (P=0.57). Age was negatively associated with total K10 distress scores (P=0.0013). Concerning severity, most of the respondents were regarded as having severe psychological distress (n=265, 69.5%), and females were found to have a statistically significant higher percentage in mild and severe psychological distress (P= 0.035), (P=0.016); respectively. 209 students (54.9%) reported that they had no motivation for distance learning. There was a statistically significant inverse relationship between severe psychological distress and motivation for distance learning (P\u003C0.0001). The most common coping strategy among students was Spending more time on social media (n=269, 70.6%). Besides, 49 students (12.9%) reported the use of medications to cope with COVID-10 related distress, and 209 students (54.9%) reported distance learning was their most serious concern. Conclusion The COVID-19 control measures resulted in a severe disruption of various human life activities, and this could impact the mental health of individuals, including students. A nationwide psychological support program should be incorporated into Jordan response strategy in combating the COVID-19, considering students and other vulnerable groups in Jordan.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether ocular surface cells possess the key factors required for cellular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 entry/infection. Methods We analyzed human post-mortem eyes as well as surgical specimens for the expression of ACE2 (the receptor for SARS-CoV-2) and TMPRSS2, a cell surface-associated protease that facilitates viral entry following binding of the viral spike protein to ACE2. Results Across all eye specimens, immunohistochemical analysis revealed expression of ACE2 in the conjunctiva, limbus, and cornea, with especially prominent staining in the superficial conjunctival and corneal epithelial surface. Surgical conjunctival specimens also showed expression of ACE2 in the conjunctival epithelium, especially prominent in the superficial epithelium, as well as the substantia propria. All eye and conjunctival specimens also expressed TMPRSS2. Finally, western blot analysis of protein lysates from human corneal epithelium obtained during refractive surgery confirmed expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Conclusions Together, these results indicate that ocular surface cells including conjunctiva are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2, and could therefore serve as a portal of entry as well as a reservoir for person-to-person transmission of this virus. This highlights the importance of safety practices including face masks and ocular contact precautions in preventing the spread of COVID-19 disease.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Lingli; Xu, Zhenhua; Castiglione, Gianni M.; Soiberman, Uri S.; Eberhart, Charles G.; Duh, Elia J.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.09.086165","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of ACE2","conjunctival epithelium","SARS-CoV","Surgical conjunctival specimens","eye specimens","ocular surface cells","viral entry","surgical specimens","TMPRSS2","portal of entry","Purpose Conjunctival signs","superficial epithelium","human corneal epithelium","corneal epithelial surface","Results","infection","virus","cell surface-associated protease","ocular contact precautions","viral spike protein","immunohistochemical analysis","prominent staining","spread of COVID","person transmission","western blot analysis of protein lysates","human post-mortem eyes","face masks","key factors","refractive surgery","binding","importance of safety practices","cellular susceptibility","symptoms","receptor","Methods","limbus","carrier","reservoir","study","subset of patients","disease","tears","concerns","substantia propria","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

As with any public health emergency, a major component of the global response is timely, effective science. However, particular factors specific to COVID-19 must be overcome to ensure that research efforts are optimised. We aimed to model the impact of COVID-19 on the clinical academic response in the UK, and to provide recommendations for COVID-related research. Methods: We constructed a simple stochastic model to determine clinical academic capacity in the UK in four policy approaches to COVID-19 with differing population infection rates: Italy model (6%), mitigation (10%), relaxed mitigation (40%) and do-nothing (80%) scenarios. The ability to conduct research in the COVID-19 climate is affected by the following key factors: (i) infection growth rate and population infection rate (from UK COVID-19 statistics and WHO); (ii) strain on the healthcare system (from published model); and (iii) availability of clinical academic staff with appropriate skillsets affected by frontline clinical activity and sickness (from UK statistics). Findings: In Italy model, mitigation, relaxed mitigation and do-nothing scenarios, from 5 March 2020 the duration (days) and peak infection rates (%) are 95(2.4%), 115(2.5%), 240(5.3%) and 240(16.7%) respectively. Near complete attrition of academia (87% reduction, less than 400 clinical academics) occurs 35 days after pandemic start for 11, 34, 62, 76 days respectively, with no clinical academics at all for 37 days in the do-nothing scenario. Restoration of normal academic workforce (80% of normal capacity) takes 11,12, 30 and 26 weeks respectively. Interpretation: Pandemic COVID-19 crushes the science needed at system level. National policies mitigate, but the academic community needs to adapt. We highlight six key strategies: radical prioritisation (eg 3-4 research ideas per institution), deep resourcing, non-standard leadership (repurposing of key non-frontline teams), rationalisation (profoundly simple approaches), careful site selection (eg protected sites with large academic backup) and complete suspension of academic competition with collaborative approaches.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Banerjee, A.; Katsoulis, M.; Lai, A.

A study in Italy reported that EMS-documented out-of-hospital cardiac arrest rose by 58% during the peak-epidemic. EMS and hospital reports from several countries have suggested that silent hypoxemia-low oxygen saturation (SpO2) in the absence of dyspnea-is associated with COVID-19 outbreaks. It is unclear, however, how these phenomena can be generalized to low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs). Tijuana is a city on the Mexico-United States border that may serve as a bellwether for cities in other LMICs. Using EMS data, we assess changes in out-of-hospital mortality and the SpO2 of respiratory patients during the COVID-19 period. Methods: We calculated numbers of weekly out-of-hospital deaths and respiratory cases seen by EMS in Tijuana, and estimate the difference between peak-epidemic rates and forecasted 2014-2019 trends. Results were compared with official COVID-19 statistics, stratified by neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES), and examined for changing demographic or clinical features, including mean (SpO2). Results: An estimated 194.7 (95%CI: 135.5-253.9) excess out-of-hospital deaths events occurred during April 14th-May 11th, representing an increase of 145% (70%-338%) compared to forecasted trends. During the same window, only 8 COVID-19-positive, out-of-hospital deaths were reported in official statistics. This corresponded with a rise in respiratory cases of 274% (119%-1142%), and a drop in mean SpO2 to 77.7%, from 90.2% at baseline. Peak respiratory cases were concentrated in high-SES neighborhoods, while the highest out-of-hospital death rates were observed in low-SES areas. Conclusions: EMS systems may play an important sentinel role in monitoring excess out-of-hospital mortality and other trends during the COVID-19 crisis in LMICs. Using EMS data, we observed increases in out-of-hospital deaths in Tijuana that were nearly threefold greater magnitude than increases reported in Italy. Furthermore, these deaths may be missing from official records describing COVID-19 patients. We also found evidence of worsening hypoxemia among respiratory patients seen by EMS, suggesting a rise in silent hypoxemia, which should be met with increased detection and clinical management efforts. Finally, we observed that social disparities in out-of-hospital death that warrant monitoring and amelioration.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Friedman, J.; Calderon-Villarreal, A.; Bojorquez, I.; Vera Hernandez, C.; Schriger, D.; Tovar Hirashima, E.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27664cba3452889824d40fcb0a68b5153139386f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.13.20098186v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EMS"],"locations":["Tijuana","Mexico-United States"],"keyphrases":["hospital mortality","hospital reports","EMS data","hospital deaths events","official COVID","hospital death rates","EMS systems","SpO2 of respiratory patients","hospital cardiac arrest","Peak respiratory cases","evolving health of COVID","mean SpO2","Tijuana","LMICs","official statistics","forecasted trends","low-SES areas","peak-epidemic rates","silent hypoxemia-low oxygen saturation","monitoring excess","official records","rise","Italy","Results","evidence of worsening hypoxemia","high-SES neighborhoods","clinical features","key source of rapid data","clinical management efforts","middle-income countries","important sentinel role","Mexico-United States border","increased detection","city","changing demographic","neighborhood socioeconomic status","Objective","Emergency medical services","threefold greater magnitude","difference","affected populations","bellwether","numbers of weekly","absence of dyspnea","amelioration","crisis","changes","Methods","cities","phenomena","Conclusions","drop","study","period","social disparities","outbreaks","window","baseline"],"language":"en"},

Many countries have implemented social distancing as a measure to control further spread. Methods: We evaluate whether and under which conditions containment or slowing down COVID-19 epidemics are possible by isolation and contact tracing in settings with various levels of social distancing. We use a stochastic transmission model in which every person generates novel infections according to a probability distribution that is affected by the incubation period distribution (time from infection to symptoms), distribution of the latent period (time from infection to onset of infectiousness), and overall transmissibility. The model distinguishes between close contacts (e.g., within a household) and other contacts in the population. Social distancing affects the number of contacts outside but not within the household. Findings: The proportion of asymptomatic or unascertained cases has a strong impact on the controllability of the disease. If the proportion of asymptomatic infections is larger than 30%, contact tracing and isolation cannot achieve containment for an R0 of 2.5. Achieving containment by social distancing requires a reduction of numbers of non-household contacts by around 90%. Depending on the realized level of contact reduction, tracing and isolation of only household contacts, or of household and non-household contacts are necessary to reduce the effective reproduction number to below 1. A combination of social distancing with isolation and contact tracing leads to synergistic effects that increase the prospect of containment. Interpretation: Isolation and contact tracing can be an effective means to slow down epidemics, but only if the majority of cases are ascertained. In a situation with social distancing, contact tracing can act synergistically and tip the scale towards containment, and can therefore be a tool for controlling COVID-19 epidemics as part of an exit strategy from current lockdown measures.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kretzschmar, Mirjam E; Rozhnova, Ganna; van Boven, Michiel E","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a46fa6628a6491cfe5c927b6e21bfbb9eed393c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.10.20033738","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["contact tracing","isolation","non-household contacts","combination of social distancing","number of contacts","various levels of social distancing","close contacts","epidemics","prospect of containment","conditions containment","realized level of contact reduction","time","incubation period distribution","rates of transmission","probability distribution","novel infections","proportion of asymptomatic infections","range of transmission","stochastic transmission model","COVID","effective reproduction number","reduction of numbers","latent period","Novel coronavirus","effective means","unascertained cases","majority of cases","severity of associated disease","settings","exit strategy","world","substantial variation","strong impact","onset of infectiousness","person","symptoms","synergistic effects","current lockdown measures","parts","SARS-CoV","Background","controllability","Interpretation","situation","overall transmissibility","Findings","tool","R0","countries","spread","scale","population","Methods"],"language":"en"},

The design (referred to as Pneumask) consists of a custom snorkel-specific adapter that couples the snorkel-port of the mask to a rated filter (either a medical-grade ventilator inline filter or an industrial filter). This design has been tested for the sealing capability of the mask, filter performance, CO2 buildup and clinical usability. These tests found the Pneumask capable of forming a seal that exceeds the standards required for half-face respirators or N95 respirators. Filter testing indicates a range of options with varying performance depending on the quality of filter selected, but with typical filter performance exceeding or comparable to the N95 standard. CO2 buildup was found to be roughly equivalent to levels found in half-face elastomeric respirators in literature. Clinical usability tests indicate sufficient visibility and, while speaking is somewhat muffled, this can be addressed via amplification (Bluetooth voice relay to cell phone speakers through an app) in noisy environments. We present guidance on the assembly, usage (donning and doffing) and decontamination protocols. The benefit of the Pneumask as PPE is that it is reusable for longer periods than typical disposable N95 respirators, as the snorkel mask can withstand rigorous decontamination protocols (that are standard to regular elastomeric respirators).

The SARS-CoV-2 genome is different from that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, although also expected to spread differently according to meteorological conditions. Our main goal is to investigate the role of some meteorological variables on the expansion of this outbreak. In this study, an exponential model relating the number of accumulated confirmed cases and time was considered. The rate of COVID-19 spread, using as criterion the doubling time of the number of confirmed cases, was used as dependent variable in a linear model that took four independent meteorological variables: temperature, humidity, precipitation and wind speed. Only China cases were considered, to control both cultural aspects and containment policies. Confirmed cases and the 4 meteorological variables were gathered between January 23 and March 1 (39 days) for the 31 provinces of Mainland China. Several periods of time were sampled for each province, obtaining more than one value for the rate of disease progression. Two different periods of time were tested, of 12 and 15 days, along with 3 and 5 different starting points in time, randomly chosen. The median value for each meteorological variable was computed, using the same time period; models with adjusted R square above 0.75 were selected. The rate of progression and doubling time were computed and used to fit a linear regression model. Models were evaluated using alpha=0.05. Results indicate that the doubling time correlates positively with temperature and inversely with humidity, suggesting that a decrease in the rate of progression of COVID-19 with the arrival of spring and summer in the north hemisphere. A 20oC increase is expected to delay the doubling time in 1.8 days. Those variables explain 18% of the variation in disease doubling time; the remaining 82% may be related to containment measures, general health policies, population density, transportation or cultural aspects.","publish_time":"2020-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oliveiros, Barbara; Caramelo, Liliana; Ferreira, Nuno C; Caramelo, Francisco","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b4edd81e0d2770b0d6e0e3c93c7fffc43e3caa80.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031872","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["time period","doubling time correlates","different periods of time","rate of progression","rate of COVID","independent meteorological variables","number of confirmed cases","meteorological conditions","rate of disease progression","China cases","days","number of accumulated confirmed cases","linear model","SARS-CoV","temperature","humidity","containment policies","exponential model","MERS-CoV","linear regression model","cultural aspects","models","spread","general health policies","different starting points","public health","containment measures","dependent variable","median value","provinces of Mainland China","population density","mortality","transportation","precipitation","adjusted R square","great impact","summer","economy","role","genome","criterion","arrival of spring","wind speed","north hemisphere","spite","expansion","decrease","Results","variation","efforts","main goal","study","outbreak","oC increase","epidemy","alpha"],"language":"en"},

Participants:From 4 February to 14 April 2020, 106 patients with neurological diseases were enrolled from all patients in the hospital with confirmed COVID-19 and divided into a severe group and a nonsevere group according to their COVID-19 diagnosis. Main outcome measures:Clinical characteristics, laboratory results, imaging findings, and treatment methods were all retrieved through an electronic medical records system and recorded in spreadsheets. Results:The mean (standard deviation, SD) age of patients was 72.7 (11.8) years, and 64 patients were male (60.4%). Among patients with co-morbid neurological diseases, 81 had a previous cerebral infarction (76.4%), 20 had dementia (18.9%), 10 had acute cerebral infarction (9.4%), 5 had sequelae of cerebral haemorrhage (4.7%), 4 had intracranial mass lesions (3.8%), 3 had epilepsy (2.8%), 2 had Parkinsons disease (1.9%), and 1 had myelopathy (0.9%). Fever (n = 62, 58.5%) was the most common symptom. The most common neurological symptoms were myalgia (n = 26, 24.5%), followed by extremity paralysis (n = 20, 18.9%), impaired consciousness (n = 17, 16%), and positive focal neurological signs (n = 42, 39.6%). Eight patients (7.5%) died. There were more patients with altered mental status in the severe group than in the non-severe group (6 [10.2%] vs. 0, P = 0.033). The inflammatory response in the severe group was more significant than that in the non-severe group. There were more patients taking anticoagulant drugs (25 [42.4%] vs. 4 [8.5%], P \u003C 0.001) and sedative drugs (22 [37.3%] vs. 9 [19.1%], P = 0.041) in the severe group than in the non-severe group.

Since a majority of the SARS-CoV-2 deaths are due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a strategy to mitigate the same could save countless lives. Since SARS-CoV-2 related ARDS has a strong immunological component, many investigators are utilizing monoclonal antibodies against IL-6, TNF-alpha and CCR5. However, targeting a single cytokine with an expensive monoclonal antibody could be a less pragmatic approach. We propose the use of cyclophosphamide as an immunomodulator, given its proven role in various settings including autoimmune diseases, and in the post-haploidentical stem cell transplant. Cyclophosphamide could deplete cytotoxic and effector T cell populations while relatively sparing the regulatory T cells (Tregs). Cyclophosphamide could tip the balance away from the overtly pro-inflammatory and could be a less expensive and effective alternative to the currently investigated monoclonal antibodies.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Revannasiddaiah, Swaroop; Kumar Devadas, Santhosh; Palassery, Rasmi; Kumar Pant, Nirdosh; V Maka, Vinayak","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c57815c2449b43e12ac984283681d7313aefb096.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S030698772031063X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030698772031063X?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","monoclonal antibodies","expensive monoclonal antibody","use of cyclophosphamide","related ARDS","effector T cell populations","effective alternative","regulatory T cells","post-haploidentical stem cell transplant","autoimmune diseases","investigators","proven role","strong immunological component","various settings","acute respiratory distress syndrome","IL","deaths","affordable therapeutic strategies","immunomodulator","single cytokine","vaccine","TNF-alpha","humanity struggles","Tregs","balance","pragmatic approach","CCR5","strategy","majority","countless lives"],"language":"en"},

Advances in Bayesian inference methods for individual-level geo-located epidemiological data have enabled reconstruction of transmission trees and quantification of disease spread in space and time, while accounting for uncertainty in missing data. However, these methods have rarely been applied to endemic diseases or ones in which asymptomatic infection plays a role, for which novel estimation methods are required. Here, we develop such methods to analyse longitudinal incidence data on visceral leishmaniasis (VL), and its sequela, post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), in a highly endemic community in Bangladesh. Incorporating recent data on infectiousness of VL and PKDL, we show that while VL cases drive transmission when incidence is high, the contribution of PKDL increases significantly as VL incidence declines (reaching 55% in this setting). Transmission is highly focal: \u003E85% of mean distances from inferred infectors to their secondary VL cases were \u003C300m, and estimated average times from infector onset to secondary case infection were \u003C4 months for 90% of VL infectors, but up to 2.75yrs for PKDL infectors. Estimated numbers of secondary VL cases per VL and PKDL case varied from 0-6 and were strongly correlated with the infector\u0027s duration of symptoms. Counterfactual simulations suggest that prevention of PKDL could have reduced VL incidence by up to a quarter. These results highlight the need for prompt detection and treatment of PKDL to achieve VL elimination in the Indian subcontinent and provide quantitative estimates to guide spatiotemporally-targeted interventions against VL.","publish_time":"2020-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chapman, Lloyd A.

In particular, when contact tracing is effective, but the system is close to being overwhelmed, moderate travel restrictions can have very large effects on the probability of an epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Malmberg, Hannes; Britton, Tom","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050401","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["contact tracing","inflow restrictions","moderate travel restrictions","epidemic","inflow of infected cases","inflowing cases","epidemiological models","large effects","simple epidemiological model","large number of papers","quarantines","transmissions","containment efforts","community interventions","assumption of unlimited capacity","simulations","mathematical analysis","broad strategies","COVID","probability","system","outbreak","region","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

The emergence, detection, spread, treatment and containment of infectious diseases shows the considerable political and economic impacts in a highly interconnected world. We aimed to estimate the effects of socioeconomic levels on the spread and treatment of COVID-19 in China. Methods: We obtained daily COVID-19 cases at a city level in China. We used migration data from the major cities in Hubei Province, and macroeconomic data at city and province levels. We obtained social management measures in response to COVID-19 outbreak. We assessed the association between measures, migration and COVID-19 spread, and the association between socioeconomic levels and COVID-19 treatment capacity. Findings: On January 1, 2020, COVID-19 spread that affected by management measures and migration started across China. After Wuhan lockdown, the case number reached peak in 12 days, and COVID-19 outbreak was basically contained in China in four weeks due to intensive measures. Guangdong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces showed the most excellent COVID-19 treatment capacities. Socioeconomic levels in these provinces ranked top in China. Guangdong achieved the largest decline in severe case rate by 22.1%. Jiangsu had the lowest average rate of severe cases (1.7%) and zero death. Among the regions with top case number, Zhejiang showed the highest rate of cured cases on confirmed cases (96.3%), the lowest average rate of severe cases (7.7%), and one death. The COVID-19 treatment capacities were strongly affected by regional economics and measures on control, detection and treatment. Interpretation: Socioeconomic levels had strong effect on the spread and treatment of COVID-19 in China. Further investigations are needed on the effectiveness of Chinese measures and the effects of socioeconomic levels on COVID-19 treatment outside China.

Therefore, molecular entities able to interfere with binding of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to ACE2 have a great potential to inhibit viral entry. Starting from the available structural data on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and the host ACE2 receptor, we here engineered a mini-protein with the aim of creating a soluble and stable Spike interactor. This mini-protein, which was recombinantly produced in high yields, possesses a stable \u03B1 helical conformation and is able to interact with the RBD of glycosylated Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 with nanomolar affinity, as measured by microscale thermophoresis. By plugging the Spike protein, our mini-protein constitutes a valid tool for the development of treatments against different types of coronavirus.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Romano, Maria; Ruggiero, Alessia; Squeglia, Flavia; Berisio, Rita","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/856c001e04bdb4eaaae851843a85930818fdfddf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.29.067728","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Receptor Binding Domain"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mini-protein","RBD of glycosylated Spike protein","stable Spike interactor","novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV","surface Spike glycoprotein","host ACE2 receptor","interaction","Receptor Binding Domain","host cells","novel virus","molecular entities able","stable \u03B1 helical conformation","development of treatments","great potential","etiological agent","valid tool","current pandemic COVID","human angiotensin","nanomolar affinity","aim","different types of coronavirus","available structural data","high yields","viral entry","enzyme","microscale thermophoresis","coronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

The clinical spectrum of COVID\u221219 disease is varied, and identifying factors associated with severe disease has been described as an urgent research priority. It has been noted that elderly patients with pre-existing comorbidities are more vulnerable to more severe disease. However, the specific symptoms and comorbidities that most strongly predict disease severity are unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the symptoms and comorbidities predictive of COVID\u221219 severity. Method This study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO. A literature search was performed in three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health) for studies indexed up to 5th March 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the literature and both also completed data extraction. Quality appraisal of studies was performed using the STROBE checklist. Random effects meta-analysis was performed for selected symptoms and comorbidities to identify those most associated with severe COVID\u221219 infection or ICU admission. Results Of the 2259 studies identified, 42 were selected after title and abstract analysis, and 7 studies (including 1813 COVID\u221219 patients) were chosen for inclusion. The ICU group were older (62.4 years) compared to the non-ICU group (46 years), with a significantly higher proportion of males (67.2% vs. 57.1%, p=0.04). Dyspnoea was the only significant symptom predictive for both severe disease (pOR 3.70, 95% CI 1.83 \u2212 7.46) and ICU admission (pOR 6.55, 95% CI 4.28 \u2212 10.0). Notwithstanding the low prevalence of COPD in severe disease and ICU-admitted groups (4.5% and 9.7%, respectively), COPD was the most strongly predictive comorbidity for both severe disease (pOR 6.42, 95% CI 2.44 \u2212 16.9) and ICU admission (pOR 17.8, 95% CI 6.56 \u2212 48.2). Cardiovascular disease and hypertension were also strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission. Those with CVD and hypertension were 4.4 (95% CI 2.64 \u2212 7.47) and 3.7 (95% CI 2.22 \u2212 5.99) times more likely to have an ICU admission respectively, compared to patients without the comorbidity. Conclusions Dyspnoea was the only symptom strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission, and could be useful in guiding clinical management decisions early in the course of illness. When looking at ICU-admitted patients, who represent the more severe end of the spectrum of clinical severity, COPD patients are particularly vulnerable, and those with cardiovascular disease and hypertension are also at a high-risk of severe illness. To aid clinical assessment, risk stratification, efficient resource allocation, and targeted public health interventions, future research must aim to further define those at high-risk of severe illness with COVID\u221219.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jain, Vageesh; Yuan, Jin-Min","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f6e2209c1b4bf5fd439880ae9e65cbab5d407f3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.15.20035360","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Global Health","ICU","CVD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe disease","severe COVID","ICU admission","disease severity","Cardiovascular disease","severe end","high-risk of severe illness","comorbidities predictive of COVID","non-ICU group","clinical spectrum of COVID","COPD patients","predictive comorbidity","introduction COVID","spectrum of clinical severity","elderly patients","hypertension","significant symptom predictive","clinical assessment","pre-existing comorbidities","selected symptoms","Global Health","years","clinical management decisions","abstract analysis","specific symptoms","course of illness","Quality appraisal of studies","targeted public health interventions","Random effects meta-analysis","low prevalence of COPD","public health emergency of international concern","future research","Conclusions Dyspnoea","literature search","urgent research priority","efficient resource allocation","risk stratification","databases","EMBASE","infection","novel coronavirus outbreak","MEDLINE","China","systematic review","times","groups","factors","higher proportion of males","study","data extraction","title","STROBE checklist","Background","Method","PROSPERO","reviewers","CVD","Results","inclusion"],"language":"en"},

No studies have yet summarised the potential severity and mortality risks caused by COVID-19 in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and we update information in smokers. Methods: We systematically searched electronic databases from inception to March 24, 2020. Data were extracted by two independent authors in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. We synthesised a narrative from eligible studies and conducted a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to calculate pooled prevalence rates and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results: In total, 123 abstracts were screened and 61 full-text manuscripts were reviewed. A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria, which included a total of 2473 confirmed COVID-19 patients. All studies were included in the meta-analysis. The crude case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 6.4%. The pooled prevalence rates of COPD patients and smokers in COVID-19 cases were 2% (95% CI, 1%-3%) and 9% (95% CI, 4%-14%) respectively. COPD patients were at a higher risk of more severe disease (risk of severity = 63%, (22/35) compared to patients without COPD 33.4% (409/1224) [calculated RR, 1.88 (95% CI, 1.4-2.4)]. This was associated with higher mortality (60%). Our results showed that 22% (31/139) of current smokers and 46% (13/28) of ex-smokers had severe complications. The calculated RR showed that current smokers were 1.45 times more likely [95% CI: 1.03-2.04] to have severe complications compared to former and never smokers. Current smokers also had a higher mortality rate of 38.5%. Conclusion: Although COPD prevalence in COVID-19 cases was low in current reports, COVID-19 infection was associated with substantial severity and mortality rates in COPD. Compared to former and never smokers, current smokers were at greater risk of severe complications and higher mortality rate. Effective preventive measures are required to reduce COVID-19 risk in COPD patients and current smokers.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alqahtani, J. S.; Oyelade, T.; Aldhahir, A.

Improving COVID-19 surveillance in long-term care","doi":"10.1101/2020.04.19.20071639","pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":null,"license":"medrxiv","abstract":"Background: Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are particularly vulnerable to nosocomial outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with high rates of transmission and mortality. Timely epidemiological surveillance is essential to detect and respond to outbreaks, but testing resources are highly limited in the current pandemic context. Methods: We used an individual-based transmission model to simulate COVID-19 spread along inter-individual contact networks in the LTCF setting. A range of surveillance strategies were evaluated for their ability to detect simulated outbreaks, assuming limited availability of standard RT-PCR tests. Various epidemiological scenarios were considered, including COVID-19 importation from patient transfers or staff members infected in the community. Findings: We estimated a median delay of 7 (95% uncertainty interval: 2-15) days from importation of an asymptomatic COVID-19-infected patient to first presentation of COVID-19 symptoms among any patients or staff, at which point an additional 7 (0-25) individuals were infected but did not (yet) show symptoms. Across a range of scenarios, the reference surveillance strategy (testing individuals with COVID-like symptoms with signs of severity) took a median 11-21 days to detect an outbreak. Group testing (pooling specimens from multiple individuals for a single RT-PCR test) patients and staff with any COVID-like symptoms was both the most timely and efficient strategy, detecting outbreaks up to twice as quickly as the reference, and more quickly than other considered strategies while using fewer tests. Maximizing use of available tests via testing cascades was more effective than group testing only when substantial testing resources were available (on the order of 1 test/20 beds/day). Including not merely those with symptoms but also newly admitted patients in group tests and testing cascades reduced delays in outbreak detection for LTCFs actively admitting patients potentially already infected with COVID-19. Interpretation: Improving COVID-19 surveillance can alert healthcare institutions to emerging outbreaks before they escalate, informing a need for urgent public health intervention in settings with ongoing nosocomial transmission.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, David RM; Duval, Audrey; Pouwels, Koen B; Guillemot, Didier; Fernandes, Jerome; Huynh, Bich-Tram; Temime, Laura; Opatowski, Lulla","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/688cb01929e3fda511d7a94af0741520a6644ec1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.19.20071639v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LTCF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Group testing","asymptomatic COVID","testing individuals","presentation of COVID","symptoms","testing cascades","group tests","substantial testing resources","simulated outbreaks","infected patient","reference surveillance strategy","Timely epidemiological surveillance","range of surveillance strategies","admitted patients","fewer tests","use of available tests","nosocomial outbreaks of coronavirus disease","limited availability of standard RT-PCR tests","multiple individuals","LTCFs","ongoing nosocomial transmission","staff members","importation","days","range of scenarios","considered strategies","single RT-PCR test","individual-based transmission model","high rates of transmission","Various epidemiological scenarios","patient transfers","outbreak detection","efficient strategy","median delay","inter-individual contact networks","settings","delays","urgent public health intervention","spread","pooling specimens","LTCF setting","Long-term care facilities","need","Background","order","signs of severity","current pandemic context","healthcare institutions","beds","mortality","uncertainty interval","Findings","community","Interpretation","Methods"],"language":"en"},

As pressure mounts to scale back these measures, understanding public compliance with and priorities for COVID-19 mitigation is critical. The main aim of this study was to assess public compliance with and support for government-imposed stay-at-home orders in nations and cities with different COVID-19 infection and death rates. Design: In this cross-sectional study, questionnaires were administered to nationally representative respondents from April 2-8, 2020. Setting: Regions with different disease prevalence included two nations [the United States (US, high) and Australia (AU, low)] and two cities [New York (NY, high) and Los Angeles (LA, low)]. Participants: For adults 18 years or older residing in specified regions, eligible respondents were empaneled until representative quotas were reached for age, gender, and either race and ethnicity (US, NY, LA) or ancestry (AU), matching the 2010 US or 2016 AU census. Of 8718 eligible potential respondents, 5573 (response rate, 63.9%) completed surveys (US: 3010; NY: 507; LA: 525; AU: 1531). The median age was 47 years (range, 18-89); 3039 (54.5%) were female. Exposure: The prevalence of COVID-19 in each region (cumulative infections, deaths) as of April 8, 2020: US (458610, 15659), AU (5956, 45), NY (81803, 4571), LA (7530, 198). Main Outcomes Measures: Public compliance with and attitudes regarding government-imposed stay-at-home orders were evaluated and compared between regions. Results: Of 5573 total respondents, 4560 (81.8%) reported compliance with recommended quarantine or stay-at-home policies (range of samples, 75.5%-88.2%). Despite significant disruptions of social and work life, health, and behavior, 5022 respondents (90.1%) supported government-imposed stay-at-home orders (range of samples, 88.9%-93.1%). Of these, 90.8% believe orders should last at least three more weeks or until public health or government officials recommend, with such support spanning the political spectrum. Conclusions: Public compliance with stringent quarantine and stay-at-home policies was very high, in both highly-affected (US, NY) and minimally-affected regions (AU, LA). Despite extensive disruption of respondents\u2032 lives, the vast majority supported continuation of long-term government-imposed stay-at-home orders. These findings have important implications for policymakers grappling with the decision as to when to lift restrictions.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Czeisler, Mark \u00C9; Howard, Mark E; Robbins, Rebecca; Barger, Laura K; Facer-Childs, Elise R; Rajaratnam, Shantha MW; Czeisler, Charles A","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f8d6764d0c62fc687efcf61d8103a7ee1960edd8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.22.20076141v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","Australia"],"keyphrases":["stay-at-home orders","public compliance","NY","stay-at-home policies","eligible respondents","representative respondents","public health","total respondents","AU census","government officials","different COVID","prevalence of COVID","eligible potential respondents","extensive disruption of respondents","specified regions","range of samples","nations","cities","different disease prevalence","years","unprecedented measures","recommended quarantine","Main Outcomes Measures","vast majority supported continuation of long-term government","stringent quarantine","coronavirus disease","representative quotas","cross-sectional study","median age","main aim","lives","older residing","work life","attitudes","race","ethnicity","Los Angeles","significant disruptions of social","United States","policymakers","adults","gender","response rate","behavior","questionnaires","New York","Setting","Conclusions","priorities","Australia","weeks","important implications","death rates","decision","cumulative infections","deaths","findings","Governments","mitigation","surveys","ancestry","Objectives","Design","political spectrum","Participants","pressure mounts","Results","Exposure","restrictions","pandemic","female"],"language":"en"},

However, these parameters have not been observed consistently across studies. The aim of this review was to assess clinical laboratory parameters which may serve as markers or predictors of severe or critical COVID-19 disease Methods: We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL and Google Scholar databases from 2019 through April 18, 2020, and reviewed bibliographies of eligible studies, relevant systematic reviews, and the medRxiv pre-print server. We included hospital-based observational studies reporting clinical laboratory parameters of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and excluded studies having large proportions (\u003E10%) of children and pregnant women. Two authors independently carried out screening of articles, data extraction and quality assessment. Meta-analyses were done using random effects model. Meta-median difference (MMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each laboratory parameter. Results: Forty-five studies in 6 countries were included. Compared to non-severe COVID-19 cases, severe or critical COVID-19 disease was characterised by higher neutrophil count (MMD: 1.23 [95% CI: 0.58 to 1.88] x109 cells/L), and lower lymphocyte and CD4 counts with MMD (95% CI) of -0.39 (-0.47, -0.31) x109 cells/L and -204.9 (-302.6, -107.1) cells/l, respectively. Other notable results were observed for C-reactive protein (MMD: 36.97 [95% CI: 27.58, 46.35] mg/L), interleukin-6 (MMD: 17.37 [95% CI: 4.74, 30.00] pg/ml,), Troponin I (MMD: 0.01 [0.00, 0.02] ng/ml), and D-dimer (MMD: 0.65 [0.45, 0.85] mg/ml). Conclusions and Relevance: Relative to non-severe COVID-19, severe or critical COVID-19 is characterised by increased markers of innate immune response, decreased markers of adaptive immune response, and increased markers of tissue damage and major organ failure. These markers could be used to recognise severe or critical disease and to monitor clinical course of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moutchia, J.; Pokharel, P.; Kerri, A.; McGaw, K.; Uchai, S.; Nji, M.; Goodman, M.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ba1fd8993d1b505ada4e2184cfab956f4768abc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.24.20078782v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MMD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MMD","critical COVID","non-severe COVID","clinical course of COVID","clinical laboratory parameters of confirmed cases of COVID","critical disease","predictors of severe","excluded studies","observational studies","increased markers of innate immune response","x109 cells","increased markers of tissue damage","decreased markers of adaptive immune response","disease Methods","reviewed bibliographies of eligible studies","Meta-analyses","notable results","relevant systematic reviews","systematic search of MEDLINE","Meta-median difference","Web of Science","CINAHL","Embase","screening of articles","data extraction","major organ failure","Relevance","Google Scholar databases","quality assessment","medRxiv pre-print server","C-reactive protein","higher neutrophil count","date","random effects model","lower lymphocyte","Conclusions","large proportions","CD4","hospital","confidence interval","D-dimer","children","pregnant women","authors","Background","pg","Troponin","countries","severity","aim","interleukin"],"language":"en"},

Unfortunately, a lack of systematic testing across the United States (US) due to equipment shortages and varying testing strategies has hindered the usefulness of the available positive COVID-19 case counts. We introduce three complementary approaches aimed at estimating the prevalence of COVID-19 in each state in the US as well as in New York City. Instead of relying on an estimate from a single data source or method that may be biased, we provide multiple estimates, each relying on different assumptions and data sources. Across our three approaches, there is a consistent conclusion that state-level COVID-19 case counts usually vary from 10 to 100 times greater than the official positive test counts. Nationally, our lowest and highest estimates of COVID-19 cases in the US from March 1, 2020 to April 4, 2020 are 2.7 and 8.3 million (9 to 27 times greater). These estimates are to be compared to the cumulative confirmed cases of about 311,000 as of April 4th. Our approaches demonstrate the value of leveraging existing influenza-like-illness surveillance systems for measuring the burden of new diseases that share symptoms with influenza-like-illnesses. Our methods may prove useful in assessing the burden of COVID-19 in other countries with comparable influenza surveillance systems.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Fred S; Nguyen, Andre T; Link, Nick; Santillana, Mauricio","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9fc5c988c4728a51b440d1cfad9dcfe128665419.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.18.20070821v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["ongoing COVID","week burden of COVID","prevalence of COVID","highest estimates of COVID","available positive COVID","state-level COVID","case counts","existing influenza","comparable influenza surveillance systems","burden of new diseases","times greater","multiple estimates","complementary approaches","official positive test counts","illness surveillance systems","data sources","varying testing strategies","lack of systematic testing","single data source","New York City","cumulative confirmed cases","usefulness","accurate estimation","equipment shortages","United States","pandemic","symptoms","consistent conclusion","countries","different assumptions","public health responses","value","illnesses","methods"],"language":"en"},

We identified panels of fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from eight large phage-displayed Fab, scFv and VH libraries by panning against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein. One high affinity mAb, IgG1 ab1, specifically neutralized live SARS-CoV-2 with exceptional potency as measured by two different assays. It competed with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for binding to RBD suggesting a competitive mechanism of virus neutralization. IgG1 ab1 protected transgenic mice expressing hACE2 from high-titer intranasal SARS-CoV-2 challenge (105 plaque forming units). Another antibody, VH ab5 did not compete with hACE2 and ab1, and did not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 although its affinity was comparable to that of ab1. The ab1 sequence has relatively low number of somatic mutations indicating that ab1-like antibodies could be quickly elicited during natural SARS-CoV-2 infection or by RBD-based vaccines. IgG1 ab1 does not have developability liabilities, and thus has potential for therapy and prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The rapid identification (within 6 days) of potent mAbs shows the value of large antibody libraries for response to public health threats from emerging microbes.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Wei; Drelich, Aleksandra; Martinez, David R.; Gralinski, Lisa; Chen, Chuan; Sun, Zehua; Liu, Xianglei; Zhelev, Doncho; Zhang, Liyong; Peterson, Eric C.; Conard, Alex; Mellors, John W.; Tseng, Chien-Te; Baric, Ralph S.; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a036567a03d34c9633f3509906f0a3d84853a77c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.13.093088","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["natural SARS-CoV","live SARS-CoV","IgG1 ab1","prophylaxis of SARS","ab1 sequence","high-titer intranasal SARS-CoV","hACE2","VH libraries","value of large antibody libraries","high affinity mAb","RBD-based vaccines","human monoclonal antibodies","large phage","potent mAbs","VH ab5","human angiotensin","receptor binding domain","response","public health threats","transgenic mice","low number of somatic mutations","potential","scFv","challenge","emerging microbes","competitive mechanism of virus neutralization","days","enzyme","exceptional potency","developability liabilities","spike","therapy","panels","plaque","different assays","COVID19 pandemic","rapid identification","glycoprotein","units","infections","Effective therapies"],"language":"en"},

Summary In Normandy (France), human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) was detected in 64.1% of acute bronchiolitis in hospitalized children, rhinovirus in 26.8%, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in 7.6%, and parainfluenza virus (PIV) in 3.4%. The viruses causing acute bronchiolitis in the community were hRSV (42%), rhinovirus (19.5%), coronavirus (8%), PIV (3.5%), and hMPV (2.5%). In 53.7% of the cases, hRSV infected infants (86.9%), 53.7% being less than 6months of age. Of the hRSV cases, 48.2% were detected in November and December and 44.5% in January and February. The hRSV epidemic started the 1st or 2nd week of October but it varied from one year to another and from one region to another. hRSV acute bronchiolitis increased from 261 cases in epidemics from 1999\u20132003 to 341 cases from 2004\u20132009. Rhinoviruses gave acute bronchiolitis in 38.4% of cases. A rate of 54.6% of viruses was detected in September and October and 38.5% in March and April. A total of 34.2% of infected infants were under 6months of age, 37.8% between 6months and 2years, and 19.5% were between 2 and 5years old. hMPV epidemics coincided with hRSV epidemics, but they accounted for one-sixth the number of cases. HMPV infected infants (74%) who were older than those infected with hRSV, and the diagnosis was bronchiolitis (59%) and pneumonia (17%). PIV infections (about 100 cases per year) included PIV3 (62.7%), PIV1 (25.3%), and PIV2 (7.3%). PIV1 infections occurred every 2years in the fall. PIV3 infections were observed every year during the fall and winter, with peaks of infections in the spring in the years without PIV1. There were acute cases of bronchiolitis in 29.8% of PIV3 infections and 18.3% in PIV1 infections.","publish_time":"2010-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Freymuth, F.; Vabret, A.; Dina, J.; Cuvillon-Nimal, D.; Lubin, C.; Vaudecrane, A.; Guillois, B.; Gouarin, S.; Petitjean, J.; Lafaix-Delaire, F.; Brouard, J.","journal":"Archives de P\u00E9diatrie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62617e03845393f2e3972b84b316c82402b7b15a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0929693X10002290; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929693X10002290","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Dans les","Les","Les \u00E9pid\u00E9mies \u00E0","Il"],"organizations":["PIV","HMPV"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["hRSV cases","infections \u00E0 PIV3 et","\u00E0 PIV1","mois et","hRSV epidemics","PIV1 infections","hRSV acute bronchiolitis","et PIV2","PIV3 infections","PIV infections","bronchiolites \u00E0 hRSV sont pass\u00E9es","\u00C0 l\u2019h\u00F4pital","\u00E0 l\u2019automne","infections \u00E0 PIV3 sont automnales et hivernales","hRSV infected infants","rhinovirus dans","hRSV mais ont","acute cases of bronchiolitis","hRSV sont d\u00E9tect\u00E9s en novembre et d\u00E9cembre","rhinovirus sont associ\u00E9s \u00E0","bronchiolites aigu\u00EBs dans","en mars et avril","en janvier et f\u00E9vrier","peaks of infections","hMPV epidemics","HMPV infected infants","mais elle varie d\u2019une ann\u00E9e \u00E0 l\u2019autre et d\u2019une r\u00E9gion \u00E0 l\u2019autre","\u00E9pid\u00E9mies \u00E0 hMPV co\u00EFncident avec celles","cas hospitalis\u00E9s","number of cases","une pneumonie dans","cas par \u00E9pid\u00E9mies","infections au printemps","souches \u00E9tant identifi\u00E9es en septembre et octobre","est trouv\u00E9 dans","se r\u00E9partissent en PIV3","bronchiolites aigu\u00EBs communautaires","ann\u00E9es sans PIV1","PIV1 apparaissent tous","nourrissons","Il entra\u00EEne une bronchiolite aigu\u00EB dans","R\u00E9sum\u00E9 En Normandie","ont moins","parainfluenza virus","months of age","years old","bronchiolites aigu\u00EBs chez l\u2019enfant hospitalis\u00E9","virus respiratoire syncytial","human respiratory syncytial virus","fois moins","virus para-influenza","fall","coronavirus","une r\u00E9partition diff\u00E9rente","Il y","human metapneumovirus","enfants entre","e semaine d\u2019octobre","France","\u00E2g\u00E9s que ceux infect\u00E9s","infectent","m\u00E9tapneumovirus humain","Normandy","winter","hospitalized children","spring","community","dont","L\u2019\u00E9pid\u00E9mie d\u00E9bute","Summary","total","Rhinoviruses","diagnosis","week","rate","region","pneumonia"],"language":"en"},

Abstract The human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a new Pneumovirinae related to the avian metapneumovirus type C. hMPV genome differs from human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) genome by the gene order and the lack of nonstructural genes. Two genetic sub-groups and four sub-types of hMPV are identified. hMPV infections evolve as regular winter outbreaks which have roughly the same size and overlaping RSV epidemics. Among hospitalized children in Caen, hMPV is detected in 9.7% of the cases after RSV (37%), rhinovirus (18%), influenza virus (14.5%), adenovirus (9%), and parainfluenza virus (5%). Most of hMPV infections are observed in children suffering from bronchiolitis, but the localization to lower respiratory tract and the severity of the disease are less frequent in comparison with RSV infections. hMPV is very difficult to isolate using cell culture. Up to now, the only way for hMPV diagnosis was the TS\u2013CRP assays. But the recent apparition of direct antigenic tests allows us to get a fair, rapid, and economic diagnostic tool.","publish_time":"2009-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Freymuth, F.; Vabret, A.; Legrand, L.; Dina, J.; Gouarin, S.; Cuvillon-Nimal, D.; Brouard, J.","journal":"Pathologie Biologie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/82500c03d57e67a212959c13a049dc82c24759cd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0369811408001156; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0369811408001156","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["gene"],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":["Caen"],"keyphrases":["the disease","the severity","the lack","hMPV diagnosis was the TS","hMPV is detected in","the cases after RSV","roughly the same","the only way","the gene order","But the recent apparition","Abstract The human metapneumovirus","hMPV genome differs from human respiratory syncytial virus","virus influenza","virus parainfluenza","parainfluenza virus","but the localization to lower respiratory tract","overlaping RSV epidemics","new Pneumovirinae related to the avian metapneumovirus type","hMPV infections evolve as regular winter outbreaks which","hMPV is very difficult to isolate using cell culture","to now","less frequent in comparison with RSV infections","plupart des infections","virus respiratoire syncytial humain","Among hospitalized children in Caen","m\u00E9tapneumovirus humain","types","rhinovirus","observed in children suffering from bronchiolitis","direct antigenic tests allows us to get","test de diagnostic rapide","economic diagnostic tool","four sub","tests antig\u00E9niques","m\u00E9tapneumovirus aviaire","apparition r\u00E9cente","manque des g\u00E8nes","ordre des g\u00E8nes","enfants atteints","enfants hospitalis\u00E9s","nouveau Pneumovirinae apparent\u00E9","Two genetic sub","fair","celle","\u00E9pid\u00E9mies hivernales r\u00E9guli\u00E8res","groups","forme","CRP assays","aujourd\u2019hui","signes de gravit\u00E9","nonstructural genes","g\u00E9nome","Most","d\u00E9tection mol\u00E9culaire","PCR","bronchiolites","importance","identified","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","cultures des cellules","groupes g\u00E9n\u00E9tiques","ann\u00E9e","adenovirus","ad\u00E9novirus"],"language":"fr"},

The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of five immunoassays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Methods Two quantitative automated immunoassays (MaglumiTM 2019-n-Cov IgG and IgM and Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA assays) and three lateral flow rapid tests were performed. This retrospective study included 200 residual sera from patients and healthy volunteers. Case serum samples (n = 128) were obtained from COVID-19 patients confirmed by RT-qPCR and CT-scan. Days since onset of symptoms was collected from their medical records. Control non-SARS-CoV-2 samples (n = 72) were obtained from anonymous stored residual serum samples. Results MaglumiTM IgG/IgM tests showed overall less sensitivity than Euroimmun IgG/IgA test (84.4% versus 64.3%). Both tests showed similar specificities of IgG at 99% and 100%, respectively. The two tests showed similar specificity for IgG at 99% and 100%, respectively. The results from the lateral flow assays were easily interpretable with unambiguous coloured reading bands. The overall sensitivity of the three tests was similar (around 70%) without any significant differences. The sensitivity of the three lateral flow assays and also of the serological quantitative assays increased during the second week after symptom onset and all reached similar values (91% to 94%) after 14 days. Conclusion This study shows accurate and equivalent performance of the five serological antibody assays (ELISA, CLIA and three lateral flow tests) in detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 14 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. This is compatible with their application in specific clinical contexts and in determining epidemiological strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Isabel, Montesinos; Damien, Gruson; Benoit, Kabamba; Hafid, Dahma; Sigi, Van den Wijngaert; Soleimani, Reza; Vincenzo, Carbone; Olivier, Vandenberg; Beatrice, Gulbis; Fleur, Wolff; Hector, Rodriguez-Villalobos","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57626a1add7bdbd1e608a80904a6bf12b540561b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301554; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301554?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Euroimmun IgG/IgA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["n-Cov IgG","lateral flow tests","lateral flow assays","Euroimmun IgG","IgM tests","lateral flow rapid tests","similar specificities of IgG","Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV","IgA assays","Results MaglumiTM IgG","Control non-SARS-CoV","serological quantitative assays","detection of SARS","onset of COVID","Days","serological antibody assays","onset of symptoms","similar values","similar specificity","overall sensitivity","patients","quantitative automated immunoassays","symptom onset","Case serum samples","retrospective study","antibodies","anonymous stored residual serum samples","residual sera","equivalent performance","IgA test","CLIA","ELISA","specific clinical contexts","epidemiological strategies","unambiguous coloured reading bands","RT-qPCR","application","healthy volunteers","Methods","week","CT-scan","Conclusion","Abstract Introduction","medical records","pandemic","significant differences","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Recent reports suggest that 10-30% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are asymptomatic. Other studies report that some subjects have significant viral shedding prior to symptom onset. Since both asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic subjects can spread the disease, identifying such individuals is critical for effective control of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Therefore, there is an urgent need to increase diagnostic testing capabilities in order to also screen asymptomatic carriers. In fact, such tests will be routinely required until a vaccine is developed. Yet, a major bottleneck of managing the COVID-19 pandemic in many countries is diagnostic testing, due to limited laboratory capabilities as well as limited access to genome-extraction and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) reagents. We developed P-BEST - a method for Pooling-Based Efficient SARS-CoV-2 Testing, using a non-adaptive group-testing approach, which significantly reduces the number of tests required to identify all positive subjects within a large set of samples. Instead of testing each sample separately, samples are pooled into groups and each pool is tested for SARS-CoV-2 using the standard clinically approved PCR-based diagnostic assay. Each sample is part of multiple pools, using a combinatorial pooling strategy based on compressed sensing designed for maximizing the ability to identify all positive individuals. We evaluated P-BEST using leftover samples that were previously clinically tested for COVID-19. In our current proof-of-concept study we pooled 384 patient samples into 48 pools providing an 8-fold increase in testing efficiency. Five sets of 384 samples, containing 1-5 positive carriers were screened and all positive carriers in each set were correctly identified. P-BEST provides an efficient and easy-to-implement solution for increasing testing capacity that will work with any clinically approved genome-extraction and PCR-based diagnostic methodologies.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shental, Noam; Levy, Shlomia; Skorniakov, Shosh; Wuvshet, Vered; Shemer-Avni, Yonat; Porgador, Angel; Hertz, Tomer","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/571504fb5bc0d85bd92d609590e8fbc332569db3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.20064618","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsyODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["P-BEST"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnostic testing capabilities","testing efficiency","positive subjects","positive carriers","Efficient SARS-CoV","increasing testing capacity","positive individuals","patient samples","leftover samples","asymptomatic carriers","P-BEST","pandemic","COVID","large set of samples","approved PCR","diagnostic assay","diagnostic methodologies","non-adaptive group-testing approach","approved genome-extraction","limited laboratory capabilities","pre-symptomatic subjects","limited access","multiple pools","fold increase","number of tests","combinatorial pooling strategy","Polymerase Chain Reaction","significant viral shedding","compressed sensing","concept study","disease","effective control","order","symptom onset","reagents","solution","ability","infected patients","urgent need","standard","countries","current proof","major bottleneck","studies","groups","Recent reports","fact","world","sets","vaccine"],"language":"en"},

These predictions indicate that variants of SARS-CoV-2 and human ACE2 in certain combinations could potentially play a role in increased binding efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 in vivo.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morton, Scott P.; Phillips, Joshua L.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b3c364cf627a5da15d204b8663c7359fa32281fa.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.30.071175","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjszMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","multiple variants of SARS","variants of ACE2","pH levels consistent","impact of pH","wide range of pH","physiological pH range","human ACE2","increased binding efficacy of SARS","consistent forces","significant variations","electrostatic interactions","human angiotensin","novel virus","greater electric forces","computational electrostatic simulations","nasal secretions","role","low potential","enzyme","differences","lung","lives","certain combinations","various complexes","bats","crossover","humans","deadly disease","scientist","vaccine","global pandemic","entire globe","Calculations","predictions"],"language":"en"},

SARS-Cov-2 entry into a cell is dependent upon binding of the viral spike (S) protein to cellular receptor and on cleavage of the spike protein by the host cell proteases such as Cathepsin L and Cathepsin B. CTSL/B are crucial elements of lysosomal pathway and both enzymes are almost exclusively located in the lysosomes.CTSL disruption offers potential for CoVID-19 therapies. The mechanisms of disruption include: decreasing expression of CTSL, direct inhibition of CTSL activity and affecting the conditions of CTSL environment (increase pH in lysosomes). We have conducted a high throughput drug screen gene expression analysis to identify compounds that would downregulate the expression of CTSL/CTSB. One of the top significant results shown to downregulate the expression of the CTSL gene is Amantadine. Amantadine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1968 as a prophylactic agent for influenza and later for Parkinson\u2019s disease. It is available as a generic drug.. Amantadine in addition to downregulating CTSL appears to further disrupt lysosomal pathway, hence interfering with the capacity of the virus to replicate. It acts as a lysosomotropic agent altering the CTSL functional environment. We hypothesize that Amantadine could decrease the viral load in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and as such it may serve as a potent therapeutic decreasing the replication and infectivity of the virus likely leading to better clinical outcomes. Clinical studies will be needed to examine the therapeutic utility of amantadine in COVID-19 infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smieszek, Sandra P.; Przychodzen, Bart P; Polymeropoulos, Mihael H","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e3f17680dc66471a7fbbccf516b61659c0f0cf6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.026187","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjszMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cathepsin B.

Although SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins have been detected in serum of COVID-19 patients, their dynamics and association with outcomes have not been characterized. Methods: A total of 116 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins tested in Tongji hospital were retrospectively investigated. Clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics and outcomes data were compared between mild-moderate group and died group. Further, a paired case-control study was conducted where each deceased case was matched to three mild-moderate patients of similar age. Findings: Among 116 subjects included, 101 mild-moderate patients survived and 15 cases died. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM levels peaked in forth week after onset of COVID-19 pneumonia, while serum IgG levels increased over 8 weeks. Serum IgM levels were higher in deceased patients than mild-moderate patients (P = 0.024), but not IgG. Serum IgM levels were negatively correlated with clinical outcome, eosinophil count and albumin levels (r = -0.269, P = 0.003; r = -0.188, P = 0.043; and r = -0.198, P = 0.033, resp.). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for IgM antibody was 0.681 (95% CI: 0.517-0.845, P = 0.024).

Specifically, there is concern that children could be an important source of SARS-CoV-2 in household transmission clusters. METHODS: We performed an observational study analysing literature published between December 2019 and March 2020 of the clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 in children and descriptions of household transmission clusters of SARS-CoV-2. In these studies the index case of each cluster defined as the individual in the household cluster who first developed symptoms. FINDINGS: Drawing on studies from China, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and Iran a broad range of clinical symptoms were observed in children. These ranged from asymptomatic to severe disease. Of the 31 household transmission clusters that were identified, 9.7% (3/31) were identified as having a paediatric index case.

The results revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein is not an ideal biomarker for COVID-19 diagnosis because of its low immunogenicity, thus tests that rely on this marker alone will have a high false negative rate. Our data further suggest that the S protein subunit 1 receptor binding domain (S1-RBD) might be the optimal antigen for IgM antibody detection, while the S protein extracellular domain (S1\u002BS2ECD) would be the optimal antigen for both IgM and IgG antibody detection.

These observations open up an obvious question about the rate and direction of mutational pressure for further vaccine and therapeutics designing. In this study, we did a comparative analysis of ORF1a and ORF1b by using the first isolate (Wuhan strain) as the parent sequence. We observed that most of the nucleotide mutations are C to U transitions. The rate of synonymous C to U transitions is significantly higher than the rate of nonsynonymous ones, indicating negative selection on amino acid substitutions. Further, trends in nucleotide usage bias have been investigated in 49 coronaviruses species. A strong bias in nucleotide usage in fourfold degenerated sites towards uracil residues is seen in ORF1 of all the studied coronaviruses. A more substantial mutational U pressure is observed in ORF1a than in ORF1b owing to the translation of ORF1ab via programmed ribosomal frameshifting. Unlike other nucleotide mutations, mutational U pressure caused by cytosine deamination, mostly occurring in the RNA-plus strand, cannot be corrected by the proof-reading machinery of coronaviruses. The knowledge generated on the direction of mutational pressure during translation of viral RNA-plus strands has implications for vaccine and nucleoside analogue development for treating covid-19 and other coronavirus infections.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Victorovich, Khrustalev Vladislav; Rajanish, Giri; Aleksandrovna, Khrustaleva Tatyana; Krishna, Kapuganti Shivani; Nicolaevich, Stojarov Aleksander; Vitoldovich, Poboinev Victor","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/298be542c679dbf76d65bac6656d57678389d74b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.05.078238","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjszOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nucleotide mutations","direction of mutational pressure","substantial mutational U pressure","U transitions","nucleotide usage bias","vaccine","rate of synonymous C","ORF1b","studied coronaviruses","coronaviruses species","rate of nonsynonymous ones","translation of viral RNA-plus strands","proof-reading machinery of coronaviruses","translation of ORF1ab","strong bias","ongoing COVID","comparative analysis of ORF1a","implications","fourfold degenerated sites","negative selection","uracil residues","nucleoside analogue development","amino acid substitutions","cytosine deamination","Wuhan strain","pandemic","programmed ribosomal frameshifting","obvious question","different parts","parent sequence","isolate","trends","therapeutics","SARS-CoV","globe","study","observations","coronavirus infections","months","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

The need for accurate and truthful information is vital. Mexico and Latin America have been widely affected, so having local epidemiological data, will be of great clinical utility. Methods: A total of 33 hospitalized patients with Covid-19 pneumonia (either severe or critical) were identified from electronic health record in a third level care private hospital in Mexico City from March 13rd to April 13rd, 2020. We conducted a descriptive study of patients for characterization of the clinical, laboratory and radiologic findings, as well as complications. Results: The mean age was 60.6 (12.68) years and 23 (69.7%) were males. Twenty-three patients (69.6%) were overweight or obese. The median duration of symptoms before admission was 7 days. All the patients required mechanical invasive ventilation. The median duration of the mechanical ventilation was 12(2.6) days and all patients were extubated except one. All patients were started on antiviral treatment in the first 24 hours after admission once the diagnosis of Covid19 pneumonia was made. There was no difference between the treatment option and the length of stay. The extubation rate was higher (91.6%) than in other series, with no fatalities even though they were treated with different regimens. Conclusions: This one-centre experience describes the epidemiology, treatment and outcome of 33 patients with severe or critical COVID pneumonia admitted to the ICU. Most patients in our series were overweight or obese male, which we observed were of higher risk to present critical pneumonia, as well as high levels of Interleukin-6. The foregoing is relevant, due to the high incidence of these comorbidities in our country.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Valente-Acosta, B.; Hoyo-Ulloa, I.; Espinosa-Aguilar, L.; Mendoza-Aguilar, R.; Garcia-Guerrero, J.; Ontanon-Zurita, D.; Gomez-Gomez, B.; Fueyo-Rodriguez, O.; Vera-Zertuche, J.

The poor performance of some diagnostic serological tools has emphasised the need for up to date immune-informatic analyses to inform the selection of viable targets for further study. This requires the integration and analysis of genetic and immunological data for SARS-CoV-2 and its homology with other human coronavirus species to understand cross-reactivity. Methods We have developed an online tool for SARS-CoV-2 research, which combines an extensive epitope mapping and prediction meta-analysis, with an updated variant database (55,944 non-synonymous mutations) based on 16,087 whole genome sequences, and an analysis of human coronavirus homology. To demonstrate its utility, we present an integrated analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins, which are candidate vaccine and serological diagnostic targets. Results Our analysis reveals that the nucleocapsid protein in its native form appears to be a sub-optimal target for use in serological diagnostic platforms. Whilst, a further analysis suggests that orf3a proteins may be a suitable alternative target for diagnostic assays. Conclusions The tool can be accessed online (http://genomics.lshtm.ac.uk/immuno) and will serve as a useful tool for biological discovery in the fight against SARS-CoV-2. Further, it may be adapted to inform on biological targets in future outbreaks, including new human coronaviruses that spill over from animal hosts.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ward, Daniel; Higgins, Matthew; Phelan, Jody E.; Hibberd, Martin L.; Campino, Susana; Clark, Taane G","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8637c41b33fc224054c008f6001697e52a4a17f5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.11.089409","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","analysis of genetic","integrated analysis","serological diagnostic targets","analysis of human coronavirus homology","diagnostic serological tools","prediction meta-analysis","serological diagnostic platforms","diagnostic assays","biological targets","online tool","nucleocapsid proteins","human coronavirus species","useful tool","new human coronaviruses","selection of viable targets","orf3a proteins","biological discovery","sub-optimal target","suitable alternative target","development of control tools","updated variant database","future outbreaks","candidate vaccine","extensive epitope mapping","socio-economic burden","immunological data","major global health","non-synonymous mutations","need","fight","mobilisation of resources","native form","date immune-informatic analyses","pandemic","research","poor performance","spike","cross-reactivity","diagnostics","study","integration","genome sequences","animal hosts","vaccines","utility","Methods","COVID","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Telemedicine, which includes medical advice given over telephone, Internet, mobile phone applications or other similar ways, may be an efficient way to reduce transmission and pressure on medical institutions. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Web of science, Embase, Cochrane, CBM, CNKI and Wanfang databases for literature on the use of telemedicine for COVID-19, SARS and MERS. from their inception to March 31st, 2020. We included studies about the content of the consultation (such as symptoms, therapy and prevention, policy, public service), screening of suspected cases, the provision of advice given to those people who may have symptoms or contact history. We conducted meta-analyses on the main outcomes of the studies. Results: A total of 2041 articles were identified after removing duplicates. After reading the full texts, we finally included nine studies. People were most concerned about symptoms (64.2%), epidemic situation and public problems (14.5%), and psychological problems (10.3%) during COVID-19 epidemic. During the SARS epidemic, the proportions of people asking for consultation for symptoms, prevention and therapy, and psychological problems were 35.0%, 22.0%, and 23.0%, respectively. Two studies demonstrated that telemedicine can be used to screen the suspected patients and give advice. One study emphasized the limited possibilities to follow up people calling hotlines and difficulties in identifying all suspect cases. Conclusions: Telemedicine services should focus on the issues that the public is most concerned about, such as then symptoms, prevention and treatment of the disease, and provide reasonable advice to patients with symptoms or people with epidemic history.

However, reports aimed at identifying the relationship between pandemics and child health are limited. We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic in 2003 and its relationship to child development indicators using a representative sample across China. Our study involved longitudinal measurements of 14,647 children, 36% of whom (n = 5216) were born before or during the SARS pandemic. Cox models were utilized to examine the effects of SARS on preterm birth and four milestones of development: age to (1) walk independently, (2) say a complete sentence, (3) count from 0 to 10, and (4) undress him/herself for urination. Mixed effect models were utilized to associate SARS with birthweight, body weight and height. Our results show that experiencing SARS during early childhood was significantly associated with delayed milestones, with adjusted hazard ratios of 3.17 [95% confidence intervals (CI): 2.71, 3.70], 3.98 (3.50, 4.53), 4.96 (4.48, 5.49), or 5.57 (5.00, 6.20) for walking independently, saying a complete sentence, counting from 0 to 10, and undressing him/herself for urination, respectively.

Automated detection of lung infections from computed tomography (CT) images offers a great potential to augment the traditional healthcare strategy for tackling COVID-19. However, segmenting infected regions from CT scans faces several challenges, including high variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between infections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is impractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep model. To address these challenges, a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation Deep Network (Inf-Net) is proposed to automatically identify infected regions from chest CT scans. In our Inf-Net, a parallel partial decoder is used to aggregate the high-level features and generate a global map. Then, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge-attention are utilized to model the boundaries and enhance the representations.

Methods The multicenter study prospectively included 59 patients with COVID-19 treated at Jilin province from January 21, 2020 to May 5, 2020. Laboratory tests were included haematological, biochemical, and immunological tests. Results Laboratory findings, the characteristics of epidemiological and demographic data were extracted from electronic medical records. Eosinopenia was shown in 52.6% cases at onset, and the average value of eosinophil continued to significantly increase thereafter. Lymphopenia was found in 40.4% cases at onset, and the average value of lymphocyte was slowly elevated after day 5. Thrombocytopenia was shown in 12.3% cases at onset, and the average value of mean platelet volume was decreased sharply after day 7. The values of aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, creatinine kinase-muscle/brain activity, and cardiac troponin I, serum cardiac markers, were beyond the upper limit of RI from 6.1% to 30.6% at onset.

We therefore assessed the association between ethnic composition, income deprivation and COVID19 mortality rates in England. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional ecological analysis across upper tier local authorities in England. We assessed the association between the proportion of the population from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds, income deprivation and COVID19 mortality rates using negative binomial regression models, whilst adjusting for population density, proportion of the population aged 50-79 and 80\u002B years, and the duration of the epidemic in each area. Findings: Local authorities with a greater proportion of residents from ethnic minority backgrounds had statistically significantly higher COVID19 mortality rates, as did local authorities with a greater proportion of residents experiencing deprivation relating to low income. After adjusting for income deprivation and other covariates, each percentage point increase in the proportion of the population from BAME backgrounds was associated with a 1% increase in the COVID19 mortality rate [IRR=1.01, 95%CI 1.01 to 1.02]. Each percentage point increase in the proportion of the population experiencing income deprivation was associated with a 2% increase in the COVID19 mortality rate [IRR=1.02, 95%CI 1.01 to 1.04]. Interpretation: This study provides evidence that both income deprivation and ethnicity are associated with greater COVID19 mortality. To reduce these inequalities governments need to target effective control measures at these disadvantaged communities, ensuring investment of resources reflects their greater need and vulnerability to the pandemic.

For the mean-field model, which does not distinguish between different age groups, we demonstrate that including a more realistic Gamma distribution of incubation and recovery periods may not have an effect on the total number of deaths and the overall size of an epidemic, but it has a major effect in terms of increasing the peak numbers of infected and critical care cases, as well as on changing the timescales of an epidemic, both in terms of time to reach the peak, and the overall duration of an outbreak. In order to obtain more accurate estimates of disease progression and investigate different strategies for introducing and lifting the lockdown, we have also considered an age-structured version of the model, which has allowed us to include more accurate data on age-specific rates of hospitalisation and COVID-19 related mortality. Applying this model to three comparable neighbouring regions in the UK has delivered some fascinating insights regarding the effect of quarantine in regions with different population structure. We have discovered that for a fixed quarantine duration, the timing of its start is very important in the sense that the second epidemic wave after lifting the quarantine can be significantly smaller or larger depending on the specific population structure. Also, the later the fixed-duration quarantine is introduced, the smaller is the resulting final number of deaths at the end of the outbreak. When the quarantine is introduced simultaneously for all regions, increasing quarantine duration postpones and slightly reduces the epidemic peak, though without noticeable differences in peak magnitude between different quarantine durations.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blyuss, K.

Non-pharmaceutical intervention policies such as community quarantines, closures and travel bans are often implemented in emergencies but many of them are disruptive and difficult to maintain for extended periods of time. A promising alternative recommended by the CDC for influenza is requiring individuals showing fever symptoms to remain isolated at home until they are fever-free for at least one day, but there is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of such symptom-based isolation policies. Methods: Here we introduce a computational model of symptom-based isolation that accounts for the timing of symptoms, viral shedding and the population structure. It was validated on outbreaks of influenza in schools and modified to account for COVID-19. It was then used to estimate the outbreak curves and the attack rates (the proportion of the population infected) under one or more days of fever-based isolation. Results: Using the model we find evidence that symptom-based isolation policies could reduce the attack rates of both influenza and COVID-19 outbreaks, and flatten the outbreak curves. Specifically, we found that across a range of influenza scenarios, a CDC-recommended policy of one day isolation following fever can reduce the attack rate from 27% of the population to 12%, and to 3% if the isolation is extended to two days. In COVID-19 transmission, we estimate that implementing one day post-fever isolation would reduce the attack rate from 79% to 71%, and there is possible benefit from isolation for six days. In both influenza and COVID-19, the policies are predicted to reduce the peak number of infected but not shorten the outbreak duration. Conclusions: Symptom-based isolation could be an important tool to control influenza and COVID-19 outbreaks in schools, and potentially other settings. We recommend that schools implement a post-fever isolation policy of two days for influenza and six days for COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burns, Adam; Gutfraind, Alexander","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/028774b18ecdeca99fdb36f09e1952c6437db771.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044750","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","day isolation","symptom-based isolation policies","days of fever","outbreaks of influenza","day post-fever isolation","post-fever isolation policy","fever symptoms","fever-free","range of influenza scenarios","attack rates","schools","outbreak curves","computational model of symptom","CDC-recommended policy","population structure","outbreak duration","Non-pharmaceutical intervention policies","timing of symptoms","limited evidence","transmission of respiratory infections","extended periods of time","peak number of infected","community quarantines","travel bans","closures","viral shedding","home","individuals","effectiveness","important tool","critical public health priority","emergencies","proportion","possible benefit","Conclusions","Background","Methods","Results","settings"],"language":"en"},

However, any such model will rely on parameters that are unknown, which in practice are estimated using stochastic and poorly measured quantities. As a result, an early prediction of the long-term evolution of a pandemic will quickly lose relevance, while a late model will be too late to be useful for disaster management. Unless a model is designed to be adaptive, it is bound either to lose relevance over time, or lose trust and thus not have a second-chance for retraining. We propose a strategy for estimating the number of infections and the number of deaths, that does away with time-series modeling, and instead makes use of a \u0027phase portrait approach\u0027. We demonstrate that, with this approach, there is a universality to the evolution of the disease across countries, that can then be usedto make reliable predictions. These same models can also be used to plan the requirements for critical resources during the pandemic. The approach is designed for simplicity of interpretation, and adaptivity over time. Using our model, we predict the number of infections and deaths in Italy and New York State, based on an adaptive algorithm which uses early available data, and show that our predictions closely match the actual outcomes. We also carry out a similar exercise for India, where in addition to projecting the number of infections and deaths, we also project the expected range of critical resource requirements for hospitalizations in a location.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prakash, Meher K; Kaushal, Shaurya; Bhattacharya, Soumyadeep; Chandran, Akshay; Kumar, Aloke; Ansumali, Santosh","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a9e6585dd4a06940cd7ca08ab2296378b62d0fcb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.20057414","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["New York State"],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["number of deaths","number of infections","late model","pandemic","temporal evolution","long-term evolution","relevance","time-series modeling","phase portrait approach","early prediction","adaptive algorithm","critical resources","reliable predictions","expected range of critical resource requirements","early available data","Current epidemiological models","Italy","New York State","hospitalizations","principle","addition","simplicity of interpretation","India","usedto","disaster management","location","countries","adaptivity","disease","universality","similar exercise","practice","measured quantities","actual outcomes","result","parameters","trust","strategy","chance","retraining"],"language":"en"},

In the following, I deduce a formula for an adjusted Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) to assess mortality in a period following a positive test adjusted for selection bias. Official datasets on cases and deaths were combined with data sets on number of tests. After data curation and quality control, a total of IFR (n=819) was calculated for 21 countries for periods of up to 26 days between registration of a case and death.

Rapid lobular progression of GGO suggests the possibility of severe disease. 3.Basic principles of early intervention treatment of COVID-19: on the premise of no effective antiviral drugs, treatment is based on supportive and symptomatic therapy (albumin supplementation, supplement of potassium, supplement blood plasma, etc.) in order to maintain the stability of the intracellular environment and adequately reactivate body immunity to clean up SARS-CoV-2 . 4. According to severity, oxygenation index, body weight, age, underlying diseases, appropriate amount methylprednisolone application on severe/critical COVID-19 patients on demand, improved blood oxygen and reduced the utilization rate of invasive mechanical ventilation, case fatality rate and medical burden significantly. The most common indications for invasive mechanical ventilation should be strictly control in critical COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: 1.Accurate and timely identification of clinical features in severe risks, and early and appropriate intervention can block disease progression. 2.Appropriate dose of methylprednisolone can effectively avoid invasive mechanical ventilation and reduce case fatality rate in critical COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"chen, m.; tu, c.; Tan, C.; Zheng, X.; wang, x.; wu, j.; Huang, Y.; wang, z.; yan, y.; li, z.; shan, h.; Liu, J.; huang, j.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/114b20d611dd85c06e7f6e93f3937233cb9203ed.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.06.20054890v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BNP","Rapid","GGO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe patients","critical COVID","confirmed COVID","prediction index of severe COVID","adult patients","severe risks","Basic principles of early intervention treatment of COVID","severe cases","possibility of severe disease","prediction of severe disease progression","Abstract Background COVID","high case fatality rate","utilization rate of invasive mechanical ventilation","early diagnosis","appropriate intervention","high BNP","high CRP","treatment effect","treatment guidelines","Appropriate dose of methylprednisolone","methylprednisolone application","high D-dimer","methylprednisolone usages","hypoproteinemia","hypokalemia","contagious respiratory disease","SARS-CoV","order","Rapid lobular progression of GGO","supplement blood plasma","huge medical burden","summarized clinical data","improved blood oxygen","excellent clinical experience","supplement of potassium","body weight","timely identification of clinical features","body immunity","oxygenation index","current diagnosis","laboratory examination results","global spread","imaging findings","underlying diseases","albumin supplementation","viremia","significant low lymphocyte count","demand","linear combinations","symptomatic therapy","important indicators","occurrence of hemoptysis","novel coronavirus","clear change","prognosis","hyperlactic acid","Characteristic images of lung CT","effective antiviral drugs","Ground-glass opacity","Affiliated Hospital","different pathological changes","intracellular environment","Hypoxemia","severity","premise","common indications","Yat-sen University","stability","Methods","Conclusions","reference"],"language":"en"},

The nature, degree and mechanism of myocardial injury in affected patients in the United States are unknown. Objective: To describe the severity and trends of myocardial injury in a large cohort of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. Design: Retrospective cohort study of data captured between February 27th and April 12th, 2020. Setting: Patients were admitted to one of five hospitals in the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) in New York City. Data was collected from the electronic health record (EHR) databases within the hospital system. Participants: We included all patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the aforementioned hospitals during the study period who had at least one troponin-I measured within 24 hours of admission. Exposure(s) (for observational studies): SARS-CoV-2 infection as confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swabs. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): During the study period, 2736 patients met the inclusion criteria. Demographics, medical history, admission labs, and all troponin-I measurements during hospitalization were recorded for each patient. Admission troponin levels were characterized as mildly elevated (between one and three times the upper limit of normal) and elevated (above three times the upper limit of normal). Results: The median age was 66.4 years, with 59.6% men and 40.7% over age 70. In those patients with elevated troponins, cardiovascular disease (CVD) including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure, were more prevalent as were conditions of chronic kidney disease, hypertension and diabetes. Inflammatory markers were higher among patients with more substantial troponin elevations as well. Patients who had lower hemoglobin, hypo- or hypertension, or tachycardia generally presented with higher troponins. Conclusions and Relevance: Myocardial injury, manifesting as troponin elevation appears to be common among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 but present at generally low levels. Patients with a history of CVD are more likely to have myocardial injury than patients without CVD or risk factors for CVD. Troponin elevation among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 likely represents non-ischemic or secondary myocardial injury.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lala, A.; Johnson, K.

We describe our web application and its models in detail and provide recommendations and caveats for its use. Our application is primarily designed for hospital leaders, healthcare workers, and government official who may lack specialized knowledge in epidemiology and modeling. However, specialists can also use our open source code as a platform for modification and deeper study.

Participants were 387,109 men and women (56.4 \u00B18.8 yr; 55.1% women) residing in England from UK Biobank study. Physical activity, smoking, and alcohol intake, were assessed by questionnaire at baseline (2006-2010). Body mass index, from measured height and weight, was used as an indicator of overall obesity. Outcome was cases of COVID-19 serious enough to warrant a hospital admission from 16-March-2020 to 26-April-2020. There were 760 COVID-19 cases. After adjustment for age, sex and mutually for each lifestyle factor, physical inactivity (Relative risk, 1.32, 95% confidence interval, 1.10, 1.58), smoking (1.42;1.12, 1.79) and obesity (2.05 ;1.68, 2.49) but not heavy alcohol consumption (1.12; 0.93, 1.35) were all related to COVID-19. We also found a dose-dependent increase in risk of COVID-19 with less favourable lifestyle scores, such that participants in the most adverse category had 4-fold higher risk (4.41; 2.52 \u20137.71) compared to people with the most optimal lifestyle. C-reactive protein levels were associated with elevated risk of COVID-19 in a dose-dependent manner, and partly (10 \u2013 16%) explained associations between adverse lifestyle and COVID-19. Based on UK risk factor prevalence estimates, unhealthy behaviours in combination accounted for up to 51% of the population attributable fraction of severe COVID-19. Our findings suggest that an unhealthy lifestyle synonymous with an elevated risk of non-communicable disease is also a risk factor for COVID-19 hospital admission, which might be partly explained by low grade inflammation. Adopting simple lifestyle changes could lower the risk of severe infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hamer, Mark; Kivim\u00E4ki, Mika; Gale, Catharine R.; David Batty, G.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/42b7eafdc0e040310ae317bd4a9de5aad31059fe.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S088915912030996X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088915912030996X?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsyNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK Biobank","UK"],"locations":["England"],"keyphrases":["elevated risk of COVID","lifestyle risk factors","cases of COVID","Relative risk","higher risk","lifestyle factor","adverse lifestyle","risk of severe infection","optimal lifestyle","unhealthy lifestyle synonymous","UK risk factor prevalence estimates","smoking","favourable lifestyle scores","simple lifestyle changes","population attributable fraction of severe COVID","elevated risk of non-communicable disease","physical inactivity","Physical activity","excessive alcohol intake","Participants","women","hospital admission","UK Biobank study","heavy alcohol consumption","dose-dependent increase","dose-dependent manner","indicator of overall obesity","unhealthy behaviours","large-scale general population study","adverse category","prospective cohort data","national registry linkage","measured height","Body mass index","C-reactive protein levels","weight","hospitalisation","combination","England","sex","confidence interval","questionnaire","findings","associations","low grade inflammation","adjustment","yr","people","Outcome","baseline"],"language":"en"},

The most notable enrichment of IRs was found inside 5\u2032UTR for IRs of size 12\u002B nucleotides, and the most notable enrichment of putative quadruplex sites (PQSs) was located before 3\u2032UTR, inside 5\u2032UTR, and before mRNA.

To be more effectively controlling the disease, it is critical to set up an optimal quarantine period so that about 95% of the cases developing symptoms will be retained for isolation. At the moment, the WHO-established quarantine period is 14 days based on previous reports which had studied small sizes of hospitalized cases (10 and ~100, respectively), however, over 80% of adult- and 95% of child-cases were not necessary to stay in hospitals, and therefore, had not been hospitalized. Therefore, we are questioning if the current-inferred median incubation time is representative for the whole Covid-19 population, and if the current quarantine period is optimal. Methods We compiled and analyzed the patient-level information of 2015 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases including 99 children in 28 Chinese provinces. This cohort represents a wide-range spectrum of Covid-19 disease with both hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases. Results The full range of incubation periods of the Covid-19 cases ranged from 0 to 33 days among 2015 cases. There were 6 (0.13%) symptom-free cases including 4 females with a median age of 25.5 years and 2 males with a median age of 36 years. The median incubation period of both male and female adults was similar (7-day) but significantly shorter than that (9-day) of child cases (P=0.02). This cohort contained 4 transmission generations, and incubation periods of the cases between generations were not significantly different, suggesting that the virus has not been rapidly adapted to human beings. Interestingly, incubation periods of 233 cases (11.6%) were longer than the WHO-established quarantine period (14 days). Data modeling suggested that if adults take an extra 4-day or 7-day of isolation (i.e., a quarantine period of 18 or 21 days), 96.2% or 98.3%, respectively, of the people who are developing symptoms will be more effectively quarantined. Patients transmitted via lunch/dinner parties (i.e., gastrointestinal tract infection through oral transmission) had a significantly longer incubation period (9-day) than other adults transmitted via respiratory droplets or contaminated surfaces and objects (P\u003C0.004). Conclusions The whole Covid-19 population including both hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases had a median incubation period of 7-day for adults, which is 1.8-day longer than the hospitalized cases reported previously. An extension of the adult quarantine period to 18 days or 21 days could be more effective in preventing virus-spreading and controlling the disease. The cases transmitted by lunch/dinner parties could be infected first in the gastrointestinal tract through oral transmission and then infected in the respiratory system so that they had a longer incubation period.","publish_time":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiang, Xue; Niu, Yawei; Li, Xiong; Li, Lin; Cai, Wenxiang; Chen, Yucan; Liao, Bo; Wang, Edwin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a6203f5bc0f1ac39f4c722a6d9aa6918858f5de1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036533","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjszMzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["child-cases","child cases","median incubation period","non-hospitalized cases","longer incubation period","current quarantine period","established quarantine period","optimal quarantine period","adult quarantine period","days","small sizes of hospitalized cases","symptom-free cases","median incubation time","day of isolation","range of incubation periods","disease","median age","oral transmission","transmission generations","female adults","wide-range spectrum of Covid","dinner parties","population","lunch","years","cohort","symptoms","gastrointestinal tract infection","respiratory droplets","respiratory system","contaminated surfaces","objects","SARS-CoV","laboratory","females","previous reports","new coronavirus","children","patient-level information","outbreak","Patients","extension","Chinese provinces","Data modeling","Conclusions","moment","human beings","Methods","hospitals","people"],"language":"en"},

Here, we report a super-spreading transmission chain of SARS-CoV-2 involving an index patient, seven cancer patients, 40 health care workers and four family members. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study to identify the index patient and the exposed individuals linked to a chain of transmission associated with COVID-19. We collected and analyzed the data on demographic features, exposure history, clinical presentation, laboratory investigation, radiological examination, and disease outcome of these patients. Results: We identified the index patient and another presumptive super-spreader, who initiated and amplified a super-spreading transmission chain associated with COVID-19, respectively. There were 31 female and 21 male patients in this cohort, and the median age was 37 years (range: 22-79 years). Each of them had an exposure history with the index patient or his close contacts. Approximately 87% (45/52) of the patients had fever or other symptoms, 96% (50/52) had abnormal chest CT-scan findings, 86% of the tested patients (39/45) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the nasopharyngeal or throat swab specimen, 85% of the tested patients (29/34) were positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and/or IgG, 15% of the RT-PCR positive patients were tested negative for the specific IgM and/or IgG at the convalescent phase, and 15% of the RT-PCR negative patients were tested positive for the specific IgM and/or IgG. The severe patients experienced a significant decrease in oximetry saturation, lymphocyte, and platelet counts, along with a significant increase in C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase. All six fatal cases had comorbidities and five of the seven cancer patients (71%) died within 2-20 days of the disease onset. Conclusions: The super-spreading events were associated with the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan and its impact on disease transmission warrants further investigation. Cancer patients appeared highly vulnerable to COVID-19. The finding that a significant portion of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were tested negative for the serum specific IgM and IgG at the convalescent phase should be addressed by additional studies.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Ke; Zhao, Yang; Wang, Mengmei; Zeng, Qiqi; Wang, Xiaorui; Wang, Ming; Zheng, Zhishui; Li, Xiaochen; Zhang, Yunting; Wang, Tao; Zeng, Shaolin; Jiang, Yan; Liu, Dan; Yu, Wenzhen; Hu, Fang; Qin, Hongyu; Hao, Jingcan; Yuan, Jian; Shang, Rui; Jiang, Meng; Ding, Xi; Zhang, Binghong; Shi, Bingyin; Zhang, Chengsheng","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a544bee366aec9bdf3d13c2824d681ff3cf7b09.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.19.20026245","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjszNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["tested patients","cancer patients","infected patients","male patients","severe patients","RT-PCR positive patients","RT-PCR negative patients","SARS-CoV","super-spreading transmission chain of SARS","index patient","IgG","Super-spreading events","chain of transmission","outbreak of COVID","significant portion of SARS","serum specific IgM","outbreaks of SARS","disease transmission warrants","presumptive super-spreader","significant decrease","significant increase","exposure history","disease outcome","disease onset","convalescent phase","years","laboratory investigation","clinical presentation","radiological examination","lymphocyte","oximetry saturation","health care workers","C-reactive protein","D-dimer","demographic features","platelet counts","impact","Wuhan","exposed individuals","abnormal chest CT-scan findings","family members","median age","range","data","cohort","retrospective study","association","throat swab specimen","lactate dehydrogenase","comorbidities","MERS","close contacts","Background","Conclusions","additional studies","fatal cases","Methods","days","fever","symptoms","female","Results"],"language":"en"},

ABSTRACT Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in December 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has since spread across the world. At present, the virus has infected over 1.7 million people and caused over 100 000 deaths worldwide. Research is currently focused on understanding the acute infection and developing effective treatment strategies. In view of the magnitude of the epidemic, we conducted a speculative review of possible medium- and long-term neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with particular emphasis on neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin, based on the available evidence on neurological symptoms of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Development: We systematically reviewed the available evidence about the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the immediate and lasting effects of the cytokine storm on the central nervous system, and the consequences of neuroinflammation for the central nervous system. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 is a neuroinvasive virus capable of triggering a cytokine storm, with persistent effects in specific populations. Although our hypothesis is highly speculative, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the onset and progression of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin should be regarded as the potential cause of a delayed pandemic that may have a major public health impact in the medium to long term. Cognitive and neuropsychological function should be closely monitored in COVID-19 survivors.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Serrano-Castro, Pedro J.; Estivill-Torr\u00FAs, Guillermo; Cabezudo-Garc\u00EDa, Pablo; Antonio Reyes-Bueno, Jos\u00E9; Petersen, Nicol\u00E1s Ciano; Aguilar-Castillo, Mar\u00EDa Jos\u00E9; Su\u00E1rez-P\u00E9rez, Juan; Jim\u00E9nez-Hern\u00E1ndez, Mar\u00EDa Dolores; Moya-Molina, Miguel \u00C1ngel; Oliver-Martos, Bego\u00F1a; Arrabal-G\u00F3mez, Carlos; de Fonseca, Fernando Rodr\u00EDguez","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6936e1a9ece051a13678f9386d399edea38170ff.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213485320300670; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213485320300670?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjszOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Sistema Nervioso Central"],"locations":["Wuhan","long"],"keyphrases":["and the","the impact of SARS","the virus","In view of the magnitude of the epidemic","in the Chinese city of Wuhan and","the immediate and lasting effects of the cytokine storm on the central nervous system","infection on the onset and progression of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric","of neuroinflammation for the central nervous system","and long","We systematically reviewed the available evidence about the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS","based on the available evidence on neurological symptoms of acute SARS","on neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric","coronavirus SARS","of neuroinflammatory origin should be regarded as the potential","since spread across the world","currently focused on understanding the acute infection and developing effective treatment","of a delayed pandemic that may have a major public health impact in the medium","neuroinvasive virus capable of triggering a cytokine storm","we conducted a speculative review of possible medium","infecci\u00F3n aguda","million people and caused over","infecci\u00F3n Covid19","Sistema Nervioso Central","Cognitive and neuropsychological function should be closely monitored in COVID","with persistent effects in specific populations","was first detected in December","term neurological","long term","medio","base neuroinflamatoria","largo plazo","tormenta de citoquinas","repercusi\u00F3n","CoV2 originada","progresi\u00F3n de Enfermedades neurodegenerativas","virus neuroinvasivo capaz","infected over","highly speculative","with particular","patolog\u00EDa neurol\u00F3gica","especial atenci\u00F3n a Enfermedades neurodegenerativas","afectaci\u00F3n neurol\u00F3gica","salud cognitiva","salud p\u00FAblica","posibles consecuencias","cuenta","causa","evidencia directa","gran impacto","pacientes supervivientes","deaths worldwide","persistencia","Development","Research","pandemia demorada","revisi\u00F3n especulativa","estrecho seguimiento","posible germen","mejor conocimiento","alto componente especulativo","mecanismos patog\u00E9nicos","At present","puesta","marcha","survivors","tiempo","neuroinflamaci\u00F3n","forma sistem\u00E1tica","regi\u00F3n china","proporciones pand\u00E9micas","Although our","epidemia","investigaci\u00F3n cient\u00EDfica actual","hip\u00F3tesis","situaci\u00F3n","estrategias terap\u00E9uticas","ABSTRACT Introduction","RESUMEN INTRODUCCI\u00D3N","muertes","poblaci\u00F3n seleccionada","DESARROLLO","CONCLUSIONES","Conclusions","millones de contagios","mundo","d\u00EDa"],"language":"es"},

Due to the well-known broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of the lactoferrin protein, we sought to verify whether its bovine form (bLf) would also be effective in vitro against SARS-CoV-2.

Design A prospective observational study using data on the daily number of infected patients and deaths from the New York Times daily database. Setting 50 States and the District of Columbia Participants All individuals judged to be positive for the coronavirus or to have died from COVID19. Main outcome measures Number of people diagnosed with or died from COVID19. Results We found that the decision to issue the state-at-home order reflects the Weber-Fechner law of psychophysics. Both the number of infections (p=\u003C0.0001; R2=0.79) and deaths (p\u003C0.0001; R2=0.63) were highly statistically significantly associated with the decision to issue the stay-at-home orders. The results indicate that for each doubling of infections or deaths within their state, an additional four to six governors will issue the stay-at-home order. We also observed a clear dose-response relationship in the Cox model: the larger the number of cases, or deaths, the higher the probability that the stay-at-home order will be made. When the number of deaths reached 256 or the number of infected people was greater than 16,384, the probability of issuing a stay-at-home order was close to 100%. Conclusions When there are not clearly articulated rules to follow, decision-makers in times of crisis such as COVID19 resort to use of simple heuristics consistent with the Weber-Fechner law of psychophysics.

Here, we quantify and characterize intra-host variation in SARS-CoV-2 raw sequence data uploaded to SRA as of 14 April 2020, and compare results between two sequencing methods (amplicon and RNA-Seq). Raw fastq files were quality filtered and trimmed using Trimmomatic, mapped to the WuhanHu1 reference genome using Bowtie2, and variants called with bcftools mpileup. To ensure sufficient coverage, we only included samples with 10X coverage for \u003E90% of the genome (n=406 samples), and only variants with a depth \u003E=10. Derived (i.e. non-reference) alleles were found at 408 sites. The number of polymorphic sites (i.e. sites with multiple alleles) within samples ranged from 0-13, with 72% of samples (295/406) having at least one polymorphic site. Correlation between number of polymorphic sites and coverage was very low for both sequencing methods (R2 \u003C 0.1, p \u003C 0.05). Polymorphisms were observed \u003E1 sample at 66 sites (range: 2-38 samples). The minor allele frequency (MAF) at each shared polymorphic site was 0.03% - 48.5%. 33/66 sites occurred in ORF1a1b, and 37/66 changes were non-synonymous. At 10/66 sites, derived alleles were found in samples sequenced using both methods. Polymorphic amplicon samples were found at 10/10 positions, while polymorphic RNA-Seq samples were found at 7/10 positions. In conclusion, our results suggest that intra-host variation is prevalent among clinical samples. While mutations resulting from amplification and/or sequencing errors cannot be excluded, the observation of shared polymorphic sites with high MAF across multiple samples and sequencing methods is consistent with true underlying variation.

SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs through binding and internalization of the viral spike protein to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the host cell membrane. Lethal complications are caused by damage and failure of vital organs that express high levels of ACE2, including the lungs, the heart and the kidneys. Here, we established a high-throughput drug screening strategy to identify therapeutic candidates that reduce ACE2 levels in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived cardiac cells. Drug target analysis of validated hit compounds, including 5 alpha reductase inhibitors, revealed androgen signaling as a key modulator of ACE2 levels. Treatment with the 5 alpha reductase inhibitor dutasteride reduced ACE2 levels and internalization of recombinant spike receptor binding domain (Spike-RBD) in hESC-derived cardiac cells and human alveolar epithelial cells. Finally, clinical data on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients demonstrated that abnormal androgen states are significantly associated with severe disease complications and cardiac injury as measured by blood troponin T levels. These findings provide important insights on the mechanism of increased disease susceptibility in male COVID-19 patients and identify androgen receptor inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ghazizadeh, Zaniar; Majd, Homa; Richter, Mikayla; Samuel, Ryan; Zekavat, Seyedeh Maryam; Asgharian, Hosseinali; Farahvashi, Sina; Kalantari, Ali; Ramirez, Jonathan; Zhao, Hongyu; Natarajan, Pradeep; Goodarzi, Hani; Fattahi, Faranak","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/260f96ec4a3d4c9fee55723b5d98baadfbaecad8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.12.091082","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high levels of ACE2","key modulator of ACE2 levels","coronavirus disease","severe disease complications","disease pathophysiology","hESC-derived cardiac cells","Spike-RBD","cardiac injury","androgen receptor inhibition","potential therapeutic strategy","blood troponin T levels","patients","infection","SARS-CoV","internalization of recombinant spike receptor binding domain","mechanism of increased disease susceptibility","human alveolar epithelial cells","viral spike protein","alpha reductase inhibitors","potential treatment options","abnormal androgen states","high-throughput drug screening strategy","therapeutic candidates","human embryonic stem cell","alpha reductase inhibitor dutasteride","male COVID","Lethal complications","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","host cell membrane","Drug target analysis of validated hit compounds","failure of vital organs","damage","understanding","angiotensin","enzyme","important insights","lungs","clinical data","global health crisis","findings","heart","kidneys"],"language":"en"},

Although generally safe and well tolerated they are potentially lethal in overdose. These two drugs are now candidates for the prevention and treatment of COVID19. In vitro data suggest that high concentrations and thus high doses will be needed if they are to be of benefit, but as yet there is no convincing evidence they are clinically effective. Nevertheless they are already being used very widely and fatal accidental overdoses have been reported. Methods: Individual data from prospectively studied French patients who had taken intentional chloroquine overdoses and were managed in the national toxicology intensive care unit in Paris were pooled. Bayesian logistic regression was used to estimate a concentration-fatality curve. The probabilities of fatal iatrogenic toxicity with the chloroquine regimens currently being trialled for the treatment of COVID19 were estimated from a combined pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model. Findings: In total, 258 patients were studied of whom 26 died (10%). There was a steep sigmoid relationship between admission whole blood chloroquine concentrations and death. Concentrations above 13umol/L (95% credible interval (C.I.), 10 to 16) were associated with greater than 1% mortality. Based on peak concentrations, absolute fatality ratios in the high dose arm (chloroquine base equivalent adult dose of 600mg given twice daily for ten days) of a recently terminated trial were estimated between 0.06% (90kg adult, 95%C.I. 0 to 0.3%) and 4.8% (40kg adult, 95% C.I. 1.9 to 9.7%). This regimen results in peak concentrations above 10umol/L in more than 60% of adults weighing 70kg. The other high dose regimens trialled currently for COVID19 result in peak concentrations above 10umol/L in only 0.2% of adults weighting 70kg. Interpretation:} High-dose chloroquine treatment regimens which result in whole blood chloroquine concentrations below 10umol/L for the majority of patients should not result in life-threatening cardiovascular toxicity.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Watson, J.

The rollout of diagnostic testing in the United States was slow, leading to numerous cases that were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 in February and March 2020, necessitating the use of serological testing to determine past infections. Here, we evaluated the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by testing 3 distinct patient populations. We tested 1,020 serum specimens collected prior to SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the United States and found one false positive, indicating a specificity of 99.90%. We tested 125 patients who tested RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 for which 689 excess serum specimens were available and found sensitivity reached 100% at day 17 after symptom onset and day 13 after PCR positivity. Alternative index value thresholds for positivity resulted in 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. We then tested 4,856 individuals from Boise, Idaho collected over one week in April 2020 as part of the Crush the Curve initiative and detected 87 positives for a positivity rate of 1.79%. These data demonstrate excellent analytical performance of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test as well as the limited circulation of the virus on the West Coast.

Methods: We collected information on clinical characteristics, exposure history, andlaboratory examinations of all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to PLA General Hospital. Cox regression analysis was applied to identify prognostic factors. The last follow-up was February 18, 2020. Results:We characterized 55 consecutive COVID-19 patients. The mean incubation was 8.42(95% confidence interval [CI], 6.55-10.29) days. The mean SARS-CoV-2-positive duration from first positive test to clearance was 9.71(95%CI, 8.21-11.22) days. COVID-19 course was approximately 2 weeks. Asymptomatic carriers might transmit SARS-CoV-2. Compared with patients without pneumonia, those with pneumonia were 15 years older and had a higher rate of hypertension, higher frequencies of having a fever and cough, and higher levels of interleukin-6 (14.61 vs. 8.06pg/mL, P=0.040), B lymphocyte proportion (13.0% vs.10.0%, P=0.024), low account (\u003C190/\u03BCL) of CD8\u002B T cells (33.3% vs. 0, P=0.019). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that circulating interleukin-6 andlactate independently predicted COVID-19 progression, with a hazard ratio (95%CI) of 1.052 (1.000-1.107) and 1.082 (1.013-1.155), respectively.

The cleavage and release of membrane proteins has been shown to modulate various cellular processes and disease pathologies. Numerous studies revealed that cell membrane molecules of diverse functional groups are subjected to proteolytic cleavage, and the released soluble form of proteins may modulate various signaling processes. Therefore, in addition to the secreted protein markers that undergo secretion through the secretory pathway, the shed membrane proteins may comprise an additional resource of noninvasive and accessible biomarkers. In this context, identifying the membrane-bound proteins that will be shed has become important in the discovery of clinically noninvasive biomarkers. Nevertheless, a data repository for biological and clinical researchers to review the shedding information, which is experimentally validated, for membrane-bound protein shed markers is still lacking. RESULTS: In this study, the database SheddomeDB was developed to integrate publicly available data of the shed membrane proteins. A comprehensive literature survey was performed to collect the membrane proteins that were verified to be cleaved or released in the supernatant by immunological-based validation experiments. From 436 studies on shedding, 401 validated shed membrane proteins were included, among which 199 shed membrane proteins have not been annotated or validated yet by existing cleavage databases. SheddomeDB attempted to provide a comprehensive shedding report, including the regulation of shedding machinery and the related function or diseases involved in the shedding events. In addition, our published tool ShedP was embedded into SheddomeDB to support researchers for predicting the shedding event on unknown or unrecorded membrane proteins. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, SheddomeDB is the first database for the identification of experimentally validated shed membrane proteins and currently may provide the most number of membrane proteins for reviewing the shedding information.

Positive-sense RNA viruses can use genomic RNA as a template for translation and replication after entering a suitable host cell. Furthermore, such viral RNA is recognized by capsid protein for packaging and by viral movement protein(s) or the movement protein complex for cell-to-cell and systemic movement. Hence, viral RNA must contain signals for different functions to complete the viral infection cycle. In this review, we examine various cis-acting elements in the genome of BaMV. The highly structured 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of the BaMV genomic RNA plays multiple roles in the BaMV infection cycle, including targeting chloroplasts for RNA replication, providing an initiation site for the synthesis of minus-strand RNA, signaling for polyadenylation, and directing viral long-distance movement. The nt at the extreme 3\u2032 end and the structure of the 3\u2032-terminus of minus-strand RNA are involved in the initiation of plus-strand genomic RNA synthesis. Both these regions have been mapped and reported to interact with the viral-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Moreover, the sequences upstream of open reading frames (ORFs) 2, 3, and 5 are involved in regulating subgenomic RNA synthesis. The cis-acting elements that were identified in BaMV RNA are discussed and compared with those of other potexviruses.","publish_time":"2017-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, I-Hsuan; Huang, Ying-Wen; Tsai, Ching-Hsiu","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2911b1cc77f7c2bf1f8743673d3d2df7d7993aee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5390519.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5390519/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzUxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral RNA","BaMV RNA","strand RNA","RNA replication","BaMV genomic RNA","viral-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","subgenomic RNA synthesis","strand genomic RNA synthesis","positive-sense RNA genome","Positive-sense RNA viruses","viral movement protein","viral long-distance movement","genome of BaMV","viral infection cycle","BaMV infection cycle","movement protein complex","systemic movement","synthesis of minus","capsid protein","various cis-acting elements","suitable host cell","initiation site","terminus of minus","multiple roles","UTR","different functions","targeting chloroplasts","translation","packaging","polyadenylation","open reading frames","family Alphaflexiviridae","nucleotides","signals","template","untranslated region","genus Potexvirus","structure","sequences","ORFs","Bamboo mosaic virus","length","review","regions","potexviruses"],"language":"en"},

Understanding how cellular factors have evolved to inhibit HIV-1 reveals particularly vulnerable points of the viral replication cycle. Many, but not all, antiviral proteins share type I interferon-upregulated expression and sensitivity to viral counteraction or evasion measures. Whereas well-established restriction factors interfere with early post-entry steps and release of HIV-1, recent research has revealed a diverse set of proteins that reduce the infectious quality of released particles using individual, to date poorly understood modes of action. These include induction of paucity of mature glycoproteins in nascent virions or self-incorporation into the virus particle, resulting in poor infectiousness of the virion and impaired spread of the infection. Conclusion: A better understanding of these newly discovered antiviral factors may open new avenues towards the design of drugs that repress the spread of viruses whose genomes have already integrated.","publish_time":"2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goffinet, Christine","journal":"Curr HIV Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27ee5b4647398fd11e7044166a9d68aca391ebcf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5403965.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5403965/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzUyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral proteins","discovered antiviral factors","line of antiviral defense","virus replication","characterization of antiviral genes","cellular factors","viral replication cycle","classical innate immunity","well-established restriction factors","viral counteraction","release of HIV","virus particle","cell-intrinsic innate immunity","impaired spread","spread of viruses","better understanding","diverse set of proteins","individual","sensitivity","early post-entry steps","addition","mature glycoproteins","nascent virions","self-incorporation","interferon-upregulated expression","date","new avenues","poor infectiousness","infectious quality of released particles","identification","type","vulnerable points","ability","recent research","design of drugs","past decade","induction of paucity","evasion measures","understood modes of action","infection"],"language":"en"},

To assess the role that host genetic variation has on efficacy of gene therapy, we characterized lentiviral-vector gene therapy within a set of 12 collaborative cross mouse strains. Lentiviral vectors carrying the firefly luciferase cDNA under the control of a liver-specific promoter were administered to female mice, with total-body and hepatic luciferase expression periodically monitored through 41 weeks post-vector administration. Vector copy number per diploid genome in mouse liver and spleen was determined at the end of this study. We identified major strain-specific contributions to overall success of transduction, vector biodistribution, maximum luciferase expression, and the kinetics of luciferase expression throughout the study.

Results: There exhibited significant microscopic changes of FHC structures between the rabbits performed LPB and the normal rabbits, among which group B2 exhibited the most serious FHC damages, and the Mankin pathological score in group B2 was much higher than those in the other three groups, and the scores of the experimental group were higher than the control group. Conclusions: The addition of TRI in LPB can damage the FHC structures, and large-dose (5 ml/once) and long-course (four times) will result in more serious injuries.","publish_time":"2017-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Dashou; Chen, Qian; Cai, Fengjun; Pan, Qi; Li, Xuesong; Wu, Qianming; Gan, Yong; Meng, Fei; Luo, Ping","journal":"Saudi Pharm J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/98364308fd44bb4fb686480fb10c968e918715f1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5447409.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5447409/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzU2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TRI","LPB","FHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["group B2","times","experimental group","control group","group A1","group A2","group B1","LPB","serious FHC damages","structural changes of FHC","significant microscopic changes of FHC structures","normal rabbits","addition of TRI","groups","Mankin pathological score","modified Mankin pathological scoring","serious injuries","month-old New Zealand white rabbits","lumbosacral plexus block","nerve block solution","femoral head chondrocytic","impacts of triamcinolone acetonide","light microscope","days","scores","time interval","total","injection","Results","large-dose","Objective","Conclusions","Methods","evaluation","course"],"language":"en"},

In line with the high disease burden attributable to influenza, these viruses play an important, but often neglected, role in travel medicine. Guidelines and recommendations regarding prevention and management of influenza in travellers are scarce. Of special interest for travel medicine are risk populations and also circumstances that facilitate influenza virus transmission and spread, like travel by airplane or cruise ship and mass gatherings. Methods: We conducted a PUBMED/MEDLINE search for a combination of the MeSH terms Influenza virus, travel, mass gathering, large scale events and cruise ship. In addition we gathered guidelines and recommendations from selected countries and regarding influenza prevention and management in travellers. By reviewing these search results in the light of published knowledge in the fields of influenza prevention and management, we present best practice advice for the prevention and management of influenza in travel medicine. Results: Seasonal influenza is among the most prevalent infectious diseases in travellers. Known host-associated risk factors include extremes of age and being immune-compromised, while the most relevant environmental factors are associated with holiday cruises and mass gatherings. Conclusions: Pre-travel advice should address influenza and its prevention for travellers, whenever appropriate on the basis of the epidemiological situation concerned. Preventative measures should be strongly recommended for travellers at high-risk for developing complications. In addition, seasonal influenza vaccination should be considered for any traveller wishing to reduce the risk of incapacitation, particularly cruise ship crew and passengers, as well as those participating in mass gatherings. Besides advice concerning preventive measures and vaccination, advice on the use of antivirals may be considered for some travellers.","publish_time":"2016-12-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goeijenbier, M.; van Genderen, P.; Ward, B.

We studied and compared the phenotype and functionality of T-cells in patients with acute ZIKV and Dengue viral (DENV) infections. A significant activation of T-cells was observed during both ZIKV and DENV infections. ZIKV infection was characterized by a CD4 T cell differentiation toward effector cells and by a lower frequency of IFN-\u03B3 producing CD4 T cells.

Therefore it is possible that the immunopathology differs among the various presentations of DAD. The aim of this study is to compare lung immunopathology of viral (influenza A(H1N1)pdm09) to non-viral, extrapulmonary aetiologies in autopsy cases with DAD. METHODS: The lung tissue of 44 patients, was divided in the H1N1 group (n = 15) characterized by severe pulmonary injury due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection; the ARDS group (n = 13), characterized by patients with DAD due to non-pulmonary causes; and the Control group (n = 16), consisting of patients with non-pulmonary causes of death. Immunohistochemistry and image analysis were used to quantify, in the parenchyma and small airways, several immune cell markers. RESULTS: Both DAD groups had higher expression of neutrophils and macrophages in parenchyma and small airways. However, there was a higher expression of CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T lymphocytes, CD83\u002B dendritic cells, granzyme A\u002B and natural killer \u002B cell density in the lung parenchyma of the H1N1 group (p \u003C 0.05). In the small airways, there was a lower cell density of tryptase \u002B mast cells and dendritic \u002B cells and an increase of IL-17 in both DAD groups (p \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSION: DAD due to viral A(H1N1)pdm09 is associated with a cytotoxic inflammatory phenotype, with partially divergent responses in the parenchyma relative to the small airways. In non-viral DAD, main immune cell alterations were found at the small airway level, reinforcing the role of the small airways in the pathogenesis of the exudative phase of DAD.

We evaluated the utility of the FRIDU during 1 year of operation. We analyzed 1,562 patients who were hospitalized after FRIDU screening between August 2015 and July 2016. The level of isolation recommended during their screening at the FRIDU was compared with the level deemed appropriate given their final diagnosis. Of the 1,562 patients screened at the FRIDU, 198 (13%) were isolated, 194 (12%) were reverse isolated, and 1,170 (75%) were not isolated. While hospitalized, 97 patients (6%) were confirmed to have a contagious disease requiring isolation, such as tuberculosis; 207 patients (13%) were confirmed to be immunocompromised and to require reverse isolation, mainly due to neutropenia; and the remaining 1,258 patients (81%) did not require isolation. The correlation coefficient for isolation consistency was 0.565 (P \u003C 0.001). The sensitivity and negative predictive value of FRIDU screening for diagnosing contagious disease requiring isolation are 76% and 98%, respectively. No serious nosocomial outbreaks of contagious diseases occurred. During FRIDU screening, 114 patients were admitted to the resuscitation zone due to clinical instability, and three of these patients died. The initial isolation levels resulting from FRIDU screening were moderately well correlated with the isolation levels required by the final diagnosis, demonstrating the utility of pre-hospitalization screening units. However, the risks of deterioration during the screening process remain challenges.","publish_time":"2017-07-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kang, Jun Sik; Jhun, Byung Woo; Yoon, Hee; Lim, Seong Mi; Ko, Eunsil; Park, Joo Hyun; Hwang, Sung Yeon; Lee, Se Uk; Lee, Tae Rim; Cha, Won Chul; Shin, Tae Gun; Sim, Min Seob; Jo, Ik Joon","journal":"J Korean Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8946e4b778ae5312b4db84cd75b68848c39a3a93.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5546975.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5546975/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzY1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["Samsung Medical Center"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","level of isolation","reverse isolation","isolation consistency","screening process","initial isolation levels","negative predictive value of FRIDU screening","utility of pre-hospitalization screening units","final diagnosis","serious nosocomial outbreaks of contagious diseases","febrile respiratory infectious disease unit","negative pressure ventilation system","Samsung Medical Center","emergency department","resuscitation zone","sensitivity","neutropenia","clinical instability","risks of deterioration","challenges","correlation coefficient","tuberculosis","year of operation"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: An entire population-based epidemiological study was conducted. Data collection was based on the Child Death Reporting Card of the Beijing Under-5 Mortality Rate Surveillance Network. Trends in mortality and leading causes of death were analysed using the \u03C7(2) test and SPSS 19.0 software. An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was fitted to forecast U5MRs between 2016 and 2020 using the EViews 8.0 software. RESULTS: Mortality in neonates, infants and children aged under 5 years decreased by 84.06%, 80.04% and 80.17% from 1992 to 2015, respectively. However, the U5MR increased by 7.20% from 2013 to 2015. Birth asphyxia, congenital heart disease, preterm/low birth weight and other congenital abnormalities comprised the top five causes of death. The greatest, most rapid reduction was that of pneumonia by 92.26%, with an annual average rate of reduction of 10.53%. The distribution of causes of death differed among children of different ages. Accidental asphyxia and sepsis were among the top five causes of death in children aged 28 days to 1 year and accident was among the top five causes in children aged 1\u20134 years. The U5MRs in Beijing are projected to be 2.88\u2030, 2.87\u2030, 2.90\u2030, 2.97\u2030 and 3.09\u2030 for the period 2016\u20132020, based on the predictive model. CONCLUSION: Beijing has made considerable progress in reducing U5MRs from 1992 to 2015. However, U5MRs could show a slight upward trend from 2016 to 2020. Future considerations for child healthcare include the management of birth asphyxia, congenital heart disease, preterm/low birth weight and other congenital abnormalities. Specific preventative measures should be implemented for children of various age groups.","publish_time":"2017-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cao, Han; Wang, Jing; Li, Yichen; Li, Dongyang; Guo, Jin; Hu, Yifei; Meng, Kai; He, Dian; Liu, Bin; Liu, Zheng; Qi, Han; Zhang, Ling","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b1684f4f6c7966725627602b6771c2f1224df89.json; document_parses/pdf_json/53c794c9dd0ae2b845a8be57742e1b74fa0f86d6.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5731445d010b69d663005de6dac188fe26b9c120.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5623503.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5623503/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzcxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Beijing","China"],"keyphrases":["U5MRs","leading causes of death","distribution of causes","congenital abnormalities","Beijing Under-","mortality rates","years","low birth weight","congenital heart disease","management of birth asphyxia","children of different ages","Child Death Reporting Card","Mortality Rate Surveillance Network","children of various age groups","Accidental asphyxia","trends","software","period","annual average rate of reduction","child healthcare","rapid reduction","predictive model","autoregressive integrated moving average","ARIMA","infants","entire population","considerable progress","neonates","days","Future considerations","epidemiological study","test","SPSS","CONCLUSION","slight upward trend","RESULTS","sepsis","Specific preventative measures","Data collection","METHODS","pneumonia","OBJECTIVES","China","EViews"],"language":"en"},

A vaccine that either reduces susceptibility to infection or reduces shedding of prions by infected animals, or a combination of both, could be of benefit for disease control. The development of such a vaccine is challenged by the unique nature of prion diseases and the requirement for formulation and delivery in an oral format for application in wildlife settings. To address the unique nature of prions, our group targets epitopes, termed disease specific epitopes (DSEs), whose exposure for antibody binding depends on disease-associated misfolding of PrP(C) into PrP(Sc). Here, a DSE corresponding to the rigid loop (RL) region, which was immunogenic following parenteral vaccination, was translated into an oral vaccine. This vaccine consists of a replication-incompetent human adenovirus expressing a truncated rabies glycoprotein G recombinant fusion with the RL epitope (hAd5:tgG-RL). Oral immunization of white-tailed deer with hAd5:tgG-RL induced PrP(Sc)-specific systemic and mucosal antibody responses with an encouraging safety profile in terms of no adverse health effects nor prolonged vector shedding. By building upon proven strategies of formulation for wildlife vaccines, these efforts generate a particular PrP(Sc)-specific oral vaccine for CWD as well as providing a versatile platform, in terms of carrier protein and biological vector, for generation of other oral, peptide-based CWD vaccines.","publish_time":"2017-10-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Taschuk, Ryan; Scruten, Erin; Woodbury, Murray; Cashman, Neil; Potter, Andrew; Griebel, Philip; Tikoo, Suresh K.; Napper, Scott","journal":"Prion","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1cfa24297a36bcd526ad00635440d59bce705a17.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5639826.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5639826/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzcyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DSE","RL","CWD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specific oral vaccine","disease management","oral format","disease control","termed disease specific epitopes","disease-associated misfolding of PrP","tgG-RL induced PrP","RL epitope","particular PrP","hAd5","shedding of prions","wildlife vaccines","Oral immunization of white-tailed deer","unique nature of prions","ongoing epidemic of chronic wasting disease","peptide-based CWD vaccines","prolonged vector shedding","antibody binding","biological vector","wildlife settings","unique nature of prion diseases","group targets epitopes","mucosal antibody responses","terms of carrier protein","proven strategies of formulation","truncated rabies glycoprotein G recombinant fusion","adverse health effects","encouraging safety profile","region","need","cervid populations","DSEs","replication-incompetent human adenovirus","efforts","novel approaches","requirement","application","generation","delivery","exposure","immunogenic following parenteral vaccination","versatile platform","rigid loop","infected animals","infection","susceptibility","combination","benefit","development"],"language":"en"},

Pathogens in mucus (artificial mucus or sputum samples) were not completely inactivated by alcohol-based disinfectants (survival rate \u003E10%), suggesting that the alcohol-based disinfectants were ineffective. Pathogen survival and mucus viscosity were strongly correlated (correlation coefficient \u003E0.7, P \u003C 0.001).

Pronase treatment of sputum samples significantly decreased sputum viscosity and increased the disinfectant effect (P \u003C 0.001 for all).

The collected evidence suggests that the Y chromosome influences immune and inflammatory responses in men, translating into genetically programmed susceptibility to diseases with a strong immune component. Phylogenetic studies reveal that carriers of a common European lineage of the Y chromosome (haplogroup I) possess increased risk of coronary artery disease. This occurs amidst upregulation of inflammation and suppression of adaptive immunity in this Y lineage, as well as inferior outcomes in human immunodeficiency virus infection. From structural analysis and experimental data, the UTY (Ubiquitously Transcribed Tetratricopeptide Repeat Containing, Y-Linked) gene is emerging as a promising candidate underlying the associations between Y-chromosome variants and the immunity-driven susceptibility to complex disease.

Multipartite viruses have genomes segmented in pieces enclosed in different capsids that are independently transmitted. Since all segments have to meet in the host for complementation and completion of the viral cycle, multipartite viruses are bound to fight the loss of genomic information. While this is an obvious disadvantage of this strategy, no consensus on its actual advantages has been reached. In this review we present an exhaustive summary of all multipartite viruses described to date. Based on evidence, we discuss possible mechanistic and evolutionary origins of different groups, as well as their mutual relationships. We argue that the ubiquitous interactions of viruses with other unrelated viruses and with subviral elements might be regarded as a plausible first step towards multipartitism. In agreement with the view of the Virosphere as a deeply entangled network of gene sharing, we contend that the power of multipartitism relies on its dynamical and opportunistic nature, because it enables immediate adaptive responses to environmental changes.

The study aimed to evaluate impact of influenza vaccine on childhood otitis media. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included data for 803,592 children (\u003C10 years old) recorded in Taiwan\u2019s National Health Insurance Research Database. AOM incidence and tympanostomy tube insertion incidence in each influenza season before and after the introduction of traditional injectable trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) were compared using the Poisson regression analysis to estimate the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: In children \u003C 2 years old, the age group eligible for free influenza vaccination, there was a significant reduction in seasonal AOM incidence after TIV introduction in 2004 (from 98.4 episodes/1000 person-seasons [95% CI: 96.4\u2013100.5] to 66.1 episodes/1000 person-seasons [95% CI: 64\u201368.1]). In addition, with the increased vaccine coverage rate, the outpatient visits for AOM in the influenza season of 2005 and 2006 were significantly lower than that in 2004 (IRR = 0.85 and 0.80, respectively, p \u003C 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: A significant reduction in primary care consultations for children \u003C2 years old was observed after the introduction of the TIV in Taiwan in 2004. With the increased vaccine coverage, there was an additional decline in 2005 and 2006. In addition of the direct protection provided by the vaccination, we believe that TIV may have induced some herd immunity that further contributed to the reduction in influenza attack rates and the rates of associated AOM in that age group. These reductions were observed only in vaccine-eligible children, while older children, who were not enrolled in the influenza vaccination program during the study period, have experienced increases in the AOM incidence during the 2004\u20132006 period compared to the 2000\u20132003 period.","publish_time":"2018-01-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Pei-Wen; Huang, Chien-Chia; Chao, Wei-Chieh; Sun, Chi-Chin; Chiu, Cheng-Hsun; Lee, Ta-Jen","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/432bff7a22efb0fd2d87b162ce6da91120d28cfe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5755876.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5755876/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzgzOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Health Insurance Research Database","TIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza season","impact of influenza vaccine","vaccine-eligible children","seasonal AOM incidence","free influenza vaccination","influenza vaccination program","TIV introduction","older children","influenza attack rates","rates of associated AOM","introduction of traditional injectable trivalent influenza vaccine","years old","study period","increased vaccine coverage rate","incidence rate ratios","significant reduction","age group eligible","tympanostomy tube insertion incidence","person-seasons","episodes","childhood otitis media","retrospective cohort study","Acute otitis media","preschool-age population","outpatient visits","primary care consultations","Taiwan\u2019s National Health Insurance Research Database","IRRs","experienced increases","preceding viral respiratory tract infection","Poisson regression analysis","common infectious disease","PURPOSE","confidence intervals","METHODS","direct protection","CONCLUSIONS","additional decline","herd immunity","CIs","RESULTS","reductions"],"language":"en"},

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are key mediators of host-pathogen interactions. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of viral hepatitis in humans. Recent reports also demonstrate its extrahepatic manifestations in the brain. Toward understanding the molecular details of HEV life cycle, we screened human liver and fetal brain cDNA libraries to identify the host interaction partners of proteins encoded by genotype 1 HEV and constructed the virus-host PPI network. Analysis of the network indicated a role of HEV proteins in modulating multiple host biological processes such as stress and immune responses, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, energy and iron metabolism, and protein translation. Further investigations revealed the presence of multiple host translation regulatory factors in the viral translation/replication complex. Depletion of host translation factors such as eIF4A2, eIF3A, and RACK1 significantly reduced the viral replication, whereas eIF2AK4 depletion had no effect. These findings highlight the ingenuity of the pathogen in manipulating the host machinery to its own benefit, a clear understanding of which is essential for the identification of strategic targets and development of specific antivirals against HEV. IMPORTANCE Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a pathogen that is transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Owing to the lack of an efficient laboratory model, the life cycle of the virus is poorly understood. During the course of infection, interactions between the viral and host proteins play essential roles, a clear understanding of which is essential to decode the life cycle of the virus. In this study, we identified the direct host interaction partners of all HEV proteins and generated a PPI network. Our functional analysis of the HEV-human PPI network reveals a role of HEV proteins in modulating multiple host biological processes such as stress and immune responses, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, energy and iron metabolism, and protein translation. Further investigations revealed an essential role of several host factors in HEV replication. Collectively, the results from our study provide a vast resource of PPI data from HEV and its human host and identify the molecular components of the viral translation/replication machinery.","publish_time":"2018-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Subramani, Chandru; Nair, Vidya P.; Anang, Saumya; Mandal, Sukhen Das; Pareek, Madhu; Kaushik, Nidhi; Srivastava, Akriti; Saha, Sudipto; Shalimar,; Nayak, Baibaswata; Ranjith-Kumar, C.

Consequently, there is remarkable little crosstalk between the different systems in the fluid phase.

These include clinical settings where massive amounts of proteolytic enzymes are released from tissues, e.g., during pancreatitis or post-traumatic tissue damage, resulting in consumption of the natural substrates of the specific proteases and the available protease inhibitor. Another example of cascade system dysregulation is disseminated intravascular coagulation, with canonical activation of all cascade systems of the blood, also leading to specific substrate and protease inhibitor elimination.

The aim of the study was to test whether obesity (BMI \u2265 30 kg/m(2)) is one of the risk factors underlying frequent RTIs in the German adult population. METHODS: We recruited 1455 individuals between 18 to 70 years from a cross-sectional survey on airway infections in Germany and invited them to self-report in diaries incident RTIs experienced during three consecutive winter/spring seasons. RTIs reported in these 18 months and summary measures adding-up individual RTIs were the outcomes of interest. RESULTS: Compared to individuals with normal weight, obese individuals reported a consistently higher frequency of upper and lower RTIs and predominantly fell in the upper 10% group of a diary sumscore adding-up 10 different RTI symptoms over time. Obesity was associated both with lower RTIs ((adjusted)OR = 2.02, 95%CI = 1.36\u20133.00) and upper RTIs ((adjusted)OR = 1.55, 95%CI = 1.22\u20131.96).

The same animals presented with reduced lung and BALF TNF-\u03B1 and IL-1\u03B2 expression in comparison with vehicle controls (p \u003C 0.05). Additionally, incubation with either EAFPg or kaempferol (100 \u03BCg/ml) reduced NO production and cytokine gene expression in cultured LPS-treated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Overall, these results demonstrate that the prophylactic treatment with EAFPg attenuates acute lung inflammation. We suggest this fraction may be useful in treating ALI.","publish_time":"2018-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pinheiro, Aruan\u00E3 Joaquim Matheus Costa Rodrigues; Gon\u00E7alves, Jaciara S\u00E1; Dourado, \u00C1dylla Wilenna Alves; de Sousa, Eduardo Martins; Brito, Natilene Mesquita; Silva, Lanna Karinny; Batista, Marisa Cristina Aranha; de S\u00E1, Joicy Cortez; Monteiro, Cinara Regina Arag\u00E3o Vieira; Fernandes, Elizabeth Soares; Monteiro-Neto, Val\u00E9rio; Campbell, Lee Ann; Zago, Patr\u00EDcia Maria Wiziack; Lima-Neto, Lidio Gon\u00E7alves","journal":"J Immunol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/512ad31f56a7be38e686f3864431191b0b9f659e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5838491.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5838491/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzkxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ALI"],"organizations":["BALF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EAFPg","cultured LPS","LPS challenge","reduced lung","LPS-stimulated RAW","acute lung injury","acute lung inflammation","LPS intranasal instillation","lung samples","lungs of ALI mice","Vehicle-treated mice","cytokine production","anti-inflammatory effects","kaempferol effects","vehicle controls","acute peritonitis","macrophages","Animals","pomegranate leaf hydroalcoholic extract","cytokine gene expression","Male Swiss mice","reduced cell accumulation","\u03B2 expression","hydroalcoholic extract of Punica granatum","mouse model","BALF TNF-\u03B1","ethyl acetate fraction","rat model of lipopolysaccharide","comparison","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","different doses","prophylactic treatment","neutrophils","collagen deposition","dexamethasone","leaves","\u03BCg","results","analysis","incubation","Pretreatment"],"language":"en"},

Chimpanzees and gorillas were, themselves, infected with SIV after virus spillover from African monkeys. During spillover events, SIV is thought to require adaptation to the new host species. The host barriers that drive viral adaptation have predominantly been attributed to restriction factors, rather than cofactors (host proteins exploited to promote viral replication). Here, we consider the role of one cofactor, RanBP2, in providing a barrier that drove viral genome evolution during SIV spillover events. RanBP2 (also known as Nup358) is a component of the nuclear pore complex known to facilitate nuclear entry of HIV-1. Our data suggest that transmission of SIV from monkeys to chimpanzees, and then from chimpanzees to gorillas, both coincided with changes in the viral capsid that allowed interaction with RanBP2 of the new host species. However, human RanBP2 subsequently provided no barrier to the zoonotic transmission of SIV from chimpanzees or gorillas, indicating that chimpanzee- and gorilla-adapted SIVs are pre-adapted to humans in this regard. Our observations are in agreement with RanBP2 driving virus evolution during cross-species transmissions of SIV, particularly in the transmissions to and between great ape species.","publish_time":"2018-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meyerson, Nicholas R.; Warren, Cody J.; Vieira, Daniel A.

The recognition of these peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes by T-cells is the cornerstone of cellular immunity, enabling the elimination of infected or tumoral cells. T-cell-based immunotherapies against cancer, which leverage this mechanism, can greatly benefit from structural analyses of pMHC complexes. Several attempts have been made to use molecular docking for such analyses, but pMHC structure remains too challenging for even state-of-the-art docking tools. To overcome these limitations, we describe the use of an incremental meta-docking approach for structural prediction of pMHC complexes. Previous methods applied in this context used specific constraints to reduce the complexity of this prediction problem, at the expense of generality. Our strategy makes no assumption and can potentially be used to predict binding modes for any pMHC complex. Our method has been tested in a re-docking experiment, reproducing the binding modes of 25 pMHC complexes whose crystal structures are available. This study is a proof of concept that incremental docking strategies can lead to general geometry prediction of pMHC complexes, with potential applications for immunotherapy against cancer or infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2018-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Antunes, Dinler A.; Devaurs, Didier; Moll, Mark; Liz\u00E9e, Gregory; Kavraki, Lydia E.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec7d9f4fbe48d9c257de95f8a18cc111de8c613c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5847594.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5847594/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzkyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["structural prediction of pMHC complexes","pMHC structure","structural analyses of pMHC complexes","general geometry prediction of pMHC complexes","molecular docking","incremental docking strategies","binding modes","re-docking experiment","state-of-the-art docking tools","incremental meta-docking approach","prediction problem","cancer","T-cells","use","capable of binding peptides","peptide-MHC","tumoral cells","histocompatibility complex","cell surface","immunotherapy","potential applications","proof of concept","elimination of infected","cornerstone of cellular immunity","context","complexity","intracellular proteins","based immunotherapies","specific constraints","infectious diseases","crystal structures","class","Previous methods","expense of generality","study","recognition","mechanism","strategy","assumption","attempts","limitations"],"language":"en"},

Here, we identify a possible signature of \u201Cdual-coding,\u201D namely extensive adenine (A) enrichment at bacterial CDS fourth sites. In 99.07% of studied bacterial genomes, fourth site A use is greater than expected given genomic A-starting codon use. Arguing for nucleotide level selection, A-starting serine and arginine second codons are heavily utilized when compared with their non-A starting synonyms. Several models have the ability to explain some of this trend. In part, A-enrichment likely reduces 5\u2032 mRNA stability, promoting translation initiation. However T/U, which may also reduce stability, is avoided. Further, \u002B1 frameshifts on the initiating ATG encode a stop codon (TGA) provided A is the fourth residue, acting either as a frameshift \u201Ccatch and destroy\u201D or a frameshift stop and adjust mechanism and hence implicated in translation initiation. Consistent with both, genomes lacking TGA stop codons exhibit weaker fourth site A-enrichment. Sequences lacking a Shine\u2013Dalgarno sequence and those without upstream leader genes, that may be more error prone during initiation, have greater utilization of A, again suggesting a role in initiation. The frameshift correction model is consistent with the notion that many genomic features are error-mitigation factors and provides the first evidence for site-specific out of frame stop codon selection. We conjecture that the NTG universal start codon may have evolved as a consequence of TGA being a stop codon and the ability of NTGA to rapidly terminate or adjust a ribosome.","publish_time":"2017-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abrahams, Liam; Hurst, Laurence D","journal":"Mol Biol Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8171299fc5073dfe98c4c56d5760ccb5f802f8f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5850271.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5850271/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzkzMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ATG","TGA","NTG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stop codon","codon selection","codon use","enrichment","translation initiation","coding sequences","consequence of TGA","codons","bacterial genomes","NTG universal start codon","nucleotide level selection","starting synonyms","frameshift correction model","dual-coding","genomic features","error prone","bacterial CDS","greater utilization","mRNA stability","ability of NTGA","error-mitigation factors","notion","optimal protein functioning","Dalgarno sequence","CDSs","initiating ATG","evidence","upstream leader genes","serine","extensive adenine","arginine","possible signature","Shine","DNA levels","sites","mechanism","frameshifts","models","trend","residue","role","ribosome"],"language":"en"},

One example of such initiatives is Dr. Morrison\u2019s Swine Health Monitoring Project, a nation-wide monitoring program for swine diseases including the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). PRRS has been extensively reported as a seasonal disease in the U.S., with predictable peaks that start in fall and are extended through the winter season. However, formal time series analysis stratified by geographic region has never been conducted for this important disease across the U.S. The main objective of this study was to use approximately seven years of PRRS incidence data in breeding swine herds to conduct time-series analysis in order to describe the temporal patterns of PRRS outbreaks at the farm level for five major swine-producing states across the U.S. including the states of Minnesota, Iowa, North Carolina, Nebraska and Illinois. Data was aggregated retrospectively at the week level for the number of herds containing animals actively shedding PRRS virus. Basic descriptive statistics were conducted followed by autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modelling, conducted separately for each of the above-mentioned states. Results showed that there was a difference in the nature of PRRS seasonality among states. Of note, when comparing states, the typical seasonal pattern previously described for PRRS could only be detected for farms located in the states of Minnesota, North Carolina and Nebraska. For the other two states, seasonal peaks every six months were detected within a year. In conclusion, we showed that epidemic patterns are not homogeneous across the U.S, with major peaks of disease occurring through the year. These findings highlight the importance of coordinating alternative control strategies in different regions considering the prevailing epidemiological patterns.","publish_time":"2018-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arruda, Andr\u00E9ia Gon\u00E7alves; Vilalta, Carles; Puig, Pere; Perez, Andres; Alba, Anna","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0e284c9dd2ca500ae5f10d04d0639d0f8779a16.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5882168.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5882168/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozk2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Morrison"],"organizations":["Swine Health Monitoring Project","PRRS"],"locations":["North America","U.S.","Minnesota","Iowa","Nebraska","Illinois","North Carolina"],"keyphrases":["swine diseases","states of Minnesota","major swine","above-mentioned states","swine producers","seasonal disease","breeding swine herds","temporal patterns of PRRS outbreaks","shedding PRRS virus","nature of PRRS seasonality","major peaks of disease","seasonal peaks","years of PRRS incidence data","North Carolina","important disease","Morrison\u2019s Swine Health Monitoring Project","monitoring diseases of economic importance","voluntary disease control programs","time-series analysis","North America","epidemic patterns","Nebraska","predictable peaks","formal time series analysis","nation-wide monitoring program","prevailing epidemiological patterns","typical seasonal pattern","number of herds","farm level","week level","alternative control strategies","different regions","autoregressive integrated moving average","ARIMA","animals","initiatives","order","Iowa","geographic region","respiratory syndrome","modelling","difference","Industry","months","main objective","Basic descriptive statistics","study","fall","Illinois","farms","example","findings","conclusion","winter season","Results","note"],"language":"en"},

Recent studies found that NMC was rarely performed in Thailand and that most Thai health professionals did not recognize that NMC could reduce the risk of HIV infection and would not want NMC services in their hospitals. This study explored the thoughts and concerns of Thai government health staff regarding the introduction of NMC in government health facilities as a public health measure. METHODS: In-depth interviews with physicians, nurses and physician administrators from four different levels of government hospitals in four provinces representing 4 regions of Thailand were conducted after provision of education regarding the benefits and risks of NMC. Interviews were audio recorded and analyzed using Atlas.ti software to develop themes. RESULTS: Six themes emerged from the data of 42 respondents: understanding of the benefits of NMC; risks of NMC; need for a pilot project; need for staff training and hospital readiness; need for parental/family education; and need for public awareness educational campaign. Major concerns included possible medical complications of NMC, infringement of child rights, and lack of understanding from staff and parents. The respondents emphasized the need for a clear policy, proper training of staff, financial and equipment support, and piloting NMC rollout before this measure could be fully implemented. CONCLUSIONS: Thai health professionals who took part in this study expressed several concerns if NMC had to be performed in their health care facilities. There is significant preparation that needs to be done before NMC can be introduced in the country.

But it remains unclear whether this is being caused by worries over potential adversities due to the pandemic, or the toll of experiencing adverse events. Aims: To explore the time-varying longitudinal relationship between (i) worries about adversity, and (ii) experience of adversity, and both anxiety and depression and test the moderating role of socio-economic position. Methods: Data from 35,784 UK adults in the UCL COVID -19 Social Study (a panel study collecting data weekly during the Covid-19 pandemic) were analysed from 01/04/2020-28/04/2020. The sample was well-stratified and weighted to population proportions of gender, age, ethnicity, education and geographical location. Fixed effects regression was used to explore within-person variation over time. Results: Cumulative number of worries and experience of adversities were both related to higher levels of anxiety and depression. Number of worries were associated more with anxiety than depression, but number of experiences were equally related to anxiety and depression. Individuals of lower socio-economic position were more negatively affected psychologically by adverse experiences. Conclusions: Measures over the first few weeks of lockdown in the UK appear to have been insufficient at reassuring people given we are still seeing clear associations with poor mental health both for cumulative worries and also for a range of specific worries relating to finance, access to essentials, personal safety and COVID-19. Interventions are required that both seek to prevent adverse events (e.g. redundancies) and that reassure individuals and support adaptive coping strategies.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wright, L.; Steptoe, A.; Fancourt, D.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fee0280bfdc55ece2946b659b5cfd98a84d77dc8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.14.20101717v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs5ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","Social Study"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cumulative worries","depression","Cumulative number of worries","adverse effects","adverse events","adverse experiences","range of specific worries","UCL COVID","number of experiences","experience of adversities","higher levels of anxiety","experience of adversity","pandemic","time","Individuals of lower socio-economic position","poor mental health","panel study","Social Study","UK adults","data weekly","potential adversities","moderating role of socio-economic position","Fixed effects regression","ethnicity","age","access","finance","population proportions of gender","education","essentials","personal safety","clear associations","geographical location","adaptive coping strategies","Methods","longitudinal relationship","toll","redundancies","Results","reassuring people","weeks of lockdown","Measures","sample","person variation","Conclusions","Background","Interventions"],"language":"en"},

The mechanism for the massive vascular leakage associated with HPS is poorly understood; however, dysregulation of components of the immune response is often suggested as a possible cause. Alveolar macrophages are found in the alveoli of the lung and represent the first line of defense to many airborne pathogens. To determine whether alveolar macrophages play a role in HPS pathogenesis, alveolar macrophages were depleted in an adult rodent model of HPS that closely resembles human HPS. Syrian hamsters were treated, intratracheally, with clodronate-encapsulated liposomes or control liposomes and were then challenged with ANDV. Treatment with clodronate-encapsulated liposomes resulted in significant reduction in alveolar macrophages, but depletion did not prevent pathogenesis or prolong disease. Depletion also did not significantly reduce the amount of virus in the lung of ANDV-infected hamsters but altered neutrophil recruitment, MIP-1\u03B1 and MIP-2 chemokine expression, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in hamster bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid early after intranasal challenge. These data demonstrate that alveolar macrophages may play a limited protective role early after exposure to aerosolized ANDV but do not directly contribute to hantavirus disease pathogenesis in the hamster model of HPS. IMPORTANCE Hantaviruses continue to cause disease worldwide for which there are no FDA-licensed vaccines, effective postexposure prophylactics, or therapeutics. Much of this can be attributed to a poor understanding of the mechanism of hantavirus disease pathogenesis. Hantavirus disease has long been considered an immune-mediated disease; however, by directly manipulating the Syrian hamster model, we continue to eliminate individual immune cell types. As the most numerous immune cells present in the respiratory tract, alveolar macrophages are poised to defend against hantavirus infection, but those antiviral responses may also contribute to hantavirus disease. Here, we demonstrate that, like in our prior T and B cell studies, alveolar macrophages neither prevent hantavirus infection nor cause hantavirus disease. While these studies reflect pathogenesis in the hamster model, they should help us rule out specific cell types and prompt us to consider other potential mechanisms of disease in an effort to improve the outcome of human HPS.","publish_time":"2016-06-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hammerbeck, Christopher D.; Brocato, Rebecca L.; Bell, Todd M.; Schellhase, Christopher W.; Mraz, Steven R.; Queen, Laurie A.; Hooper, Jay W.","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d9b665ff94e800c03f3051567312a3921a76e81.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4936146.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4936146/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPS","ANDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Alveolar macrophages","HPS pathogenesis","mechanism of hantavirus disease pathogenesis","hantavirus infection","hamster model of HPS","immune-mediated disease","hantavirus pulmonary syndrome","potential mechanisms of disease","Syrian hamster model","outcome of human HPS","adult rodent model of HPS","lung of ANDV","individual immune cell types","immune response","aerosolized ANDV","clodronate-encapsulated liposomes","hamster bronchoalveolar lavage","control liposomes","MIP","B cell studies","specific cell types","numerous immune cells","Syrian hamsters","depletion","possible cause","lethal vascular leak syndrome","massive vascular leakage","vascular endothelial growth factor","infected hamsters","Andes virus","limited protective role","levels","VEGF","humans","BAL","chemokine expression","fluid","effective postexposure prophylactics","significant reduction","neutrophil recruitment","respiratory tract","prompt","effort","FDA-licensed vaccines","prior T","antiviral responses","line of defense","poor understanding","airborne pathogens","intranasal challenge","therapeutics","dysregulation of components","Treatment","alveoli","IMPORTANCE Hantaviruses","data"],"language":"en"},

Background The new influenza virus A/H1N1 (2009), identified in mid\u20102009, rapidly spread over the world. Estimating the transmissibility of this new virus was a public health priority. Methods We reviewed all studies presenting estimates of the serial interval or generation time and the reproduction number of the A/H1N1 (2009) virus infection. Results Thirteen studies documented the serial interval from household or close\u2010contact studies, with overall mean 3 days (95% CI: 2\u00B74, 3\u00B76); taking into account tertiary transmission reduced this estimate to 2\u00B76 days. Model\u2010based estimates were more variable, from 1\u00B79 to 6 days. Twenty\u2010four studies reported reproduction numbers for community\u2010based epidemics at the town or country level. The range was 1\u00B72\u20133\u00B71, with larger estimates reported at the beginning of the pandemic. Accounting for under\u2010reporting in the early period of the pandemic and limiting variation because of the choice of the generation time interval, the reproduction number was between 1\u00B72 and 2\u00B73 with median 1\u00B75. Discussion The serial interval of A/H1N1 (2009) flu was typically short, with mean value similar to the seasonal flu. The estimates of the reproduction number were more variable. Compared with past influenza pandemics, the median reproduction number was similar (1968) or slightly smaller (1889, 1918, 1957).","publish_time":"2011-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bo\u00EBlle, Pierre\u2010Yves; Ansart, S\u00E9verine; Cori, Anne; Valleron, Alain\u2010Jacques","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/afcc1a28b96721fb9f9544943254ab73d656b635.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4942041.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4942041/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzIw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H1N1","median reproduction number","influenza virus pandemic","serial interval","new influenza virus","reproduction numbers","new virus","based estimates","days","generation time interval","contact studies","virus infection","larger estimates","past influenza pandemics","mean value similar","based epidemics","overall mean","seasonal flu","Transmission parameters","account tertiary transmission","community","household","town","early period","choice","under\u2010reporting","variation","public health priority","country level","paper","Bo\u00EBlle P","Accounting","beginning","Model","review","Results","Respiratory Viruses","CI","transmissibility","Discussion","Methods","world","range"],"language":"en"},

This study analysed the response of F81 cells to CPV infection at successive infection time points by iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) during 60 h of infection and at selected time points post-infection were identified by an analysis of variance test and a two-tailed unpaired t test, respectively. DEPs with similar quantitative changes were clustered by hierarchical clustering and analysed by gene ontology enrichment, revealing that 12 h and 60 h post-infection were the optimal times to analyse the autonomous parvovirus replication and apoptosis processes, respectively.

Besides, a significantly enriched pathway suggests that the CPV-induced cytopathic effect was probably due to the deficiency of functional CFTR caused by CPV infection. This study uncovered the systemic changes in key cellular factors involved in CPV infection and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of the anti-cancer activity of CPV and the cytopathic effects induced by CPV infection.","publish_time":"2016-07-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Hang; Cheng, Yuening; Wang, Jianke; Lin, Peng; Yi, Li; Sun, Yaru; Ren, Jingqiang; Tong, Mingwei; Cao, Zhigang; Li, Jiawei; Deng, Jinliang; Cheng, Shipeng","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a51659a324f74a7cf16acd3b1180d203cab2b8d4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4942776.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4942776/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzIy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Differentially"],"organizations":["CPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CPV infection","h of infection","h post-infection","successive infection time points","different time points post-infection","selected time points post-infection","DEPs","anti-cancer activity of CPV","response of F81 cells","resources of host cells","Feline kidney F81 cells","cytopathic effects","study","similar quantitative changes","systemic changes","cytotoxic effects","quantitative proteomics","Canine parvovirus","enriched pathway","autonomous parvovirus replication","analysis of variance test","unpaired t test","disparate growing statuses","optimal times","key cellular factors","hierarchical clustering","iTRAQ","molecular mechanisms","gene ontology enrichment","apoptosis processes","deficiency of functional CFTR","network","TM","database","p53 regulation","Metacore","proteins"],"language":"en"},

Seven electronic databases and relevant resources were searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing patients using noninvasive ventilation at PIC window with those continuing receiving invasive ventilation. Retrieved citations were screened, risk of bias was assessed, and data were extracted by 2 independent review authors. Overall effect sizes were synthesized by using meta-analyses. Quality of evidence was rated by using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. A total of 17 trials involving 959 participants were included for this review. Compared with continuous invasive ventilation, noninvasive ventilation used at PIC window significantly reduced mortality, ventilator-associated pneumonia, weaning failures, reintubations, duration of invasive ventilation, total duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay (LOS) in intensive care unit, and LOS in hospital as well as hospital costs. Of these, mortality significantly decreased (risk ratio = 0.27, 95% confidence interval: 0.17\u20130.42, P \u003C 0.001) without significant heterogeneity (I(2) = 0%, P = 0.99). Quality of evidence regarding the 9 outcomes across the included studies was rated from moderate to low. Use of noninvasive ventilation at PIC window showed beneficial effects across identified trials for ARF in AECOPD patients. Considering the absence of high quality of available evidence and the uncertainty of long-term effect of this intervention, a weak recommendation for clinical practice was generated, and further well-designed and adequately powered RCTs are required to validate this conclusion.","publish_time":"2016-06-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peng, Le; Ren, Peng-Wei; Liu, Xue-Ting; Zhang, Chao; Zuo, Hong-Xia; Kang, De-Ying; Niu, Yu-Ming","journal":"Medicine (Baltimore)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c3068b22cb2cb50114316f9fed2738a943d2435.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4998464.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4998464/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozc30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PIC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["duration of invasive ventilation","safety of noninvasive ventilation","PIC window","continuous invasive ventilation","total duration of mechanical ventilation","Quality of evidence","AECOPD patients","ARF","LOS","identified trials","absence of high quality of available evidence","randomized controlled trials","reduced mortality","powered RCTs","risk ratio","hospital costs","risk of bias","included studies","acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","acute respiratory failure","pulmonary infection control","uncertainty of long-term effect","Overall effect sizes","independent review authors","ventilator-associated pneumonia","beneficial effects","reintubations","weaning failures","intervention","length of stay","intensive care unit","Assessment","Development","relevant resources","weak recommendation","clinical practice","Grading of Recommendations","outcomes","efficacy","Evaluation approach","confidence interval","electronic databases","participants","meta-analyses","study","significant heterogeneity","citations","aim","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Airborne diseases may spread rapidly as people visit different indoor environments and are in frequent contact with others. We constructed a simple indoor contact model for an ideal city with 7 million people and 3 million indoor spaces, and estimated the probability and duration of contact between any two individuals during one day. To do this, we used data from actual censuses, social behavior surveys, building surveys, and ventilation measurements in Hong Kong to define eight population groups and seven indoor location groups. Our indoor contact model was integrated with an existing epidemiological Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered (SEIR) model to estimate disease spread and with the Wells-Riley equation to calculate local infection risks, resulting in an integrated indoor transmission network model. This model was used to estimate the probability of an infected individual infecting others in the city and to study the disease transmission dynamics. We predicted the infection probability of each sub-population under different ventilation systems in each location type in the case of a hypothetical airborne disease outbreak, which is assumed to have the same natural history and infectiousness as smallpox. We compared the effectiveness of controlling ventilation in each location type with other intervention strategies. We conclude that increasing building ventilation rates using methods such as natural ventilation in classrooms, offices, and homes is a relatively effective strategy for airborne diseases in a large city.","publish_time":"2016-09-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gao, Xiaolei; Wei, Jianjian; Lei, Hao; Xu, Pengcheng; Cowling, Benjamin J.; Li, Yuguo","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1af9746ea8f584f3f58da4f59d6dba8185f8be4b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/702157bbe24c5eca7ab92f90cd717c3e56aa6ccf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5017609.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5017609/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzEwMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["simple indoor contact model","indoor location groups","natural ventilation","indoor spaces","Airborne diseases","integrated indoor transmission network model","ventilation measurements","different indoor environments","frequent contact","duration of contact","different ventilation systems","location type","large city","infection probability","airborne route","effectiveness of controlling ventilation","increasing building ventilation rates","large urban contact networks","hypothetical airborne disease outbreak","population groups","ideal city","people","disease transmission dynamics","Emerging diseases","sub-population","natural history","social behavior surveys","local infection risks","methods","case","Hong Kong","actual censuses","classrooms","Wells-Riley equation","effective strategy","homes","data","new vaccines","infected individual infecting","offices","infectiousness","smallpox","individuals","intervention strategies","SEIR","day"],"language":"en"},

Information on sapovirus infection of wildlife is limited and is currently lacking for any free-ranging wildlife species in Africa. By screening a large number of predominantly fecal samples (n = 631) obtained from five carnivore species in the Serengeti ecosystem, East Africa, sapovirus RNA was detected in the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta, family Hyaenidae), African lion (Panthera leo, family Felidae), and bat-eared fox (Otocyon megalotis, family Canidae), but not in golden or silver-backed jackals (Canis aureus and C. mesomelas, respectively, family Canidae). A phylogenetic analysis based on partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene sequences placed the sapovirus strains from African carnivores in a monophyletic group. Within this monophyletic group, sapovirus strains from spotted hyenas formed one independent sub-group, and those from bat-eared fox and African lion a second sub-group. The percentage nucleotide similarity between sapoviruses from African carnivores and those from other species was low (\u003C 70.4%). Long-term monitoring of sapovirus in a population of individually known spotted hyenas from 2001 to 2012 revealed: i) a relatively high overall infection prevalence (34.8%); ii) the circulation of several genetically diverse variants; iii) large fluctuations in infection prevalence across years, indicative of outbreaks; iv) no significant difference in the likelihood of infection between animals in different age categories. The likelihood of sapovirus infection decreased with increasing hyena group size, suggesting an encounter reduction effect, but was independent of socially mediated ano-genital contact, or the extent of the area over which an individual roamed.","publish_time":"2016-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Olarte-Castillo, Ximena A.; Hofer, Heribert; Goller, Katja V.; Martella, Vito; Moehlman, Patricia D.; East, Marion L.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/42e321eedba25d380ae44d16cdf0bbdeab83d665.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5035092.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5035092/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzExNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa","East Africa"],"keyphrases":["sapovirus RNA","likelihood of sapovirus infection","sapovirus infection of wildlife","sapovirus strains","genus Sapovirus","likelihood of infection","family Canidae","monophyletic group","African lion","African carnivores","family Hyaenidae","family Caliciviridae","family Felidae","independent sub-group","Long-term monitoring of sapovirus","spotted hyenas","wildlife species","increasing hyena group size","high overall infection prevalence","bat-eared fox","Crocuta crocuta","carnivore species","partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","large fluctuations","East Africa","large number","domestic animals","RdRp","gene sequences","Serengeti ecosystem","years","Otocyon megalotis","enteric viruses of humans","Panthera leo","jackals","encounter reduction effect","sapoviruses","mesomelas","population","percentage nucleotide similarity","indicative of outbreaks","mediated ano-genital contact","different age categories","silver","Canis aureus","fecal samples","diverse variants","significant difference","phylogenetic analysis","area","extent","Information","circulation"],"language":"en"},

Here we focused on the interplay between IAV and DExD-box RNA helicases (DDX), which play a key role in cellular RNA metabolism by remodeling RNA-RNA or RNA-protein complexes. We performed a targeted RNAi screen on 35 human DDX proteins to identify those involved in IAV life cycle. DDX19 was a major hit. In DDX19-depleted cells the accumulation of viral RNAs and proteins was delayed, and the production of infectious IAV particles was strongly reduced. We show that DDX19 associates with intronless, unspliced and spliced IAV mRNAs and promotes their nuclear export. In addition, we demonstrate an RNA-independent association between DDX19 and the viral polymerase, that is modulated by the ATPase activity of DDX19.

In the current study, an enzyme-based screening assay was used to identify effective HNE inhibitors from a number of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). Among them, a water extract of Ilex kaushue (IKWE) effectively inhibited HNE activity (IC(50), 11.37 \u00B1 1.59 \u03BCg/mL). Using bioactivity-guided fractionation, one new compound and 23 known compounds were identified.

In a cell-based assay, 3,5-DCQA not only directly reduced superoxide generation and elastase activity but also attenuated the Src family kinase (SRKs)/Vav signaling pathway in N-formyl-L-Met-L-Leu-L-Phe (fMLF)-stimulated human neutrophils. In an animal disease model, both 3,5-DCQA and standardized IKWE protected against lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI in mice, which provides support for their potential as candidates in the development of new therapeutic agents for neutrophilic inflammatory diseases.","publish_time":"2016-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Yu-Li; Hwang, Tsong-Long; Yu, Huang-Ping; Fang, Jia-You; Chong, Kowit Yu; Chang, Yao-Wen; Chen, Chun-Yu; Yang, Hsuan-Wu; Chang, Wen-Yi; Hsieh, Pei-Wen","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c1aa9863693a1415a8d3996023797c46e1b157d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e5fe71d8230e51b9cd2ce70386533910dfa152f5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5041076.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5041076/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzEzNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Compound","IKWE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inhibited HNE activity","development of HNE inhibitors","DCQA","effective HNE inhibitors","elastase activity","new compound","characteristic of ALI","lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI","human neutrophil elastase","cell-based assay","development of new therapeutic agents","standardized IKWE","inflammatory response","enzyme-based screening assay","severe respiratory disease","neutrophilic inflammatory diseases","stimulated human neutrophils","animal disease model","Vav","selective inhibitory effect","number of traditional Chinese medicines","SRKs","fMLF","high mortality rates","candidates","water extract of Ilex kaushue","Src family kinase","key role","N-formyl","pathway","TCMs","Phe","support","mice","Recent reports","superoxide generation","bioactivity-guided fractionation","efficient treatment strategy","current study","Acute lung injury","Met","Leu","potential","known compounds","dicaffeoylquinic acid","\u03BCg","\u03BCM"],"language":"en"},

Patients infected with macrolide-resistant M pneumoniae usually present with severe M pneumoniae pneumonia. The aim of this study was to identify indicators for whether children at an early stage of M pneumoniae infection develop mild or severe pneumonia. CASE SUMMARY: Herein, we retrospectively reviewed 2 pediatric cases caused by macrolide-resistant M pneumoniae, but with markedly different severity of pneumonia. First, we compared the clinical courses of the patients, then isolated the pathogens and tested their response to macrolides, then finally, carried out whole genome sequencing of these isolates. Despite the difference in clinical presentation of the infection, both isolates exhibited a high level of resistance to macrolide antibiotics. Analysis of clinical data showed that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate in blood samples of the patients in the early stages of disease varied greatly. Genome sequence analysis revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms mainly focused on adhesin P1, which is involved in the pathogenicity of M pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: The differences of erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the early stage of M pneumoniae pneumonia and mutations in P1 protein may help us to distinguish between severe or mild disease after infection with macrolide-resistant M pneumoniae. These findings could lead to the development of screening assays that will allow us to distinguish severe or mild M pneumoniae pneumonia early.","publish_time":"2016-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Shaoli; Sun, Hongmei; Liu, Fei; Feng, Yanling; Zhao, Hanqing; Xue, Guanhua; Yan, Chao","journal":"Medicine (Baltimore)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94bb822945a2854f5d541d3b83b5a100f1b7f50a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5044926.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5044926/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzE0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["pneumoniae pneumonia","pneumoniae infection","resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae","macrolide-resistant","severe pneumonia","Cases of macrolide","macrolide antibiotics","Patients","mild disease","early stages of disease","different severity of pneumonia","isolates","Analysis of clinical data","clinical presentation","clinical courses","differences of erythrocyte sedimentation rate","Genome sequence analysis","adhesin P1","P1 protein","pediatric cases","genome sequencing","single nucleotide polymorphisms","blood samples","high level of resistance","mutations","pathogens","indicators","CONCLUSION","children","BACKGROUND","development of screening assays","study","response","macrolides","CASE SUMMARY","aim","findings","pathogenicity","Asia"],"language":"en"},

The virus is endemic in over 120 countries, causing over 350 million infections per year. Dengue vaccine development is challenging because of the need to induce simultaneous protection against four antigenically distinct DENV serotypes and evidence that, under some conditions, vaccination can enhance disease due to specific immunity to the virus. While several live-attenuated tetravalent dengue virus vaccines display partial efficacy, it has been challenging to induce balanced protective immunity to all 4 serotypes. Instead of using whole-virus formulations, we are exploring the potentials for a particulate subunit vaccine, based on DENV E-protein displayed on nanoparticles that have been precisely molded using Particle Replication in Non-wetting Template (PRINT) technology. Here we describe immunization studies with a DENV2-nanoparticle vaccine candidate. The ectodomain of DENV2-E protein was expressed as a secreted recombinant protein (sRecE), purified and adsorbed to poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles of different sizes and shape. We show that PRINT nanoparticle adsorbed sRecE without any adjuvant induces higher IgG titers and a more potent DENV2-specific neutralizing antibody response compared to the soluble sRecE protein alone. Antigen trafficking indicate that PRINT nanoparticle display of sRecE prolongs the bio-availability of the antigen in the draining lymph nodes by creating an antigen depot. Our results demonstrate that PRINT nanoparticles are a promising platform for delivering subunit vaccines against flaviviruses such as dengue and Zika.","publish_time":"2016-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Metz, Stefan W.; Tian, Shaomin; Hoekstra, Gabriel; Yi, Xianwen; Stone, Michelle; Horvath, Katie; Miley, Michael J.; DeSimone, Joseph; Luft, Chris J.; de Silva, Aravinda M.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cbabbd687725e949c99a0a6f53f033128ea1aaca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5072622.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5072622/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzE5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Particle Replication"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRINT nanoparticles","tetravalent dengue virus vaccines","Dengue vaccine development","PRINT nanoparticle display of sRecE","PRINT nanoparticle adsorbed sRecE","dengue hemorrhagic fever","DENV E-protein","soluble sRecE protein","virus formulations","causative agent of dengue fever","DENV2-nanoparticle vaccine candidate","subunit vaccines","ectodomain of DENV2","distinct DENV serotypes","particulate subunit vaccine","Antigen trafficking","antigen depot","secreted recombinant protein","specific immunity","nanoparticles of different sizes","potent DENV2-specific neutralizing antibody response","balanced protective immunity","adjuvant","Non-wetting Template","PLGA","higher IgG titers","Particle Replication","promising platform","lactic-co-glycolic acid","draining lymph nodes","flaviviruses","partial efficacy","simultaneous protection","bio-availability","poly","need","disease","technology","evidence","potentials","immunization studies","conditions","vaccination","shape","countries","infections","Zika","results","year"],"language":"en"},

It also poses a public health concern when avian influenza subtypes infect humans, often with high mortality. Understanding viral genetic factors which positively contribute to influenza A virus (IAV) fitness \u2013 infectivity, spread and pathogenesis \u2013 is of great importance both for human and livestock health. PB1-F2 is a small accessory protein encoded by IAV and in mammalian hosts has been implicated in a wide range of functions that contribute to increased pathogenesis. In the avian host, the protein has been understudied despite high-level full-length conservation in avian IAV isolates, which is in contrast to the truncations of the PB1-F2 length frequently found in mammalian host isolates. Here we report that the presence of a full-length PB1-F2 protein, from a low pathogenicity H9N2 avian influenza virus, prolongs infectious virus shedding from directly inoculated chickens, thereby enhancing transmission of the virus by lengthening the transmission window to contact birds. As well as extending transmission, the presence of a full-length PB1-F2 suppresses pathogenicity evidenced by an increased minimum lethal dose in embryonated chicken eggs and increasing survival in directly infected birds when compared to a virus lacking an ORF for PB1-F2. We propose that there is a positive pressure to maintain a full-length functional PB1-F2 protein upon infection of avian hosts as it contributes to the effective transmission of IAV in the field.","publish_time":"2016-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"James, Joe; Howard, Wendy; Iqbal, Munir; Nair, Venugopal K.; Barclay, Wendy S.; Shelton, Holly","journal":"J Gen Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac8d2e900ee0c6d713d153782a530ddee6d606aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5078828.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5078828/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzIxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["full-length PB1-F2 protein","PB1-F2 length","full-length functional PB1-F2 protein","avian IAV isolates","avian influenza subtypes","low pathogenicity H9N2 avian influenza virus","infectious virus","infection of avian hosts","effective transmission of IAV","transmission window","small accessory protein","high-level full-length conservation","increased pathogenesis","mammalian hosts","mammalian host isolates","presence","livestock health","infected birds","public health concern","increased minimum lethal dose","embryonated chicken eggs","significant economic burden","poultry industry","humans","survival","fitness","geographical regions","great importance","truncations","infectivity","contrast","positive pressure","wide range of functions","field","chickens","ORF","viral genetic factors","high mortality"],"language":"en"},

Avian influenza is characterized by pronounced activation of the proinflammatory cytokine cascade, which perpetuates the inflammatory response, leading to persistent systemic inflammatory response syndrome and pulmonary infection in animals and humans. There are currently no specific treatment strategies for avian influenza. METHODS: We hypothesized that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) would have beneficial effects in the treatment of H9N2 AIV-induced acute lung injury in mice. Six- to 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice were infected intranasally with 1 \u00D7 10(4) MID(50) of A/HONG KONG/2108/2003 [H9N2 (HK)] H9N2 virus to induce acute lung injury. After 30 min, syngeneic MSCs were delivered through the caudal vein. Three days after infection, we measured the survival rate, lung weight, arterial blood gas, and cytokines in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum, and assessed pathological changes to the lungs. RESULTS: MSC administration significantly palliated H9N2 AIV-induced pulmonary inflammation by reducing chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines levels, as well as reducing inflammatory cell recruit into the lungs. Thus, H9N2 AIV-induced lung injury was markedly alleviated in mice treated with MSCs. Lung histopathology and arterial blood gas analysis were improved in mice with H9N2 AIV-induced lung injury following MSC treatment. CONCLUSIONS: MSC treatment significantly reduces H9N2 AIV-induced acute lung injury in mice and is associated with reduced pulmonary inflammation. These results indicate a potential role for MSC therapy in the treatment of clinical avian influenza.","publish_time":"2016-10-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yan; Xu, Jun; Shi, Weiqing; Chen, Cheng; Shao, Yan; Zhu, Limei; Lu, Wei; Han, XiaoDong","journal":"Stem Cell Res Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b1875d105e53a1353e51defa01d08154cbfb78b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5084318.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5084318/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzIyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MSC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of H9N2 AIV","H9N2 AIV-induced lung injury","acute lung injury","mice","palliated H9N2 AIV","H9N2 virus","MSC treatment","lung weight","Lung histopathology","treatment of clinical avian influenza","avian influenza virus","pulmonary infection","MSC therapy","MSC administration","specific treatment strategies","reduced pulmonary inflammation","RESULTS","syngeneic MSCs","lungs","humans","arterial blood gas analysis","inflammatory cell recruit","proinflammatory cytokines levels","persistent systemic inflammatory response syndrome","proinflammatory cytokine cascade","survival rate","serum","host range","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","chemokines","animals","activation","beneficial effects","species barriers","potential role","BALF","birds","mammals","mesenchymal stromal cells","HK","pathological changes","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","caudal vein","HONG KONG","METHODS","week-old C57BL","days"],"language":"en"},

Thus, Mint3 might represent one of the likely therapeutic targets for the treatment of severe influenza pneumonia without affecting host anti-viral defence through suppressing macrophage cytokine/chemokine production.","publish_time":"2016-11-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Uematsu, Takayuki; Fujita, Tomoko; Nakaoka, Hiroki J.; Hara, Toshiro; Kobayashi, Noritada; Murakami, Yoshinori; Seiki, Motoharu; Sakamoto, Takeharu","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65aad42469b115f496dac7fe5b1a74ee5bbbf93e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5121658.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5121658/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzI4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFV","ATP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFV infection","chemokine production","macrophages","treatment of severe influenza pneumonia","interferon production","ATP production","improved influenza pneumonia","IFV-infected lungs","host anti-viral defence","viral burden","chemokine levels","common cause of severe pneumonia","Influenza virus","severe pathologies","Mint3-deficient mice","X11 protein family member Mint3","resultant cytokine","Mint3 depletion attenuated NF-\u03BAB signalling","suppressing macrophage cytokine","host immune system","reduced inflammatory cytokines","Apba3","neutrophil infiltration","response","alteration","I\u03BAB\u03B1","lung pathogenesis","excessive activation","hypoxia inducible factor","glycolysis","type","roles","likely therapeutic targets","HIF","cellular energy sensor AMPK","Studies","immunity"],"language":"en"},

Campylobacter jejuni causes a form of gastroenteritis called campylobacteriosis. Campylobacter drug resistance is considered a serious threat. In order to better understand national and international research output on Campylobacter, we conducted this bibliometric overview of publications on Campylobacter. This study can be used to assess extent of interaction and response of researchers, food regulators, and health policy makers to global burden of campylobacateriosis. METHODS: Scopus database was used to retrieve publications with the following keywords (Campylobacter/campylobacteriosis, C. jejuni, C. coli). The study period was set from 2000 to 2015. All types of journal documents, excluding errata, were considered. Bibliometric indicators such as annual growth of publications, country contribution, international collaboration, and citation analysis were presented. The quality of retrieved data was indirectly assessed by Hirsch index and impact factor of journals. RESULTS: A total of 5522 documents were retrieved with median (Q1\u2013Q3) citations of 9 (2\u201323) and h-index of 113. Annual number of publications showed a fluctuating increase. The core leading journals were Applied and Environmental Microbiology journal and Journal of Food Protection with 246 (4.46%) publications for each. The USA (1309; 23.6%) was the most productive country while Danmarks Tekniske Universitet (150; 2.7%) was the most productive institution. Half of the top ten productive countries were European. France had the lowest percentage (33.5%) of articles with international collaboration while Netherlands (57.7%) had the highest percentage of articles with international collaboration. Approximately half (50.1%) of retrieved articles were published in journals under the subject area of \u201Cimmunology/microbiology\u201D. Main themes in highly cited articles were molecular biology/genetics and public health burden of campylobacteriosis. There were 728 (13.1%) articles on campylobacter-related drug resistance, and the top cited articles focused mainly on increasing resistance to quinolones and fluoroquinolones. CONCLUSIONS: There was a clear increase in number of publications on Campylobacter. Rational use of antimicrobials in humans, poultry, and animals is highly recommended. International collaboration is highly required particularly in implementing new diagnostic screening technologies to minimize global health burden of Campylobacter and ensure food safety.","publish_time":"2016-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sweileh, Waleed M.; Al-Jabi, Samah W.; Sawalha, Ansam F.; AbuTaha, Adham S.; Zyoud, Sa\u2019ed H.","journal":"J Health Popul Nutr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c8a35cb4e5844ead3ef3214b059ba238cd70362.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5129233.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5129233/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzMwNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Applied and Environmental Microbiology journal and Journal of Food Protection","Danmarks Tekniske Universitet"],"locations":["France","Netherlands"],"keyphrases":["Campylobacter jejuni","Campylobacter species","Campylobacter drug resistance","international collaboration","retrieved articles","global health burden of Campylobacter","cited articles","campylobacter-related drug resistance","Annual number of publications","annual growth of publications","highest percentage of articles","bibliometric overview of publications","public health burden of campylobacteriosis","productive country","Journal of Food Protection","international research output","food regulators","global burden of campylobacateriosis","Environmental Microbiology journal","increasing resistance","food safety","types of journal documents","productive countries","productive institution","Half","health policy makers","impact factor of journals","core leading journals","quality of retrieved data","country contribution","Hirsch index","clear increase","fluctuating increase","Bibliometric indicators","lowest percentage","h-index","study period","genetics","molecular biology","response of researchers","new diagnostic screening technologies","poultry","humans","widespread zoonotic pathogens","Q1","extent of interaction","Danmarks Tekniske Universitet","subject area","BACKGROUND","form of gastroenteritis","following keywords","Rational use of antimicrobials","Main themes","serious threat","citation analysis","Q3","citations","animals","immunology","fluoroquinolones","Scopus database","errata","Netherlands","METHODS","RESULTS","total","France","CONCLUSIONS","order","coli","USA"],"language":"en"},

This paper examines the effect of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome epidemic on the labor market to investigate whether vulnerable groups become more vulnerable due to an interaction between the socio-economic structure and physical risk. METHODS: This paper examines the effect of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome epidemic on the labor market by considering unemployment status, job status, working hours, reason for unemployment and underemployment status. In particular, the study investigates whether the U-shaped curve becomes a J-shaped curve due to the interaction between medical vulnerability and labor market vulnerability after an outbreak, assuming that the relative vulnerability in the labor market by age shows a U curve with peaks for the young group and middle aged and old aged groups using the Economically Active Population Survey. We use the difference in difference approach and also conduct a falsification check and robustness check. RESULTS: The results suggest that older workers faced a higher possibility of unemployment after the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak. In particular, they experienced higher involuntary unemployment and underemployment status as well as decreased working hours. It was confirmed that the relative vulnerability of the labor market for older workers was higher than for the other age groups after the epidemic outbreak due to the double whammy of vulnerability in the medical and labor market. The vulnerability in the young group partially increased compared to the 30s and 40s age groups due to their relative vulnerability in the labor market despite being healthy. We find that assuming the relative vulnerability in the existing labor market shows a U shape with age increase, the U-shaped curve became J-shaped after the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Disasters like epidemics can occur unexpectedly and affect certain groups more than other. Therefore, medical protection should be enhanced for groups vulnerable to disease and economic measures are also required for the protection of their livelihoods in the labor market to prevent unemployment stemming from inequality.","publish_time":"2016-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Ayoung; Cho, Joonmo","journal":"Int J Equity Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/41f31582cb50c99b10a376f465107d82bacf135c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5134239.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5134239/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzMxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["labor market vulnerability","relative vulnerability","medical vulnerability","existing labor market","physical vulnerability","vulnerability approach","unemployment status","vulnerable groups","groups vulnerable","s age groups","double whammy of vulnerability","epidemic outbreak","underemployment status","certain groups","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome epidemic","U curve","old aged groups","higher possibility of unemployment","higher involuntary unemployment","U-shaped curve","job status","J-shaped curve","age increase","medical protection","interaction","older workers","young group","epidemics","disasters","difference approach","working hours","RESULTS","paper","U shape","economic measures","physical risk","falsification check","economic class","robustness check","reason","peaks","different effects","socio-economic structure","Active Population Survey","disease","study","livelihoods","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","BACKGROUND","inequality"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study material consisted of 15 calves of different ages and sexes brought to the Training, Research and Application Center at the Kafkas University Faculty of Veterinary Medicine with suspected neonatal septicemia. 8.5 mL of blood was drawn from the jugular vein of each animal into coagulant tubes before and after treatment for one-off biochemical analyses and centrifuged. After this, the serum was separated. Hepcidin, TAS, TOS, and Fe levels in the serum were measured. RESULTS: While pre-treatment hepcidin levels were 58.42\u00B13.46 ng/mL, post-treatment levels were 46.87\u00B12.98 ng/mL (p\u003C0.05).

METHODS: Nine of 11 countries in the region agreed to be assessed. During February to November 2015 a joint team from WHO and ministries of health conducted 4\u20135 day missions to Bangladesh, Bhutan, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Timor-Leste. We collected information through guided discussions with senior technical leaders and visits to hospitals, laboratories and airports. We assessed each country\u2019s Ebola virus disease preparedness on 41 tasks under nine key components adapted from the WHO Ebola preparedness checklist of January 2015. FINDINGS: Political commitment to Ebola preparedness was high in all countries. Planning was most advanced for components that had been previously planned or tested for influenza pandemics: multilevel and multisectoral coordination; multidisciplinary rapid response teams; public communication and social mobilization; drills in international airports; and training on personal protective equipment. Major vulnerabilities included inadequate risk assessment and risk communication; gaps in data management and analysis for event surveillance; and limited capacity in molecular diagnostic techniques. Many countries had limited planning for a surge of Ebola cases. Other tasks needing improvement included: advice to inbound travellers; adequate isolation rooms; appropriate infection control practices; triage systems in hospitals; laboratory diagnostic capacity; contact tracing; and danger pay to staff to ensure continuity of care. CONCLUSION: Joint assessment and feedback about the functionality of Ebola virus preparedness systems help countries strengthen their core capacities to meet the International Health Regulations.","publish_time":"2016-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vong, Sirenda; Samuel, Reuben; Gould, Philip; El Sakka, Hammam; Rana, Bardan J; Pinyowiwat, Vason; Bezbaruah, Supriya; Ofrin, Roderico","journal":"Bull World Health Organ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/814ecf9043112382eaae1310c6359ddc70557bba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5153931.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5153931/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzMzNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Thailand"],"keyphrases":["countries","Ebola preparedness checklist","functionality of Ebola virus preparedness systems","assessments of Ebola virus disease preparedness","country\u2019s Ebola virus disease preparedness","surge of Ebola cases","risk communication","hospitals","limited capacity","international airports","International Health Regulations","limited planning","Joint assessment","ministries of health","tasks","inadequate risk assessment","laboratory diagnostic capacity","World Health Organization","triage systems","public communication","key components","joint team","molecular diagnostic techniques","South-East Asia Region","appropriate infection control practices","multidisciplinary rapid response teams","multisectoral coordination","social mobilization","adequate isolation rooms","senior technical leaders","visits","data management","drills","gaps","event surveillance","Bhutan","Nepal","Indonesia","Myanmar","Maldives","travellers","analysis","training","feedback","core capacities","Sri Lanka","guided discussions","Bangladesh","advice","tracing","Political commitment","day missions","Major vulnerabilities","staff","Thailand","information","influenza pandemics","danger"],"language":"en"},

However, the current OIT strategy is limited in terms of the long-term efficacy and safety. We have previously demonstrated that kakkonto, a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, suppresses the occurrence of allergic symptoms in a murine model of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced FA, which is attributed to the induction of the Foxp3(\u002B) CD4(\u002B) regulatory T cells. In this study, we established an OIT model using the FA mice with already established allergic symptoms and determined whether kakkonto could improve the efficacy of OIT. The OIT method consisted of initially administrating a very small amount of OVA and slowly increasing the amount. Allergic symptoms decreased in the OIT-treated FA mice. OIT significantly downregulated Th2 immune response-related gene expression in the FA mouse colon, and decreased the level of mouse mast cell protease-1, a marker of mast cell degranulation in the FA mouse plasma. Moreover, the concomitant use of kakkonto significantly enhanced the effectiveness of OIT on the allergic symptoms, and the combination therapy further suppressed the Th2 immune responses and the mast cell degranulation. In addition, OIT significantly increased the population of Foxp3(\u002B) CD4(\u002B) regulatory T cells in the FA mouse colon, and this population was further increased by OIT in combination with kakkonto. Furthermore, the combined therapy with kakkonto reduced the expression of RA-degrading enzyme CYP26B1 mRNA in the FA mouse colon. These findings indicated that the combination of OIT with kakkonto represents a promising approach for FA treatment.","publish_time":"2017-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nagata, Yuka; Yamamoto, Takeshi; Hayashi, Michie; Hayashi, Shusaku; Kadowaki, Makoto","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d940acd1f38f4b26cf2a7aeb4212f6854450ed0a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5249179.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5249179/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzM5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OIT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["combination of OIT","OIT model","efficacy of OIT","effectiveness of OIT","OIT method","OIT-treated FA mice","FA mouse colon","FA mouse plasma","induced FA","FA treatment","current OIT strategy","occurrence of allergic symptoms","concomitant use of kakkonto","level of mouse mast cell protease","combination therapy","marker of mast cell degranulation","promising approach","CD4","regulatory T cells","population of Foxp3","Th2 immune responses","expression of RA","combined therapy","downregulated Th2 immune response-related gene expression","long-term efficacy","murine model of ovalbumin","enzyme CYP26B1 mRNA","terms","traditional Japanese herbal medicine","food allergies","FAs","safety","Oral immunotherapy","addition","study","findings","induction"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 1038 patients who received SCT between January 2007 and August 2011 at a single center in Korea. RESULTS: Seventy-one CRV-LRDs were identified in 67 (6.5%) patients. The human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) was the most common causative pathogen of CRV-LRDs at 100 days [cumulative incidence estimate, 23.5%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.3\u201343.7] and 1 year (cumulative incidence estimate, 69.2%; 95% CI, 45.9\u201392.5) following SCT. The 30-day overall mortality rates due to influenza-LRDs, respiratory syncytial virus-LRDs, HPIV-LRDs, and human rhinovirus-LRDs were 35.7, 25.8, 31.6, and 42.8%, respectively. Co-pathogens in respiratory specimens were detected in 23 (33.8%) patients. The overall mortality at day 30 after CRV-LRD diagnosis was 32.8% (22/67). High-dose steroid usage (p=0.025), a severe state of immunodeficiency (p=0.033), and lymphopenia (p=0.006) were significantly associated with death within 30 days following CRV-LRD diagnosis in a univariate analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that high-dose steroid usage [odds ratio (OR), 4.05; 95% CI, 1.12\u201314.61; p=0.033] and lymphopenia (OR, 6.57; 95% CI, 1.80\u201324.03; p=0.004) were independent risk factors for mortality within 30 days of CRV-LRDs. CONCLUSION: CRV-LRDs among SCT recipients showed substantially high morbidity and mortality rates.

Here, we show that FLJ11286, which we refer to as IRAV, is induced by DENV in an interferon-dependent manner, displays antiviral activity against DENV, and localizes to the DENV replication complex. IRAV is an RNA binding protein and localizes to cytoplasmic processing bodies (P bodies) in uninfected cells, where it interacts with the MOV10 RISC complex RNA helicase, suggesting a role for IRAV in the processing of viral RNA. After DENV infection, IRAV, along with MOV10 and Xrn1, localizes to the DENV replication complex and associates with DENV proteins. Depletion of IRAV or MOV10 results in an increase in viral RNA. These data serve to characterize an interferon-stimulated gene with antiviral activity against DENV, as well as to propose a mechanism of activity involving the processing of viral RNA. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus, a member of the family Flaviviridae, can result in a life-threatening illness and has a significant impact on global health. Dengue virus has been shown to be particularly sensitive to the effects of type I interferon; however, little is known about the mechanisms by which interferon-stimulated genes function to inhibit viral replication. A better understanding of the interferon-mediated antiviral response to dengue virus may aid in the development of novel therapeutics. Here, we examine the influence of the interferon-stimulated gene IRAV (FLJ11286) on dengue virus replication. We show that IRAV associates with P bodies in uninfected cells and with the dengue virus replication complex after infection. IRAV also interacts with MOV10, depletion of which is associated with increased viral replication. Our results provide insight into a newly identified antiviral gene, as well as broadening our understanding of the innate immune response to dengue virus infection.","publish_time":"2017-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Balinsky, Corey A.; Schmeisser, Hana; Wells, Alexandra I.; Ganesan, Sundar; Jin, Tengchuan; Singh, Kavita; Zoon, Kathryn C.","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b65730c8b239180dd62a079fd2a40f2325a86a78.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5309953.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5309953/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IRAV","DENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dengue virus replication complex","DENV replication complex","dengue virus infection","DENV infection","interferon-stimulated gene IRAV","IRAV associates","IMPORTANCE Dengue virus","Depletion of IRAV","DENV proteins","processing of viral RNA","increased viral replication","antiviral activity","antiviral gene","antiviral response","MOV10 RISC complex RNA helicase","MOV10 results","interferon-stimulated genes function","interferon-dependent manner","P bodies","cytoplasmic processing bodies","RNA binding protein","uninfected cells","member","mechanism of activity","FLJ11286","life-threatening illness","better understanding","innate immune response","severe febrile illness","significant impact","role","genus Flavivirus","Xrn1","global health","family Flaviviridae","effects of type","mechanisms","insight","influence","development of novel therapeutics","data"],"language":"en"},

Because the pace of sequence accumulation tends to exceed the pace of experimental studies of protein function and the roles of individual amino acids, statistical tools to identify meaningful patterns in protein diversity are essential. Large sequence alignments from fast-evolving micro-organisms are particularly challenging to dissect using standard tools from phylogenetics and multivariate statistics because biologically relevant functional signals are easily masked by neutral variation and noise. To meet this need, a novel computational method is introduced that is easily executed in parallel using a cluster environment and can handle thousands of sequences with minimal subjective input from the user. The usefulness of this kind of machine learning is demonstrated by applying it to nearly 5000 haemagglutinin sequences of influenza A/H3N2.Antigenic and 3D structural mapping of the results show that the method can recover the major jumps in antigenic phenotype that occurred between 1968 and 2013 and identify specific amino acids associated with these changes.

In this paper, we examine how serological testing can reduce the risk of relaxing social distancing measures while also providing a way for test-positive individuals to return to more normal levels of activity. Methods: We use an SEIR-like compartmental model that accounts for serological test status to examine if widespread serological testing can reduce the adverse effects of relaxing social distancing measures, in terms of total deaths and health system burden. In our model, social distancing measures are relaxed to a greater extent for those who test positive compared to those who have not been tested or test negative, allowing a return to work and partial restoration of other social contacts to pre-pandemic levels. All in- dividuals preferentially interact with those who have tested positive, such that seropositive individuals act as immunological shields. We consider a range of potential testing capacities and the implications of an imperfect test for this strategy. Results: Although relaxing social distancing interventions increases total deaths, serologic testing as a part of this strategy can reduce population risk. If social distancing restrictions are relaxed by 50% in tandem with monthly serological testing of the general United States (US) population, 174,000 deaths would be averted and 67% of the US population would be released from social distancing after 1 year, as compared to a scenario without serological testing. Sustaining moderate levels of social distancing can help to flatten the epidemic curve, reducing health system burden below the US critical care capacity. Implications: Modeling studies suggest that serological testing can be used to relax social distancing measures preferentially for seropositive individuals, insofar as antibodies can be established as a correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Implementing a strategy of serological testing and shielding can reduce population risk while offsetting the severe social and economic costs of a sustained shutdown.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kraay, A.

The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the host cell surface receptor ACE2 is responsible for mediating SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Mutations on most of these residues are likely to be deleterious, leading to less infectious virus strains that may suffer from negative selection. Meanwhile, several residues with mostly advantageous mutations have been predicted. It is more probable that mutations on these residues increase the transmission ability of the virus by enhancing spike-hACE2 interaction. So far, only a limited number of mutations has been reported in this region. However, the list of hot spot residues with predicted downstream effects from this study can still serve as a tracking list for SARS-CoV-2 evolution studies.

Rapid development of new test kits has helped to alleviate these shortages. However, comparisons of these new detection systems are largely lacking. Here, we compare indirect methods that require RNA extraction, and direct RT-qPCR on patient samples. For RNA isolation we compared four different companies (Qiagen, Invitrogen, BGI and Norgen Biotek). For detection we compared two recently developed Taqman-based modules (BGI and Norgen Biotek), a SYBR green-based approach (NEB Luna Universal One-Step Kit) with published and newly-developed primers, and clinical results (Seegene STARMag RNA extraction system and Allplex 2019-nCoV RT-qPCR assay). Most RNA isolation procedures performed similarly, and while all RT-qPCR modules effectively detected purified viral RNA, the BGI system proved most sensitive, generating comparable results to clinical diagnostic data, and identifying samples ranging from 65 copies \u2013 2.1\u00D7105 copies of viral Orf1ab/\u03BCl. However, the BGI detection system is \u223C4x more expensive than other options tested here. With direct RT-qPCR we found that simply adding RNase inhibitor greatly improved sensitivity, without need for any other treatments (e.g. lysis buffers or boiling). The best direct methods were \u223C10 fold less sensitive than indirect methods, but reduce sample handling, as well as assay time and cost. These studies will help guide the selection of COVID-19 detection systems and provide a framework for the comparison of additional systems.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pearson, Joel D.; Trcka, Daniel; Hyduk, Sharon J.; Aynaud, Marie-Ming; Hern\u00E1ndez, J.

Abstract Anemia is one of the most prevalent diseases in the general population and is a very frequently found condition in medical and surgical patients in all medical specialties. A good evaluation of its clinical impact and its therapeutic possibilities is essential. Allogenic blood transfusion is a useful procedure in anemia management, although it has important adverse effects. It is the responsibility of the clinician to know and to take into account all the available alternatives for the treatment of anemia. Blood transfusions, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, iron therapy (oral and endovenous) and other therapeutic alternatives must be rationally used, in accordance with the currently available clinical evidence.

The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge levels, attitudes and practices toward COVID-19 among the Malaysian public. A cross-sectional online survey of 4,850 Malaysian residents was conducted between 27th March and 3rd April 2020. The survey instrument consisted of demographic characteristics, 13 items on knowledge, 3 items on attitudes and 3 items on practices, modified from a previously published questionnaire on COVID-19. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, t-tests and oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA) were conducted. The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 80.5%. Most participants held positive attitudes toward the successful control of COVID-19 (83.1%), the ability of Malaysia to conquer the disease (95.9%) and the way the Malaysian government was handling the crisis (89.9%). Most participants were also taking recautions such as avoiding crowds (83.4%) and practising proper hand hygiene (87.8%) in the week before the movement control order started. However, the wearing of face masks was less common (51.2%). This survey is among the first to assess knowledge, attitudes and practice in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. The results highlight the importance of consistent messaging from health authorities and the government as well as the need for tailored health education programs to improve levels of knowledge, attitudes and practices.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mohamad, E.

Abstract The human bocavirus (HBoV) has been recently identified by means of molecular screening techniques in respiratory tract secretions from children with acute respiratory tract disease. This virus, which belongs to the Parvoviridae family, has been detected worldwide with a 5 to 10% prevalence among children with upper or lower respiratory tract infections, essentially during the winter period. A seroepidemiological study has shown that almost all the children have antibodies to HBoV by the age of five years, and HBoV infection seems to be rare in adults. HBoV is often detected in association with other respiratory viruses. This virus has also been detected in stools, but its role in gastroenteritis has not been yet established. Virological diagnostic of HBoV infection is based on the detection of viral DNA by PCR. Viral load determination by viral DNA quantitation in respiratory tract secretions could be a tool to differentiate between symptomatic HBoV infection and virus carriage.","publish_time":"2009-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Foulongne, V.; Segondy, M.","journal":"Pathologie Biologie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9530ae72ca7810c50bd1048adf106a49cba07a4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0369811408000205; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0369811408000205","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus respiratoires","This virus","the children","virus carriage","antibodies to HBoV","HBoV infection is based","HBoV infection seems to be rare in adults","the detection","the age","ADN viral","detected in stools","simple portage du virus","HBoV is often detected in association with other respiratory viruses","viral DNA quantitation in respiratory tract secretions could be","tool to differentiate between symptomatic HBoV infection","infection symptomatique","s\u00E9cr\u00E9tions respiratoires","molecular screening techniques in respiratory tract secretions from children with acute respiratory tract disease","lower respiratory tract infections","detected worldwide with","which belongs to the Parvoviridae family","Abstract The human bocavirus","Viral load determination","but its role in gastroenteritis","prevalence among children with upper","essentially during the winter period","atteintes respiratoires hautes","PCR","enfants","utilisation de techniques","Virological diagnostic","bocavirus humain","diagnostic virologique","five years","sujets","shown that almost","means","atteinte respiratoire aigu\u00EB gr\u00E2ce","recently identified","also","basses","d\u00E9tection","quantification","seroepidemiological study","anticorps","\u00E2ge","r\u00E9gions du monde","charge virale","yet established","pr\u00E9valence","criblage mol\u00E9culaire","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","famille","p\u00E9riode hivernale","gastroent\u00E9rites","r\u00F4le","ordre","selles","adulte","\u00E9tude s\u00E9ro\u00E9pid\u00E9miologique"],"language":"fr"},

In the case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), droplet spread can occur from symptomatic as well as pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic persons. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has therefore recently recommended home-made cloth face coverings for use by the general public in areas of significant community-based transmission. Because medical masks and N95 respirators are in short supply, these are to be reserved for healthcare workers. There is, however, little information on the effectiveness of home-made face coverings in reducing droplet dissemination. Here, we ascertained the performance of ten different fabrics, ranging from cotton to silk, in blocking high velocity droplets, using a 3-layered commercial medical mask as a benchmark material. We also assessed their breathability and ability to soak water. We reason that the materials should be as breathable as possible, without compromising blocking efficiency, to reduce air flow through the sides of the mask since such flow would defeat the purpose of the mask. We found that most home fabrics substantially block droplets, even as a single layer. With two layers, blocking performance can reach that of surgical mask without significantly compromising breathability. Furthermore, we observed that home fabrics are hydrophilic to varying degrees, and hence soak water. In contrast, medical masks are hydrophobic, and tend to repel water. Incoming droplets are thus soaked and \u0027held back\u0027 by home fabrics, which might offer an as of yet untapped and understudied advantage of home-made cloth masks. Overall, our study suggests that most double-layered cloth face coverings may help reduce droplet transmission of respiratory infections.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aydin, Onur; Emon, Md Abul Bashar; Saif, M Taher A","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3982079927c2ffab971cd0a7fae2ab5ec40c8a2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.19.20071779v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","CDC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["home fabrics","home-made cloth face coverings","medical masks","water","commercial medical mask","effectiveness of home-made face coverings","droplet spread","Incoming droplets","surgical mask","different fabrics","double-layered cloth face coverings","droplet transmission of respiratory infections","understudied advantage of home-made cloth masks","droplet dissemination","high velocity droplets","performance","blocking efficiency","breathability","air flow","Disease Control","case of Coronavirus Disease","areas of significant community-based transmission","use","general public","aerosols","infected individuals","airborne particles","N95 respirators","COVID","silk","coughing","Prevention","cotton","CDC","benchmark material","sides","degrees","short supply","little information","sneezing","Centers","asymptomatic persons","contrast","materials","study","single layer","purpose","healthcare workers","layers"],"language":"en"},

Methods: Thus, we analyzed key safety metrics after transfusion of ABO-compatible human COVID-19 convalescent plasma in 5,000 hospitalized adults with severe or life threatening COVID-19, with 66% in the intensive care unit, as part of the US FDA Expanded Access Program for COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Results: The incidence of all serious adverse events (SAEs) in the first four hours after transfusion was \u003C1%, including mortality rate (0.3%). Of the 36 reported SAEs, there were 25 reported incidences of related SAEs, including mortality (n=4), transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO; n=7), transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI; n=11), and severe allergic transfusion reactions (n=3). However, only 2 (of 36) SAEs were judged as definitely related to the convalescent plasma transfusion by the treating physician. The seven-day mortality rate was 14.9%. Conclusion: Given the deadly nature of COVID-19 and the large population of critically-ill patients included in these analyses, the mortality rate does not appear excessive.

In this study, a novel method of immune-modulation to modify the endothelial function was studied to modulate the features of the endothelial cells, and thereby to reduce coronary artery disease and other disorders modulated by endothelium. Methods HUVEC cells were seeded in the cell culture, and streptococcus pyogenes were added to the cell culture, and the supernatant was studied for the secreted proteins. In the second phase, the bacterial lysate was synthesized, and the lysate was added to cell culture; and the proteins in the supernatant were studied at various time intervals. Results When streptococcus pyogenes alone was added to culture, E Cadherin, Angiostatin, EpCAM and PDGF-AB were some of the biomarkers elevated significantly. HCC1, IGFBP2 and TIMP were some of the biomarkers which showed a reduction. When the lysate was added, the cell-culture was maintained for a longer time, and it showed the synthesis of immune regulatory cytokines. Heatmap analysis showed a significant number of proteins/cytokines concerning the immune/pathways, and toll-like receptors superfamily were modified.

SARS-CoV-2 relies on its spike protein, in particular the receptor binding domain (RBD), to bind human cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry, and thus targeting RBD holds the promise for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this work, a competitive biopanning strategy of a phage display antibody library was applied to screen blocking antibodies against RBD. High-affinity antibodies were enriched after the first round using a standard panning process in which RBD-His recombinant protein was immobilized as a bait. At the next two rounds, immobilized ACE2-Fc and free RBD-His proteins were mixed with the enriched phage antibodies. Antibodies binding to RBD at epitopes different from ACE2-binding site were captured by the immobilized ACE2-Fc, forming a \u201Csandwich\u201D complex. Only antibodies competed with ACE2 for recognizing RBD at the same or similar epitopes can bind to the free RBD-His in the supernatant and be subsequently separated by the Ni-NTA magnetic beads. Top 1 lead from the competitive biopanning of a synthetic antibody library, Lib AB1, was produced as the full-length IgG1 format. It was proved to competitively block the binding of RBD to ACE2 protein, and potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection of ACE2-overexpressing Hela cells with IC50 values of 12nM. Nevertheless, top 1 lead from the standard biopanning of Lib AB1, can only bind to RBD in vitro but not have the blocking or neutralization activity. Our strategy can efficiently isolate the blocking antibodies of RBD, and it would speed up the discovery of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zeng, Xin; Li, Lingfang; Lin, Jing; Li, Xinlei; Liu, Bin; Kong, Yang; Zeng, Shunze; Du, Jianhua; Xiao, Huahong; Zhang, Tao; Zhang, Shelin; Liu, Jianghai","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b84047a5731db3ab96287fffef86b04ddda65825.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.19.049643","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RBD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["binding of RBD","blocking antibodies of RBD","free RBD","recognizing RBD","Antibodies binding","ACE2 protein","ACE2-binding site","immobilized ACE2-Fc","pseudovirus infection of ACE2","screen blocking antibodies","enriched phage antibodies","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","discovery of neutralizing antibodies","High-affinity antibodies","competitive biopanning strategy","receptor binding domain","standard biopanning of Lib AB1","synthetic antibody library","phage display antibody library","recombinant protein","spike protein","lead","specific therapeutic antibody","epitopes different","similar epitopes","standard panning process","human cell receptor angiotensin","overexpressing Hela cells","enzyme","IC50 values","proteins","vaccine","viral entry","Ni-NTA magnetic beads","nM","work","rounds","promise","full-length IgG1 format","deaths","sandwich","neutralization activity","bait","supernatant","complex"],"language":"en"},

However, the availability of validated nomograms and the machine-learning model to predict severity risk and triage of affected patients is limited. OBJECTIVE To develop and validate nomograms and machine-learning models for severity risk assessment and triage for COVID-19 patients at hospital admission. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective cohort of 299 consecutively hospitalized COVID-19 patients at The Central Hospital of Wuhan, China, from December 23, 2019, to February 13, 2020, was used to train and validate the models. Six cohorts with 426 patients from eight centers in China, Italy, and Belgium, from February 20, 2020, to March 21, 2020, were used to prospectively validate the models. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES The main outcome was the onset of severe or critical illness during hospitalization. Model performances were quantified using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. RESULTS Of the 299 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the retrospective cohort, the median age was 50 years ((interquartile range, 35.5-63.0; range, 20-94 years) and 137 (45.8%) were men. Of the 426 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the prospective cohorts, the median age was 62.0 years ((interquartile range, 50.0-72.0; range, 19-94 years) and 236 (55.4%) were men. The model was prospectively validated on six cohorts yielding AUCs ranging from 0.816 to 0.976, with accuracies ranging from 70.8% to 93.8%, sensitivities ranging from 83.7% to 100%, and specificities ranging from 41.0% to 95.7%. The cut-off values of the low, medium, and high-risk probabilities were 0.072 and 0.244. The developed online calculators can be found at www.predict19risk.ai. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE The machine learning models, nomograms, and online calculators might be useful for the prediction of onset of severe and critical illness among COVID-19 patients and triage at hospital admission. Further prospective research and clinical feedback are necessary to evaluate the clinical usefulness of this model and to determine whether these models can help optimize medical resources and reduce mortality rates compared with current clinical practices.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, G.; Yang, P.; Woodruff, H.

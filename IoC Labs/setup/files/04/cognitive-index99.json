There is currently no consensus for the types of PPE that are recommended to be worn by HCWs, nor is there a universal process for the donning and doffing of PPE. METHODS: HCWs from Bellevue Hospital participate in quarterly PPE trainings as part of the Special Pathogens Program (SPP), which consist of didactic sessions as well as an evaluation of donning and doffing techniques. A total of 50 HCWs completed the training curriculum in 2017. During the doffing process, PPE trainers applied corn start powder paint (Chameleon Colors; American Fork, UT) to the participants\u2019 gloved hands between multiple steps of PPE removal. At the end of the process, the areas where paint was found on was documented including the outer surgical gown, the powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) helmet and shroud, the inner impermeable suit, the knee-high boots and boot covers, and the extended-cuff gloves. RESULTS: The areas of PPE that were most marked with paint were the lower shoulders and upper arms of the surgical gowns, the top sides of the PAPR shroud, the front upper chest area, and the center back of the inner impermeable suits. In a majority of cases no powder paint was noted on the knee-high boots. In a minority of cases, paint was observed on the inside upper chest area of the surgical gown. These paint markings were used to discuss potential breaches in PPE doffing technique in real-time, as well as identify areas to target in future PPE trainings. CONCLUSION: The powdered paint quality improvement process for donning and doffing PPE is a method to evaluate the complex PPE dressing procedure. It is particularly useful given the fact that it is incumbent on each hospital or healthcare system to develop its own processes and procedures for PPE, as well as maintain readiness through periodic trainings. Powdered paint can identify vulnerabilities in their process as well as areas that require further education.

Rapid diagnostic tests provide collaborative opportunities for antimicrobial stewardship Teams (AST) to improve patient outcomes and decrease antimicrobial use. In January of 2017 our institution initiated use of a FDA approved multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Respiratory Panel. The objective of this evaluation was to assess the clinical impact along with procalcitonin (PCT) on quality of patient care when used in conjunction with antimicrobial stewardship. METHODS: Molecular testing was performed using the BioFire FilmArray\u00AE Respiratory Panel [RP] (BioMerieux). The medical staff was encouraged to order an Influenza/RSV PCR test prior to ordering the full RP. The results of RP and PCT were available the same day as ordered. AST recommended the RP as part of its intervention on several patients and provided advice based on results. RESULTS: From January-April the results of 81 tests for the respiratory panel were evaluated. Of these 30 were positive (\u002B) for virus (most common-Human Metapneumovirus [HMV]-13, Coronavirus-7). PCT (ng/mL) results were available on 69. Most common final diagnosis: Pneumonia-31; AECOPD-16. Effect on duration of antimicrobial therapy (ABX) and hospital length of stay (LOS): CONCLUSION: The results of the RP led to a decrease in ABX duration, which was most profound in the patients for whom AST intervened. LOS was also reduced. Utilization of RP and PCT facilitated better ABX use. DISCLOSURES: T. M.

A vaccination campaign was implemented. Numerous vaccine-associated rash illnesses (VARI) were detected. VARI is non-contagious, but difficult to distinguish from measles clinically. Often, public health control measures need to be implemented before wild-type measles can be differentiated from VARI by viral genotyping. We compared clinical characteristics of VARI and confirmed measles cases to inform testing practices. METHODS: We defined measles cases per the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. VARI was defined as a rash occurring in a person within 21 days after receipt of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and in whom a measles vaccine strain (genotype A) was detected in naso/oro- pharyngeal swab or urine samples. Minnesota\u2019s immunization information system monitored MMR doses administered. We collected clinical information through routine case investigation. RESULTS: Over 42,000 MMR doses above expected were administered during the outbreak. We identified 71 measles cases and 30 VARI. The median age of VARI patients was 1.2 years (range 10 months\u201348 years) and for measles cases 2.8 years (range 3 months\u201357 years). VARI diagnosis increased with rising MMR administration (figure); rash onset occurred a median of 11 (range 7\u201318) days after MMR receipt. Most VARI (97%) occurred following first MMR dose. The presence of fever was similar among VARI and measles cases (97% of VARI vs. 100% of measles cases; P = 0.12), but differences were seen in the proportion with cough (30% vs. 96%; P \u003C 0.001), coryza (47% vs. 85%; P \u003C 0.001), conjunctivitis (23% vs. 68%; P \u003C 0.001), and exposure to infectious measles cases (0% vs. 96%). CONCLUSIONS: Surges in MMR administration and heightened community awareness during a measles outbreak can result in a large number of VARI, consuming considerable public health resources. When evaluating the need to suspect measles among patients with febrile rash, clinicians should consider time since MMR administration, clinical presentation, and history of measles exposure. Collecting appropriate specimens for timely virus genotyping could inform appropriate public health action.

The Burden of Respiratory Viral Illness in HIV-Infected Patients","doi":"10.1093/ofid/ofy210.1917","pmcid":"PMC6253283","pubmed_id":null,"license":"cc-by-nc-nd","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Among individuals living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), pulmonary complications are the most frequent cause of morbidity and mortality. Although bacterial and fungal pathogens are well-described etiologies of lung disease, the role of respiratory viruses remains poorly understood. We sought to describe the burden of respiratory viral illness in HIV-infected inpatients admitted to our tertiary care center. METHODS: All HIV-infected inpatients from August 2015 to March 2018 were approached if they presented with respiratory symptoms, defined as cough, dyspnea, sore throat, rhinorrhea, wheezing, or stridor. Eighty patients were enrolled. After obtaining informed consent, nasopharyngeal swabs and blood were collected. If the subject underwent bronchoscopy per the treating physician, excess bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample was collected. Demographic and clinical data were recorded for each subject. Multiplex PCR testing of all respiratory samples was performed. RESULTS: Of the 70 HIV-infected patients that have undergone complete analysis, 23 (33%) tested positive for respiratory viruses. Of these, 11 (48%) were positive for rhinovirus, 3 were positive for influenza A (13%), 2 for parainfluenza 3 (9%), 2 for coronavirus (9%), and one each tested positive for adenovirus, parainfluenza 4, respiratory syncytial virus and influenza B. One patient had co-infection with rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus. Patients infected with a respiratory virus had severe illness as nearly half (10/23; 48%) required intensive care, 5 (22%) required mechanical ventilation, 4 (17%) were discharged to a higher level of care, and 3 (13%) died. CONCLUSION: The role of respiratory viruses on the lung health of HIV-infected patients is poorly defined. In this study, respiratory viruses were identified in over a third of HIV-infected inpatients, representing a substantial disease burden. Moreover, these patients demonstrated significant disease severity.

Novel Metabolomics Approach for the Diagnosis of Respiratory Viruses Directly from Nasopharyngeal Specimens","doi":"10.1093/ofid/ofz360.1654","pmcid":"PMC6809267","pubmed_id":null,"license":"cc-by-nc-nd","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Respiratory virus infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality among pediatric and adult patients. These viruses infect respiratory epithelial cells, where they may induce specific metabolite alterations. As a proof-of-concept, we investigate the novel use of liquid chromatography (LC) combined with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOF) for the study of host cell metabolite alterations to diagnose and differentiate respiratory viruses. METHODS: We studied nasopharyngeal swab samples positive for respiratory viruses by the eSensor Respiratory Viral Panel (GenMark Diagnostics, Carlsbad, CA). Banked, frozen samples (\u221280\u00B0C) stored in viral transport media were retrieved and thawed. Aliquots of 100 \u03BCL were centrifuged at 13.3 \u00D7 g for 15 minutes, and the filtrate was analyzed by Agilent 6545 Quadrupole LC/Q-TOF (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Compounds were separated using a novel column arrangement based on hydrophobicity and charge using a quaternary solvent manager, followed by accurate mass analysis by LC/Q-TOF. Agilent Mass Profiler 3D principal component analysis was performed, and compound identification was completed using the METLIN metabolite database. RESULTS: A total of 235 specimens were tested by LC/Q-TOF, including 195 positive specimens [including adenovirus, coronavirus, influenza A H1N1 and H3N2, influenza B, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3, and 4, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinovirus] as well as 40 negative clinical specimens. LC/Q-TOF primary component analysis (PCA) allowed preliminary identification of key metabolites that distinguished all virus-positive specimens compared with the negative group, and differentiated respiratory viruses from one another including between influenza A 2009 H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes (Figure 1). CONCLUSION: Preliminary data from our LC/Q-TOF analysis show that respiratory viruses exhibit different host cell metabolomic profiles that allow viral differentiation to the species level, and for influenza A virus, the subtype level. This metabolomic approach has substantial potential for diagnostic applications in infectious diseases directly from patient samples, and may be eventually adapted for point-of-care testing.

The synthesized conjugates were evaluated for their preliminary in vitro analysis against Trichomonas vaginalis at 50 \u03BCM. The efficacy of synthesized hybrids was observed to depend on the substituent at N-1 position of \u03B2-lactam ring, as well as the presence of single/double 1H-1,2,3-triazole linker. Among the synthesized conjugates, the presence of a p-tolyl substituent at N-1 of \u03B2-lactam ring was preferred for good activity profiles while the increase in spacer length did not influence the efficacy of the compounds. Compounds with high levels of potency were further analysed to determine their IC(50) values, as well as cytotoxicity profiles against mammalian cells. The most active compound in the synthesized conjugates displayed an IC(50) value of 10.49 \u03BCM against cultured G3 strain of T. vaginalis and was non-toxic to cultured mammalian HeLa cells at the same concentration.

To ensure high quality of the trial intervention as well as of patient care, we have developed a multilingual web-based training program to train relevant staff and test their competence. As we enter an under-explored area of e-learning, we have conducted a pilot study on the first of the five modules comprising the web-based training program to test the feasibility of developing such a program for an international trial with limited resources. METHODS: The module in this study focuses on the principles and practice of NIRS monitoring. The pedagogical idea was to integrate training and certification. One-hundred doctors and nurses from five Neonatal Intensive Care Units across China, Spain and Denmark were invited to participate in the pilot study. Upon completion of the NIRS module, participants were invited to evaluate their experience by completing an online survey. Data from closed-ended questions were analysed using descriptive statistics while data from open-ended questions underwent thematic analysis. RESULTS: In total, 81 of 100 invited staff members entered the training module and completed the online survey. The median time and the number of questions to pass the module was 15 minutes and seven questions, respectively. Most staff found the academic level of the learning material and quiz appropriate (85% and 93% of all staff members, respectively), as well as agreeing that the module was relevant to prepare them to \u2018use the NIRS device\u2019 (90%). Thematic analysis revealed issues such as a discrepancy between learning material and quiz questions, lack of clarity, and technical issues. CONCLUSION: We provide evidence of the feasibility of developing a multilingual web-based training program for an international trial, despite challenges such as low budget, language barriers and possibly differences in the clinical training of staff. Exploring the integration of training and certification for international trials, the positive results of this study motivate further developments. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT03770741.

Multiple transport pathways including bulk autophagy (microautophagy and macroautophagy) and chaperone\u2010mediated autophagy (CMA) have been identified to efficiently facilitate this transit of macromolecules from the cytoplasm to acidic vacuolar organelles. While autophagy plays a role in the general housekeeping of cells, it also functions in more specialized processes such as development and differentiation, responses to physiological stress and immunity. The presentation of both exogenous and endogenous antigens (Ag) by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules to CD4(\u002B) T lymphocytes is critical for the induction of tolerance to self Ag as well as the development of immunity against intracellular pathogens and tumors. Here, we discuss the class II\u2010mediated presentation of several endogenous Ag, dependent on either macroautophagy or CMA for their transport from the cytosol to endosomal/lysosomal compartments. Thus, the various pathways of autophagy as routes of cytoplasmic Ag delivery to lysosomes have significant implications for the MHC class II\u2010mediated immune response to intracellular pathogens and cancer.","publish_time":"2007-10-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crotzer, Victoria L.; Blum, Janice S.","journal":"Traffic","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ebc3f7126ebbb0141913473c8bb69155d999933.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7182309.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7182309/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CMA","MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mediated autophagy","endogenous Ag","self Ag","MHC class","bulk autophagy","intracellular pathogens","mediated presentation","various pathways of autophagy","routes of cytoplasmic Ag delivery","macroautophagy","cytosol","delivery of intracellular substrates","development of immunity","CMA","Multiple transport pathways","endogenous antigens","damaged organelles","acidic vacuolar organelles","lysosomes","significant implications","major histocompatibility complex","differentiation","misfolded proteins","microautophagy","immune response","degradation","induction of tolerance","responses","CD4","chaperone","T lymphocytes","physiological stress","role","cancer","cell survival","general housekeeping of cells","transit of macromolecules","lysosomal compartments","specialized processes","tumors"],"language":"en"},

The most important substances in this arena include inhibitors of PD\u20111, PD-L1 and CTLA\u20114. As a consequence, the spectrum of treatment-associated adverse reactions is shifting away from classical cytotoxic effects (e.g. pancytopenia and polyneuropathy) towards novel entities of immune-mediated complex diseases. These so-called immune-related adverse events (irAEs) can involve any organ system and mimic known classical autoimmune conditions. Timely recognition of irAEs is the key for rapid initiation of a suitable treatment and is especially challenging in the clinical routine as it requires an intensive interdisciplinary management. Nephrologists are particularly confronted with this kind of problem due to the highly interdisciplinary nature of their work. This article summarizes the broad spectrum of currently known renal and more frequently occuring non-renal forms of irAEs and aims to prime the reader on diagnostic and therapeutic options.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Braun, G.

We then describe the organisation of autonomous and nonautonomous IS\u2010related elements. This is used to illustrate the growing recognition that the boundaries between different types of mobile element are becoming increasingly difficult to define as more are being identified. We review the known Tpase types, their different catalytic activities used in cleaving and rejoining DNA strands during transposition, their organisation into functional domains and the role of this in regulation.

Certain metabolites play a key role in ARDS and could serve as potential targets for developing therapies against this respiratory disorder. The present study was designed to determine such \u201Cfunctional metabolites\u201D in ARDS using metabolomics and in vivo experiments in a mouse model. METHODS: Metabolomic profiles of blood plasma from 42 ARDS patients and 28 healthy controls were captured using Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) assay. Univariate and multivariate statistical analysis were performed on metabolomic profiles from blood plasma of ARDS patients and healthy controls to screen for \u201Cfunctional metabolites\u201D, which were determined by variable importance in projection (VIP) scores and P value. Pathway analysis of all the metabolites was performed. The mouse model of ARDS was established to investigate the role of \u201Cfunctional metabolites\u201D in the lung injury and mortality caused by the respiratory disorder. RESULTS: The metabolomic profiles of patients with ARDS were significantly different from healthy controls, difference was also observed between metabolomic profiles of the non-survivors and the survivors among the ARDS patient pool. Levels of Phenylalanine, D-Phenylalanine and Phenylacetylglutamine were significantly increased in non-survivors compared to the survivors of ARDS. Phenylalanine metabolism was the most notably altered pathway between the non-survivors and survivors of ARDS patients. In vivo animal experiments demonstrated that high levels of Phenylalanine might be associated with the severer lung injury and increased mortality of ARDS. CONCLUSION: Increased mortality of acute respiratory distress syndrome was associated with high levels of plasma Phenylalanine. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR1800015930.

Coughing and sneezing by an infected person can emit pathogen-containing particles with diameters less than 10 \u03BCm that can reach the alveolar region. Based on our analysis of the sparse literature on respiratory aerosols, we estimated that emitted particles quickly decrease in diameter due to water loss to one-half the initial values, and that in one cough the volume in particles with initial diameters less than 20 \u03BCm is 6 \u00D7 10(\u22128) mL. The pathogen emission rate from a source case depends on the frequency of expiratory events, the respirable particle volume, and the pathogen concentration in respiratory fluid. Viable airborne pathogens are removed by exhaust ventilation, particle settling, die-off, and air disinfection methods; each removal mechanism can be assigned a first-order rate constant. The pathogen concentration in well-mixed room air depends on the emission rate, the size distribution of respirable particles carrying pathogens, and the removal rate constants. The particle settling rate and the alveolar deposition fraction depend on particle size. Given these inputs plus a susceptible person\u0027s breathing rate and exposure duration to room air, an expected alveolar dose \u03BC is estimated. If the infectious dose is one organism, as appears to be true for tuberculosis, infection risk is estimated by the expression: R = 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03BC). Using published tuberculosis data concerning cough frequency, bacilli concentration in respiratory fluid, and die-off rate, we illustrate the model via a plausible scenario for a person visiting the room of a pulmonary tuberculosis case.

Areas covered: This review summarizes what is currently known about the use of gold nanoparticles as an antigen carrier and adjuvant to prepare antibodies in vivo and design vaccines against viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections. The basic principles, recent advances, and current problems in the use of gold nanoparticles are discussed. Expert opinion: Gold nanoparticles can be used as adjuvants to increase the effectiveness of vaccines by stimulating antigen-presenting cells and ensuring controlled antigen release. Studying the characteristics of the immune response obtained from the use of gold nanoparticles as a carrier and an adjuvant will permit the particles\u2019 potential for vaccine design to be increased.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dykman, Lev A.","journal":"Expert Rev Vaccines","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3431417c7db9dfad0645e3fedcf8d8857845d9d4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7196924.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7196924/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsyODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of gold nanoparticles","popular antigen carrier","Vaccination","high immune response","optimal carrier","design vaccines","parasitic infections","controlled antigen release","vaccine design","protective immune responses","new vaccines","effectiveness of vaccines","vaccine preparation","current problems","antibodies","immunization","recent advances","cells","regard","important task","antibody","particles\u2019 potential","adjuvants","nanoscale particle carriers","basic principles","Expert opinion","Introduction","characteristics","Areas","review"],"language":"en"},

Hypothesis: Treatment with rFeIFN\u2010\u03C9 in cats with fibrosarcoma is safe and feasible. Animals: Twenty domestic cats. Methods: In an open\u2010labeled uncontrolled clinical trial 12 injections of 1 \u00D7 10(6) U/kg rFeIFN\u2010\u03C9 were administered over a 5\u2010week period: the 1st through 4th injections were given intratumorally, and the 5th through 12th injections were administered subcutaneously at the tumor excision site. Wide surgical excision of the tumors was carried out after the 4th injection and before the 5th injection of rFeIFN\u2010\u03C9. A Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) analysis was conducted. Flow cytometry of fibrosarcoma cells after incubation with rFeIFN\u2010\u03C9 and recombinant feline interferon\u2010\u03B3 was performed to assess the biological effect of rFeIFN\u2010\u03C9. Results: Changes in blood cell count, increases in serum aspartate\u2010amino\u2010transferase activity, serum bilirubin concentration, serum creatinine and serum electrolyte concentrations, weight loss, anorexia, increased body temperature, and reduced general condition were observed but were mostly minor (grade 1 and 2) and self limiting. Eosinophilia (P= .025), neutropenia (P= .021), and weight loss (P \u003C .001) were statistically correlated with rFeIFN\u2010\u03C9\u2010treatment (analysis of parameters before treatment and after 3 injections of rFeIFN\u2010\u03C9). Flow cytometry of 5 unrelated feline fibrosarcoma cell lines showed increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules (P= .026) in response to in vitro incubation with rFeIFN\u2010\u03C9, whereas expression of MHC class II molecules was not affected significantly. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: RFeIFN\u2010\u03C9 for the treatment of feline fibrosarcoma is safe, well tolerated, and can be easily performed in practice. To assess the efficacy of the treatment, it should be tested in a placebo\u2010controlled trial.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hampel, Verena; Schwarz, Bianca; Kempf, Christine; K\u00F6stlin, Roberto; Schillinger, Ulrike; K\u00FCchenhoff, Helmut; Fenske, Nora; Brill, Thomas; Hirschberger, Johannes","journal":"J Vet Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8bcd6f4684b338453ed77105d7c6f5b0bfd18e94.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197455/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsyODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events","MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["injections of rFeIFN","injection of rFeIFN","treatment of feline fibrosarcoma","biological effect of rFeIFN","treatment option","Recombinant feline interferon","unrelated feline fibrosarcoma cell lines","serum creatinine","serum aspartate","Flow cytometry of fibrosarcoma cells","serum bilirubin concentration","serum electrolyte concentrations","expression of MHC class","weight loss","incubation","molecules","domestic cats","uncontrolled clinical trial","analysis of parameters","Clinical Importance","controlled trial","increased expression of major histocompatibility complex","increased body temperature","blood cell count","Wide surgical excision","tumor excision site","transferase activity","anorexia","Adverse Events","CTCAE","Common Terminology Criteria","general condition","Results","Changes","Background","tumors","safety","Conclusions","response","Hypothesis","grade","placebo","Animals","feasibility","neutropenia","self limiting","week period","Methods","Eosinophilia","efficacy","practice"],"language":"en"},

In a phylogenetic analysis with the concatenated sequences of the 16S rRNA, gltA, rpoB, cell division protein (ftsZ) gene, and riboflavin synthase gene (ribC) gene, isolates belonging to genotypes I to IV clustered with Bartonella strains from Taiwanese Miniopterus bats, similar to the outcome of the phylogenetic analysis with gltA, whereas genotype V also made a monophyletic clade separate from other bat-associated Bartonella strains.

Previously iron-branded (n = 45; 1 yr) and microchipped (n = 59; 7 yr) camels showed problems of healing (8.6% of brands) and reading (only 42.9% of brands and 69.5% of microchips were readable), which made their use inadvisable. With the aim of proposing suitable ID systems for different farming conditions, an on-field study was performed using a total of 528 dromedaries at 4 different locations (Egypt, n = 83; Spain, n = 304; Saudi Arabia, n = 90; and Tunisia, n = 51). The ID devices tested were visual (button ear tags, 28.5 mm diameter, n = 178; double flag ear tags, 50 by 15 mm, n = 83; both made of polyurethane) and electronic (ear tags, n = 90, and rumen boluses, n = 555). Electronic ear tags were polyurethane-loop type (75 by 9 mm) with a container in which a 22-mm transponder of full-duplex technology was lodged. Electronic boluses of 7 types, varying in dimensions (50 to 76 mm length, 11 to 21 mm width, and 12.7 to 82.1 g weight) and specific gravity (SG; 1.49 to 3.86) and each of them containing a 31-mm transponder of half-duplex technology, were all administered to the dromedaries at the beginning of the study. When a low-SG bolus was lost, a high-SG bolus was readministered. Readability rates of each ID system were evaluated during 1 to 3 yr, according to device and location, and yearly values were estimated for comparison. On a yearly basis, visual ear tag readability was not fully satisfactory; it was lower for rectangular ear tags (66.3%) than for button ear tags (80.9%). Yearly readability of electronic ear tags was 93.7%. Bolus readability dramatically varied according to their SG; the SG \u003C 2.0 boluses were fully lost after 8 mo. In contrast, the SG \u003E 3.0 boluses were efficiently retained (99.6 to 100%) at all locations. In conclusion, according to the expected long lifespan of camels, low ID performances were observed for iron brands, injectable microchips, and ear tags (visual and electronic), making their use inadvisable as unique ID systems in camels. The high readability of dense electronic boluses recommended their use as a permanent ID device of reference in camels.","publish_time":"2016-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Caja, G.; D\u00EDaz-Medina, E.; Salama, A.

The SNP WUR10000125 (WUR) is used as a tag SNP for this QTL. The favorable (B) allele at this SNP is in low frequency in commercial populations, possibly because this allele is unfavorably associated with an important trait under nonchallenging conditions and, therefore, may have been selected against. Therefore, objectives of this study were to estimate the effect of WUR on traits under selection in commercial lines under nonchallenging conditions and to estimate the effect of WUR genotype of parents on performance of crossbred progeny in a commercial-like environment. Data were collected on 4 purebred lines: a Landrace dam line (D1), a Large White dam line (D2), a synthetic sire line (S1), and a Pietrain sire line (S2). Traits analyzed included total number born, number stillborn, farrowing survival, lactation survival, litter mortality, daily feed intake (DFI), backfat, average test daily gain (TGR), average lifetime daily gain (LGR), and Topigs Norsvin selection index (TSI) value, indicative of overall economic value. Deregressed EBV were calculated for each trait (except TSI) and analyzed within line. In the S1 line, AB and BB pigs had significantly lower TGR (P = 0.002) and LGR (P = 0.001) than AA pigs but also lower DFI (P = 0.004). Conversely, AB and BB pigs had significantly higher DFI (P \u003C 0.001) and AB pigs had significantly higher TGR (P = 0.03) than AA pigs in the S2 line. The effect of WUR on TSI was not significant for any line (P \u2265 0.15). Analyses of phenotypic records collected on crossbred progeny of S1 sires and D1 \u00D7 D2 F(1) females showed no significant effect of parent WUR genotype on DFI, backfat, TGR, or LGR (P \u2265 0.07). In conclusion, the effect of WUR was nonsignificant for most traits but the magnitude and direction of the effect differed by trait and by line. The favorable allele for host response to PRRS was associated with greater DFI and a tendency for greater TGR in the S2 line, but the opposite direction of effect was detected for the S1 line. Regardless of the effect on individual traits, no significant effect of WUR on TSI was detected for any line. Therefore, selecting for the B allele is expected to result in progeny with increased resistance to PRRS without compromising overall economic value under normal, nonchallenging conditions.","publish_time":"2017-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dunkelberger, J.

This method did not need reverse transcription of IBV template under isothermal condition (37\u00B0C), the amplification of target gene fragments could be completed within only 24 min, and the amplification products could be visually observed and determined by LFD within 3 min. The specificity test demonstrated that there was no cross reaction with the nucleic acids of other similar common pathogens. The lowest detectable limit for IBV was 10(2) copies/\u03BCL, and this method was 100 times more sensitive than conventional PCR (10(4) copies/\u03BCL), as verified by sensitivity test. The results showed that RT-RAA-LFD assay with strong specificity and high sensitivity was simple and easy to operate, and could be used for rapid detection of IBV in clinical diagnosis.","publish_time":"2019-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Wenjing; Wang, Chunguang; Zhang, Peng; Yao, Shanshan; Liu, Jingru; Zhai, Xianghe; Zhang, Tie","journal":"Poult Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18dc497dbade61ee314c46981c7d7260b21869b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7199787.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7199787/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjszNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","LFD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RT-RAA","RAA reaction time","LFD assay","rapid detection of IBV","optimization of RT","reverse transcription of IBV template","sensitive method","end of RAA probe","reaction temperature","cross reaction","specificity test","amplification products","sensitivity test","copies","\u03BCL","reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification","strong specificity","clinical diagnosis","high sensitivity","primer concentration","amplification of target gene fragments","selected downstream primer","diagnosis of avian infectious bronchitis virus","nucleic acids","FAM","isothermal condition","lateral flow dipstick","similar common pathogens","biotin","times","conventional PCR","experiment","lowest detectable limit","results","study"],"language":"en"},

The VP8* protein from the P[4], P[6], P[8], P[9], P[11], P[14] and P[25] genotypes were produced in E. coli. These proteins were tested with 88 serum samples from children (n = 41, 3.5 years old in average) and from adults (n = 47, 58 years old in average) by ELISA. A subset of 55 samples were genotyped for the FUT2(G428A) polymorphism and the antibody titers compared. The same subset of samples was also analysed by ELISA using whole rotavirus Wa particles (G1P[8]) as antigen. Ninety-three per cent of the samples were positive for at least one of the VP8* antigens. Differences in the IgG seroprevalence were found between children and adults for the P[4], P[8] and P[11] genotypes. Similarly, significant differences were found between adults and children in their antibody titers against the P[4], P[8], and P[11] VP8* genotypes, having the children higher antibody titers than adults. Interestingly, positive samples against rare genotypes such as P[11] (only in children), P[14] and P[25] were found. While no statistical differences in the antibody titers between secretors and non-secretors were found for any of the tested P genotypes studied, a higher statistic significant prevalence for the P[25] genotype was found in secretors compared to non-secretors.

Fusion\u2010resistant L\u20102 cell mutants had similar cholesterol and fatty acid composition as did their fusion\u2010susceptible parent subclone, and were presumably deficient in a genetically mutable non\u2010lipid, host cell factor (e.g., fusion protein receptor). On the other hand, cellular sensitivity to virus fusion, which is known to be influenced by cell cholesterol content [Daya et al., 1988], was shown further to be modulated by homeostatic alterations in fatty acid metabolism. Cholesterol supplementation of mouse L\u20102 fibroblasts or of peritoneal macrophages from MHV\u2010susceptible mice elevated susceptibility to viral fusion. Increased fusion susceptibility occurred in cholesterol\u2010supplemented L\u20102 cells in the absence of any detectable alterations i n host cell fatty acid composition, thus demonstrating fusion enhancement by cholesterol alone. L\u20102 cells cloned by limiting dilution in normal (not cholesterol\u2010supplemented) medium were found to be heterogeneous i n cholesterol content. Interestingly, high cholesterol\u2010containing subclones had increased levels of C\u201018:0, C\u201018:2, C\u201020:4, and C\u201022:6 and markedly reduced levels of C\u201018:l fatty acids when compared to low cholesterol\u2010containing subclones. High cholesterol\u2010containing subclones did not show enhanced susceptibility to viral fusion, suggesting that homeostatic alteration of fatty acid metabolism compensated for the increased cholesterol levels and countered the normally fusion\u2010enhancing effect of cholesterol alone. Since these observations have potentially important consequences regarding the effects of dietary cholesterol on the severity of virus infection, we examined liver titres and pathology of normal and hypercholesterolemic mice infected with MHV. Hypercholesterolemia had no significant effect on virus replication or on liver pathology in two MHV\u2010 sensitive strains (Balb/c and AIJ) or in one MHV\u2010resistant (SJLIJ) of mice. Lipid analyses of the livers from normal and hypercholesterolemic mice showed evidence of two homeostatic mechanisms (cholesterol esterification and alteration of fatty acid composition) which likely counteracted the normally exacerbating effect of cholesterol on MHV cytopathology.","publish_time":"2005-12-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cervin, Marguerite; Anderson, Robert","journal":"J Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9ac6afce9aa49839d88321e48718aaf1fc0dad43.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159151/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs1MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high cholesterol","cholesterol esterification","similar cholesterol","low cholesterol","virus fusion","cell cholesterol content","increased cholesterol levels","Cholesterol supplementation of mouse","exacerbating effect of cholesterol","viral fusion","Increased fusion susceptibility","effects of dietary cholesterol","fusion enhancement","heterogeneous i n cholesterol content","alteration of fatty acid composition","fusion protein receptor","n host cell fatty acid composition","homeostatic alteration of fatty acid metabolism","fatty acids","MHV cytopathology","reduced levels of C","cell mutants","hypercholesterolemic mice","Cellular susceptibility","susceptible mice elevated susceptibility","mouse hepatitis virus","MHV strain A59","virus replication","homeostatic mechanisms","homeostatic alterations","pathology of normal","enhanced susceptibility","Lipid analyses","use of subclones","host cell factor","severity of virus infection","liver pathology","mutable non\u2010lipid","selected mutants of mouse","significant effect","fibroblasts","cells","detectable alterations","liver titres","independent mechanisms","cellular sensitivity","susceptible parent subclone","murine coronavirus","sensitive strains","evidence","peritoneal macrophages","Balb","livers","important consequences","absence","AIJ","hand","Hypercholesterolemia","medium","SJLIJ","dilution","Daya","observations"],"language":"en"},

Their quality is important for species distribution. The role of cave microclimate as well as other environmental factors influencing the distribution of cave\u2010dwelling species, is poorly known. We tested the significance of cave variables (length, temperature, elevation, occurrence of water) and geographical location for the presence of bats during hibernation and the breeding season in five regions in Romania. To detect species\u0027 environmental relationships, we used canonical correspondence analyses for winter bat aggregations and principal components analysis for maternity colonies. We analysed the factors influencing the distribution of bats by using two sets of explanatory variables reflecting cave characteristics and geographical locations. Winter aggregation was divided into three groups: (1) bat species that prefer high temperatures (Rhinolophus euryale, Myotis cappacinii) and hibernate at a low altitude; (2) species ranging from mid\u2010 to high elevation and low temperature (Myotis myotis/oxygnathus group); (3) species that hibernate in large, cold cave systems with a constant flow of the water (Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Nyctalus noctula, Barbastella barbastellus). Maternity colonies were divided into those that select either high (rhinolophids) or low temperatures (My. myotis/oxygnathus and Miniopterus schreibersii). The most important factors influencing the distribution of bats are the temperature in caves and their geographical location. This information was combined with IUCN\u0027s Red List data as well as with the number of individuals occurring in caves with the aim of identifying the key sites for conservation. The majority of these sites, which also constitute the refuges for vulnerable species, are located in west and south\u2010western Romania. Seven caves provide shelter throughout the year for 122 000 individuals of 14 species.","publish_time":"2010-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nagy, Z.

Expression of the Tn antigen can arise as a consequence of mutations in the genes for T\u2010synthase or Cosmc, or genes affecting other steps of O\u2010glycosylation pathways. Because of the association of the Tn antigen with disease, there is much interest in the development of Tn\u2010based vaccines and other therapeutic approaches based on Tn expression.","publish_time":"2011-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ju, Tongzhong; Otto, Vivianne I.; Cummings, Richard D.","journal":"Angew Chem Int Ed Engl","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a30e64267a451d39d0b281f62aca7ef5751a0e0a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159538.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159538/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs1OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Tn expression","Tn antigen","development of Tn","synthase","Expression of active T","steps of O","type O","Glycoproteins","genes","glycans","major types","animal cells","based vaccines","variety of glycan structures","different types of sugar","molecular chaperone Cosmc","Golgi apparatus of cells","threonine residues","glycosidic \u03B1 linkage","galactosamine","serine","GalNAc\u03B11","amino acid linkages","therapeutic approaches","acetyl","cancer","abnormal mucin","human disorders","Asn","consequence of mutations","specific galactosyltransferase","simple structure","glycosylation pathways","association","disease","X chromosome","glycoconjugates"],"language":"en"},

In infants younger than 1 year of age, the major agents were enteroviruses, herpes simplex virus, and the group of \u201Cothers,\u201D whereas in older children, respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma Pneumoniae as well as varicella\u2010zoster virus, dominated. In children aged 1 to 11 months, the causal agent could not be identified in one\u2010half of all cases, whereas in children who were at least 10 years old, the etiology remained unknown in only one\u2010fourth of cases. Male dominance was most evident in the 4\u2010 to 9\u2010year age group. The difference in etiology between males and females was significant (p = 0.02); mumps and varicella were more common in boys, and adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were more common in girls.

The pathogenesis of three human demyelinating diseases of known viral etiology is discussed. In progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a papovavirus selectively infects oligodendrocytes and causes focal areas of demyelination. In postmeasles encephalomyelitis, the virus is lymphotrophic and disrupts immune regulation that can result in an autoimmune perivenular demyelinating illness without evidence of infection of the central nervous system. In human immunodeficiency virus\u2010encephalopathy and myelopathy virus is present in macrophages and microglia and the myelin abnormalities apparently are caused by soluble factors such as viral proteins, cytokines, or neurotoxins.

Based upon reconstructed phylogenies for the higher gerromorphan taxa, the hypothesis that the hygropetric zone is the ancestral one is confirmed for the Mesoveliidae, Hebridae and the clade comprising the Paraphrynoveliidae, Macroveliidae and Hydrometridae, but not for the Hermatobatidae and Veliidae. There is no support for the hypothesis that the intersection zone was a sort of transitional zone during the ecological evolution of pleustonic bugs. It is shown that the unique morphological and behavioural traits of the most derived members of this group evolved after inferred historical changes in environmental conditions and therefore qualify as adaptations in the sense ofGould and Vrba (1982),Coddington (1988) andBaum and Larson (1991).

Paper lateral flow biosensors (LFBs) have been established as attractive tools for such analytical applications. In the present study a prototype LFB was designed for whole particles (virions) detection of nodavirus or fish nervous necrosis virus. Nodavirus is an important threat in the aquaculture industry, causing severe economic losses and environmental problems. The LFB was based on polyclonal antibodies conjugated on gold nanoparticles for signal visualization. Brain and retinas from fish samples were homogenized, centrifuged and the supernatant was directly applied on the LFB. Formation of a red test line was indicative of nodavirus virions presence. Nodavirus visual detection was completed in short time (30 min). Key factors of the LFB development influencing the assays\u2019 detection limit were characterized and the optimum parameters were determined, enabling increased efficiency, excluding non-specific interactions. Therefore, the proposed LFB assay consists a robust, simple, low cost and accurate method for detection of nodavirus virions in fish samples. The proposed biosensor is ideal for development of a commercial kit to be used on aquaculture facilities by fish farmers. It is anticipated that disease monitoring and environmental safety will benefit from the simplification of time consuming and costly procedures.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Toubanaki, Dimitra K.; Margaroni, Maritsa; Prapas, Athanasios; Karagouni, Evdokia","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/70e13373ff4531525b42fcc0b89dea5318b0b3cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162894.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162894/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs4NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Nodavirus"],"organizations":["LFB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of nodavirus virions","Nodavirus visual detection","LFB development","fish samples","prototype LFB","proposed LFB assay","indicative of nodavirus virions presence","fish farmers","sensitive detection methods","assays\u2019 detection limit","fish nervous necrosis virus","aquaculture industry","aquaculture facilities","environmental safety","environmental problems","short time","proposed biosensor","simplification of time consuming","accurate method","veterinary diseases","severe economic losses","low cost","red test line","LFBs","field","gold nanoparticles","increased efficiency","commercial kit","polyclonal antibodies","research laboratory setups","Paper lateral flow biosensors","Effective analysis of pathogens","costly procedures","optimum parameters","important threat","attractive tools","routine diagnosis","signal visualization","analytical applications","non-specific interactions","Formation","disease monitoring","present study","Brain","retinas","Key factors","supernatant"],"language":"en"},

Beyond the actomyosin interaction, there is not yet a unified theory explaining smooth muscle contraction, mainly because the structure of the contractile unit in smooth muscle (akin to the sarcomere in striated muscle) is still undefined.

The simulations are performed under a variety of conditions such as light breathing and constant flow ventilation (which is characterized by very rapid acceleration and deceleration). All results show that the peripheral vessels significantly impact the pressure, however, the flow is relatively unaffected, reinforcing the fact that the majority of the lung impedance is due to the lower generations rather than the peripheral vessels. Furthermore, simulations of a hypothetical diseased lung (restricted flow in the superior left lobe) under mechanical ventilation show that the mean pressure at the outlets of the 3D domain is about 28% higher. This hypothetical model illustrates potential causes of volutrauma in the human lung and furthermore demonstrates how different clinical scenarios can be studied without the need to assume the unknown flow distribution into the downstream region.","publish_time":"2010-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Comerford, Andrew; F\u00F6rster, Christiane; Wall, Wolfgang A.","journal":"J Biomech Eng","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/730e055a1fd55b544694fb716af1bda59eb54e74.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164507.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164507/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs5NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["D domain","restricted flow","peripheral vessels","constant flow ventilation","hypothetical diseased lung","lung impedance","unknown flow distribution","nonimageable vessels","simulations","utilized structured tree","structured tree outflow boundary conditions","mechanical ventilation","variety of conditions","hypothetical model","mean pressure","different scales","different clinical scenarios","patient specific human lungs","airflow","superior left lobe","light breathing","potential causes of volutrauma","lower generations","need","downstream region","outlets","fact","majority","Dirichlet","paper","Neumann approach","rapid acceleration","deceleration","coupling","results"],"language":"en"},

The alveolar size and aspect ratio change with generation number. Due to successive bifurcation, the flow velocity magnitude also decreases as the bronchiole diameter decreases from the upper to lower acini. As a result, fluid dynamic parameters such as Reynolds (Re) and Womersley (\u03B1) numbers progressively decrease with increasing generation number. In order to characterize alveolar flow patterns and inhaled particle transport during synchronous ventilation, we have conducted measurements for a range of dimensionless parameters physiologically relevant to the upper acini. Acinar airflow patterns were measured using a simplified in vitro alveolar model consisting of a single transparent elastic truncated sphere (representing the alveolus) mounted over a circular hole on the side of a rigid circular tube (representing the bronchiole). The model alveolus was capable of expanding and contracting in-phase with the oscillatory flow through the bronchiole thereby simulating synchronous ventilation. Realistic breathing conditions were achieved by exercising the model over a range of progressively varying geometric and dynamic parameters to simulate the environment within several generations of the acinar tree. Particle image velocimetry was used to measure the resulting flow patterns. Next, we used the measured flow fields to calculate particle trajectories to obtain particle transport and deposition statistics for massless and finite-size particles under the influence of flow advection and gravity. Our study shows that the geometric parameters (\u03B2 and \u0394V/V) primarily affect the velocity magnitudes, whereas the dynamic parameters (Re and \u03B1) distort the flow symmetry while also altering the velocity magnitudes. Consequently, the dynamic parameters have a greater influence on the particle trajectories and deposition statistics compared to the geometric parameters. The results from this study can benefit pulmonary research into the risk assessment of toxicological inhaled aerosols, and the pharmaceutical industry by providing better insight into the flow patterns and particle transport of inhalable therapeutics in the acini.","publish_time":"2011-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chhabra, Sudhaker; Prasad, Ajay K","journal":"J Fluids Eng","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/960da39d83b809cd9d10258cfbf87404c2db4831.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164511.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164511/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs5NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Reynolds"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["alveolar flow patterns","geometric parameters","flow symmetry","oscillatory flow","resulting flow patterns","particle trajectories","flow velocity magnitude","fluid dynamic parameters","inhaled particle transport","influence of flow advection","measured flow fields","range of dimensionless parameters","alveolar model","upper acini","lower acini","particle transport of inhalable therapeutics","Particle image velocimetry","Acinar airflow patterns","alveolar size","velocity magnitudes","model alveolus","acinar tree","deposition statistics","synchronous ventilation","bronchiole diameter","generations","study","increasing generation number","greater influence","circular hole","finite-size particles","rigid circular tube","risk assessment of toxicological inhaled aerosols","deeper branches","aspect ratio change","single transparent elastic truncated sphere","pharmaceutical industry","higher population density","better insight","pulmonary research","numbers","measurements","\u0394V","successive bifurcation","Reynolds","environment","alveoli","Womersley","gravity","order","Realistic breathing conditions","human lung","bronchioles","results","phase"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, profiling of serological responses can be used to identify biomarkers indicative of exposure to pathogens. Conducting such immune surveillance requires readout methods that are high-throughput, robust, and require small sample volumes. While the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the classical readout method for assessing serological responses, the advent of multiplex assays has significantly increased the throughput and capacity for immunoprofiling. This report describes the development and assay performance (sensitivity, linearity of detection, requirement for multiple dilutions for each sample, intra- and inter-assay variability) of an electro-chemiluminescence (ECLIA)-based multiplex assay. METHODS: The current study describes the development of a multiplex ECLIA-based assay and characterizes the sensitivity, linear range, and inter- and intra-assay variability of the ECLIA platform and its agreement with the traditional ELISA. Special emphasis was placed on potential antigenic competition when testing closely related antigens in the multiplex format. RESULTS: Multiplexing of antigens in ECLIA provides significant practical benefits in terms of reducing sample volume requirements and experimental time. Beyond the practical advantages of multiplexing, the ECLIA provides superior assay performance when compared to the ELISA. Not only does ECLIA show good agreement with the ELISA assay, but the linear range of ECLIA is also sufficiently wide to permit single-dilution measurements of concentration without the need to do serial dilutions. The lack of antigenic competition allows the simultaneous testing of closely related antigens, such as plate antigens representing different alleles of the same protein, which can inform about cross-reactivities\u2014or lack thereof\u2014of serological responses. CONCLUSION: The advantages of the newly developed tool for assessing the antigen profiles of serological responses may ultimately lead to the identification of biomarkers associated with various disease stages and or protection against disease.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bolton, Jessica S.; Chaudhury, Sidhartha; Dutta, Sheetij; Gregory, Scott; Locke, Emily; Pierson, Tony; Bergmann-Leitner, Elke S.","journal":"Malar J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39388b1c693fb41b7c2607a4fc2d9a8358363e31.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165447.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165447/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs5ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ECLIA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ELISA assay","multiplex ECLIA-based assay","intra-assay variability","inter-assay variability","ECLIA platform","superior assay performance","linear range of ECLIA","profiling of serological responses","related antigens","Multiplexing of antigens","Profiling immune responses","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","antigen profiles of serological responses","plate antigens","traditional ELISA","multiplex format","sensitivity","development","lack of antigenic competition","readout methods","identification of biomarkers","practical advantages of multiplexing","advent of multiplex assays","protection","sample volume requirements","small sample volumes","potential antigenic competition","high-throughput","multiple dilutions","good agreement","identification of correlates","immune surveillance","simultaneous testing","serial dilutions","significant practical benefits","classical readout method","various disease stages","biomarkers indicative of exposure","terms","linearity of detection","need","insight","infection","single-dilution measurements of concentration","electro-chemiluminescence","developed tool","experimental time","different alleles","vaccination","Special emphasis","current study","protein","pathogens","BACKGROUND","report","RESULTS","cross-reactivities","capacity","immunoprofiling","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

The constitutive expression of HPV E6 and E7 proteins in CaCx makes them attractive targets for CTL based immunotherapy. However cervical carcinomas may have features, e.g., antigen processing defects, that limit the effectiveness of HPV specific CTL. Furthermore most vaccine development has concentrated on HPV type 16, and it is not clear whether such vaccines could induce CTL able to cross\u2010react on related oncogenic HPV types, e.g., HPV31 and 52. To investigate these potentially important parameters in vitro, we used a CTL (D4) specific for HPV16 E7(11\u201320). D4 was able to kill a variety of HPV16\u002B CaCx cell lines including those with suspected (CaSki) or known antigen processing defects (C33A), and with low HPV DNA copy number (SiHa). D4 was also able to cross react on a related peptide from HPV52 E7 but not HPV31 E7. Further analysis suggested that D4 cross reactivity against related peptides was influenced both by TCR contact residues and a certain threshold for peptide binding. The HPV cross\u2010reactivity was confirmed at the whole protein level as D4 was also able to recognize the endogenously processed forms of HPV16 and 52 E7 but not 31 E7. These results suggest that HPV16 E7(11\u201320) would be a useful epitope for immunotherapy in both HPV 16 and 52 tumours. Despite this, it is difficult to generate these CTL in response to vaccination, emphasizing the need for definition of novel epitopes and more efficient vaccination strategies. \u00A9 2005 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.","publish_time":"2004-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Youde, Sarah J.; McCarthy, Corinna M.; Thomas, Karen J.; Smith, Kelly L.; Man, Stephen","journal":"Int J Cancer","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0aa7e544032d26f7eee624fcf0eaf22e72c861f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165518.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165518/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs5ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HPV cross","HPV16 E7","HPV31 E7","CTL able","effectiveness of HPV specific CTL","E7 proteins","HPV52 E7","related oncogenic HPV types","D4 cross reactivity","constitutive expression of HPV E6","low HPV DNA copy number","variety of HPV16","related peptides","antigen processing defects","processed forms of HPV16","immunotherapy","CaCx cell lines","peptide binding","cervical carcinomas","Cervical cancer","efficient vaccination strategies","certain threshold","definition of novel epitopes","TCR contact residues","attractive targets","need","SiHa","CaSki","features","C33A","infection","response","human papillomavirus","protein level","vaccine development","useful epitope","vaccines","analysis","results","important parameters","Wiley","Liss","tumours"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the Environmental Relative Moldiness Index (ERMI) metric, developed to quantify mold exposures in homes, might be applied to evaluating the mold contamination in schools. METHODS: Settled dust samples (n = 10) were collected on each level of a water\u2010damaged school in Springfield, Massachusetts and two samples per level in five Idaho schools. Each dust sample was analyzed for the 36 molds that make up the ERMI. The concentration of 2.5\u2010\u03BCm particulate matter (PM (2.5)) was measured in each school at two locations during the spring of 2013. RESULTS: The average ERMI value in the Springfield school, 15.51, was significantly greater (p \u003C 0.001) than the average ERMI value, \u22122.87, in the Idaho schools. Ten of the twenty\u2010six Group 1 molds, which are associated with water\u2010damaged environments, were in significantly greater concentrations in the Springfield school. The populations of Group 2 molds, which are common indoors even without water damage, were essentially the same in Springfield and Idaho schools.

This function is deeply involved in cancer cell properties in terms of loss of cell polarity. Recently, two novel aspects of tight junctions have been reported. One is their involvement in signal transduction. The other is that fact that tight junctions are considered to be a crucial component of innate immunity. In addition, since some proteins comprising tight junctions work as receptors for viruses and extracellular stimuli, pathogenic bacteria and viruses target and affect the tight junction functions, leading to diseases.

In latently infected resting CD4(\u002B) T cells HIV\u20101 transcription seems to be repressed by deacetylation events mediated by histone deacetylases (HDACs). Upon reactivation of HIV\u20101 from latency, HDACs are displaced in response to the recruitment of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) by NF\u2010\u03BAB or the viral transcriptional activator Tat and result in multiple acetylation events. Following chromatin remodeling of the viral promoter region, transcription is initiated and leads to the formation of the TAR element. The complex of Tat with p\u2010TEFb then binds the loop structures of TAR RNA thereby positioning CDK9 to phosphorylate the cellular RNA polymerase II. The Tat\u2010TAR\u2010dependent phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II plays an important role in transcriptional elongation as well as in other post\u2010transcriptional events.

In eukaryotic cells, the ubiquitin\u2010proteasome system (UPS) that serves as the major intracellular pathway for protein degradation and modification plays a crucial role in the regulation of many fundamental cellular functions. A growing amount of evidence has suggested that the UPS can be utilized by positive\u2010sense RNA viruses. The UPS eliminates excess viral proteins that prevent viral replication and modulates the function of viral proteins through post\u2010translational modification mediated by ubiquitin or ubiquitin\u2010like proteins. This review will discuss the current understanding of how positive RNA viruses have evolved various mechanisms to usurp the host UPS to modulate the function and stability of viral proteins.

For this reason, interest has been focused on nonantibiotic therapeutic measures directed to the host response rather than the microorganism. The development of an efficacious adjunctive treatment has important implications for reducing mortality in CAP. Some clinical studies performed in the last decade have shown a clinically beneficial effect of corticosteroids, possibly by diminishing local and systemic inflammatory host response. Recent meta-analyses showed faster resolution of symptoms, shorter time to clinically stability, reduction of mechanical ventilation needed, and reduction of mortality in the most severe population, although some methodological limitations must be taken into account. In addition, some studies using statins also suggested improved outcomes due to its anti-inflammatory effect in CAP, although this requires further research. Other adjunctive therapies such as immunoglobulins and stem cells are being explored, but are not yet in the stage of clinical trials. In summary, the use of corticosteroids and other adjuvant treatments are promising in CAP, but more studies are needed to determine their impact on mortality.","publish_time":"2016-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sibila, Oriol; Rodrigo-Troyano, Ana; Torres, Antoni","journal":"Semin Respir Crit Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c2da16a4dcc20430e105210dfc71bbb63a1ec4f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7171709.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7171709/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs3Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CAP","reduction of mortality","clinical studies","beneficial effect of corticosteroids","antibiotic treatments","adjuvant treatments","systemic inflammatory host response","adjunctive therapies","use of corticosteroids","anti-inflammatory effect","efficacious adjunctive treatment","reduction of mechanical ventilation","stage of clinical trials","faster resolution of symptoms","stability","shorter time","improved outcomes","important implications","patients","Recent meta-analyses","severe population","leading cause of hospitalization","methodological limitations","immunoglobulins","statins","morbidity","decade","nonantibiotic therapeutic measures","stem cells","development","pneumonia","advances","account","summary","addition","Community","microorganism","impact","research","reason"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the serological and/or molecular diagnostic performance of minimally and non-invasive samples (conjunctiva cells (CS) and peripheral blood (PB)) for monitoring Leishmania infection/exposure to Phlebotomus perniciosus salivary antigens in dogs at the beginning and the end of sand fly seasonal activity (May and October, respectively) and to assess associated risks factors. METHODS: A total of 208 sheltered dogs from endemic areas of leishmaniosis were screened. Leishmania DNA detection in PB on filter paper and CS was performed by nested-PCR (nPCR), while the detection of anti-Leishmania antibodies was performed using IFAT and ELISA. The exposure to P. perniciosus salivary antigens (SGH, rSP01 and rSP03B \u002B rSP01) was measured by ELISA. RESULTS: Ninety-seven (46.6%) and 116 (55.8%) of the 208 dogs were positive to Leishmania antibodies or DNA by at least one test at the beginning and end of the sand fly season, respectively. IFAT and ELISA presented a substantial agreement in the serodiagnosis of leishmaniosis. Discrepant PB nPCR results were obtained between sampling points. Leishmania DNA was detected in CS of 72 dogs at the end of the phlebotomine season. The presence of antibodies to the parasite measured by ELISA was significantly higher in dogs presenting clinical signs compatible with leishmaniosis at both sampling points. Phlebotomus perniciosus salivary antibodies were detected in 179 (86.1%) and 198 (95.2%) of the screened dogs at the beginning and end of the phlebotomine season, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The association between ELISA positivity and clinical signs suggests its usefulness to confirm a clinical suspicion. CS nPCR seems to be an effective and non-invasive method for assessing early exposure to the parasite. PB nPCR should not be used as the sole diagnostic tool to monitor Leishmania infection. The correlation between the levels of antibodies to P. perniciosus saliva and Leishmania antibodies suggests the use of a humoral response to sand fly salivary antigens as biomarkers of L. infantum infection.

The mechanisms mediating the development of MBD are unknown. In this study, five inbred strains of mice (C57BL/6J, Balb/cByJ, A/J, SJL/J, PL/J) immunosuppressed with either irradiation (IR), cyclophosphamide (CY), or cyclosporin A (CP) along with three immune deficient strains (C57BL/6J nu/nu, Balb/cByJ nu/nu, C57BL/6J bg/bg) were lip inoculated with HSV I to determine the effect of immunosuppression on viral spread throughout the brain and the development of demyelination during the acute stage of infection. Mortality increased in all groups when compared with controls but was greatest in A/J, SJL/J, and PL/J strains, where all mice died before day 6 PI. In contrast with immunocompetent C57BL/6J mice where virus is restricted to the brainstem, virus spread throughout the brain of immunosuppressed C57BL/6J, C57BL/6J nu/nu, and C57BL/6J bg/bg mice. Despite viral spread throughout the brain of immunosuppressed C57BL/6J, C57BL/6J nu/nu, Balb/cByJ and Balb/cByJ nu/nu mice, MBD did not develop. MBD did develop however, in both HSV I infected C57BL/6J bg/bg and CP treated Balb/cByJ mice. Immunosuppression of HSV I infected Balb/cByJ mice prevents the development of demyelination at the trigeminal root entry zone (TREZ) of the brainstem while in Balb/cByJ nu/nu mice, the extent of demyelination at TREZ was reduced and delayed when compared with immunocompetent controls. These results suggest that the immune system plays an important role in limiting viral spread in the brain as well as in the development of demyelination at TREZ and of MBD throughout the brain during the acute phase of infection. Virus alone does not induce MBD in this animal model of virus induced CNS demyelination but is a prerequisite for its development.","publish_time":"2003-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kastrukoff, Lorne F.; Lau, Allen S.; Leung, George Y.; Thomas, Eva E.","journal":"J Neurol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac8d8e1edc44843b31124cfe63b3907b3a5cc714.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172415/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs4MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MBD","HSV","PI","CP","TREZ","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["J bg","nu mice","J strains","cByJ nu","cByJ mice","bg mice","Balb","brain of immunosuppressed C57BL","immunocompetent C57BL","development of demyelination","development of MBD","specific strains of mice","inbred strains of mice","multifocal brain demyelination","extent of demyelination","viral spread","TREZ","Immunosuppression of HSV","animal model of virus induced CNS demyelination","immune deficient strains","CP","SJL","lip inoculation of Herpes simplex virus","brainstem","immunocompetent controls","acute stage of infection","acute phase of infection","immune system","effect of immunosuppression","trigeminal root entry zone","important role","cyclophosphamide","prerequisite","cyclosporin","irradiation","study","contrast","groups","results","day","PI","mechanisms","Mortality"],"language":"en"},

The assay is based upon detection of R-MuLV encoded p30 protein production in virus infected murine cells. The assay reagents are readily available and the assay system is amenable to automated data collection systems. Cytotoxicity evaluations are conducted in parallel to the Rauscher MuLV ELISA assay in order to assess drug-induced reductions in cell viability. Cytotoxicity evaluations are important to interpretation of the ELISA results since reductions in cell viability reduce viral protein production which would indicate an antiviral drug effect.

Methods:During the SARS outbreak, a dedicated paramedic surveillance and quarantine program was developed. The authors determined the number of paramedics on quarantine each day, the type of quarantine (either home quarantine [HQ] or work quarantine [WQ]), and the development of SARS\u2010like symptoms. Results: During the SARS outbreak, there were five cases of probable SARS and three cases of suspect SARS. SARS\u20101 lasted 30 days, during which 234 paramedics were placed on HQ. The total number of HQ days was 1,615. During the five peak days of SARS\u20101, the total number of HQ days was 664. SARS\u20102 lasted 18 days, during which 292 paramedics were placed on either HQ or WQ, for a combined number of quarantine days of 1,637. During the five peak days of SARS\u20102, the combined number of quarantine days was 910. Of these, paramedics were available for duty on 708 days (78%) due to the WQ program. The primary reason for quarantine was unprotected exposure to a health care institution experiencing a SARS outbreak. Under quarantine, SARS\u2010like symptoms developed in 68 paramedics, including cough (53 [78%]), myalgia (33 [48%]), fatigue (30 [44%]), headache (29 [43%]), fever (11 [16%]), and shortness of breath (7 [10%]). Conclusions: Paramedics were among the health care workers who developed SARS. During SARS\u20102, WQ optimized the number of days on which paramedics were available for duty. Many paramedics developed SARS\u2010like symptoms without being diagnosed as having SARS. A dedicated paramedic surveillance and quarantine program provided a useful means to manage the paramedic resource during the SARS outbreak.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Verbeek, P.

Methods:This was a prospective, observational study conducted in the EMS system of Taipei, Taiwan. Probable/suspect cases of SARS were defined by World Health Organization criteria. SARS\u2010related transports were categorized into 1) requests from hospitals for probable/suspect cases of SARS, 2) quarantined individuals, and 3) febrile persons. City ambulances were organized into teams A, B, and C for transports of different perceived risks. Data on the EMS volume, the transport category, the final SARS status of patients, and the EMT responsible for the transports were collected. The EMS projected volume was computed by previous years\u0027 data and compared with that collected. The SARS incidence among EMTs was assessed by investigating probable SARS (P\u2010SARS) and by surveying the seroprevalence of SARS\u2010associated coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) antibody. Results: From March 18 to June 19, 2003, there were 7,961 EMS transports, similar to the volume projected from previous years (7,506) (95% CI = 6,688 to 8,324). Of these, 1,760 (22.1%) were SARS\u2010related. When SARS\u2010related transports were excluded, there was a 12.2% decrease (95% CI = 11.4% to 12.9%) in EMS activities. Requests from hospitals, quarantined individuals, and febrile citizens accounted for 23%, 18%, and 59% of SARS\u2010related transports. Among the 397 P\u2010SARS cases in the city of 2.65 million people (incidence 0.01%, 95% CI = 0.01% to 0.02%), 138 (35%) required EMS transports. Two EMTs working in team C, the team with the lowest risk, developed P\u2010SARS. One of them died soon thereafter. The incidence of P\u2010SARS was 0.6% (95% CI = 0.2% to 2.2%), or 0.1% (95% CI = 0.03% to 0.4%) per transport. SARS\u2010CoV serology was available in 74.1% of EMTs who were alive. In addition to the surviving P\u2010SARS EMT, one EMT from team A, the team with the highest risk, was seropositive. Combining P\u2010SARS and the seropositive case, three EMTs were infected (incidence 1.3%, 95% CI = 0.4% to 3.6%). No patient transported by the infected EMTs developed SARS. The hospitals serving EMS by the infected EMTs had been involved in a clustered outbreak prior to the EMTs\u0027 infections. Conclusions: During the outbreak of SARS, the overall EMS volume did not change significantly, but the non\u2010SARS EMS activities decreased. Compared with the general population, EMS providers are at higher risk of contracting the SARS virus regardless of different perceived levels of risk. Standard protections and procedures for infection control should be strictly followed during transport and within the hospital environment.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chow\u2010In Ko, Patrick; Chen, Wen\u2010Jone; Huei\u2010Ming Ma, Matthew; Chiang, Wen\u2010Chu; Su, Chan\u2010Ping; Huang, Chien\u2010Hua; Lu, Tsung\u2010Chien; Shih, Fuh\u2010Yuan; Lin, Fang\u2010Yue","journal":"Acad Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db213b65f1f167d0ae37153d8c2628cdfaa32327.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7175936/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs5NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EMS","SARS","World Health Organization","EMT"],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["SARS incidence","SARS EMT","outbreak of SARS","SARS cases","probable SARS","SARS virus","seroprevalence of SARS","suspect cases of SARS","non\u2010SARS EMS activities","EMS transports","final SARS status of patients","EMS providers","EMS projected volume","infected EMTs","incidence of P","related transports","overall EMS volume","EMS system of Taipei","incidence of infection","surviving P","team C","hospitals","transports of different perceived risks","higher risk","lowest risk","highest risk","different perceived levels of risk","quarantined individuals","clustered outbreak","EMT responsible","transport category","requests","emergency medical technicians","previous years\u0027 data","utilization of emergency medical services","infection control","seropositive case","observational study","febrile citizens","CoV serology","febrile persons","City ambulances","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","systems","associated coronavirus","Standard protections","procedures","teams","World Health Organization criteria","general population","Taiwan","infections","antibody","addition","hospital environment","people","Conclusions","Methods","Objectives","decrease","Results"],"language":"en"},

Vegetation surveys at corresponding locations on the ground identified five distinct woody vegetation communities defined primarily by water drainage and secondarily by soil characteristics. Air\u2010photo analyses revealed that, contrary to popular perceptions and in contrast to results from other habitats, there has been no generalized net increase in overstorey woody vegetation cover across the full range of lowland savanna habitats. Rather, different habitats exhibited distinctly different vegetation change mechanisms: low\u2010lying seasonally inundated \u2018wet\u2019 habitats have experienced woody vegetation increase since 1948, whereas well\u2010drained \u2018dry\u2019 habitats have experienced overstorey vegetation stability or loss. In almost every instance woody vegetation increase could be attributed to the invasion or proliferation of a single species, Melaleuca minutifolia F.Muell. The extent of M. minutifolia increase was unrelated to historical grazing/fire regime. Demographic analyses for this species revealed that recruitment was often episodic and that synchronized recruitment events occurred uniformly across the full range of historical management treatments, most likely as a consequence of favourable climatic conditions in years with an extended wet season. Heavy grazing facilitated juvenile survival and/or recruitment, most likely by reducing grassy fuel loads and eliminating landscape fire. We conclude that while there has been no generalized net increase in overstorey woody vegetation cover in lowland environments, savanna dynamics are complex, and multiple change mechanisms have occurred simultaneously in different habitats, some of which have been significantly transformed since 1948. Where net woody vegetation increase has occurred it is primarily a natural consequence of episodic M. minutifolia establishment in climatically favourable years, but the extent and magnitude of this effect is likely mediated by fire/grazing regime.","publish_time":"2009-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"SHARP, BEN R.; BOWMAN, DAVID M.

This paper describes modeling the efficacy of vaccination considering the cost and benefit of vaccination to individual players. The model is based on the public goods game and is presented as a spatial game on a lattice. Using this model, individuals can contribute to the public health by paying the cost of vaccination or choose to be protected by the public who is vaccinated rather than pay the cost and share the risk of vaccination. Thus, in this model individuals can choose to stay susceptible, can become infected, or choose to vaccinate once in each episode.

Research attention is now being focused on this possibility, especially in the case of protozoan pathogens which may be the most important as they are often resistant to current methods used in public water treatment. In this review we highlight some of the many factors that are likely to influence the degree of pollution by their effect on both the vertical and horizontal transport of microorganisms through soil. Soil pH, temperature, the presence of plants, microbial surface properties, type of waste, soil type and soil water content and flow may all affect the rate and extent of vertical transport, with the latter two generally considered to be the most important. Lateral movement is a particular problem in soils with impermeable substrata or in waterlogged conditions and in these cases the major factors affecting movement include rainfall rate, topography of the land and the rate at which microorganisms partition into the runoff.","publish_time":"2000-01-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mawdsley, Jane L.; Bardgett, Richard D.; Merry, Roger J.; Pain, Brian F.; Theodorou, Michael K.","journal":"Appl Soil Ecol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135449/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjsxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["soil type","soil water content","Soil pH","water courses","public water treatment","public water supplies","rainfall rate","pathogenic microorganisms","horizontal transport of microorganisms","microorganisms partition","land","extent of vertical transport","type of waste","presence of plants","Lateral movement","major factors","Livestock wastes","microbial surface properties","impermeable substrata","particular problem","soils","waterlogged conditions","cases","bacteria","current methods","topography","flow","effect","viruses","temperature","degree of pollution","potential","catchments","case of protozoan pathogens","environmental contamination","runoff","Research attention","possibility","application","review"],"language":"en"},

Suckling mice born to unimmunized dams rapidly succumb to an acute encephalomyelitis. MHV-JHM can be isolated from the brains and spinal cords of maternal antibody-protected mice when the late onset disease becomes clinically apparent, showing that the virus must be present in these mice when they are still asymptomatic. To determine which cells of the central nervous system (CNS) were potential reservoirs for the virus during the asymptomatic period, tissue sections were assayed simultaneously by immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence staining for the presence of viral antigen and for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for astrocytes.(2) The results indicate that 20% (range 0\u201352%) of the MHV-JHM infected cells in asymptomatic mice were astrocytes. In mice symptomatic with late onset hindlimb paralysis, a higher percentage of infected cells were astrocytes.

The cytokine storm during the second (immune) phase is thought to be a major contributory factor for the leptospirosis disease severity. We aim to summarize evidence for cytokine response in leptospirosis at different clinical outcomes. METHODS: A systematic review was carried out to examine the cytokine response in leptospirosis patients using relevant scientific databases. Reference lists of the selected articles were also screened. Quality of the selected studies was assessed by using the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. RESULTS: Of the 239 articles retrieved in the initial search, 18 studies fulfilled the selection criteria. India and Thailand have produced the highest number of studies (17% each, n = 3). The majority were comparative cross-sectional studies (72%, n = 13). Overall the quality of the selected studies was fair regardless of few drawbacks such as reporting of sample size and the lack of adjustment for confounders. Microscopic agglutination test (67% - 12/18) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (50% - 9/18) were commonly used for the confirmation of leptospirosis and the measurement of cytokines respectively. IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-\u03B1 levels were found to be significantly higher in severe than in mild leptospirosis. There were equivocal findings on the association between IL-1\u03B2, TNF-\u03B1 and IL-10/TNF-\u03B1 ratio and disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Leptospirosis had a wide-range of elevated cytokines. However, prospective studies in-relation to the onset of the symptom are required to better understand the pathophysiology of cytokine response in leptospirosis.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Senavirathna, Indika; Rathish, Devarajan; Agampodi, Suneth","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/59f682a976e99e77e09b8edea3eae6e5f8717d0b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7137275.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7137275/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjsxNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort"],"locations":["India","Thailand"],"keyphrases":["selected studies","leptospirosis patients","mild leptospirosis","confirmation of leptospirosis","leptospirosis disease severity","prospective studies","comparative cross-sectional studies","highest number of studies","pathophysiology of cytokine response","cytokine storm","selected articles","TNF-\u03B1 ratio","TNF-\u03B1 levels","neglected zoonotic disease","major challenge","National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool","elevated cytokines","measurement of cytokines","public health professionals","major contributory factor","Observational Cohort","clinicians","relevant scientific databases","tropical countries","different clinical outcomes","wide-range","lack of adjustment","sample size","relation","drawbacks","association","initial search","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","Thailand","onset","Reference lists","equivocal findings","BACKGROUND","majority","evidence","selection criteria","METHODS","systematic review","Microscopic agglutination test","India","confounders","symptom","phase","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Experimental models have long been used to mimic features of ARDS pathophysiology, but the presence of distinct subphenotypes among preclinical ARDS remains unknown. This review will investigate whether: 1) subphenotypes can be identified among preclinical ARDS models; 2) such subphenotypes can identify some responsive traits. METHODS: We will include comparative preclinical (in vivo and ex vivo) ARDS studies published between 2009 and 2019 in which pre-specified therapies were assessed (interleukin (IL)-10, IL-2, stem cells, beta-agonists, corticosteroids, fibroblast growth factors, modulators of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products pathway, anticoagulants, and halogenated agents) and outcomes compared to a control condition. The primary outcome will be a composite of the four key features of preclinical ARDS as per the American Thoracic Society consensus conference (histologic evidence of lung injury, altered alveolar-capillary barrier, lung inflammatory response, and physiological dysfunction). Secondary outcomes will include the single components of the primary composite outcome, net alveolar fluid clearance, and death. MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases will be searched electronically and data from eligible studies will be extracted, pooled, and analyzed using random-effects models. Individual study reporting will be assessed according to the Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments guidelines. Meta-regressions will be performed to identify subphenotypes prior to comparing outcomes across subphenotypes and treatment effects. DISCUSSION: This study will inform on the presence and underlying pathophysiological features of subphenotypes among preclinical models of ARDS and should help to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to perform preclinical trials of subphenotype-targeted therapies, prior to potential clinical translation.

METHODS: The Delphi technique was used to develop an instrument to assess social contacts, which was then applied in a cross-sectional pilot study. A panel of 15 medical professionals reviewed the feasibility and validity of each item. The minimum content validity ratio was 0.49. Thirty participants used the developed measure to record contacts during a 24-hour period. RESULTS: After a systematic review, the survey instrument (parts I and II) was developed. Part I assessed social contact patterns over a 24-hour period, and part II assessed perceptions of contacts in daily life and preventive behaviors (hand hygiene and coughing etiquette). High validity and feasibility were found. In the pilot study, the 30 participants had a combined total of 198 contacts (mean, 6.6 daily contacts per person). The participants\u2019 age (p=0.012), occupation (p\u003C0.001), household size (p\u003C0.001), education (p\u003C0.001), personal income (p=0.003), and household income (p\u003C0.001) were significantly associated with the number of contacts. Contacts at home, of long duration, and of daily frequency were relatively likely to be physical. Assortative mixing was observed between individuals in their 20s and 50s. Contact type differed by location, duration, and frequency (p\u003C0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The developed social contact survey instrument demonstrated high validity and feasibility, suggesting that it is viable for implementation.","publish_time":"2020-02-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oh, Hyang Soon; Yang, Youngran; Ryu, Mikyung","journal":"J Prev Med Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27ff5c1b188c1c2a63efc307fb86c8788749ee0c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7142013.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7142013/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjsyNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["social contacts","daily contacts","feasibility","number of contacts","developed social contact survey instrument","assessed perceptions of contacts","valid social contact survey instrument","social contact patterns","High validity","daily frequency","Contact type","daily life","hour period","developed measure","household income","cross-sectional pilot study","minimum content validity ratio","long duration","household size","personal income","preventive behaviors","hand hygiene","mean","coughing etiquette","systematic review","combined total","medical professionals","location","CONCLUSIONS","individuals","Korean adults","home","parts","Delphi technique","Assortative mixing","METHODS","panel","RESULTS","participants\u2019 age","item","occupation","education","implementation","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

We hypothesized that differential expression of host genes related to translation and innate immune response could contribute to differential resistance to NDV in inbred Fayoumi and Leghorn lines. The expression of twenty-one genes related to the interferon signaling pathway and the eIF2 family was evaluated at two- and six-days post infection (dpi) in the spleen from both lines, either challenged by NDV or nonchallenged. Higher expression of OASL in NDV challenged versus nonchallenged spleen was observed in Leghorns at 2 dpi. Lower expression of EIF2B5 was found in NDV challenged than nonchallenged Fayoumis and Leghorns at 2 dpi. At 2 dpi, NDV challenged Fayoumis had lower expression of EIF2B5 and EIF2S3 than NDV challenged Leghorns. At 6 dpi, NDV challenged Fayoumis had lower expression of EIF2S3 and EIF2B4 than NDV challenged Leghorns.

Among the common strategies developed by viruses, bacteria, protozoa, helminths, and fungi is the manipulation of the regulatory T cell network in order to favor pathogen survival and transmission. Treg activity also benefits the host in many circumstances by controlling immunopathogenic reactions to infection. Interestingly, some pathogens are able to directly induce the conversion of naive T cells into suppressive Foxp3-expressing Tregs, while others activate pre-existing natural Tregs, in both cases repressing pathogen-specific effector responses. However, Tregs can also act to promote immunity in certain settings, such as in initial stages of infection when effector cells must access the site of infection, and subsequently in ensuring generation of effector memory. Notably, there is little current information on whether infections selectively drive pathogen-specific Tregs, and if so whether these cells are also reactive to self-antigens. Further analysis of specificity, together with a clearer picture of the relative dynamics of Treg subsets over the course of disease, should lead to rational strategies for immune intervention to optimize immunity and eliminate infection.","publish_time":"2011-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maizels, Rick M.; Smith, Katherine A.","journal":"Adv Immunol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150045.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7150045/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjszNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effector cells","pathogen-specific Tregs","immunity","site of infection","pathogen-specific effector responses","pathogen survival","initial stages of infection","pre-existing natural Tregs","conversion of naive T cells","host immune system","generation of effector memory","immune intervention","rational strategies","common strategies","Treg activity","regulatory T cell network","relative dynamics of Treg subsets","order","cases","manipulation","infections","suppressive Foxp3","helminths","viruses","bacteria","portfolio","clearer picture","course of disease","protozoa","fungi","circumstances","certain settings","immunopathogenic reactions","little current information","Infectious agents","self-antigens","sophisticated mechanisms","transmission","analysis of specificity","pathogens"],"language":"en"},

Further, KRRK basic residues of IFITM1 locating at 62\u201367 of the conserved intracellular loop (CIL) were found to play a key role in the restriction on the Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV). Similarly, KRRK basic residues of IFITM2/3 also contributed to suppressing ZIKV replication. Finally, IFITM1 was revealed to be capable of restricting the release of ZIKV particles from endosome to cytosol so as to impede the entry of ZIKV into host cells, which was tightly related with the inhibition of IFITM1 on the acidification of organelles.

Colostrum supplements (CS) have been developed to provide supplemental immunoglobulin when maternal colostrum is of poor quality. However, colostrum replacers (CR) that provide \u2265100 g of IgG have not been formulated. Our objective was to determine the absorption of IgG in newborn calves fed CS derived from bovine serum or CR derived from bovine immunoglobulin concentrate. The CS were prepared by collecting, processing, and spray drying bovine serum and blending with other ingredients to provide 45 to 50 g of IgG per dose. The CR were prepared by further processing bovine serum to increase IgG concentration to \u003E50% IgG and blending with other ingredients to provide 100 to 122 g of IgG per dose. Holstein calves (n = 160) were fed 90 to 244 g of IgG from CS or CR in 1 or 2 feedings in two experiments. Blood was collected from each calf by jugular venipuncture at 0 and 24 h of age and plasma IgG was determined by turbidimetric immunoassay. Apparent efficiency of IgG absorption was calculated. Plasma IgG concentrations at 24 h of age were indicative of IgG intake and averaged 5.5 to 14.1 g/L in calves fed CS and CR. Mean apparent efficiency of IgG absorption in calves fed CS was 25 and 28% in experiments 1 and 2, respectively. Mean apparent efficiency of IgG absorption in calves fed CR ranged from 19 to 32% and were affected by method of processing and number of times fed. Treatment of plasma with polyethylene glycol reduced the efficiency of IgG absorption in experiment 1. The addition of animal fat to CR had no effect on IgG absorption.

There have been no published studies comparing the filtration efficiency test methods used for NIOSH certification of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (N95 FFRs) with those used by the FDA for clearance of SMs. To address this issue, filtration efficiencies of \u201CN95 FFRs\u201D including six N95 FFR models and three surgical N95 FFR models, and three SM models were measured using the NIOSH NaCl aerosol test method, and FDA required particulate filtration efficiency (PFE) and bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE) methods, and viral filtration efficiency (VFE) method. Five samples of each model were tested using each method. Both PFE and BFE tests were done using unneutralized particles as per FDA guidance document. PFE was measured using 0.1 \u00B5m size polystyrene latex particles and BFE with \u223C3.0 \u00B5m size particles containing Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. VFE was obtained using \u223C3.0 \u00B5m size particles containing phiX 174 as the challenge virus and Escherichia coli as the host. Results showed that the efficiencies measured by the NIOSH NaCl method for \u201CN95 FFRs\u201D were from 98.15\u201399.68% compared to 99.74\u201399.99% for PFE, 99.62\u201399.9% for BFE, and 99.8\u201399.9% for VFE methods.

The above results show that the NIOSH NaCl method is relatively conservative and is able to identify poorly performing filtration devices.

Complement system activation can be initiated by three different pathways\u2014classical, alternative, and lectin pathways\u2014resulting in a proteolytic cascade, which culminates in multiple biological processes including opsonization and phagocytosis of intruders, inflammation, cell lysis, and removal of immune complexes and apoptotic cells. Furthermore, it also functions as a link between the innate and adaptive immune responses. The lectin pathway (LP) activation is mediated by serine proteases, termed mannan-binding lectin (MBL)-associated serine proteases (MASPs), which are associated with the pattern recognition molecules (PRMs) that recognize carbohydrates or acetylated compounds on surfaces of pathogens or apoptotic cells. These result in the proteolysis of complement C2 and C4 generating C3 convertase (C4b2a), which carries forward the activation cascade of complements, culminating in the elimination of foreign molecules. This chapter presents an overview of the complement system focusing on the characterization of MASPs and its genes, as well as its functions in the immune response.","publish_time":"2017-06-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Andrade, Fabiana A.; Lidani, K\u00E1rita C.

In contrast to other lung diseases, the entire course of disease in these syndromes is measured in days to weeks rather than months to years, which raises unique challenges in achieving precision medicine. We review advances in sepsis and ARDS resulting from omics studies, including those involving genome-wide association, gene expression, targeted proteomics, and metabolomics approaches. We focus on promising evidence of biological subtypes in both sepsis and ARDS that consistently display high risk for death. In sepsis, a gene expression signature with dysregulated adaptive immune signaling has evidence for a differential response to systemic steroid therapy, whereas in ARDS, a hyperinflammatory pattern identified in plasma using targeted proteomics responded more favorably to randomized interventions including high positive end-expiratory pressure, volume conservative fluid therapy, and simvastatin therapy. These early examples suggest heterogeneous biology that may be challenging to detect by clinical factors alone and speak to the promise of a precision approach that targets the right treatment at the right time to the right patient.","publish_time":"2019-09-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rogers, Angela J.; Meyer, Nuala J.","journal":"Precision in Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/558ba9ec5f66ab9871cedfcea023add273ed964f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120471.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120471/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ARDS","Sepsis","simvastatin therapy","targeted proteomics","right treatment","right time","right patient","gene expression signature","systemic steroid therapy","volume conservative fluid therapy","high risk","precision approach","precision medicine","promising evidence of biological subtypes","high positive end-expiratory pressure","dysregulated adaptive immune","genome-wide association","differential response","acute respiratory distress syndrome","syndromes","interventions","entire course of disease","lung diseases","unique challenges","hyperinflammatory pattern","weeks","months","years","plasma","omics studies","substantial morbidity","metabolomics approaches","early examples","heterogeneous biology","days","promise","mortality","contrast","death","advances"],"language":"en"},

Preclinical results are discussed for new approaches including AMPK activation, the FGF21 target, cell therapy approaches, adiponectin mimetics and novel insulin formulations. Gene-based therapies are among the most promising emerging alternatives to conventional treatments. Therapies based on gene silencing using vector systems to deliver interference RNA to cells (i.e. against VEGF in diabetic retinopathy) are also a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of several diabetic complications.

There is a huge anthropomorphic prejudice that although life is unlikely, the just-right Goldilocks terrestrial conditions mean that the just-right balance of minerals and basic small molecules inevitably result in life as we know it throughout our solar system, galaxy, and the rest of the universe. Moreover, when such conditions on planets such as ours may not be quite right for the origin of life, it is popularly opined that asteroids and comets magically produce life or at the very least, the important, if not crucial components of terrestrial life so that life then blooms, when their fragments cruise the solar system, stars, and galaxies, and plummet onto appropriately bedecked planets and moons. It is no longer extraordinary to detect extraterrestrial solar systems. Moreover, since extra-solar system space exploration has commenced, this provides the problem of detecting life with enhanced achievability. Small organisms, which replicate outside of a living cell or host, would not be catalogued as viruses. How about viruses that cohabit with life? On the Earth, viruses are a major, if underestimated, condition of life \u2013 will that be the case elsewhere? Detection of extra-solar system viruses, if they exist, requires finding life, since viruses necessitate life to replicate. (It should be noted, though, that viruses could be detected through various types of portable ultra-microscopes, including Electron Microscopes (EM) (scanning and transmission) as well as Atomic Force Microscopes (AFM).) However, extra-solar system detection of life does not oblige that viruses exist ubiquitously. Viruses are important potential components of biospheres because of their multiple interactions and influence on evolution, although viruses are small and obligatory parasitic. In addition, nanotechnology \u2013 living or replicating nano-synthetic machine organisms might also be present out there, and require consideration as well. An imposing caveat is that, if found, could some extraterrestrial viruses and synthetic nanotechnological microorganisms infect humans? Possibly, intelligence and cognition may at times be contemporaneous with life. Concomitantly, life and viruses that may be detected, could well be impacted upon by intelligences existing on such exoplanets (and vice versa). Coming to an understanding of the plurality of extraterrestrial intelligence is an optimal objective, in order to avoid causing harm on exoplanets, as well as avoiding conflict and possible human devastation. This is especially the case if we encounter greatly advanced galactic-level civilizations, compared to terrestrial civilizations. Their machine and bionic technologies on the Dyson engineering civilization scale may be prominently superior to ours; their biological expertise may be similarly critically radical. For example, they may use viruses for purposes for which we are barely aware, and which could be utterly deadly for humans. A series of steps is being taken in space exploration. Scientists hypothesize and claim that types of life may be near the Earth, in the solar system, and outside the solar system, similar to ours in the sense that only such conditions, Goldilocks conditions, are key sine qua non requirements, based on our terrestrial chemistry and biochemistry. If detected within the solar system, will life or its remnants resemble terrestrial life? Outside the solar system a similar chauvinism exists, although the likelihood for life, in any event, remains probably low, according to more cautious approaches to the problem. The study of our solar system includes planets, asteroids, comets, and other planetesimals that have been in overall contiguity during several billion years; anthropomorphisms claims life consequently has been developing along terrestrial-type mechanisms. However, a non-anthropomorphic view would surmise, probably not, especially for extra-solar system locales. The prime warning and admonition in all these deliberations is the contamination and damage, which current and past practice and procedures has caused and continues, due to insufficient biocontainment concepts and technology to date. Advances in the development of robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), and high capacity ultrafast quantum computers (QC) greatly enhance the sophisticated control and logical development of extra-solar system studies. Consequently, future long-range manned space exploration seems unwarranted. Clearly, reduced dangers to human health and safety, will result from the use of intelligent machine-based investigations and besides, with increased cost-effectiveness. Space exploration comes at great cost to humanity as a whole and utilizes global resources. Consequently, appropriate organizational measures and planning/cooperation need to be in place. Moreover, the bottom line is that despite all the slogans and claims, there have been next to no financial benefits to our planet as a whole. Such financial and heedless difficulties need to be addressed, the sooner the better. In addition, prior to exposure to exoplanetary life, deep understanding of the problems of infectious diseases and immune dysfunction risks are needed. In addition, global efforts should avoid serendipity and stochasticity as this work should be directed with long-term organization, commitment, scientific, and technological methodology. This chapter briefly reviews such questions assuming a new paradigm for oversight of extrasolar system viral investigations including intelligence and life. Finances are included as an essential adjunct.","publish_time":"2019-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shapshak, Paul","journal":"Global Virology III: Virology in the 21st Century","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fee95f0347ce52008cf563aef6795c52d67b80ac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120930.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120930/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjszMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Electron Microscopes","Atomic Force Microscopes"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["types of life","condition of life","origin of life","extra-solar system detection of life","extraterrestrial viruses","Detection of extra-solar system viruses","crucial components of terrestrial life","extra-solar system space exploration","extraterrestrial solar systems","terrestrial civilizations","right Goldilocks terrestrial conditions","Goldilocks conditions","terrestrial chemistry","Small organisms","Electron Microscopes","plurality of extraterrestrial intelligence","large problem","humans","Earth","exoplanets","case","nano-synthetic machine organisms","Atomic Force Microscopes","basic small molecules","right balance of minerals","important potential components of biospheres","similar chauvinism","bedecked planets","living cell","synthetic nanotechnological microorganisms","various types of portable","advanced galactic-level civilizations","Dyson engineering civilization scale","bionic technologies","multiple interactions","plummet","influence","evolution","galaxies","stars","fragments","optimal objective","key sine","transmission","conflict","order","scanning","requirements","times","likelihood","blooms","huge anthropomorphic prejudice","remnants","biological expertise","possible human devastation","moons","cognition","cautious approaches","Astrovirology","Astrobiology","AFM","understanding","event","sense","enhanced achievability","galaxy","nanotechnology","host","harm","series of steps","biochemistry","purposes","asteroids","comets","imposing caveat","addition","universe","consideration","intelligences","Scientists","example","chapter","extra-solar system locales","logical development of extra-solar system studies","exoplanetary life","claims","oversight of extrasolar system viral investigations","development of robotics","artificial intelligence","global efforts","global resources","financial benefits","future long-range manned space exploration","use of intelligent machine-based investigations","QC","problems of infectious diseases","deep understanding","high capacity ultrafast quantum computers","new paradigm","sophisticated control","cooperation","commitment","safety","serendipity","exposure","planets","immune dysfunction risks","deliberations","damage","insufficient biocontainment concepts","technology","date","appropriate organizational measures","planning","reduced dangers","human health","planetesimals","work","long-term organization","questions","stochasticity","years","humanity","great cost","overall contiguity","admonition","past practice","technological methodology","anthropomorphisms","study","prime warning","increased cost-effectiveness","terrestrial-type mechanisms","non-anthropomorphic view","Finances","essential adjunct","procedures","contamination","slogans","heedless difficulties","Advances","line","place"],"language":"en"},

Epiglottitis, which used to be prevalent in children under age 5, is now seen more often in adults than in children. This decline in childhood epiglottitis is due to the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine. Streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, are now important causes of epiglottitis. Croup is a viral infection, usually due to parainfluenza virus, that primarily affects children ages 6 months to 3 years old. Epiglottitis and croup can cause life-threatening loss of the airway, and misdiagnosis or mismanagement can result in fatalities.

It should be noted, however, that the population health management owes much to the effective delivery of clinical care. This chapter demonstrates how public health is intimately linked to patient care through human movement. Nearly a century ago, people typically did not develop a disease where it is contracted or even close to that place. Today, daily travel is a common way of life in modern metropolitan areas. Large, localized mosquito populations in areas that people visit regularly may be both reservoirs and hubs of infection, even if people only pass through those locations briefly.

Greater overall biodiversity could lead to a greater diversity of hosts and thus of pathogens. Yet disease regulation \u2013 due to the buffering role of host diversity \u2013 is considered to be one of the services provided by biodiversity. In this chapter, we ask how biodiversity is linked to infectious disease. First, we investigate the influence of the biodiversity of pathogens. We highlight that the number of pathogen species is not well known but that new findings are facilitated by the rapid expansion of molecular techniques. We show that, although there is a trend to find higher pathogen richness toward the equator, identifying a global pattern between the richness of all pathogen species and their latitudinal distribution is challenging. We emphasize that pathogen intraspecific diversity is a crucial factor in disease emergence and allows pathogens to adapt to the selective pressures they face. In addition, the selective pressure acting on hosts due to parasite, and reinforced by parasite diversity within hosts seems to be a major evolutionary and ecological force shaping hosts biodiversity. Second, we investigate how the diversity of hosts influences infectious disease ecology. For multi-host diseases, a change in host species richness or abundance can modify the dynamics of local infectious diseases by either reducing (\u201Cdilution effect\u201D) or increasing (\u201Camplification effect\u201D) the risk of transmission to the targeted host species. The underlying hypothesis is that, the competence of reservoirs varies according to the host species. The dilution effect has been demonstrated mainly through theoretical work and there have been only few case studies. Regarding the genetic diversity of host, an important issue is: to what extent does a reduction of this diversity impact the ability of the host population to response to infectious diseases? Third, we rapidly examine the role of biodiversity in the treatment of infectious diseases. To conclude, we consider that the consequences of the loss of species biodiversity on infectious diseases is still largely unknown, notably due to the lack of knowledge on the dynamics of host-pathogen relationships, especially at the population and at the community level.. We highlight that work on multi-host/ ulti-pathogen systems should be fostered and that new approaches, such as metagenomic investigations that does not require a priori assumptions, are promising to describe a community of pathogens and their interactions.","publish_time":"2011-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vourc\u2019h, Gwena\u00EBl; Plantard, Olivier; Morand, Serge","journal":"New Frontiers of Molecular Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9b8fc086d5e8f7a3599048738bd39a1794b2d5af.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121084.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121084/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjszOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hosts biodiversity","host species richness","biodiversity of pathogens","multi-host diseases","genetic diversity of host","dynamics of host","host population","targeted host species","new infectious diseases","loss of species biodiversity","role of biodiversity","buffering role of host diversity","treatment of infectious diseases","pathogen intraspecific diversity","greater diversity of hosts","parasite diversity","number of pathogen species","dynamics of local infectious diseases","infectious disease ecology","Greater overall biodiversity","pathogen relationships","higher pathogen richness","community of pathogens","ulti-pathogen systems","disease emergence","disease regulation","dilution effect","new approaches","new findings","amplification effect","selective pressures","community level","theoretical work","increasing rate","change","crucial factor","abundance","equator","ecological force","risk of transmission","ability","response","important issue","unprecedented scale","extent","rapid expansion of molecular techniques","metagenomic investigations","global pattern","lack of knowledge","competence of reservoirs","reduction","trend","latitudinal distribution","consequences","underlying hypothesis","addition","past years","interactions","influence","case studies","assumptions","services","chapter"],"language":"en"},

The second category includes new risk factor(s) that were not known to be associated with a specific EOLD, and thus the association between the agent and the new condition could be easily missed.

These include various infections caused by influenza viruses, human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), human T-cell leukemia viruses (HTLV), Torque teno viruses (TTV), parvoviruses, adenoviruses, hepatitis B virus, polyomaviruses, herpesviruses, and papillomaviruses. Detection of viral RNA splicing for active viral gene expression in a clinical sample is a nucleic acid-based detection. The interpretation of the detected viral RNA splicing results is straightforward without concern for carry-over DNA contamination, because the spliced RNA is smaller than its corresponding DNA template. Although many methods can be used, a simple method to detect viral RNA splicing is reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In principle, the detection of spliced RNA transcripts by RT-PCR depends on amplicon selection and primer design. The most common approach is the amplification over the intron regions by a set of primers in flanking exons. A larger product than the predicted size of smaller, spliced RNA is in general an unspliced RNA or contaminating viral genomic DNA. A spliced mRNA always gives a smaller RT-PCR product than its unspliced RNA due to removal of intron sequences by RNA splicing. The contaminating viral DNA can be determined by a minus RT amplification (PCR). Alternatively, specific amplification of a spliced RNA can be obtained by using an exon-exon junction primer because the sequence at exon-exon junction is not present in the unspliced RNA nor in viral genomic DNA.","publish_time":"2018-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Majerciak, Vladimir; Zheng, Zhi-Ming","journal":"Advanced Techniques in Diagnostic Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e01695fa634f9a9c68794eb36274230521cb7388.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121103.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121103/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs0MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","RT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral RNA splicing","detection of viral RNA","unspliced RNA","detected viral RNA","detection of spliced RNA transcripts","viral genomic DNA","contaminating viral DNA","smaller RT-PCR product","spliced mRNA","exon-exon junction primer","active viral gene expression","minus RT amplification","influenza viruses","human immunodeficiency viruses","carry-over DNA contamination","corresponding DNA template","Torque teno viruses","specific amplification","human T-cell leukemia viruses","clinical diagnosis of virus infections","nucleic acid-based detection","predicted size of smaller","clinical sample","intron regions","primer design","larger product","various infections","hepatitis B virus","removal of intron sequences","parvoviruses","reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","HTLV","HIV","new tool","polyomaviruses","adenoviruses","concern","results","set of primers","herpesviruses","TTV","amplicon selection","simple method","flanking exons","interpretation","principle","common approach","papillomaviruses","methods","chapter"],"language":"en"},

Thus, it is important to assess the extent of immunologic decline in both patients suffering from various diseases and in healthy people in order to maintain healthy conditions. To this end, we have developed a scoring system that analyzes immune parameters according to a database of known age-associated immune changes obtained from a healthy population. Using this scoring system, we can combine several different immunological parameters and express the immune status of individuals as a simple numeral.

The point was made that these argument forms have relevance to the epidemiologists and public health scientists whose task it was to identify and respond to this emerging infectious disease. However, this point requires some explanatory work if it is to have more than a very general application to the work of these public health professionals. For these professionals might ask with some justification why they should treat seriously argument forms that have been deemed to be logically inadequate by generations of philosophers. They might also wonder if philosophical discussion of reasoning has anything but the most abstract lessons for scientists who are charged with containing infectious diseases. In this chapter, I undertake this explanatory work by arguing that philosophical contributions on reasoning and argument are not only relevant to epidemiology, but that they also represent the very best prospect for investigators of addressing some of the criticisms of epidemiology that have been raised in recent years. These criticisms have been expressed most clearly by Christakos et al. (2005), although other theorists have also added their voices to the exchange.","publish_time":"2010-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cummings, Louise","journal":"Rethinking the BSE Crisis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75e8e7ef445abbe5fe3288f1a8f8da9228e20c6a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121386.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121386/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs1NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of argument forms","explanatory work","public health scientists","public health professionals","philosophical discussion of reasoning","point","criticisms of epidemiology","chapter","fallacious modes of reasoning","emerging infectious disease","philosophical contributions","generations of philosophers","infectious diseases","new brain disease","epidemiologists","relevance","task","investigators","cattle","scientific inquiry","abstract lessons","general application","voices","best prospect","BSE","justification","recent years","theorists","exchange","Christakos"],"language":"en"},

The presence of variability impacts significantly on the success of clinical trials and failure to identify this variability can result in the clinical trial being under-powdered to detect a treatment effect.

Since IBV was first described in 1936, many serotypes and variants of IBV have been isolated worldwide. IBV isolates are capable of infecting a large range of epithelial surfaces of the chicken, involving the respiratory, renal, and reproductive systems; however, the clinical signs are usually not specific for differential diagnoses. Virus isolation is commonly used for diagnosis of IBV infection, which was achieved through passage of clinical materials via the allantoic route of embryos. Currently, more sensitive molecular approaches for the detection of avian pathogens have been developed, including reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time RT-PCR, which are more suitable for use in diagnostic laboratories. In this chapter, we describe a one-step RT-PCR which can be used for detecting most of IBV serotypes in the IBV-infected allantoic fluid and has been used routinely in our laboratories for detection of IBVs.","publish_time":"2015-09-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Junfeng; Liu, Shengwang","journal":"Animal Coronaviruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bcd69ddb3c53f5553ea3a45f6db6344ff8b17534.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121479.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121479/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs1OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV serotypes","IBV isolates","variants of IBV","diagnosis of IBV infection","IBV-infected allantoic fluid","real-time RT-PCR","one-step RT-PCR","detection of avian pathogens","chicken Gammacoronavirus","clinical signs","Avian infectious bronchitis virus","detection of IBVs","Virus isolation","diagnostic laboratories","major poultry pathogen","passage of clinical materials","intensive poultry production","allantoic route of embryos","reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","large range of epithelial surfaces","reproductive systems","regions","sensitive molecular approaches","use","differential diagnoses","chapter"],"language":"en"},

New treatments and anti-HIV drugs are being continuously developed with the aim to control and cure AIDS. The anti-HIV drugs that are in use usually target HIV entry and replication inside the host cells. However, these drugs are only partially effective in slowing the rate of HIV replication. Nevertheless, the virus manages to replicate at much slower rates even when anti-retroviral treatment is ongoing. The HIV seropositives who are on anti-retroviral treatment for long periods of time are now developing different kinds of other complications including neuroAIDS.

Current approaches to addressing threats to societal health security are discussed, along with the role to be played by international affairs.

Most risk assessments in food and environmental virology performed in the last decade have focused on water, fresh produce, molluscan shellfish, and prepared foods. Recent examples of enteric virus risk modeling efforts are discussed in detail, as are several of the difficulties and intricacies of performing risk assessments for foodborne viruses compared to bacteria and other agents.

Furthermore, infectious simulation of Ebola haemorrhagic fever and Zika fever, which have not yet any effective vaccine, is also implemented in the model. As results of experiments using the model, it has been found that preventive vaccine, antiviral medicine stocks and the number of medical staff are crucial factors to prevent the spread.

The \u201Cmilieu enterieur\u201D has to be stabilised in spite of the variable external and internal conditions of toxic, osmotic, microbial and climatic environmental circumstances. This first line of barriers is composed of skin and mucous membranes of complicated structures. A second line of barrier system is present in our organisms. Certain organs have to be separated from the immune system and other parts of the body because of evolutionary reasons (eye-bulb and testicles) because of unique proteins \u201Cunknown\u201D for the acquired immune system. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is providing enhanced safety circumstances for the central nervous system. The second line of barriers is represented by the special properties of the capillary endothelial system. The maternal-fetal barrier is the most complex. At the maternal fetal interface two individuals of two different haplotypes has to be live 9 months separated by a very complicated dynamic barrier. The placenta is the organ, which is separating the maternal and fetal tissues. Similar to others the bidirectional transport of gasses, metabolites, cells, proteins, regulatory substances, are transported by active or passive transcellular and intercellular mechanisms. The fetal immune system develops immunotolerance to all maternal cells and antigens transferred transplacentally. The problem is to mitigate the maternal immune system to tolerate the paternal haplotype of the fetus. In the case of normal pregnancy a complex series of physiological modifications can solve the problem without harmful consequences to the mother and fetus. The outermost contact cells of trophoblasts express instead of HLA-class Ia and class II antigens non-variable HLA-C, HLA-E, HLA-F and HLA-G antigens. The first consequence of this is reduction of the activity of maternal natural killer cells and maternal dendritic cells; Progesteron, micro-RNA and mediators influence the development of T effector-cells. The production of soluble HLA-G(5 and 6) and IL-10 supports the differentiation of Th-2 CD4(\u002B) helper cells, reducing the ability of maternal cells to kill fetal cells. Series of receptors and costimulators are expressed by the different lines of semi-allogenic trophoblast cells to bind HLA-G and mitigate maternal immune response; The maternal immunotolerance is further facilitated by the activation of CD4(\u002B)CD25(bright)Foxp3(\u002B) regulatory T (T(REG)) cells. Infections have to be prevented during pregnancy. The cells of placenta express 10 Toll-like receptors a group of pattern recognition receptors responsible for innate immunity. The interferon level is also higher in the placental tissues than in the somatic fetal or maternal cells. The complement system is also adapted to the requirements of the pregnancy and fetal damage is inhibited by the production of \u201Cassymmetric IgG antibodies\u201D under hormonal and placental-regulation. These modifications prevent the activation of complement, cytotoxic activity, opsonising ability, antigen clearance and precipitating activity of the molecules. The Achilles\u2019 heels of the different barriers are regularly found by virus infections. Lamina cribrosa of the blood-brain barrier, optical nerve of the eyes, etc. the risk factors of the maternal-fetal barrier has been summarised in Table 1.1.","publish_time":"2012-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berencsi, Gy\u00F6rgy; Tak\u00E1cs, Maria","journal":"Maternal Fetal Transmission of Human Viruses and their Influence on Tumorigenesis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/207f90f000d19d0c72e3cdac5b31117b3a3ae562.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121758.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121758/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs3Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lamina"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fetal cells","ability of maternal cells","maternal dendritic cells","maternal-fetal barrier","maternal immune system","cells of placenta","maternal immunotolerance","helper cells","maternal fetal interface","fetal immune system","activity of maternal natural killer cells","maternal immune response","line of barrier system","fetal tissues","complement system","development of T effector-cells","fetal damage","HLA-G antigens","HLA-E","HLA-F","outermost contact cells of trophoblasts","different barriers","line of barriers","HLA-class Ia","different lines of semi-allogenic trophoblast cells","blood-brain barrier","central nervous system","capillary endothelial system","production of soluble HLA-G","complicated dynamic barrier","antigens non-variable HLA-C","Series of receptors","regulatory T","precipitating activity","cytotoxic activity","different haplotypes","placental tissues","activation of CD4","problem","activation of complement","fetus","complex series of physiological modifications","case of normal pregnancy","opsonising ability","regulatory substances","unique proteins","placental-regulation","internal surroundings","human body","virus infections","group of pattern recognition receptors responsible","enhanced safety circumstances","internal conditions of toxic","climatic environmental circumstances","mucous membranes of complicated structures","antigen clearance","Progesteron","micro-RNA","testicles","mediators","skin","metabolites","BBB","eye-bulb","evolutionary reasons","innate immunity","eyes","optical nerve","special properties","parts","individuals","assymmetric IgG antibodies","bidirectional transport of gasses","harmful consequences","risk factors","paternal haplotype","intercellular mechanisms","mother","CD25","Foxp3","costimulators","reduction","Toll","requirements","Lamina cribrosa","months","molecules","spite","Achilles\u2019 heels","organisms","interferon level","differentiation of Th","Table","milieu enterieur","Certain organs"],"language":"en"},

This chapter will focus on pediatric community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), immunocompromised pneumonia, and aspiration pneumonia. The pathogenesis for developing pneumonia varies; it can occur by direct inhalation of infectious particles in the air or aspiration, direct extension from the upper airways, and hematogenous spread. There are multiple levels of defense against pathogen invasion including anatomic barriers, as well as innate and adaptive immunity, which may be compromised in PICU patients. The etiologies of pediatric pneumonia vary depending on age, host condition, and environmental factors like time of year and location. Viruses remain the most common form of lower respiratory tract infection in children, especially in neonates. Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia continues to be most prevalent in younger children as well, most often affecting children less than 5 years of age who are otherwise healthy. Despite immunizations and public health initiatives, the most common bacterial causes of CAP have remained largely unchanged over the last several decades and include: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae (including non-typable strains) and Moraxella catarrhalis. Pulmonary infection in an immunocompromised host provides a much broader differential and must be aggressively treated without delay. This chapter will also address various imaging modalities and typical findings with pediatric pneumonia. Methods for pathogen identification are broad and range from non-specific markers of illness to invasive techniques for culture. The mainstay of therapy continues to be antibiotics tailored to the patient and presumed etiology; more novel therapies may include corticosteroids or macrolide antibiotics for immune modulation.

Infact, if injured tissue does not exhibit signs of inflammation this would be considered abnormal and wounds and infections would never heal without inflammation. Secondly, inflammation occurs in living tissue, hence there is need for an adequate blood supply to the tissues in order to exhibit an inflammatory response. The inflammatory response may be triggered by mechanical injury, chemical toxins, and invasion by microorganisms, and hypersensitivity reactions. Three major events occur during the inflammatory response: the blood supply to the affected area is increased substantially, capillary permeability is increased, and leucocytes migrate from the capillary vessels into the surrounding interstitial spaces to the site of inflammation or injury. The inflammatory response represents a complex biological and biochemical process involving cells of the immune system and a plethora of biological mediators. Cell-to-cell communication molecules such as cytokines play an extremely important role in mediating the process of inflammation.

These are particularly important to investigators because accurate prediction of which patients are at greatest risk of PARDS \u2013 both the development of PARDS and worse clinical outcomes after PARDS has been established \u2013 is key to identifying the next generation of diagnostic techniques and preventative strategies. In addition to those risk factors, there are specific disease processes that lead to the development of PARDS, often divided into direct or pulmonary insults and indirect or extrapulmonary insults.

Early upper airway colonization by pathogenic bacteria and microaspiration are the primary pathogenic events leading to VAP. Patients at risk for VAP have defects in structural/mechanical defenses of the respiratory tract. In addition, critical illness, including sepsis, trauma, and postoperative states, is associated with profound defects in both innate and acquired antibacterial immunity, influencing antimicrobial effector functions of both leukocytes and structural/parenchymal cells. Factors present within the lung microenvironment, including alveolar stretch, cyclical atelectasis, changes in oxygen tension, and respiratory tract microbiota, substantially impact antibacterial host responses. Mechanisms accounting for dysregulated immune homeostasis are incompletely understood, but likely involve: (1) alterations in the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines; (2) changes in pathogen recognition receptor and G-protein coupled receptor expression and downstream signaling cascades; and (3) dysregulated cell death responses. Antibiotics and preventive strategies are the mainstay of therapy in patients with VAP. However, novel approaches are needed to reverse immunological reprogramming that occurs during critical illness and/or mechanical ventilation, and to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from immunomodulatory therapy.","publish_time":"2012-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ballinger, Megan N.; Standiford, Theodore J.","journal":"Mucosal Immunology of Acute Bacterial Pneumonia","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/150a194d86e044c8953c81dbae7c2c0b72eaf2b2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121904.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121904/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs4MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VAP","Patients","changes","mechanical defenses","critical illness","common complication of mechanical ventilation","respiratory tract microbiota","antibacterial host responses","pathogenic bacteria","antibacterial immunity","receptor expression","profound defects","mainstay of therapy","dysregulated cell death responses","immunomodulatory therapy","primary pathogenic events","pathogen recognition receptor","dysregulated immune homeostasis","Ventilator-associated pneumonia","microaspiration","oxygen tension","cyclical atelectasis","G-protein","leukocytes","alveolar stretch","sepsis","antimicrobial effector functions","Early upper airway colonization","substantial morbidity","mortality","trauma","lung microenvironment","postoperative states","immunological reprogramming","balance of pro-","health care cost","preventive strategies","anti-inflammatory cytokines","risk","Antibiotics","Mechanisms","parenchymal cells","cascades","addition","novel approaches","alterations","Factors"],"language":"en"},

Anti-inflammation therapies alone are not successful for the reason that disbalance of anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving agents. In the recent researches, the host responses during the course of self-resolving infections are found to have the involvements of specialized pro-resolution mediators (SPMs), namely, lipoxins, resolvins, protectins and maresins. These endogenous lipid metabolites are core signal molecules in the resolution of inflammation, playing a key role in regulating the inflammation and promoting return to homeostasis. Besides, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1, a sensitive marker for oxidative stress) is also known for upregulation in inflammation profiling.

Appreciation of pulmonary pathology in the medicolegal context is important as it frequently contributes to the immediate or underlying mechanisms of death. The primacy of the lungs in breathing and their coordinated function with the cardiovascular system means that \u00ADpulmonary failure can rapidly compromise tissue oxygenation and body chemistry, leading to an alteration in blood pH, hypoxic damage to downstream tissues and ultimately multiorgan failure and death. Moreover, given that the lungs have direct contact with the environment through inhalation and receive approximately 50% of the cardiac output with each beat of the heart, they may be adversely affected by hazardous agents from the outside world or other pathologic processes not primarily located in the lungs. The range of topics discussed herein is limited by design to deaths due to disease and largely foregoes discussion of more forensically relevant issues relating to toxicology or trauma. Furthermore, the content and format of this chapter is not intended to be encyclopedic, but rather attempts to highlight selected issues regarding pulmonary disease of potential relevance to surgical or forensic pathologists who perform medicolegal postmortem examinations.","publish_time":"2011-07-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cunningham, Kris S.; Pollanen, Michael S.","journal":"Forensic Pathology Reviews","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/407284d8852ff557edc0dc4e838026a033f8ee17.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122050.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122050/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs4OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lungs","pulmonary failure","pulmonary disease of potential relevance","potential role of pulmonary disease","Appreciation of pulmonary pathology","cause of death","chapter","underlying mechanisms of death","medicolegal context","multiorgan failure","relevant issues","selected issues","medicolegal postmortem examinations","downstream tissues","forensic pathologists","hypoxic damage","alteration","blood pH","outside world","coordinated function","tissue oxygenation","cardiovascular system","autopsy","body chemistry","direct contact","environment","breathing","opinion","pathologic processes","common pathological entities","beat","hazardous agents","inhalation","toxicology","trauma","design","discussion","cardiac output","heart","content","format","deaths","primacy","range of topics"],"language":"en"},

Important anatomic and imaging criteria for each of these structures will be discussed in this chapter. The normal trachea appears in the PA chest radiograph in the midline. The aortic arch causes slight deviation of the trachea to the right side. This shift is more marked in an expiratory film, due to shortening of the trachea. The transparency of the tracheal lumen normally decreases from cranial to caudal. The maximal width of the trachea is 25 mm (for men) and 21 mm (for women). The right tracheal border, where the trachea is in direct contact with lung tissue, can be traced from the clavicle to the right main bronchus. This border is referred to as the right paratracheal stripe or line and is visible in up to 60% of patients. Its width is normally less than 4 mm. A left paratracheal stripe is generally not visible, because the left tracheal border is in direct contact with the large vessels rather than lung tissue.","publish_time":"2015-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Proschek, Petra; Vogl, Thomas J.","journal":"Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/743fc8c1add5b7abbd9e02dda11b4766875a369c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122111.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122111/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs5MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung tissue","normal trachea","right tracheal border","left tracheal border","right paratracheal stripe","lung hila","lung fissures","soft tissue structures","direct contact","bony structures","tracheal lumen","left paratracheal stripe","right main bronchus","PA chest radiograph","chest radiographs","maximal width","lungs","mediastinum","diaphragm","anatomy","large vessels","slight deviation","interpretation of routine posteroanterior","imaging criteria","aortic arch","clavicle","midline","expiratory film","shift","transparency","chapter","women","patients"],"language":"en"},

Over 50% of those infected die. Prior to 1976, the disease was unknown. No one knows exactly where it came from, but it is postulated that a mutation in an animal virus allowed it to jump species and infect humans. In 1976 simultaneous outbreaks of Ebola occurred in what is now South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). For 20 years, only sporadic cases were seen, but in 1995 a new outbreak occurred killing hundreds in the DRC. Since that time the frequency of these outbreaks has been increasing. It is uncertain why this is occurring, but many associate it with increasing human encroachment into forested areas bringing people and animals into more intimate contact and increased mobility of previously remote population. This chapter will navigate Ebola in the context of global health and security. There are multiple objectives of this chapter. First is to provide a basic understanding of Ebola disease processes and outbreak patterns. Second, is to explore the interplay between social determinants of health and Ebola. The role of technology in spreading Ebola outbreaks will be explained as will Ebola\u2019s potential as a bioweapon. Readers will gain understanding of the link between environmental degradation and Ebola outbreaks. This chapter will be divided into five main sections. These are (1) a case study; (2) Ebola Disease process; (3) Social determinants of health and Ebola; (4) Ebola in the modern era, and (5) the link between Ebola and environmental degradation.","publish_time":"2019-06-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"LaBrunda, Michelle; Amin, Naushad","journal":"Global Health Security","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b8ac3aee6b08fada33ce54b79e49208b08c9fdc4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123219.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123219/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs1MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DRC"],"locations":["Ebola","South Sudan","Democratic Republic"],"keyphrases":["Ebola outbreaks","simultaneous outbreaks of Ebola","basic understanding of Ebola disease processes","chapter","social determinants of health","link","deadliest infectious disease","environmental degradation","modern era","DRC","context of global health","outbreak patterns","new outbreak","increasing human encroachment","people","animals","forested areas","increased mobility","intimate contact","Democratic Republic","remote population","South Sudan","species","animal virus","Congo","associate","security","hundreds","interplay","role of technology","Ebola\u2019s potential","case study","years","sporadic cases","bioweapon","mutation","multiple objectives","time","frequency","Readers","main sections","infected die","humans"],"language":"en"},

RVIs often present with nonspecific symptoms and currently lack effective treatments (Baraldi et al., Ital J Pediatr. 40:65, 2014). Death due to viral bronchiolitis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing nations and industrialized nations alike, and patients with bronchiolitis frequently require intensive care and use of mechanical ventilation (Thompson et al., JAMA 289:179\u2013186, 2003). Infants who acquire RVI during their birth hospitalizations have significantly longer length of stay and are more likely to develop chronic respiratory disease, particularly bronchopulmonary dysplasia (Bennett et al., J Pediatr 161:814\u2013818, 2012). Furthermore, infants with RVIs are often placed on empiric antibiotic therapy, which can frustrate antimicrobial stewardship efforts (Bennett et al., J Pediatr 161:814\u2013818, 2012; Cantey et al., Lancet Infect Dis 2016;16:1178\u20131184). RVIs are also associated with increased costs to both health systems and families due to increased care and lost productivity. In 2016, Zinna et al. (Pediatrics 138:e20161675, 2016) showed that infants with hospital-acquired RVI in the United Kingdom had hospital charges more than double those of uninfected infants. Similarly, the Sentinel-1 Study (Anderson et al., Am J Perinatol 34:51\u201361, 2017) in the United States demonstrated that each hospitalization for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the most common etiological agent of viral bronchiolitis in children age \u003C1 year, costs more than $55,000, even excluding the additional outpatient visits before and after hospitalization.

Although the common cold is a self-limited infection, there are no effective treatments presently available and complications, missed time from work and school, and overall discomfort are not insignificant. Understanding how infections are transmitted may lead to interventions to reduce rates of infection. In order to establish a route of transmission, certain conditions must be met. The virus must be produced and shed at the site of infection. The virus must be deposited in the environment and be able to survive there. The virus must then be able to reach the portal of entry. Finally, interruption of the proposed route of transmission must reduce the incidence of infection under natural conditions. Applying this framework, there is clear evidence in both experimental and home settings that colds can be transmitted via self-inoculation. A small amount of evidence is available relating to large and small particle aerosol transmission. Because rhinovirus is responsible for half of all colds, it has been used as the model to understand how virus is transmitted from one person to another in experimental settings. Rhinovirus has been shown to infect via self-inoculation following hand-to-hand contact with contaminated hands or hand-to-surface contact with contaminated objects in the environment. Similarly, there is convincing evidence that the self-inoculation method of cold virus transmission occurs in the home environment, where colds arre most often transmitted. Aerosol transmission has been studied in the experimental setting and may provide another, albeit less common method for transmission of rhinovirus infection. As more is understood about the transmission of cold viruses, effective methods to interrupt transmission may be devised.","publish_time":"2009-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pappas, Diane E.; Hendley, J.

While the Food and Drug Administration of the United States sought to control antibiotics in animal feed as far back as 1977, only in 2016 were such regulations fully implemented. The farm-level costs of such controls are estimated by the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s Economic Research Service to be minimal, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s estimates of the public health costs of antibiotic resistance without implementing controls are $7 billion annually. The complex interactions which exist between economic interests, regulatory policy, and human and animal health are explored in this chapter.","publish_time":"2018-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Armbruster, Walter J.; Roberts, Tanya","journal":"Food Safety Economics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d86aeaa351fd84dba619bc366143c9b4b075e030.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123476.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123476/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs2NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Food and Drug Administration","US Department of Agriculture\u2019s Economic Research Service","Centers for Disease Control"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["animal health","animal feed","public health costs of antibiotic resistance","antibiotic use","United States","antibiotic-resistant bacteria","United Kingdom","public health implications","controls","chapter","economic interests","food animals","Disease Control","low levels of antibiotics","farm-level costs","US Department of Agriculture\u2019s Economic Research Service","Prevention\u2019s estimates","dramatic increase","political responses","regulatory policy","Centers","impact","related industry","Drug Administration","evidence","complex interactions","Swann Report","regulations"],"language":"en"},

In resource-poor environments, the deployment of technological solutions faces other challenges for success. Lack of stable electrical power, availability of Internet connections, and a workforce that can support the information technology remain barriers to successful implementation.

In 1911, Peyton Rous described viruses as causing sarcomas in poultry. The tumour-inducing virus responsible was later named after him, Rous sarcoma virus. In the following decades, a large number of viruses were discovered that can cause various cancers in poultry and rodents, such as lymphomas, sarcomas and carcinomas. Many of them belong to the family Retroviridae, and were classified into the genera Alpharetrovirus, Betaretrovirus and Gammaretrovirus. Most of these pathogens were isolated from inbred strains of the respective species or from cell cultures; under natural conditions, these strains are likely irrelevant as a cause of cancer in the corresponding species. An exception is feline leukaemia virus (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_18). The tumorigenic potential of oncogenic retroviruses is based on transformationally active proteins. They are similar to cellular products which are ordinarily involved in the regulation of cell division. In contrast to the cellular products, viral oncogene proteins are altered by mutations in such a way that they are not subject to regulatory control, and are thus constitutively active.

This speed of production comes because of 50 years of hard work by virologists worldwide in pharma groups, research laboratories, and government licensing units. The present chapter presents the background framework of influenza vaccine production and its evolution over 50 years. Isolation of the causative virus of influenza in 1933, followed by the discovery of embryonated hen eggs as a substrate, quickly led to the formulation of vaccines. Virus-containing allantoic fluid was inactivated with formalin. The phenomenon of antigenic drift of the virus HA was soon recognized and as WHO began to coordinate the world influenza surveillance, it became easier for manufacturers to select an up-to-date virus. Influenza vaccines remain unique in that the virus strain composition is reviewed yearly, but modern attempts are being made to free manufacturers from this yolk by investigating internal virus proteins including M2e and NP as \u201Cuniversal\u201D vaccines covering all virus subtypes. Recent technical innovations have been the use of Vero and MDCK cells as the virus cell substrate, the testing of two new adjuvants, and the exploration of new presentations to the nose or epidermal layers as DNA or antigen mixtures. The international investment into public health measures for a global human outbreak of avian H5N1 influenza together with a focus of swine influenza H1N1 is leading to enhanced production of conventional vaccine and to a new research searchlight on T-cell epitope vaccines, viral live-attenuated carriers of influenza proteins, and even more innovative substrates to cultivate virus, including plant cells.","publish_time":"2010-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oxford, John; Gilbert, Anthony; Lambkin-Williams, Robert","journal":"Influenza Vaccines for the Future","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/21563705f74e809b410e25c1bf560a89141f7b57.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123788.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123788/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs4NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Influenza vaccines","causative virus of influenza","virus HA","up-to-date virus","virus subtypes","virus cell substrate","internal virus proteins","virus strain composition","world influenza surveillance","formulation of vaccines","background framework of influenza vaccine production","focus of swine influenza H1N1","T-cell epitope vaccines","viral live-attenuated carriers of influenza proteins","new research searchlight","global human outbreak of avian H5N1 influenza","new adjuvants","speed of production","enhanced production of conventional vaccine","exploration of new presentations","research laboratories","MDCK cells","free manufacturers","plant cells","years of hard work","swine flu pandemic","public health measures","epidermal layers","pharma groups","nose","virologists","NP","use of Vero","DNA","M2e","yolk","testing","government licensing units","antigen mixtures","international investment","innovative substrates","evolution","discovery of embryonated hen eggs","phenomenon of antigenic drift","present chapter","Recent technical innovations","modern attempts","allantoic fluid","Isolation","short time frame","formalin"],"language":"en"},

Disasters such as Katrina (2005), Hurricane Sandy (2012), Alberta (Canada) Floods (2013), and Super Typhoon Haiyan (2013) are examples that highlight the vulnerability of communities to natural hazards and the crippling effect they have on the social and economic well-being. Through foresight and scenario planning, such events can be expected but can they be predicted to support resilience and enable suppression of the impacts? With consideration of emerging and systemic risks and inherent uncertainty associated with surprising events, planning for and managing risk, crisis and disasters requires understanding of the outliers that challenge our resilience. \u2018Black Swans\u2019 represent the unpredictable. They represent \u201C\u2026 our misunderstanding of the likelihood of surprises\u201D (Taleb in The black swan: the impact of the highly improbable, 2007). A \u2018Black Swan\u2019 is described by Taleb (2007) as that which is an outlier, that which is outside the realm of regular expectations which carries with it an extreme impact such as natural disasters, market crashes, catastrophic failure of complex socio-technical systems and terrorist events such as 9/11. Sornette (Int J Terraspace Sci Eng 2(1):1\u201318, 2009) identifies a different class of extreme events (outliers) that he calls \u2018Dragon Kings\u2019. Sornette (2009) argues that Dragon Kings may have properties that make them not only identifiable in real time but also predictable. The evolving science on complexity (and, more specifically, on complex networks) and on resilience suggest that modeling and simulation of such extreme events can assist in the predictability and the suppression of low probability extremely high consequence events such as natural hazards (flood, earthquake, wildfire, tsunami, extreme weather), cyber-attacks, and financial events. Furthermore, the science of complex networks is developing rapidly and has fundamentally reshaped our understanding of complexity, potentially leading to innovative methods for the prediction of emergent behavior on natural and technological networks, as well as specific strategies for designing networks that are more resistant (resilient) to both failure and attack. Governments and owners of critical physical and digital infrastructure may benefit from analyses, advice and exercises that involve predictable and suppressible \u201CDragon-King\u201D type of low probability extremely high consequence extreme events, as well as from the utilization of recent advances in complex network theory, to ultimately enhance resiliency.

Their small size makes them ultrafilterable, i.e. they are not retained by bacteria-proof filters. Viruses have evolved over millions of years, and have adapted to specific organisms or their cells. The infectious virus particles, or virions, are composed of proteins and are surrounded in some species of viruses by a lipid membrane, which is referred to as an envelope; the particles contain only one kind of nucleic acid, either DNA or RNA. Viruses do not reproduce by division, such as bacteria, yeasts or other cells, but they replicate in the living cells that they infect. In them, they develop their genomic activity and produce the components from which they are made. They encode neither their own protein synthesis machinery (ribosomes) nor energy-generating metabolic pathways. Therefore, viruses are intracellular parasites. They are able to re-route and modify the course of cellular processes for the optimal execution of their own reproduction. Besides the genetic information encoding their structural components, they additionally possess genes that code for several regulatory active proteins (such as transactivators) and enzymes (e.g. proteases and polymerases).","publish_time":"2013-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Modrow, Susanne; Falke, Dietrich; Truyen, Uwe; Sch\u00E4tzl, Hermann","journal":"Molecular Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7afe7fdee8df6d5204617b093c9f30ba42643fce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123905.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123905/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs5NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["species of viruses","nm","living cells","infectious virus particles","structural components","infectious units","regulatory active proteins","bacteria-proof filters","energy","ribosomes","transactivators","genes","diameters","optimal execution","kind of nucleic acid","course of cellular processes","DNA","code","virions","protein synthesis machinery","enzymes","proteases","RNA","genetic information","circoviruses","lipid membrane","yeasts","division","metabolic pathways","specific organisms","millions of years","small size","polymerases","reproduction","genomic activity","poxviruses","Table","intracellular parasites","envelope"],"language":"en"},

In this scenario, the large-scale production of proteomic data has driven the development of specific bioinformatic tools to assist researchers during the discovery processes. Here, we discuss the main methods, algorithms, and procedures to identify and use biomarkers for clinical and research purposes. In particular, we have been focused on quantitative approaches, the identification of proteotypic peptides, and the classification of samples, using proteomic data. Finally, this chapter is concluded by reporting the integration of experimental data with network datasets, as valuable instrument for identifying alterations that underline the emergence of specific phenotypes.

Endotoxin of Gram-negative bacteria, with their pyrogenic component lipopolysaccaride, is the most potent exogenous pyrogen. Fever is also a common finding in children without obvious evidence of infection, for example hypersensitivity reaction, autoimmune diseases and malignancy. Exogenous pyrogens initiate fever by inducing host cells (primarily macrophages) to produce and release endogenous pyrogens such as interleukin-1, which has multiple biological functions essential for the immune response. Endogenous pyrogens are transmitted to the hypothalamic thermoregulatory centre, specifically organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT), where they induce synthesis of prostaglandins, of which PGE2 is the most important. These raise the thermostatic set point to initiate the febrile response. The hypothalamic thermoregulatory centre accomplishes heat production by inducing shivering and heat conservation through vasoconstriction. At an established degree, fever is regulated (even at a temperature of over 41.0 \u00B0C) and heat production approximates loss, as in health, though at a higher level of the set point. Therefore fever does not climb up relentlessly. In addition to the function as an endogenous pyrogen, IL-1 activates T-lymphocytes to produce various factors, such as INF and IL-2, which are vital for immune response. The production of fever simultaneously with lymphocyte activation constitutes the clearest and strongest evidence in favour of the protective role of fever. The induction of fever results in inhibition of bacterial growth, increased bactericidal effects of neutrophils, production of acute-phase protein synthesis and other physiological changes such as anorexia and somnolence. These changes suggest that fever has an adaptive role in the host\u2019s survival during infection.","publish_time":"2019-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"El-Radhi, A.

Trying to understand the disease mechanisms and finding the remedial measures have been the quest of humankind. The susceptibility to disease of an individual in a given population is determined by ones genetic buildup. Response to treatment and the disease prognosis also depends upon individual\u2019s genetic predisposition. The environmental stress induces mutations and is leading to the emergence of ever-increasing more dreaded infectious pathogens, and now we are in the era of increasing antibiotic resistance that has thrown up a challenge to find new treatment regimes. Discoveries in the science of high-throughput sequencing and array technologies have shown new hope and are bringing a revolution in human health. The information gained from sequencing of both human and pathogen genomes is a way forward in deciphering host-pathogen interactions. Deciphering the pathogen virulence factors, host susceptibility genes, and the molecular programs involved in the pathogenesis of disease has paved the way for discovery of new molecular targets for drugs, diagnostic markers, and vaccines. The genomic diversity in the human population leads to differences in host responses to drugs and vaccines and is the cause of poor response to treatment as well as adverse reactions. The study of pharmacogenomics of infectious diseases is still at an early stage of development, and many intricacies of the host-pathogen interaction are yet to be understood in full measure. However, progress has been made over the decades of research in some of the important infectious diseases revealing how the host genetic polymorphisms of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters affect the bioavailability of the drugs which further determine the efficacy and toxicology of the drugs used for treatment. Further, the field of structural biology and chemistry has intertwined to give rise to medical structural genomics leading the way to the discovery of new drug targets against infectious diseases. This chapter explores how the advent of \u201Comics\u201D technologies is making a beginning in bringing about a change in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatments of the infectious diseases and hence paving way for personalized medicine.","publish_time":"2013-06-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ganguly, Nirmal Kumar; Saha, Gautam Kumar","journal":"Omics for Personalized Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/15153b1a69033ae898a2d6ebc9c6f614946f5be5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122342.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122342/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["important infectious diseases","drugs","host responses","dreaded infectious pathogens","deciphering host-pathogen interactions","new treatment regimes","host genetic polymorphisms of drug","host susceptibility genes","paving way","discovery of new molecular targets","discovery of new drug targets","new hope","human population","disease prognosis","pathogen genomes","pathogenesis of disease","disease mechanisms","pathogen virulence factors","vaccines","human health","individual\u2019s genetic predisposition","ones genetic buildup","cause of poor response","molecular programs","given population","array technologies","throughput sequencing","cause of morbidity","medical structural genomics","field of structural biology","metabolizing enzymes","diagnostic markers","science of high","transporters","intricacies","differences","remedial measures","emergence of ever-increasing","chemistry","mortality","rise","bioavailability","diagnosis","revolution","challenge","treatments","memoriam","early stage of development","millions of individuals","personalized medicine","scourge of invasion","mutations","change","prevention","advent","beginning","genomic diversity","toxicology","efficacy","study of pharmacogenomics","time","antibiotic resistance","quest of humankind","decades of research","adverse reactions","environmental stress","Discoveries","information","progress","chapter","Humans"],"language":"en"},

These include new phleboviruses of the Bunyaviridae family, exemplified by severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus [SFTSV] recognized in China in 2010, and the Heartland virus, a closely related but distinct virus, presenting with similar clinical features and discovered in Missouri in 2012. Other newly recognized tickborne infections include a novel spirochete of the relapsing fever group, Borrelia miyamotoi, first reported to cause human infection in Russia in 2011 and subsequently discovered to cause clinical disease in the Netherlands, Japan, and the United States, with transmission by the black-legged deer tick Ixodes scapularis. In Europe a new tickborne disease, neoehrlichiosis caused by Candidatus neoehrlichia mikurensis belonging to the Anaplasmataceae family, has been described recently. Furthermore, new tickborne rickettsial infections continue to be recognized in Europe such as tickborne lymphadenopathy identified in 1997 and caused by Rickettsia slovaca. Novel tickborne infectious diseases will continue to emerge worldwide for the foreseeable future and be a challenge to the health of human populations. Innovative methods of prevention for a broad variety of tick-transmitted diseases are needed, and one approach is to develop a universal tick vaccine that can be given to animal hosts or humans.","publish_time":"2017-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fong, I.

The social and economic value of opioids has remained high not only due to their demonstrated efficiency in mitigating pain but also their noteworthy ability to reliably produce rewarding psychological effects. Consequently, at various times during the past several hundred years, opioids have sparked wars, fueled black markets and cartel crime, and triggered numerous opioid addiction and overdose death epidemics around the world. The increased therapeutic desire to address pain together with pharmaceutical discoveries in medication design, rapid manufacture, and highly effective opioid marketing and distribution has led more recently to increased availability and accessibility to potent prescription opioids, which has sparked the deadliest overdose crisis in human history.

In the United States, tests for infectious diseases are routinely conducted on each unit of donated blood, and these tests are designed to comply with regulatory requirements (Table 28.1). The field of clinical microbiology and virology are now focusing on molecular technology. Currently, nucleic acid testing techniques have been developed to screen blood and plasma products for evidence of very recent viral infections that could be missed by conventional serologic tests. It is time for all blood safety procedures to include molecular detection techniques.

On the last day of September 2014, the first active Ebola case was diagnosed in the United States. Officials in Dallas, Texas, scrambled to contain the virus. A few weeks later, tension rose dramatically when two of the nurses who treated the initial US patient developed Ebola. One of the nurses traveled to Ohio and back before becoming sick. She flew by plane and had contact with other travelers. Officials were very worried that Ebola flare-ups would start to occur across the country. On October 6, 2014, a nursing assistant in Spain was diagnosed with Ebola. Like the US nurses, she had helped treat a repatriated Ebola victim. On October 23, 2014, a new US case was identified. A doctor was diagnosed with Ebola in New York City after returning from Guinea. On the same day, an Ebola case was discovered in the West African country of Mali. The Ebola outbreak seemed out of control and poised to start a major international epidemic. In West Africa, however, a corner had been turned. Healthcare efforts had shifted from treating all Ebola patients in medical facilities to providing families with supplies to take care of sick patients at home. Toward the end of October 2014, reports started to surface about there being fewer cases in West Africa, especially in Liberia. These reports were initially treated with caution. As time progressed, however, it became clear that the drop in cases was real.","publish_time":"2018-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bullard, Stephan Gregory","journal":"A Day-by-Day Chronicle of the 2013-2016 Ebola Outbreak","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0ad030c1b8382ee731e6c2c4dc766c97322fd30.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122725.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122725/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsyNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["US","Healthcare"],"locations":["Ebola","United States","Ohio","Spain","Guinea","West Africa","Mali","Liberia"],"keyphrases":["Ebola patients","Ebola outbreak","Ebola flare-ups","active Ebola case","repatriated Ebola victim","US nurses","new US case","West African country of Mali","Officials","reports","day","care of sick patients","initial US patient","fewer cases","New York City","supplies","families","medical facilities","Texas","drop","Guinea","home","Spain","Western countries","control","nursing assistant","United States","major international epidemic","Dallas","Ohio","corner","Liberia","doctor","time progressed","Healthcare efforts","weeks","tension","plane","travelers","virus","end","caution","disease"],"language":"en"},

Acute CNS infections that warrant neurointensive care (ICU) admission fall broadly into three categories\u2014meningitis, encephalitis, and abscesses\u2014and generally result from blood-borne spread of the respective microorganisms. Other causes of CNS infections include head trauma resulting in fractures at the base of the skull or the cribriform plate that can lead to an opening between the CNS and the sinuses, mastoid, the middle ear, or the nasopharynx. Extrinsic contamination of the CNS can occur intraoperatively during neurosurgical procedures. Also, implanted medical devices or adjunct hardware (e.g., shunts, ventriculostomies, or external drainage tubes) and congenital malformations (e.g., spina bifida or sinus tracts) can become colonized and serve as sources or foci of infection. Viruses, such as rabies, herpes simplex virus, or polioviruses, can spread to the CNS via intraneural pathways resulting in encephalitis. If infection occurs at sites (e.g., middle ear or mastoid) contiguous with the CNS, infection may spread directly into the CNS causing brain abscesses; alternatively, the organism may reach the CNS indirectly via venous drainage or the sheaths of cranial and spinal nerves. Abscesses also may become localized in the subdural or epidural spaces. Meningitis results if bacteria spread directly from an abscess to the subarachnoid space. CNS abscesses may be a result of pyogenic meningitis or from septic emboli associated with endocarditis, lung abscess, or other serious purulent infections. Breaches of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) can result in CNS infections. Causes of such breaches include damage (e.g., microhemorrhage or necrosis of surrounding tissue) to the BBB; mechanical obstruction of microvessels by parasitized red blood cells, leukocytes, or platelets; overproduction of cytokines that degrade tight junction proteins; or microbe-specific interactions with the BBB that facilitate transcellular passage of the microorganism. The microorganisms that cause CNS infections include a wide range of bacteria, mycobacteria, yeasts, fungi, viruses, spirochaetes (e.g., neurosyphilis), and parasites (e.g., cerebral malaria and strongyloidiasis). The clinical picture of the various infections can be nonspecific or characterized by distinct, recognizable clinical syndromes. At some juncture, individuals with severe acute CNS infections require critical care management that warrants neuro-ICU admission. The implications for CNS infections are serious and complex and include the increased human and material resources necessary to manage very sick patients, the difficulties in triaging patients with vague or mild symptoms, and ascertaining the precise cause and degree of CNS involvement at the time of admission to the neuro-ICU. This chapter addresses a wide range of severe CNS infections that are better managed in the neuro-ICU. Topics covered include the medical epidemiology of the respective CNS infection; discussions of the relevant neuroanatomy and blood supply (essential for understanding the pathogenesis of CNS infections) and pathophysiology; symptoms and signs; diagnostic procedures, including essential neuroimaging studies; therapeutic options, including empirical therapy where indicated; and the perennial issue of the utility and effectiveness of steroid therapy for certain CNS infections. Finally, therapeutic options and alternatives are discussed, including the choices of antimicrobial agents best able to cross the BBB, supportive therapy, and prognosis.","publish_time":"2013-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Archibald, Lennox K.; Quisling, Ronald G.","journal":"Textbook of Neurointensive Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a48d1dec20b589260b4e38c977ccb38c5f38e61d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122753.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122753/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsyNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","BBB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CNS abscesses","causes of CNS infections","pathogenesis of CNS infections","certain CNS infections","severe acute CNS infections","respective CNS infection","wide range of severe CNS infections","degree of CNS involvement","various infections","serious purulent infections","BBB","spread","brain abscesses","neuro-ICU admission","blood supply","foci of infection","result of pyogenic meningitis","red blood cells","wide range of bacteria","medical emergencies","medical epidemiology","supportive therapy","empirical therapy","time of admission","spinal nerves","middle ear","therapeutic options","mastoid","brain barrier","encephalitis","respective microorganisms","Meningitis results","Breaches","effectiveness of steroid therapy","implanted medical devices","triaging patients","neurointensive care","sick patients","mild symptoms","lung abscess","diagnostic procedures","optic nerves","venous drainage","spinal cord","catastrophic implications","affected individuals","precise cause","neurosurgical procedures","clinical picture","critical care management","essential neuroimaging studies","external drainage tubes","recognizable clinical syndromes","relevant neuroanatomy","congenital malformations","septic emboli","yeasts","mycobacteria","pathophysiology","tight junction proteins","material resources necessary","discussions","increased human","long-term sequelae","adjunct hardware","microbe-specific interactions","mechanical obstruction of microvessels","head trauma","spina bifida","overproduction of cytokines","substantial morbidity","microhemorrhage","ventriculostomies","shunts","utility","platelets","leukocytes","quality of life","fungi","difficulties","covering membranes","cerebellum","fractures","sheaths of cranial","signs","cerebrum","sinuses","herpes simplex virus","necrosis of surrounding tissue","skull","sinus tracts","base","mortality","rabies","spirochaetes","endocarditis","polioviruses","Central nervous system","juncture","choices of antimicrobial agents","perennial issue","transcellular passage","cerebral malaria","parasites","epidural spaces","cribriform plate","neurosyphilis","damage","alternatives","opening","chapter","prognosis","intraneural pathways","categories","strongyloidiasis","subarachnoid space","Topics","nasopharynx","Extrinsic contamination"],"language":"en"},

Fundamentally, there are two kinds of immunization: active and passive. The latter is based on the administration of immunoglobulin preparations that can neutralize a specific virus. Therefore, passive vaccination is applied only in special cases, such as when the person to be protected recently had verifiable contact with a specific virus (postexposure prophylaxis), or if the risk of exposure to pathogens cannot be ruled out in the following weeks and an active vaccination is not possible, as in short-term planned trips to Third World countries (exposure prophylaxis). An example is the administration of antibodies specific for hepatitis B virus in cases of contamination with blood from people who have an acute or chronically persistent infection with this virus, and thus have high concentrations of infectious particles in the blood. Such accidents occur primarily in medical personnel by needlestick injury (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19). In certain cases, the administration is performed in combination with an active vaccination (active\u2013passive immunization). Specific immunoglobulin preparations are also administered when people have been bitten by animals that may be infected with the rabies virus (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_15). In the case of early application (together with an active vaccination), the antibodies can neutralize the virus, and impede its spread in the body. Since the time between contact with the virus and its spread in the organism is often very short, passive immunization is limited to a period shortly before or after exposure to the infective agent (usually within 4 days). Therefore, it is reserved for cases in which the contact with the potential pathogen is well documented and the type of infection is known, and when an appropriate immunoglobulin preparation is available. The protection afforded by antibody preparations lasts just a few weeks, as immunoglobulins are rapidly degraded in the organism. Therefore, postexposure administration of active vaccines is increasingly preferred, e.g. in the context of outbreak-control vaccination. In veterinary medicine, passive immunization is employed occasionally in young animals which were born in a flock with high infection pressure. This approach is applied, for example, in kennels when infections occur with canine parvovirus (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_20). However, its value is controversial, as the immunoglobulins administered hinder the more advantageous active immunization.","publish_time":"2013-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Modrow, Susanne; Falke, Dietrich; Truyen, Uwe; Sch\u00E4tzl, Hermann","journal":"Molecular Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0e60c2c2486984fcbb550a12681ae29106dace0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122972.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122972/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjszNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["active vaccination","specific virus","passive vaccination","passive immunization","advantageous active immunization","rabies virus","postexposure administration of active vaccines","administration of antibodies specific","Specific immunoglobulin preparations","administration of immunoglobulin preparations","hepatitis B virus","control vaccination","kinds of immunization","possible infection","cases of contamination","verifiable contact","special cases","certain cases","type of infection","persistent infection","high infection pressure","blood","postexposure prophylaxis","immunized people","antibody preparations","risk of exposure","immunoglobulins","example","protection","young animals","organism","spread","appropriate immunoglobulin preparation","following weeks","respective pathogens","high concentrations of infectious particles","World countries","short-term planned trips","medical personnel","kennels","infections","flock","subsequent illness","combination","potential pathogen","context of outbreak","needlestick injury","canine parvovirus","infective agent","case of early application","veterinary medicine","period","days","accidents","value","time","prevention","approach"],"language":"en"},

Vaccines for seasonal influenza have been available for decades and there is a wealth of data available on the immune response to these vaccines in humans, with well-established correlates of protection for inactivated influenza virus vaccines. Many of the seminal studies on vaccines for epidemic influenza have been conducted in human subjects. Studies in humans are performed less frequently now than they were in the past. Therefore, as the quest for improved influenza vaccines continues, it is important to consider the use of animal models for the evaluation of influenza vaccines, and a major challenge is the selection of an appropriate animal model that accurately reflects the disease and the protective immune response to influenza infection in humans. The emergence of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (AI) viruses and the threat of a pandemic caused by AI viruses of this or another subtype has resulted in a resurgence of interest in influenza vaccine research. The development of vaccines for pandemic influenza presents a unique set of obstacles, not the least of which is that the demonstration of efficacy in humans is not possible. As the correlates of protection from pandemic influenza are not known, we rely on extrapolation of the lessons from seasonal influenza vaccines and on data from the evaluation of pandemic influenza vaccines in animal models to guide our decisions on vaccines for use in humans. The features and contributions of commonly used animal models for influenza vaccine research are discussed.

Several forms of chronic pulmonary dysfunction due to infectious or noninfectious causes commonly occur in the months to years after chemo-radiotherapy and can be fatal or result in long-term morbidity. The judicious use of prophylactic antimicrobial agents has tipped the balance toward noninfectious etiologies. Hence, while opportunistic infections still contribute to chronic lung disease, late sequelae resulting from antineoplastic therapy have been identified and reported. Patients who proceed to receive hematopoietic cell transplantation (HSCT) are particularly prone to developing lung complications. Pulmonary dysfunction occurring after HSCT may manifest with obstructive or restrictive pulmonary mechanics and may range in severity from subtle, subclinical functional changes to frank respiratory failure. Insights generated using animal models suggest that the immunologic mechanisms contributing to lung inflammation after HSCT may be similar to those responsible for graft-versus host disease. In sum, chronic fibrotic pulmonary dysfunction is a frequent and significant complication facing survivors of hematologic malignancies and their practitioners. The high incidence and suboptimal response to current support care and immunosuppressive therapy underscore the need for heightened awareness and continued research in this area.","publish_time":"2010-08-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Salman, Huda; Cooke, Kenneth R.; Lazarus, Hillard M.","journal":"Pulmonary Involvement in Patients with Hematological Malignancies","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/26ee9d86ae3b0353f8d5de6f5ce11a39810fca20.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123073.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123073/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs0MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSCT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HSCT","chronic fibrotic pulmonary dysfunction","forms of chronic pulmonary dysfunction","chronic lung disease","antineoplastic therapy","lung complications","immunosuppressive therapy","lung inflammation","restrictive pulmonary mechanics","risk of late complications","hematological malignancies","late sequelae","noninfectious causes","host disease","survival of patients","noninfectious etiologies","current support care","current treatment modalities","survivors of hematologic malignancies","subclinical functional changes","need","suboptimal response","significant complication","heightened awareness","severity","immunologic mechanisms","frank respiratory failure","continued research","months","balance","judicious use of prophylactic antimicrobial agents","high incidence","chemo-radiotherapy","animal models","graft","hematopoietic cell transplantation","sum","opportunistic infections","years","area","practitioners","long-term morbidity","Insights","advances"],"language":"en"},

In part, the previous switched epidemic models are reintroduced with continuous (e.g., vaccination of newborns continuously in time) or switching control (i.e., piecewise continuous application of vaccination or treatment schemes) for evaluation and optimization. As discussed earlier, infectious disease models are a crucial component in designing and implementing detection, prevention, and control programs (e.g., the World Health Organization\u2019s program against smallpox, leading to its global eradication by 1977). The switched SIR model is first returned to for consideration and analysis of vaccination of the susceptible group (e.g., newborns or the entire cohort). Subsequently, the developed theoretical methods are applied to the switched SIR model with a treatment program in effect. Common Lyapunov functions are used to provide controlled eradication of diseases modeled by the so-called SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) model with seasonal variations captured by switching. A screening process, where traveling individuals are examined for infection, is proposed and studied for the switched multi-city model of the previous chapter. Switching control of diseases such as Dengue and Chikungunya which are spread via mosquito\u2013human interactions, is investigated.","publish_time":"2017-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Xinzhi; Stechlinski, Peter","journal":"Infectious Disease Modeling","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123137.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123137/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs0NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["switched SIR model","control of diseases","switched multi-city model","vaccination of newborns","control programs","application of control strategies","previous switched epidemic models","treatment program","piecewise continuous application of vaccination","analysis of vaccination","previous chapter","controlled eradication of diseases","treatment schemes","susceptible group","global eradication","infectious disease models","World Health Organization\u2019s program","smallpox","crucial component","detection","traveling individuals","so-called SEIR","evaluation","mosquito","screening process","Common Lyapunov functions","Chikungunya","optimization","developed theoretical methods","prevention","Dengue","epidemics","consideration","effect","time","seasonal variations","human interactions","infection","entire cohort"],"language":"en"},

This research-in-progress study follows the divided stages of ADR, where the stage of problem formulation is to be conducted through semi-structured interviews. Findings from stage 1 will provide knowledge about the phenomenon with a public organization as a context and make up the problem definition within ADR. The stage of building, interventions and evaluation is to be conducted with interventions in focus groups where we will investigate how to increase adoption of employee-driven digital innovation and how introducing digital tools can support employee-driven digital innovation as an innovation practice. The study aims to contribute by creating general solution concepts about employee-driven digital innovation.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Opland, Leif Erik; Jaccheri, Letizia; Engesmo, Jostein; Pappas, Ilias O.","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2d5b4dde4b9c258377bc24865a2eac61a2d8dc9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134233.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134233/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsxNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ADR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["digital innovation","innovation practice","digital tools","public sector","adoption of employee","public organizations","interventions","stage of building","stage of problem formulation","progress study","action design research","divided stages of ADR","private sector","theoretical knowledge","problem definition","methodology","relation","general solution concepts","evaluation","development","context","services","processes","phenomenon","semi-structured interviews","focus groups","Findings"],"language":"en"},

The data for the study was collected from 131 (n = 131) ICT alumni that represent 25 nationalities. Results reveal that men with 77% share dominate the closest supervisor positions and 14% of the previous ICT students in the university have felt some kind of gender-based discrimination in their work. The data-driven content analysis was used to analyze the data. In the analysis we found five main categories behind the gender-based discrimination: society, organizational; individual action; hard facts and zero.

Largely developed and published by practitioners, the academic value of these models remains obviously unclear. To shed light on their value in a broader sense, in this paper we critically evaluate 17 existing digital maturity models \u2013 identified through a systematic literature search (2011\u20132019) \u2013 with regard to their validity of measurement. We base our evaluation on established academic criteria, such as generalizability or theory-based interpretation, that we apply in a qualitative content analysis to these models. Our analysis shows that most of the identified models do not conform to the established evaluation criteria.

We argue that a more consistent conceptualisation of media use behaviour and its etiological foundations is a necessary basis for research in this regard to progress. To this end, through the adoption of an affordances approach, we propose the Media Use Behaviour Conceptual Framework to describe the reciprocal relations between users (described in relation to personal characteristics and cognitive factors), the situations (consisting of social, physical, and technological dimensions) in which they use media, their media use behaviour, and the outcomes (both realised and expected) of this behaviour. This framework seeks to integrate the behaviourist and cognitivist approaches to action and, additionally, acknowledges the socially constructed and deterministic role of media in action. It is argued that such a framework will provide a useful basis upon which researchers can consider various individual differences in observed media use behaviours and associated outcomes and, importantly, understand why particular media use behaviours occur.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parry, Douglas A.; le Roux, Daniel B.","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be1ef93ab7f4c182875e760a5738ebecd23dfee5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134275.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134275/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsxOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Media Use Behaviour Conceptual Framework","observed media use behaviours","particular media use behaviours","consistent conceptualisation of media use behaviour","deterministic role of media","digital communications media","associated outcomes","action","necessary basis","useful basis","connected world researchers","various individual differences","etiological foundations","cognitive factors","reciprocal relations","personal characteristics","situations","users","regard","behaviourist","technological dimensions","affordances approach","adoption","cognitivist approaches","progress","end"],"language":"en"},

The BDRI, applied on Africa, includes the topic of happiness within the digital wellbeing driver, but the link between the two topics requires further investigation. Thus, two underlying questions emerge: what is the relation between happiness and big data? And how does Africa perform in digital wellbeing? This paper includes a structured literature review highlighting five key clusters indicating this link. Furthermore, we present some first empirical insights using the BDRI focusing on Africa.

Strategic course development should therefore be conducted collaboratively by several stakeholders. Change management approaches offer a solution to deal with the integration of strategies for change and consider all stakeholder groups. This paper aims to combine an FC process model and a change management approach to include all stakeholders. Based on a literature review, we develop an integrative approach and summarize the necessary aspects of change.

The odds of farms with particular management strategies having above median morbidity were calculated. At the individual calf level, the odds of a calf being treated, controlling for farm of origin and month of birth, were calculated for different management practices. Farm size, and policies related to anti-scour vaccination, offering free-choice water and minerals to calves, methods of feeding, and the use of medicated feeds significantly altered the odds of a farm experiencing above-median pneumonia rates. Farm policies with regard to anti-scour vaccination, offering free-choice salt to calves, age at teat removal, type of calf housing, and use of preventive antimicrobials significantly altered the odds of a farm experiencing above-median scours rates. Scours and pneumonia were significantly associated with each other at both the farm and the calf level. No significant associations were found between individual calf management practices and the odds of being treated for scours.

Nous rapportons l\u2019impact sur la pratique clinique de l\u2019utilisation de la PCR multiplex pour la d\u00E9tection de 18 virus et 4 bact\u00E9ries. Entre janvier 2012 et avril 2014, une PCR multiplex a \u00E9t\u00E9 r\u00E9alis\u00E9e sur aspiration nasopharyng\u00E9e chez tous les patients adultes hospitalis\u00E9s pour une IRB dans le service de maladies infectieuses du CHU de Tours. Sur 133 patients test\u00E9s, un pathog\u00E8ne a \u00E9t\u00E9 identifi\u00E9 chez 72 patients (54 %) dont 4 cas avec un Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Les 68 autres identifications \u00E9taient des virus avec Myxovirus influenzae A (22 patients), Rhino/ent\u00E9rovirus (16), Coronavirus (11), Bocavirus (11), Metapneumovirus (6), virus syncitial respiratoire (4), Ad\u00E9novirus (4), Myxovirus influenzae B (3) et Paramyxovirus influenzae (2). Avec les m\u00E9thodes classiques, un agent pathog\u00E8ne a \u00E9t\u00E9 identifi\u00E9 dans 6 cas : 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae et 3 Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Lorsqu\u2019un virus a \u00E9t\u00E9 identifi\u00E9 comme cause de l\u2019IRB, la radiographie pulmonaire montrait un syndrome alv\u00E9olaire dans 21 cas.

The full-length cDNA (GenBank accession No.: KC616308) is 1,509 bp in length including an 83 bp-long 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) and a 709 bp-long 3\u2032 UTR, which encoded a 238 amino acids protein. In the 2,339 bp-long MHC IIA genomic DNA, four exons and three introns were identified. Sequence comparison exhibited that the deduced amino acid sequence shared 27.1\u201366.3% identity with those of other species. Seven alleles were identified from five healthy individuals. Number of alleles per individual diversified from two to five. Five different 5\u2032 UTR sequences and two different 3\u2032 UTR sequences from one individual may infer the existence of five loci at least. Real-time quantitative PCR demonstrated that swamp eel MHC IIA transcripts were ubiquitously expressed in ten tissues, but the expression level was distinctly different.

In the field of medical virology, Malaysia contributed substantially in the areas of virus diagnostic services, development and research ranging from survey and documentation on the existence and prevalence of viruses causing diseases in Malaysia, clinical presentation and epidemiological features of virus diseases, evaluation of new diagnostic tests to pathogenesis of viral diseases. Malaysia contributed to the discoveries of at least 12 new viruses in the world. ASEAN plus Three (China, Japan, Republic of Korea) Emerging Infectious Programme was established to overcome the challenges and impact of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in this region. Malaysia as the co-ordinator of the laboratory component of the programme, contributed to strengthen the regional laboratory capability, capacity, laboratory-based surveillance and networking. The future of medical virology in Malaysia in terms of integration of diagnostic, reference and research to support the country\u2019s need will be enhanced and strengthened with the on-going development of the National Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC Malaysia) which also incorporates a futuristic Special Diagnostic and Reference Laboratory.","publish_time":"2009-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chua, Kaw Bing","journal":"Virol Sin","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4970abe88f0048aaf9e1a86e8b7512cde678b46.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091434/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Institute for Medical Research","Department of Medical Microbiology","CDC Malaysia"],"locations":["Malaysia"],"keyphrases":["Medical Research","development of medical virology","CDC Malaysia","field of medical virology","future of medical virology","University Kebangsaan Malaysia","University of Sarawak Malaysia","medical importance","Virus Research","control of diseases","Reference Laboratory","Department of Medical Microbiology","Division of Medical Zoology","laboratory component","new viruses","study of viruses","epidemiological features of virus diseases","areas of virus diagnostic services","research work","laboratory-based surveillance","prevalence of viruses","outbreak investigation of infectious diseases","pathogenesis of viral diseases","regional laboratory capability","virus isolation","National Public Health Laboratory","University Malaya","Infectious Programme","futuristic Special Diagnostic","evaluation of new diagnostic tests","country surveillance","on-going development","Institute","Disease Control","National Centre","latest institution","impact of emerging","clinical presentation","NPHL","Prevention","capacity","terms of integration","beginning","Faculty of Medicine","Republic of Korea","existence","China","Japan","documentation","establishment","survey","branch of biological science","IMR","challenges","networking","co-ordinator","discoveries","country\u2019s need","ASEAN","world"],"language":"en"},

However, drugs used for single dose treatments must possess important characteristics, namely, long half-life, effective concentration in tissues over a long period, and low toxicity. In tropical medicine, such drugs are an important advance in the treatment of malaria (mefloquine and halofantrine), schistosomiasis (praziquantel and metrifonate), filariasis (ivermectin), and genitourinary tract and intestinal infections. Intestinal infections are one of the most frequent problems in tropical medicine. While a large number of cases of diarrhoea are of viral (rotavirus) or bacterial (Salmonella, Escherichia coli) origin, necessitating only oral rehydration, some are of parasitological origin (Giardia, Entamoeba histolytica, Strongyloides, Trichuris, Schistosoma) and can be cured by a single dose treatment (tinidazole, secnidazole, ivermectin, albendazole, praziquantel). Secnidazole is the nitroimidazole with the longest half-life and is, therefore, used in single dose treatments for Giardia, acute intestinal amoebiasis and E. histolytica cyst carriers. Single dose treatments of most intestinal parasites will be a major advance in the management of tropical infectious diarrhoea. In the next decade, opportunistic intestinal infections (Cryptosporidium, Isospora, Enterocytozoon) in AIDS patients that are refractory to treatment could be the major problem.","publish_time":"2012-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dupouy-Camet, Jean","journal":"Drug Investig","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28b7049a95dfbf2a1e514e5e934f4fcbc30f6218.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100088/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjsyODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Single dose treatments","intestinal parasites","opportunistic intestinal infections","important advance","tropical medicine","acute intestinal amoebiasis","important characteristics","Giardia","long period","long half-life","treatment of malaria","ivermectin","major advance","secnidazole","praziquantel","drugs","management of tropical infectious diarrhoea","important advantages of simple administration","Entamoeba histolytica","parasitological origin","longest half-life","major problem","histolytica cyst carriers","short period of drug pressure","Isospora","excellent compliance","Cryptosporidium","tissues","tinidazole","effective concentration","Salmonella","AIDS patients","Enterocytozoon","Strongyloides","halofantrine","Escherichia coli","genitourinary tract","effects","schistosomiasis","rotavirus","Trichuris","oral rehydration","mefloquine","metrifonate","filariasis","albendazole","decade","frequent problems","large number of cases","Schistosoma","nitroimidazole","low toxicity"],"language":"en"},

On January 20, 2017, we identified a mumps outbreak in the Denver metropolitan area among a Marshallese community. We performed active surveillance to assess outbreak magnitude and guide implementation of control measures. METHODS: On January 22, local and state health departments initiated active case surveillance by using a church-based community roster. Each household was contacted by telephone \u22653 times to identify mumps cases, according to the 2012 CDC/Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists case definition, and risk factors (e.g., household size). Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination status was reviewed in the Colorado Immunization Information System (CIIS). Four church-based vaccination clinics were held to bring participants up-to-date for MMR vaccination. Targeted messaging about mumps, MMR vaccine, and vaccination clinics was distributed through social media, churches, and Marshallese-language radio. RESULTS: Of the 21 households on the church roster, 17 were successfully contacted, 13 of which (76%) provided data for 85 persons (median household size: 6 persons; range: 5\u201312). Through household interviews and laboratory reporting, we identified 47 mumps cases (17 confirmed; 30 probable). Median patient age was 20 years (range: 3 months\u201344 years), 24 (51%) were male, and 34 (72%) reported no or unknown prior mumps vaccination and had no MMR vaccination documented in CIIS. During vaccination clinics, 118 (80%) of 148 presenting Marshallese persons were eligible for and received MMR vaccine; of those vaccinated, median age was 21 years (range: 1\u201355 years) and 104 (88%) had no prior MMR vaccine documentation. CONCLUSION: Active surveillance, facilitated through culturally appropriate communication with church leaders, helped identify cases, disseminate materials, and promote MMR vaccination. Household interviews provided timely data to define outbreak magnitude and need for urgent MMR vaccination.

Although controversial, the majority of patients with various neurodegenerative or neurobehavioral conditions, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and autistic spectrum disorders, show evidence of central nervous system or systemic bacterial and viral infections. For example, using serology or polymerase chain reaction evidence of Chlamydia pneumoniae, Borrelia burgdorferi, Mycoplasma species, human herpesvirus-1 and -6, and other bacterial and viral infections revealed high infection rates that were not found in control subjects. Although chronic infections were not found in some studies, and the specific role of chronic infections in neurological disease pathogenesis has not been determined or is inconclusive, the data suggest that chronic bacterial or viral infections could be common features of progressive neurodegenerative and neurobehavioral diseases.","publish_time":"2008-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nicolson, Garth L.","journal":"Lab Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5231f8b0f8344ee8a0b67717f8352c70beae56b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107574/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs0Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral infections","neuropathic infections","Parkinson\u2019s disease","Alzheimer\u2019s disease","disease progression","disease inception","specific role of chronic infections","neurobehavioral diseases","neurological disease pathogenesis","neurobehavioral conditions","multiple sclerosis","common features of progressive neurodegenerative","majority of patients","amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","evidence of central nervous system","polymerase chain reaction evidence of Chlamydia pneumoniae","Borrelia burgdorferi","Mycoplasma species","autistic spectrum disorders","serology","types","high infection rates","human herpesvirus","data","severities of signs","symptoms","example","studies","control subjects"],"language":"en"},

While they provide needed assistance and help meet the health needs of Africans, they make the continent dependent on hand-outs, unwittingly encouraging unscrupulous leaders not to generate or make national resources available to the people. Worse even, foreign assistance leaves a vacuum when it is depleted or, for various reasons, withdrawn. Foreign funds are also easily prone to misuse by leaders and unscrupulous high and middle level civil servants. Furthermore, as is the case with the IMF, assistance has always come with strings attached, forcing Africa to rely on international generosity to meet the health needs the West deems a priority for the continent. These conditions often imply at times that the donors know best what is good for Africans. While not denying the usefulness and the need for international assistance, the author argues that the use of financial assistance must be completely transparent to prevent misuse and abuse, not condescending, and always respectful of Africa\u2019s sovereignty.

One approach is in silico drug design based on our existing knowledge of the biology of a specific disease and the specific target site binding chemistry. Based on this knowledge, a range of molecules will be designed and synthesised after which they will be tested in in vitro bioassays for activity and toxicity. The best candidates, called lead compounds, will then be \u201Cfine-tuned\u201D by chemical derivatisation in order to improve their activity and/or to reduce their toxicity. Lead compounds are then tested in various animal models before entering clinical trials in people. Another approach is to screen a large number of biological samples (plants, bacteria and fungi) for activity against a specific disease. Any active extract, consisting of many compounds, will be fractionated by chromatographic techniques, and each fraction will be tested for in vitro activity. Active fractions will again be fractionated until the active compound is identified. This process, also called bioguided fractionation, can go through a number of fractionation cycles before the active compound is identified. The active compound will be chemically derivatised in order to improve its properties before in vivo animal studies will be conducted. Based on these test results, the most promising lead compounds will then be tested in clinical trials in people. There are however a number of shortcomings with both approaches. It is expensive, time consuming, makes use of in vitro bioassays and it suffers from a very low success rate. Due to these shortcomings, it is currently estimated that the development of one new drug costs around $1\u20131.5 billion, simply because so many lead compounds fail during clinical trials. Keeping these high costs in mind, one would think that all registered drugs are effective and importantly non-toxic. Unfortunately, this is not the case, as there are a number of drugs currently on the market that are causing severe side effects and whose efficacy should be questioned. This holds true particularly for cancer chemotherapeutics. It was estimated that cancer chemotherapy improves the average 5-year survival rate of patients (for all cancer types) by only 2 % (Morgan et al. 2004). Another relatively unknown fact is that each year, 200,000 people die in the EU due to adverse drug reactions (all types of drugs), highlighting the severe shortcomings of the drug development and drug licensing pipelines (Archibald and Coleman 2012). To put this into perspective, there are a large number of drugs that work perfectly well and are safe to use, but we have to concede that our approach to drug discovery and our overall approach to health care suffers from some major problems.","publish_time":"2013-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"van der Kooy, Frank","journal":"Artemisia annua - Pharmacology and Biotechnology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33d30070caa7db7bcf22ed7ba26bc837b2ee6350.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124147.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124147/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjs5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Coleman"],"organizations":["EU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["drug development","large number of drugs","number of shortcomings","activity","active compound","drug discovery","types of drugs","new drugs","new drug costs","promising lead compounds","clinical trials","registered drugs","people","active extract","Active fractions","drug licensing pipelines","adverse drug reactions","silico drug design","number of fractionation cycles","specific disease","overall approach","severe shortcomings","cancer types","large number of biological samples","order","cancer chemotherapy","cancer chemotherapeutics","use of","bioassays","toxicity","various animal models","year survival rate of patients","existing knowledge","various ways","animal studies","bioguided fractionation","high costs","specific target site binding chemistry","low success rate","plants","health care","bacteria","Archibald","average","fungi","Coleman","biology","market","time consuming","chemical derivatisation","test results","major problems","effects","properties","best candidates","chromatographic techniques","mind","range of molecules","unknown fact","process","efficacy","perspective","approaches","case","Morgan"],"language":"en"},

We describe here the comparative incidence of community respiratory virus (CRV) infections occurring by day 180 post-transplant by donor source and their impact on outcomes including survival, relapse, chronic GVHD, and transplant related mortality (TRM) using CIBMTR registry data. The analysis included 2765 patients, all \u003E 2 years of age, who underwent first allogeneic HCT for AML, ALL or MDS from 100 centers between 2012 and 2017 receiving either HaploCy (n=757), Matched related donor (MRD) transplant with PTCy (SibCy n= 403), and MRD transplant with calcineurin inhibitor and either MTX or MMF (SibCNI n= 1605). The cumulative incidences of CRV in the HaploCy, SibCy and SibCNI were: 3% (99% CI, 1.6-4.8), 3% (1.3-5.5) and 2.4 %(1.5-3.5) respectively at day 30 (P =0.649, NS), but notably higher at 15.5% (12.3-19), 16.2% (11.7-21.2) and 9.4 %(7.6-11.4) at 6 months (P\u003C.001) post-transplant [Figure 1]. Identified CRV included primarily Rhinovirus, Parainfluenza, and RSV accounting for approximately 70% of all CRV reported [Table 1]. Figure 2 shows the multivariable models through 2 years post-transplant for survival, relapse, TRM, and chronic GVHD with a reference group of SibCNI without CRV infection for the main effect variable of donor type and infection. Patients in the HaploCy cohort who developed a CRV by day 180 had a higher risk of TRM [p=0.002] and inferior survival [p = 0.001] compared to the reference group. Older age, more advanced disease, and higher HCT-CI were all associated with increased mortality. The incidence of CRVs is higher for patients receiving PTCy, regardless of donor. This finding justifies further studies to understand long-term antiviral immune recovery in different donor sources and GVHD prophylaxis regimens. The higher overall mortality for HaploCy patients developing CRV infection warrants consideration for patient education and heightened awareness for clinicians, as well as long term follow up studies of such patients.","publish_time":"2020-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Taplitz, Randy; Maziarz, Richard T.; Mulroney, Carolyn; Perales, Miguel; Romee, Rizwan; Goldsmith, Scott R.; Fuchs, Ephraim J.; Bashey, Asad; Ciurea, Stefan O.; Singh, Anurag K; Ganguly, Siddhartha; Kim, Soyoung; Chen, Min; Chemaly, Roy F.; Komanduri, Krishna V.; Riches, Marcie L.","journal":"Biol Blood Marrow Transplant","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128635/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjsyNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDS","MRD","MMF","CRV","RSV","TRM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HaploCy patients","MRD transplant","haploidentical transplant","years post-transplant","CRV infection warrants consideration","cumulative incidences of CRV","HaploCy cohort","higher overall mortality","higher risk of TRM","day","SibCNI n","higher HCT-CI","Matched related donor","chronic GVHD","related mortality","SibCy n","different donor sources","reference group of SibCNI","relapse","setting of PTCy","increased mortality","inferior survival","incidence of CRVs","studies","years of age","Figure","main effect variable of donor type","GVHD prophylaxis regimens","allogeneic HCT","detailed data","Older age","comparative incidence of community respiratory virus","CIBMTR registry data","high rates of viral infections","patient education","long-term antiviral immune recovery","clinicians","MTX","outcomes","impact","heightened awareness","advanced disease","MMF","calcineurin inhibitor","multivariable models","Rhinovirus","Parainfluenza","long term","RSV accounting","MDS","AML","months","centers","analysis","Table"],"language":"en"},

Vaccination remains the most effective measure to prevent influenza and its associated complications. The seasonal influenza vaccine uptake rates among RCHE staff were much lower than that among residents. In order to increase uptake of influenza vaccination among RCHE staff in Hong Kong, this study developed and evaluated amultimodal vaccine promotion program (VPP) based on identified factors affecting vaccination acceptance or refusal within the Hong Kong Chinese context. Vaccine acceptance was found to be significantly associated with belief in vaccine efficacy, duration of service, staff group and providing direct care to residents. The focus group study revealed that RCHE staff\u0027s belief in the efficacy and safety of the vaccine played a major role in vaccine acceptance. VPP effectiveness was evaluated with a cluster randomised controlled trial among RCHEs with staff vaccination rates below 50%. Compared with 2008/09, the 2009/10 mean staff vaccination rates increased significantly in both the intervention (39.4% to 59.6% (P \u003C 0.001)) and control groups (36.3% to 47.6% (P = 0.008)). RCHE staff in the intervention group had a higher vaccination rate than in the control group (59.6% versus 47.6%, P = 0.072). This program reinforces the importance of a comprehensive and culturally sensitive approach to promote influenza vaccination for RCHE staff.","publish_time":"2016-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, H.; Ng, Sammy; King, Mark E.; Fong, Carol; Ng, W.P.; Szeto, K.H.; Ho, Sara; Leung, Jane; Lam, C.K.; Chan, Shelley; Chan, W.M.; Wong, T.Y.","journal":"Healthc Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/914fb414691d6d7061d7cca07660685798fbb3a0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129256/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjszNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RCHE","VPP"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["staff group","vaccination acceptance","uptake of influenza vaccination","mean staff vaccination rates","Vaccine acceptance","vaccine efficacy","seasonal influenza vaccine uptake rates","higher vaccination rate","intervention group","RCHE staff\u0027s belief","evaluated amultimodal vaccine promotion program","focus group study","Annual influenza epidemics","RCHEs","aged residents of residential care homes","Hong Kong Chinese context","direct care","VPP effectiveness","control groups","associated complications","refusal","worldwide morbidity","duration of service","societal disruption","identified factors","controlled trial","cluster","safety","sensitive approach","major role","mortality","elderly","effective measure","importance","order"],"language":"en"},

Decisions about the initiation and timing of invasive ventilation can be difficult, and early discussion with critical care colleagues is essential. Appropriateness of invasive ventilatory support can also require advanced discussion with patients and families. In the past 10\u201315 years, the role of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has expanded, not least in an attempt to minimize the complications inherent in invasive ventilation. Indeed, NIV is now considered first-line therapy in some conditions (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary oedema, mild to moderate hypoxaemic respiratory failure in immunocompromised patients), and a \u2018trial of NIV\u2019 is often considered in respiratory failure resulting from an increasingly wide range of causes. With NIV, the importance of the environment (setting, monitoring, experience of staff) and forward planning cannot be overemphasized. When used for other than the standard indications, NIV should be employed in a high-dependency or intensive care setting in patients for whom invasive ventilation would be considered.","publish_time":"2016-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Popat, Bhavesh; Jones, Andrew T.","journal":"Medicine (Abingdon)","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108337.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108337/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs0OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["timing of invasive ventilation","trial of NIV","immunocompromised patients","Early recognition of patients","Appropriateness of invasive ventilatory support","critical care colleagues","intensive care setting","early discussion","role of non-invasive ventilation","pulmonary oedema","key goal of critical care outreach programmes","moderate hypoxaemic respiratory failure","advanced discussion","experience of staff","hospital medical staff","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","important skill","conditions","environment","high-dependency","line therapy","years","monitoring","complications inherent","initiation","wide range of causes","forward planning","families","importance","attempt","Decisions","standard indications"],"language":"en"},

Theoretically, Koch postulates must be fulfilled, in order to formerly demonstrate that a disease is due to an infectious agent. However, in infectious uveitis, most often, serological evidence, molecular or histological demonstration, and treatment response are usually the only available elements to suggest the infectious origin of the uveitis. Using those evidences, a large number of infectious organisms have been demonstrated to cause infectious uveitis. Some have a global importance around the world, while others have more limited niches.

Although several different bacteria and respiratory viruses can be responsible for CAP, Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) remains the most common causative pathogen. A small proportion of CAP cases are caused by Gram-negative bacteria, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomona maltophilia [2, 3]. The main problem concerning the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections is their related antibiotic resistance, reported as multidrug resistant (MDR = resistant to at least one agent in three or more groups of antibiotics), extensively drug resistant (XDR = resistant to at least one agent in all but two or fewer groups of antibiotics) and pan-drug resistant (PDR = resistant to all groups of antibiotics) [4]. This makes the clinical management of pneumonia caused by such pathogens a challenge for physicians. Taking into account the clinical severity that may be associated with CAP caused by Gram-negative bacteria (respiratory failure, bacteremia, shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]) the magnitude of the global health problem is tremendous.","publish_time":"2018-12-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cill\u00F3niz, C.; Domined\u00F2, C.; Torres, A.","journal":"Annual Update in Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine 2019","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4de39025476fa81e418fa4fb86ca41d1a2e9676a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119995.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119995/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs4NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Klebsiella"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pan-drug resistant","fewer groups of antibiotics","respiratory failure","respiratory viruses","different bacteria","agent","small proportion of CAP cases","clinical management of pneumonia","Klebsiella pneumoniae","acute respiratory distress syndrome","treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections","Streptococcus pneumoniae","main problem","clinical severity","global health problem","bacteremia","shock","Acinetobacter baumannii","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","related antibiotic resistance","magnitude","ARDS","pneumococcus","PDR","Stenotrophomona maltophilia","pathogens","MDR","challenge","high morbidity","XDR","common causative pathogen","mortality","physicians","account","Community"],"language":"en"},

Due to their ability to bind reversibly with specific carbohydrate structures and their abundant availability, plant lectins have commonly been used as a molecular tool in various disciplines of biology and medicine. Whilst once thought of being a dietary toxin, the focus on plant lectins has since shifted to understanding the useful properties of these lectins and utilizing them in medicinal applications to advance human health.

The previously dominant thinking, such as the social adjustment agenda and the human capital-deficit model, has strongly been challenged by three emerging perspectives, such as rights-based citizenship, gender and empowerment, and social capital building. These new perspectives enrich our understanding by deconstructing migrants as many social groups with competing needs and facing constraints. They also demystify migrant families by examining the power dynamics within these families. New research methodologies, such as ethnography and participatory action research, and new methods, such as photovoice and community map drawing, have been experimented with in order to engage and empower the migrants. These changing perspectives are more sensitive to the influence of locality and have brought some impact on social service provision and delivery.","publish_time":"2012-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Sam","journal":"International Handbook of Chinese Families","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aefd578cccda76f2794dc73d859f9010fd7a188b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120170.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120170/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs5NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["new perspectives","social groups","social capital building","New research methodologies","social adjustment agenda","social service provision","deconstructing migrants","new methods","changing perspectives","emerging perspectives","participatory action research","Mainland Chinese migrants","migrant families","human capital-deficit model","Hong Kong","empowerment","gender","ethnography","photovoice","impact","understanding","rights-based citizenship","competing needs","complex","delivery","power dynamics","community map drawing","constraints","influence of locality","chapter","dominant thinking","years","order"],"language":"en"},

It is therefore obvious that RNA hydrolysis does not represent an obligate step in the viral life cycle that would have to be governed by viral proteins. Accordingly, RNases are found only rarely in the viral proteomes and serve special functions. In this chapter, several virus-specific RNases will be described and their role in the viral life cycle discussed. The text will concentrate on RNases of members of the nidoviruses, herpesviruses, pestiviruses, and several viruses with segmented negative-strand RNA genome including influenza virus.

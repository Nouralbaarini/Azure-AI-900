It has been postulated that patients with allergic rhinitis experience more pronounced symptoms and pathophysiology during URI than individuals without allergy. These observations have provided limited insight into the pathogenesis of URI in allergic patients. To better define these relationships several groups of investigators have examined the effect of experimental virus infection on volunteers with and without allergic rhinitis and with and without asthma. Lemanski et al. showed that Rhinovirus 16 (RV16) was able to modify bronchial hyperreactivity and late phase allergic asthmatic reactions. Calhoun et al. demonstrated that RV16 potentiated airway inflammation after segmental allergen bronchoprovocation in allergic subjects. Experimental RV16 infection also provoked a modest increase in histamine responsiveness accompanied by a modest increase in bronchial and intranasal lymphocytes and eosinophils. Yet, experimental RV16 infection did not trigger asthma or changes in spirometry or changes in bronchial reactivity to histamine or bradykinin in normal subjects. Studies in our laboratories using experimental Rhinovirus 39 (RV39) infection did not alter pulmonary measurements or methacholine responses in normal healthy allergic subjects. These results were surprising, as enhanced WBC histamine release was observed in the same RV39\u2010infected allergic subjects and was similar to that observed in RV16 infection described by others. The RV39\u2010infected allergic subjects also showed acute increases in serum IgE as well as changes of cellular immune parameters. Bardin et al. described more severe nasal symptoms as well as increased nasal albumin in allergic rhinitis subjects experimentally infected with RV16. However, allergic subjects infected with RV39 did not show a physiologic hyper\u2010responsiveness during a nonallergy season. Analysis of nasal secretions during RV39 infection did show more vascular permeability in allergic subjects. Experimental infection with RV39 and Influenza A has provoked eustachian tube obstruction, otitis media and rarely acute otitis. These studies of volunteers experimentally infected with virus suggest that atopy alone does not predispose to more severe symptoms but combining URI with allergen exposure enhanced allergen\u2010induced inflammation. Recent studies implicate cytokines as participants in these virus\u2010provoked responses. Increases in nasal lavage concentrations of IL\u20106 were found during experimental URIs caused by RV39, Influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus and coincide with peaks in symptomatology and pathophysiology. Moreover, IL\u20106 applied directly to the nasal mucosa in noninfected allergic subjects reproduced symptoms of rhinitis. Other studies have shown that IL\u201010 secretion from peripheral blood white cells was impaired in allergic subjects after experimental infection with Influenza A. It is anticipated that future studies using natural infection as well as experimental virus infection model will further define the mechanisms and relationships of virus infection to allergy and asthma.","publish_time":"2003-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fireman, P.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d66463d9d1f11314a6e5a9d7cafb3d152534806.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162098.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162098/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs3NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rhinovirus"],"organizations":["WBC","Influenza A","Influenza A."],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Experimental infection","allergic rhinitis subjects","RV39 infection","noninfected allergic subjects","Experimental RV16 infection","allergic patients","normal healthy allergic subjects","effect of experimental virus infection","experimental virus infection model","relationships of virus infection","allergic rhinitis experience","normal subjects","natural infection","experimental Rhinovirus","manifest allergic respiratory disease","experimental URIs","respiratory syncytial virus","symptoms of rhinitis","severe nasal symptoms","late phase allergic asthmatic reactions","studies of volunteers","severe symptoms","nasal mucosa","future studies","Recent studies","pronounced symptoms","pathogenesis of URI","histamine responsiveness","RV16 potentiated airway inflammation","nasal lavage concentrations of IL","provoked responses","increased nasal albumin","Analysis of nasal secretions","allergen exposure enhanced allergen","bronchial hyperreactivity","bronchial reactivity","modest increase","acute otitis","pathophysiology","acute increases","enhanced WBC histamine release","upper respiratory tract infections","segmental allergen bronchoprovocation","induced inflammation","methacholine responses","otitis media","changes of cellular immune parameters","physiologic hyper\u2010responsiveness","pulmonary measurements","participants","peripheral blood white cells","eustachian tube obstruction","intranasal lymphocytes","serum IgE","peaks","spirometry","bradykinin","parainfluenza","mechanisms","vascular permeability","nonallergy season","limited insight","cytokines","individuals","laboratories","groups of investigators","results","eosinophils","children","Calhoun","symptomatology","Bardin","observations","adults","Lemanski","atopy"],"language":"en"},

In order to better grasp the multilevel regulation of complex policy problems, it is needed to understand how uncertainty and scientific expertise are dealt with. We investigate this via the regulation of pandemics by the EU and the WHO, with the H1N1 pandemic of 2009 as critical case. The analysis of the multilevel practice reveals that the attitude toward uncertainty fundamentally differed between the global (WHO) and the European level. At the global level a classic speaking truth to power approach involved the denial of uncertainty, while at the EU level the assigned role of providing scientific expertise was interpreted as a necessity to openly communicate about uncertainty. While the global approach was heavily criticized, the uncertainty communication at the European level was much appreciated.","publish_time":"2019-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Versluis, Esther; van Asselt, Marjolein; Kim, Jinhee","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de7e48816f77e6df46058300853c2e1ceb373f49.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7163688.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163688/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs4NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["global level","EU level","denial of uncertainty","European level","uncertainty communication","global approach","multilevel regulation of complex policy problems","multilevel practice","multilevel governance","scientific expertise","power approach","regulation of pandemics","classic speaking truth","assigned role","challenges","H1N1 pandemic","critical case","attitude","necessity","analysis","order","article"],"language":"en"},

Besides its regulatory pathway involving ganglion cells in the retina, the neural connections between the eyes and the pineal gland include the master circadian clock, the suprachiasmatic nuclei, and the central and peripheral nervous systems. Since pineal melatonin is released into the blood and into the cerebrospinal fluid, it has access to every cell in an organism and it mediates system-wide effects. Subsequently, melatonin was found in several extrapineal organs and, more recently, perhaps in every cell of every organ. In contrast to the pinealocytes, non-pineal cells do not discharge melatonin into the blood; rather it is used locally in an intracrine, autocrine, or paracrine manner. Melatonin levels in non-pineal cells do not exhibit a circadian rhythm and do not depend on circulating melatonin concentrations although when animals are treated with exogenous melatonin it is taken up by presumably all cells. Mitochondria are the presumed site of melatonin synthesis in all cells; the enzymatic machinery for melatonin synthesis has been identified in mitochondria. The association of melatonin with mitochondria, because of its ability to inhibit oxidative stress, is very fortuitous since these organelles are a major site of damaging reactive oxygen species generation. In this review, some of the actions of non-pineal-derived melatonin are discussed in terms of cellular and subcellular physiology.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reiter, Russel J.; Sharma, Ramaswamy; Rosales-Corral, Sergio A.; Coto-Montes, Ana; Boga, Jose Antonio; Vriend, Jerry","journal":"Approaching Complex Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/097dd58a69a0ec46085b4c2bc96f5aecff6bf3d7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164543.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164543/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs4OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pineal melatonin","Melatonin levels","exogenous melatonin","association of melatonin","non-pineal cells","actions of non-pineal-derived melatonin","circulating melatonin concentrations","presumed site of melatonin synthesis","mammalian pineal gland","ganglion cells","Mitochondria","blood","circadian rhythm","master circadian clock","major site of damaging reactive oxygen species generation","suprachiasmatic nuclei","retina","control","animals","terms of cellular","product of serotonin metabolism","enzymatic machinery","organism","access","organelles","light","neural connections","eyes","ability","pinealocytes","regulatory pathway","N-acetyl","peripheral nervous systems","intracrine","paracrine manner","oxidative stress","dark cycle","subcellular physiology","cerebrospinal fluid","contrast","system-wide effects","methoxy-tryptamine","extrapineal organs","review"],"language":"en"},

However, steppe grasslands face desertification or degradation caused by human over\u2010activity. In the last decades, steppe regions have seen increased areas of crop cultivation and subsequent abandonment due to inappropriate agricultural management. Land degradation of abandoned croplands has become a common problem in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. A field survey was conducted in the Xilingol steppe, and vegetation was classified into three groups. Based on comparisons of species composition and soil characters, group 1 represents steppe grassland, group 2 represents abandoned croplands and group 3 represents yardangs. The typical indicator species of steppe, abandoned croplands and yardangs are Leymus chinensis, Cleistogenes squarrosa and Elymus dahuricus, respectively. Abandoned croplands are exposed to wind and rain, resulting in soil erosion, which not only increases coarse sand content but also decreases total carbon and total nitrogen in the soil. We found that soil condition is an important factor affecting the early stages of secondary succession in abandoned croplands and that farming in typical steppes might contribute to land degradation. We concluded that abandoned croplands can be converted to yardangs by erosion. The extension of yardangs might then lead to desertification in steppe regions. Land managers should be aware that farming in typical steppes is associated with a risk of desertification. The degree of degradation of steppe can be measured by monitoring these indicator species.","publish_time":"2011-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kawada, Kiyokazu; , Wuyunna; Nakamura, Toru","journal":"Grassl","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/668666fb70655859992afbf4c64a89371c21bd10.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165941.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165941/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs5NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["steppe regions","Land degradation of abandoned croplands","Xilingol steppe","typical indicator species of steppe","steppe grasslands face desertification","soil erosion","typical steppes","soil characters","soil condition","degree of degradation","extension of yardangs","farming","risk of desertification","Land managers","semiarid regions of Eurasia","comparisons of species composition","vast areas","total carbon","total nitrogen","increased areas of crop cultivation","subsequent abandonment","Leymus chinensis","common problem","early stages of secondary succession","Cleistogenes squarrosa","Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region","important factor","Elymus dahuricus","inappropriate agricultural management","China","coarse sand content","human over\u2010activity","rain","wind","vegetation","decades","field survey","groups"],"language":"en"},

Novel pathogens and transmission methods can easily be exploited to cause disease outbreaks. Advancements in molecular biology that make it possible to genetically modify, edit, or disrupt the genome of pathogens increase the disease risk of an accidental or intentional release of pathogens with pandemic potential. The occurrence of a disease at more than an endemic level may stimulate an investigation to determine the source of the disease, who has the disease, when it occurred, and how it spreads. When intentional release of pathogens is suspected, investigators have the additional task of attributing the outbreak not only to a pathogen but also to a human source. The deliberate nature of such dissemination may be obvious. However, some forms of bioterrorism may be more covert, requiring molecular methods to uncover. The field of microbial forensics emerged following the anthrax attack in the United States in 2001 to extend epidemiologic principles to aid in the investigation of bioterrorism incidents. Microbial forensics combines epidemiology with genomic and microbiologic methods, to identify, characterize, and ascribe the cause of an incident resulting from the intentional or unintentional release of a harmful pathogen. Unlike routine epidemiologic investigations, microbial forensic investigations are undertaken when there is a potential crime due to the release of a pathogen with disease-causing potential. The investigation is conducted to attribute cause to a source based on indisputable evidence and is used to support criminal charges against the perpetrator(s). However, because bioterrorism may be unannounced, the initial investigation will start the same as to any public health incident of concern. This chapter discusses how epidemiology integrated with laboratory science can be used to identify the source of diseases caused by microorganisms or toxins\u2014especially for attribution purposes.","publish_time":"2019-12-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khan, Ali S.; Amara, Philip S.; Morse, Stephen A.","journal":"Microbial Forensics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153336.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153336/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["intentional release of pathogens","disease risk","disease outbreaks","investigation of bioterrorism incidents","unintentional release","Novel pathogens","genome of pathogens","initial investigation","molecular methods","source of diseases","human source","microbial forensic investigations","epidemiology","field of microbial forensics","harmful pathogen","pandemic potential","microbiologic methods","disease-causing potential","Deliberate dissemination","transmission methods","potential crime","forms of bioterrorism","attribute cause","public health incident of concern","routine epidemiologic investigations","global public health security","epidemiologic principles","molecular biology","deliberate nature","latest challenge","different routes","biological agent","anthrax attack","United States","toxins","microorganisms","investigators","criminal charges","perpetrator","additional task","indisputable evidence","endemic level","attribution purposes","laboratory science","Advancements","chapter","occurrence"],"language":"en"},

These are highly conserved and are not pathogen-specific, but are in response to classes of molecular structures. Infections can be perceived both extracellularly and intracellularly by Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) and their host cell ligands, Pathogen Recognition Receptors (PRRs), among them, Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs). The innate immune response to infection includes the release of soluble preformed mediators, or synthesis of cytoplasmic enzymes, cytokines, chemokines, interferons (IFNs), lipid mediators, proteins of the complement cascade, neurotransmitters, nucleotides, and components of transcription factors (High Mobility Group B1, receptors for sex hormones/steroids). Directed cellular migration of parenchymal astrocytes and microglia, as well as recruitment across the blood brain barrier (BBB) of circulating neutrophils, natural killer, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and ultimately T lymphocytes to the site of infection are also hallmarks of innate responses to infections. These responding cells contribute their own secreted effector molecules and effector activities (such as phagocytosis). Distinct viruses are capable of infecting every cell type (endothelial cells, ependymal cells, perivascular macrophages and pericytes, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells, and neurons) in the central nervous system (CNS). These CNS infections challenge the host with a different set of problems than do peripheral viral infections. Among the complications are (a) neurons that rarely express Class I or Class II Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules and are thus not suitable targets for either CD4(\u002B) or CD8(\u002B) MHC-restricted T cells, (b) an enclosed volume that is constrained from swelling during inflammation, as well as poorly developed lymphatic drainage, and (c) the immunologic privilege of the CNS which leads to extremely limited immune surveillance for pathogens. Therefore, the role of innate immunity, both from CNS-resident cells and their products, and from circulating inflammatory cells and molecules which traverse the BBB are essential to \u201Cbuy time,\u201D inhibiting viral replication and dissemination, until the host can marshal an adaptive immune response. The immune responses are crucial for host survival from the infection. Consequently, successful pathogens, especially those that persist, have developed a wide variety of evasive approaches to limit the inhibition of replication. Many of these pathways are highlighted in individual chapters that precede this one. These evasive measures range from neutralizing host secreted molecules (cytokines and chemokines) with soluble receptors, encoding anti-inflammatory proteins in their genome, preventing signal transduction, blocking inhibition of protein synthesis, degradation of essential antiviral molecules, preventing apoptosis, and blockade of the nuclear pore complex. In this chapter, I will attempt to cover the breadth of the innate immune response to viral infection, but will also devote more space to generally under-considered aspects than to the well-known components. There are some caveats to consider, as most experiments have been performed in the murine model and not in man; further, conclusions from experiments using in vitro cultured cells (whether primary or established lines) may not reflect physiological conditions in an undisturbed CNS. Lastly, we now appreciate the complexities imposed on hosts by polymorphisms in genes of critical pathways, leading to increased susceptibility or resistance of that individual but not others.","publish_time":"2016-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reiss, Carol Shoshkes","journal":"Neurotropic Viral Infections","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee08db213ffc7b665ea6a5d44d2d121a5701f5a0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153449.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153449/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjsxMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns","Pathogen Recognition Receptors","High Mobility Group","CNS","BBB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ependymal cells","dendritic cells","endothelial cells","cultured cells","Schwann cells","responding cells","inflammatory cells","CNS-resident cells","Innate immune responses","CNS infections","innate responses","adaptive immune response","MHC-restricted T cells","neutralizing host secreted molecules","secreted effector molecules","host survival","soluble receptors","undisturbed CNS","host cell ligands","Pathogen Recognition Receptors","limited immune surveillance","peripheral viral infections","site of infection","viral replication","role of innate immunity","degradation of essential antiviral molecules","cytokines","microglia","chemokines","BBB","neurons","inhibition of replication","pathogen-specific","experiments","successful pathogens","inhibition of protein synthesis","perivascular macrophages","cell type","lipid mediators","release of soluble preformed mediators","effector activities","anti-inflammatory proteins","express Class","T lymphocytes","well-known components","circulating neutrophils","Molecular Patterns","individual chapters","synthesis of cytoplasmic enzymes","components of transcription factors","Major Histocompatibility Complex","evasive measures range","genes of critical pathways","nuclear pore complex","classes of molecular structures","developed lymphatic drainage","cellular migration of parenchymal astrocytes","wide variety of evasive approaches","High Mobility Group B1","monocytes","pericytes","nucleotides","natural killer","interferons","IFNs","oligodendrocytes","PAMPs","sex hormones","complement cascade","different set of problems","polymorphisms","blood brain barrier","increased susceptibility","neurotransmitters","signal transduction","established lines","blockade","apoptosis","PRRs","products","under-considered aspects","physiological conditions","hosts","man","genome","recruitment","central nervous system","conclusions","time","CD4","space","resistance","CD8","Toll","steroids","suitable targets","immunologic privilege","dissemination","breadth","murine model","Distinct viruses","enclosed volume","complexities","phagocytosis","TLRs","primitive organisms","inflammation","caveats","complications"],"language":"en"},

As \u2018diagnostic PCR\u2019, a set of consensus nested primers was selected from highly conserved stretches of the nucleocapsid (N) gene. As \u2018phylogeny\u2019 PCR, a fragment of the spike protein gene (S1) was amplified and the PCR products were directly sequenced. To study the phylogenetic relationships of the viruses from various outbreaks, studies of molecular epizootiology were performed in Sweden, a Nordic region, where the occurrence of natural cases of the disease is relatively low and the occasional use of live vaccine(s) is well recorded and monitored. The disease appeared in the region in 1994, associated with production problems among layers of various ages. During outbreaks in 1995 and 1997, both layers and broilers were affected. To reduce losses, a live attenuated vaccine has been applied since 1997. By examining 12 cases between 1994 and 1998, molecular epizootiology revealed that, before 1997, the viruses had gene sequences very similar to strains of the Massachusetts serotype. However, comparative sequence analysis of the S1 gene revealed that the identity was not 100% to any of the strains of this serotype that we analysed. A virus related to the Dutch-type strain, D274, was also identified on one farm. Surprisingly, from 1997, the year that vaccination commenced with a live Massachusetts serotype vaccine, the majority of viruses detected had S1 sequences identical to the live Massachusetts vaccine strain. This genetic relation to the vaccine virus was also confirmed by N gene sequence analysis. The studies of molecular epizootiology reveal a strong probability that the vaccination had lead to the spread of the vaccine virus, causing various disease manifestations and a confusing epizootiological situation in the poultry population.","publish_time":"2010-06-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Farsang, A.; Ros, C.; Renstr\u00F6m, Lena H.

This in turn has increased the need to thoroughly monitor the environment of mice and the equipment used for their care. Environmental and equipment monitoring are viewed as management tools used to control the quality of mice produced or housed in the facility. Their purpose is to help safeguard the health of the animals and personnel. In its distilled form, much of environmental and equipment monitoring is common sense coupled with a constant awareness that an animal care program is a dynamic organization dependent on the interaction of animals and people with the physical facility. If the animals are to remain healthy and the physical plant is to continue to function properly, there is little room for error. The errors arise neither from the animals nor the equipment but from the people who are responsible for developing a management policy and style that maintains the health of the animals and the integrity of the physical plant, yet at the same time makes it a pleasant and functional place for both mice and people to accomplish their intended tasks.","publish_time":"2007-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"David Small, J.; Deitrich, Rick","journal":"The Mouse in Biomedical Research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155573/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjsyNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["people","equipment monitoring","interaction of animals","altered mice","quality of mice","environment of mice","physical plant","physical facility","management policy","management practices","management tools","need","health","stringent environmental conditions","animal care program","increased use of inbred","dynamic organization dependent","constant awareness","common sense","functional place","compromised immune systems","integrity","time","style","intended tasks","distilled form","little room","personnel","turn","purpose","errors"],"language":"en"},

There is historical precedent for the use of biological agents against both military and civilian populations. The use of biological (and chemical) agents as weapons of war has been well documented. The German biological warfare program during World War I included covert infections of Allied livestock with anthrax and glanders. The Japanese army began conducting experiments on the effects of bacterial agents of biowarfare on Chinese prisoners in occupied Manchuria in 1932 at their infamous Unit 731. The United States began its own offensive biological weapons program in 1942 and, during its 28-year official existence, weaponized and stockpiled lethal biological agents, such as anthrax, as well as incapacitating agents, such as the etiologic agent of Q fever. There are some recent examples of bioterrorism, though not necessarily resulting in attacks causing morbidity or mortality, may serve as harbingers of future events. Saddam Hussein\u0027s regime in Iraq developed and deployed anthrax and botulinum-laden warheads in the years leading up to the Gulf War. The reasons that these weapons were never used in an actual attack probably had more to do with the implicit threat of overwhelming US retaliation and Iraqi technological deficiencies rather than the regime\u0027s reluctance to violate any moral principles. Biological agents have also been used to forward political ideologies: in 1984 a religious cult, intent on influencing voter turnout during a local election, contaminated restaurant salad bars in The Dalles, Oregon.","publish_time":"2008-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Artenstein, Andrew W.; Martin, Troy","journal":"The Social Ecology of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155594/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjsyOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Saddam Hussein"],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","Iraq","Oregon"],"keyphrases":["use of biological agents","incapacitating agents","stockpiled lethal biological agents","weapons of war","offensive biological weapons program","effects of bacterial agents of biowarfare","malicious deployment of microbial agents","German biological warfare program","deployed anthrax","World War","Gulf War","recent examples of bioterrorism","Iraqi technological deficiencies","local election","contaminated restaurant salad bars","voter turnout","implicit threat of overwhelming US retaliation","Chinese prisoners","covert infections of Allied livestock","toxins","regime\u0027s reluctance","overt example of human behavior","occupied Manchuria","botulinum-laden warheads","religious cult","epidemic infectious diseases","Dalles","year official existence","years","experiments","military","intent","Saddam Hussein\u0027s regime","non-combat setting","etiologic agent of Q fever","United States","civilian populations","historical precedent","mortality","moral principles","Oregon","glanders","political ideologies","Japanese army","infamous Unit","harbingers of future events","attacks","morbidity","actual attack","reasons"],"language":"en"},

With standard incidence when the associated reproduction threshold is less than unity, the model exhibits the phenomenon of backward bifurcation, where a stable disease-free equilibrium co-exists with a stable endemic equilibrium. It is then proved that this phenomenon vanishes either when the vaccine is assumed to be 100% potent and perfect or the Standard Incidence is replaced with a Mass Action Incidence in the model development. Furthermore, the model has a unique endemic and disease-free equilibria. Using a suitable Lyapunov function, the endemic equilibrium and disease free equilibrium are proved to be globally-asymptotically stable depending on whether the control reproduction number is less or greater than unity. Some numerical simulations are presented to validate the analytic results.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rabiu, Musa; Willie, Robert; Parumasur, Nabendra","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/daf9937f2a41a003f8127ae952d8196c4a95e2ab.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149030/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Standard Incidence"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stable endemic equilibrium","stable disease-free equilibrium co-","standard incidence","model development","disease free equilibrium","unique endemic","unity","new disease-resistant mathematical model","Mass Action Incidence","disease-free equilibria","imperfect vaccine","associated reproduction threshold","control reproduction number","phenomenon of backward bifurcation","treatment","fraction","susceptible class","suitable Lyapunov function","quarantine classes","paper","numerical simulations","analytic results"],"language":"en"},

The virus outbreak provoked public fear, which resulted in a mass reduction in transit use in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA). Its effect differed among socioeconomic groups and geographical areas. A typical way to analyze this is to associate individual reactions to the disaster with socioeconomic characteristics. However, a more structured approach, which considers behavioral characteristics resulting from the societal position of an individual, would identify the basic reason for such associations. The study hypothesized that the degree of fixity that individuals have in their daily life may elucidate these associations. When fear is prevalent, people having the flexibility to change their lifestyle will make more changes in daily activities and travels. The study examined the influence of public fear of a pandemic disease on travel behavior and the effect of life fixity on individual response to the fear. To this end, smart card data of transit use and changes in travel behavior during the MERS period were examined. The study found that fear was powerful and influenced travel behavior differently depending on life fixity levels and regional characteristics.","publish_time":"2017-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Chansung; Cheon, Seung Hoon; Choi, Keechoo; Joh, Chang-Hyeon; Lee, Hyuk-Jin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b55a81d3e561a0ba3d3f132781aef8b4a5375ac2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149053/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","South Korea","Seoul Metropolitan Area"],"keyphrases":["study","effect of life fixity","influence of public fear","daily life","socioeconomic characteristics","influenced travel behavior","life fixity levels","changes","degree of fixity","behavioral characteristics","individual response","regional characteristics","individual reactions","associations","MERS period","socioeconomic groups","virus outbreak","daily activities","smart card data of transit use","Disaster management teams","pandemic disease","Seoul Metropolitan Area","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","end","societal position","mass reduction","individuals","geographical areas","South Korea","flexibility","structured approach","lifestyle","travels","people","basic reason","typical way"],"language":"en"},

Interventions included an informational poster, hand-sanitizer dispenser, and change agent to increase hand-hygiene behavior. Results showed that the presence of a strategically placed hand-sanitizer dispenser was effective in increasing hand-hygiene behavior from 1.52% to over 60% (average n = 208 students per day). Participants were particularly responsive to the hand-sanitizer dispenser when combined with a change agent. Meanwhile, the tested interventions were ineffective in increasing the number of students entering a restroom to hand wash.

The aim of this research is to study the phylogeny estimation from Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) haplotypes under the maximum parsimony criterion (MPPEP-SNP). Previous exact methods have modeled the mentioned problem as a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problem. Since the problem, in general, proved to be NP-hard which causes MIP models to take long runtime for solving large-scale instances, the need for non-exact methods is obvious. In this paper, the authors propose a heuristic algorithm that attempts to find the MPPEP-SNP solution in several stages by solving a specific MIP model in each stage. Created based on network flows formulation, MIP models appearing in each stage are very small; therefore, their exact solutions could be found practically very fast. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, it has been tested on both simulated and real instances and compared with Pars and Flow-RM as two of the best known methods. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed method can compete with the previous methods in terms of accuracy, runtime, and specially the largeness of the solved instances.","publish_time":"2018-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feizabadi, R.; Bagherian, M.; Vaziri, H.

It can be used independently of a particular ideology. The TRAP-18 consists of 8 proximal warning behaviors and 10 distal characteristics, and has been designed to help prioritize the imminency of risk in specific cases, and therefore determine the intensity of monitoring and active management a case requires. Research has demonstrated excellent interrater reliability, and promising content, criterion, discriminant, and predictive validity. More research is in progress.

Contemporary infection control mechanisms set the human and the pathogenic microbe against each other, as the victim versus the menace. This biomedical polarization persistently runs through the contemporary dominant mode of thinking about public health and infectious disease governance. Taking its cue from the currently accepted germ theory of disease, such mechanisms render a global city like Hong Kong not only pervasively \u201Con alert\u201D and under threat of unpredictable and pathogenic viruses and other microbes, it also gives rise to a hygiene and antimicrobial politics that is never entirely able to control pathogenic circulation. The article draws on recent advances in medical microbiology, which depart from germ theory, to invoke an ecological understanding of the human-microbe relation. Here, while a small number of viruses are pathogenic, the majority are benign; some are even essential to human life. Disease is not just the outcome of a pathogenic microbe infecting a human host but emerges from socioeconomic relations, which exacerbate human-animal-microbial interactions. In a final step, the article draws on Daoist thought to reflect on the ways that such a microbial understanding translates into life and city dwelling.","publish_time":"2019-08-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Voelkner, Nadine","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7051470d2c4d38201bdd2823a0c3d5d0937ac29.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149467.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149467/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjszMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["human life","pathogenic microbe","pathogenic viruses","human host","human-animal","human-microbe relation","pathogenic circulation","microbial understanding","global city","accepted germ theory of disease","microbial approach","microbial interactions","article","Contemporary infection control mechanisms","global health security","infectious disease governance","public health","ecological understanding","city dwelling","small number of viruses","contemporary dominant mode of thinking","medical microbiology","threat of unpredictable","socioeconomic relations","antimicrobial politics","rise","recent advances","Hong Kong","microbes","hygiene","alert","Daoist","cue","ways","majority","outcome","final step","biomedical polarization","victim","menace"],"language":"en"},

Several examples from all around the world have been quoted to highlight different incidents of bioterrorism across the world. After addressing vicious epidemics, several laboratory methods for detection and surveillance for bioterrorism have been elaborated. The case studies of bioterrorism in terms of warfare highlight use of bioweapons at political fronts. Similarly, the success story of controlling bird flu and advent and persistence of dengue show the status of bioterrorism and Pakistan\u0027s preparedness to deal with this menace. Pakistan has strengthened itself to deal with bioterrorism by adopting different national and global tools for governance.

What is Ebola? Why did this happen? Here you will find the answers to these questions, while meeting fascinating people thrust into a situation as dramatic as any that could be imagined in a blockbuster novel or movie. By reading this book you will come to understand why the world was unprepared for the outbreak of such a deadly pathogen as Ebola virus and why it still is. You will gain intimate knowledge of a pathogen that spread like a tsunami over a region of the world that lacked the resources to fight it. You will meet a group of people that by chance were already there to fight another deadly virus. You will find out how in a matter of weeks this small group of doctors, nurses, and scientists were overwhelmed and why this matters. You will meet people that fought with limited resources at hand and became heroes that put the possibility of saving their patients ahead of their own lives.

Domesticated llamas and alpacas have become hobby pets and thus management and genetic issues are an increasing source of disease. These include obesity, vitamin and mineral deficiencies and intoxications, metabolic derangements, and congenital malformations (particularly in the young). Domesticated animals are also more prone to degenerative arthropathy and dental disease as they age than wild camelids. Ovarian hydrobursitis is an important source of infertility in dromedaries. Important infectious diseases include coccidiosis, bovine viral diarrhea virus, alpaca fever, and meningeal worm of NW camelids, trypanosomiasis and camelpox in OW camels, and foot and mouth disease in Bactrian camels and NW camelids.

The natural history of COPD is punctuated by episodes of acute deterioration in respiratory health termed exacerbations. Exacerbations are responsible for much of the morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with COPD, and also affect the rate of decline in lung function. Most exacerbations are caused by episodes of tracheobronchial infection. The clinical features comprise a worsening in symptoms beyond usual day-to-day variation. Examination may reveal tachypnea and signs of respiratory failure. Pathologically, exacerbations are associated with an increase in airway and systemic inflammation which, at least in more severe disease, is predominantly neutrophilic. Simple investigations are indicated to exclude differential diagnoses and assess exacerbation severity. Treatment aims to support respiratory function whilst drugs aimed at the underlying cause are able to act. The cornerstone of therapy is inhaled bronchodilators, with oral corticosteroids in all but the mildest exacerbations. Antibiotics are indicated if there has been a change in the character of the sputum. Some patients with respiratory failure will require supplemental oxygen or assisted ventilation. Strategies to prevent exacerbations include inhaled corticosteroids, long acting bronchodilators, and influenza vaccination.","publish_time":"2006-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wedzicha, J.A.; Hurst, J.R.","journal":"Encyclopedia of Respiratory Medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150188.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7150188/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs0ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory function","mildest exacerbations","respiratory health termed exacerbations","signs of respiratory failure","lower respiratory tract symptoms","inhaled bronchodilators","inhaled corticosteroids","airway inflammation","natural history of COPD","acting bronchodilators","oral corticosteroids","lung function","severe disease","systemic inflammation","episodes of acute deterioration","episodes of tracheobronchial infection","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","airflow obstruction","worsening","condition","supplemental oxygen","differential diagnoses","morbidity","usual day-to-day variation","healthcare costs","drugs","tachypnea","increase","underlying cause","assisted ventilation","rate of decline","cornerstone of therapy","exacerbation severity","mortality","influenza vaccination","clinical features","patients","Strategies","Simple investigations","change","character","sputum","Examination","Treatment","Antibiotics"],"language":"en"},

Despite numerous clinical trials, there is still no effective pharmacotherapy available for ARDS patients. However, recent research on extracellular vesicles provides new insights into pathogenesis, prognosis, and potential therapeutic options for ARDS. Extracellular vesicles are membrane-bound anuclear structures which constitute a recently recognized and important intercellular communication mechanism, allowing targeted transfer of diverse biologic cargo between different cell types. There is new evidence that extracellular vesicles play an important role in the pathogenesis of ARDS and also potentially a protective role. In this chapter, we highlight recent translational and clinical studies that have advanced our understanding of the critical role extracellular vesicles play in both inducing and attenuating inflammatory lung injury in ARDS. This review also considers the wide range of potential clinical applications for extracellular vesicles, ranging from use as biomarkers of lung injury to therapeutic agents for ARDS. Extracellular vesicles represent a new frontier for research in ARDS.","publish_time":"2019-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mahida, R. Y.; Matsumoto, S.; Matthay, M.

The intensification of animal husbandry; centralisation of large groups of animals in industrial production units; globalization of trade in live animals and/or animal products, bedding and feeds; as well as increased tourism, are all considerable factors in the threat of devastating infectious diseases word-wide. The opening of borders between many countries such as in the European continent contributes greatly to the high-risk situation, where infectious agents may easily travel thousands of miles and then suddenly appear in areas where they are unexpected and probably even unknown. The sudden and unexpected appearance of any infectious disease in a new region, be it a country or a continent, may lead to a delayed or innaccurate diagnosis resulting in the uncontrolled spread of the disease agent to other susceptible populations of animals over large geographic areas. Recent major examples are incidences of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the UK, the extension of rinderpest into the Somali plains and Rift Valley fever (RVF) spread into the Arabian Peninsula. The latest major problem is the occurrence, re-occurrence and rapid spread of influenza virus.

Existing studies mainly focus on high detection accuracy, which often requires large volumes of data on contents, source credibility or propagation. In this paper we focus on early detection of rumours when data for information sources or propagation is scarce. We observe that tweets attract immediate comments from the public who often express uncertain and questioning attitudes towards rumour tweets. We therefore propose to learn user attitude distribution for Twitter posts from their comments, and then combine it with content analysis for early detection of rumours. Specifically we propose convolutional neural network (CNN) CNN and BERT neural network language models to learn attitude representation for user comments without human annotation via transfer learning based on external data sources for stance classification. We further propose CNN-BiLSTM- and BERT-based deep neural models to combine attitude representation and content representation for early rumour detection. Experiments on real-world rumour datasets show that our BERT-based model can achieve effective early rumour detection and significantly outperform start-of-the-art rumour detection models.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tian, Lin; Zhang, Xiuzhen; Wang, Yan; Liu, Huan","journal":"Advances in Information Retrieval","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/90f08f1b2ed18d704f912f0bd47fd610f77f0906.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148202.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148202/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs4NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effective early rumour detection","early detection of rumours","art rumour detection models","rumour tweets","attitude representation","high detection accuracy","real-world rumour datasets","content representation","user comments","BERT neural network language models","deep neural models","BERT-based model","external data sources","user attitude distribution","convolutional neural network","CNN-BiLSTM","immediate comments","propagation","large volumes of data","information sources","content analysis","Twitter posts","transfer learning","human annotation","contents","public","questioning attitudes","source credibility","stance classification","start","Existing studies","important problem","Experiments","paper"],"language":"en"},

Curriculum learning has recently been shown to improve neural models\u2019 effectiveness by sampling batches non-uniformly, going from easy to difficult instances during training. In the context of neural Information Retrieval (IR) curriculum learning has not been explored yet, and so it remains unclear (1) how to measure the difficulty of training instances and (2) how to transition from easy to difficult instances during training. To address both challenges and determine whether curriculum learning is beneficial for neural ranking models, we need large-scale datasets and a retrieval task that allows us to conduct a wide range of experiments. For this purpose, we resort to the task of conversation response ranking: ranking responses given the conversation history. In order to deal with challenge (1), we explore scoring functions to measure the difficulty of conversations based on different input spaces. To address challenge (2) we evaluate different pacing functions, which determine the velocity in which we go from easy to difficult instances. We find that, overall, by just intelligently sorting the training data (i.e., by performing curriculum learning) we can improve the retrieval effectiveness by up to 2% (The source code is available at https://github.com/Guzpenha/transformers_cl.).","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Penha, Gustavo; Hauff, Claudia","journal":"Advances in Information Retrieval","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e110fd35a79f6c03c7d00d2aabc5f292f3ece6f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148246.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148246/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs5MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Neural","Information Retrieval"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Curriculum learning","difficulty of training instances","difficult instances","Neural ranking models","training data","ranking responses","retrieval task","retrieval effectiveness","neural models\u2019 effectiveness","task of conversation response ranking","context of neural Information Retrieval","entire training set","different pacing functions","difficulty of conversations","conversation history","scoring functions","sampling batches non-","different input spaces","series of random batches","large-scale datasets","velocity","wide range of experiments","source code","challenges","order","purpose"],"language":"en"},

We extend this setup by driving the learning of such a model with captions of clicked images as the target, instead of using the subsequent query within the session. Since these captions tend to be linguistically richer, the reformulation mechanism can be seen as assistance to construct more descriptive queries.

These leadership tasks resulted in the formation of relational networks that could serve as social, emotional, and cognitive resources for organizational resilience.","publish_time":"2017-08-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Teo, Winnie L.; Lee, Mary; Lim, Wee\u2010Shiong","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b15d947504dcb1cb54c134dbbadaddc69204c12.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166971.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166971/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Relational Activation"],"locations":["Tan Tock Seng Hospital","Singapore"],"keyphrases":["organizational leaders","organizational resilience","new relational connections","formation of relational networks","formation of new connections","Relational Activation of Resilience model","positive emotional connections","members","severe acute respiratory syndrome crisis","liminal period","abbreviated case study of Tan Tock Seng Hospital","Singapore","cognitive resources","swift trust","routines","liminality","collective meaning","relationships","leadership tasks","sensemaking","Early signs","addition"],"language":"en"},

Since the introduction of GLPs, regulatory agencies worldwide have increasingly required additional types of safety studies, such as viral clearance studies for plasma\u2010derived and biotechnology products, to be performed in accordance with the principles of the GLP regulations. Establishment of a GLP compliance program for non\u2010toxicology safety studies, however, has many challenges. In a viral validation study, a bench\u2010scale model of a manufacturing step is developed and is used to evaluate virus clearance, and so, many GLP elements such as the definitions for test article and test system, are not directly applicable. In spite of these difficulties, GLP concepts can be implemented as much as possible to ensure the integrity of the study. A GLP compliance program, with application to a number of disciplines, including viral validation, was established at Bayer HealthCare Biological Products Division. Integral to the effort was a multi\u2010functional team comprised of members from the quality Assurance Unit (QAU) and different departments within Research and Development (R\u0026D). The team is primarily responsible for preparing, reviewing, and harmonizing the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) used in all regulated non\u2010clinical laboratory studies. Through the effective interactions between R\u0026D and QAU, study participants gain essential knowledge and experience in GLPs. In addition to performing audits, the QAU plays an important role in the implementation of strategies for GLP compliance. As a result, significant progress has been made toward meeting the challenges of establishing a GLP compliance program for non\u2010toxicology safety studies.

DCs are present in the gut mucosa and may thus be target for modulation by gut microbes, including ingested probiotics. Here, we tested the hypothesis that species of lactic acid bacteria, important members of the gut flora, differentially activate DC. A large panel of human gut\u2010derived Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium spp. was screened for DC\u2010polarizing capacity by exposing bone marrow\u2010derived murine DC to lethally irradiated bacteria. Cytokines in culture supernatants and DC\u2010surface maturation markers were analysed. Substantial differences were found among strains in the capacity to induce interleukin\u201012 (IL\u201012) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)\u2010\u03B1, while the differences for IL\u201010 and IL\u20106 were less pronounced. Bifidobacteria tended to be weak IL\u201012 and TNF\u2010\u03B1 inducers, while both strong and weak IL\u201012 inducers were found among the strains of Lactobacillus. Remarkably, strains weak in IL\u201012 induction inhibited IL\u201012 and TNF\u2010\u03B1 production induced by an otherwise strong cytokine\u2010inducing strain of Lactobacillus casei, while IL\u201010 production remained unaltered. Selected strains were tested for induction of DC maturation markers. Those lactobacilli with greatest capacity to induce IL\u201012 were most effective in upregulating surface MHC class II and CD86. Moreover, L. casei\u2010induced upregulation of CD86 was reduced in the presence of a weak IL\u201012\u2010inducing L. reuteri. In conclusion, human Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium spp. polarize differentially DC maturation. Thus, the potential exists for Th1/Th2/Treg\u2010driving capacities of the gut DC to be modulated according to composition of gut flora including ingested probiotics.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chistensen, H.

Vitamin E deficiency has also been found to predispose pigs to different diseases, E. coli infection is one among them. After weaning, the vitamin E status of pigs often decreases to a critical low level. In this experiment, we studied whether vitamin C supplementation would be a possible feeding strategy to optimize the immune status of weaners. The interaction between vitamin E and C is interesting due to the reported sparing action on vitamin E or synergism between these to vitamins. Piglets were weaned at day 28 of age from sows fed increasing dietary vitamin E during lactation, and piglets were during the following 3 weeks fed either a control diet or this diet supplemented with 500 mg STAY\u2010C per kg. Blood sampling was obtained weekly from day 28 and until day 49 of age. On the same days, one piglet per dietary treatment was killed and alveolar macrophages (AM) were harvested. Vitamin C supplementation increased the concentration of IgM in serum of piglets throughout the weaning period. Although the vitamin E concentration in AM decreased with increasing age of the piglets, the concentration was numerically higher in piglets of sows fed the high dietary level of vitamin E. However, vitamin C supplementation tended to increase the total AM concentration of vitamin E after weaning and increased the proportion of the biologically most active isomer of vitamin E [RRR\u2010(\u03B1\u2010tocopherol)] in the AM. The eicosanoid synthesis by AM was not influenced by the vitamin C supplementation, but the synthesis of leukotriene B4 was decreased 2 weeks after weaning compared to other days of AM harvesting. In conclusion, dietary vitamin C supplementation improved the immune responses of piglets after weaning.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lauridsen, C.; Jensen, S.

Acute gastroenteritis is one of the most common illnesses affecting humans and may be caused by a large variety of different microbes. Infection with gastroenteritis agents can be asymptomatic or can be followed by mild or severe disease, including vomiting or diarrhea or both, and can be fatal because of severe dehydration. The spectrum of causative agents differs in developed and developing countries. Besides rotaviruses (RVs) as the main etiologic agent, there are many other viral causes of diarrhea. The main diarrheagenic agents comprise four virus families: RVs, enteric adenoviruses (Ads), human caliciviruses (CVs), and astroviruses. Treatment of infantile diarrhea is mainly by oral or intravenous rehydration. Several formulas of oral rehydration solution (ORS) have been devised and are recommended.","publish_time":"2004-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Perspect Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cce0cb717d2469b8132d5943bbc561b66648d996.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172247/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs0ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gastroenteritis agents","viral causes of diarrhea","RVs","main diarrheagenic agents","Treatment of infantile diarrhea","epidemiology of viral gastroenteritis","Acute gastroenteritis","spectrum of causative agents","formulas of oral rehydration solution","severe disease","intravenous rehydration","severe dehydration","main etiologic agent","virus families","enteric adenoviruses","Ads","human caliciviruses","CVs","pathophysiology","ORS","immunology","vomiting","large variety of different microbes","Infection","common illnesses","humans","astroviruses","chapter","rotaviruses","countries"],"language":"en"},

Since there is no \u201Cone-fits-all\u201D cloud service provider, companies face the challenge of selecting and combining services from different vendors to meet all their requirements. Therefore, this paper calls for the design of a cloud brokering framework that would enable faster and easier selection of cloud services by recommending appropriate services through a matchmaking system. Drawing on previously conducted studies and considering current issues and practical experiences both from provider and user perspectives, we propose a framework that would identify, rank and recommend cloud services from multiple modules and components to individual consumers. Furthermore, we contribute an early-stage design of a cloud broker framework that considers cloud-service consumers\u2019 sourcing preferences while making new cloud-sourcing decisions and that can be used in the selection and adoption phase of implementing cloud services and/or as part of a multicloud strategy.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hentschel, Raoul; Strahringer, Susanne","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e6795c64890ea18af10b5a28e9ec55710f31795.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134226.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134226/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsxNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["appropriate cloud services","cloud service provider","easier selection of cloud services","cloud broker framework","appropriate services","new cloud-sourcing decisions","cloud-service consumers\u2019 sourcing preferences","fit cloud service consumer requirements","early-stage design","multiple modules","practical experiences","complex","components","current issues","cost-intensive process","user perspectives","individual consumers","challenge","companies","adoption phase","rank","conducted studies","medium-sized enterprises","different vendors","matchmaking system","fits","multicloud strategy","paper"],"language":"en"},

Embracing good financial inclusion (FI) schemes in a country helps to ensure that entrepreneurs of SSB have access to financial services and hence meet their needs. In this paper we studied FI scheme in Kingdom of Eswatini with the view to establish the extent to which SSB have access to funds in running their businesses such that they could satisfy the target population and meet their desired goals. We got FI dataset for Eswatini for 2018 from Finscope database. Finscope 2018 dataset contains 1385 attributes with 2928 records. This study extracted attributes based on payment channel, registered/unregistered business, usage of commercial banks/insurance/mobile money and source of income for households from the Finscope database. We identified lot of missing data and hence replaced them using Mode method of preprocessing module in WEKA. We split the datasets and carried out cross validation on it. Training data is 80% of the datasets and 20% was used for testing. We carefully classified FI for selected parameters for Hhohho, Manzini, Shiselweni and Lubombo regions of Eswatini using Logistic regression with 80% for training and 10 fold cross-validation. The best 10 fold cross-validation recall rate for Manzini region using support vector machine (SVM) is 69.4% and 63.4% using logistic regression. These results show that veracity of FI dataset is weak and this is due to large number of missing data.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Akinnuwesi, Boluwaji A.; Fashoto, Stephen G.; Metfula, Andile S.; Akinnuwesi, Adetutu N.","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca7fd0b0696a7b3b067bfe47e362030cd3ea5111.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134229.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134229/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsxNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SSB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["classified FI","FI scheme","cross validation","veracity of FI dataset","Training data","Finscope database","fold cross-validation recall rate","Kingdom of Eswatini","entrepreneurs of SSB","access","attributes","Logistic regression","lot of missing data","datasets","large number of missing data","Lubombo regions of Eswatini","good financial inclusion","Manzini region","financial services","employment rate","objectives of good governance","capital base of small scale businesses","Hhohho","mobile money","usage of commercial banks","unregistered business","insurance","support vector machine","Shiselweni","source of income","selected parameters","payment channel","households","schemes","Mode method of preprocessing module","WEKA","SVM","order","target population","desired goals","investments","study","view","paper","country","extent","funds","results","needs","records","testing"],"language":"en"},

This was done by Conceptualising the characteristics of the service provider and technology characteristics as the two dimensions that could influence merchant adoption of mobile payments. The study was done through the lenses of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Trust-Theoretic Model and adopted a qualitative approach where two merchants were selected from the health sector. The findings demonstrate that the role of merchant trust is very critical for adoption due to m-payment technology and security risk. Hence, sufficient trust-building structures in mobile payment space are essential for the adoption of mobile payment by merchants. Moreover, the findings indicate mobile service provider characteristics and the mobile technology characteristics are both imperative toward building trust in mobile payment systems for merchants\u2019 adoption. The study also found that the trust of both technology and service provider has a far more critical influence on merchants\u2019 adoption of mobile payments than perceived usefulness or ease of use. The study, therefore, recommends that service providers should consider the opportunity to nurture merchant trust because merchant trust acts as a fundamental enabler for the adoption of mobile payments. Other implications are also discussed.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yeboah, Eunice; Boateng, Richard; Owusu, Acheampong; Afful-Dadzie, Eric; Ofori-Amanfo, Joshua","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/26a4acc2141ba6c5926040f701494f824bed9748.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134291.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134291/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsyMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["merchant adoption of mobile payments","mobile payment systems","mobile technology characteristics","mobile payment space","merchants\u2019 adoption of mobile payments","payment technology","role of merchant trust","mobile service provider characteristics","merchant trust acts","merchant\u2019s trust","sufficient trust","role trust play","Trust-Theoretic Model","study","Technology Acceptance Model","service providers","critical influence","findings","enablers","perceived usefulness","fundamental enabler","structures","TAM","opportunity","qualitative approach","ease of use","lenses","dimensions","crucial need","security risk","health sector","implications"],"language":"en"},

Emphasis is initially placed upon the bone osteoclast, the skeletal muscle myotube and the placental syncytiotrophoblast. The widespread occurence of MNGCs in a range of pathological situations is discussed, with emphasis upon the broad involvement of the macrophage in inflammatory responses. Many viruses produce cell fusion in vivo and in vitro when cell cultures are infected. Several examples are given. A clear distinction is drawn between viral fusion from \u201Cwithout\u201D and viral fusion from \u201Cwithin\u201D the cell. The cytopathic effect (CPE) of the animal and human retroviruses is discussed in considerable detail. The in vivo and in vitro formation of lymphocytic and macrophage MNGCs by HIV-1 is given extensive coverage. The possible significance of the presence of brain MNGCs of macrophage/microglial origin as a cellular feature of AIDS dementia is discussed. A new hypothesis is advanced relating to the possible role of endogenous C-type retrovirus in the physiological fusion of the invasive placental cytotrophoblasts to create the syncytiotrophoblast. The evolutionary and developmental significance of such an event in relation to the evolution of the placental mammals is discussed. The possible importance of MNGC formation in the depletion of the CD4(\u002B) population of T-lymphocytes in vivo in the clinical progression of the AIDS-related complex and AIDS is related to the potent fusogenic effect of HIV-1 when cell cultures are infected.","publish_time":"2002-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harris, J.R.","journal":"Micron","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134806/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjszMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MNGC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell fusion","macrophage MNGCs","viral fusion","cell cultures","physiological fusion","possible significance","presence of brain MNGCs of macrophage","widespread occurence of MNGCs","AIDS-related complex","placental mammals","Emphasis","possible importance of MNGC formation","invasive placental cytotrophoblasts","cellular feature of AIDS dementia","potent fusogenic effect of HIV","formation of lymphocytic","developmental significance","cytopathic effect","possible role of endogenous C-type retrovirus","microglial origin","advanced relating","skeletal muscle myotube","clinical progression","bone osteoclast","broad involvement","range of pathological situations","lymphocytes","CPE","animal","CD4","event","depletion","evolution","relation","human retroviruses","population of T","new hypothesis","inflammatory responses","survey","available ultrastructural data","multinucleate giant cells","clear distinction","extensive coverage","examples"],"language":"en"},

Deep water collections have been made by dredging and trawling. These are both cost-effective collection methods if the substratum does not cause damage to or snag the gear. There are several disadvantages to these approaches. It is difficult to photograph the organisms in their habitat, and encrusting organisms or organisms that grow in crevices, under ledges, or on steep rock faces cannot be easily collected unless the hard substrate that supports the organism is collected as well; dredging and trawling put all collected samples in close contact with each other and therefore, some organisms may chemically contaminate others because of exudations or secretions of various compounds and the environmental impact of dredging or trawling can be detrimental because the sampling is nonselective and habitats can be damaged or destroyed. A controversial facet of marine-derived microorganisms is their putative role with respect to the origin of bioactive natural products from marine macroorganism\u2013microorganisms associations. Symbiotic microorganisms have been repeatedly suggested as being the direct or indirect sources of bioactive metabolites in marine sponges and other invertebrates, tunicates, and bryozoans.","publish_time":"2013-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oliver, J.McConnell; Ross, E.Longley; Frank, E.Koehn","journal":"Discovery of Novel Natural Products with Therapeutic Potential","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150297.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7150297/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs1MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["trawling","marine sponges","marine macroorganism","encrusting organisms","discovery of marine natural products","controversial facet of marine","derived microorganisms","microorganisms associations","Symbiotic microorganisms","collected samples","origin of bioactive natural products","environmental impact of dredging","indirect sources of bioactive metabolites","respect","putative role","secretions of various compounds","invertebrates","therapeutic potential","substratum","ledges","sampling","exudations","tunicates","close contact","cost-effective collection methods","steep rock faces","habitats","chapter","crevices","Deep water collections","hard substrate","damage","bryozoans","disadvantages","approaches","gear"],"language":"en"},

When the colonies first formed the United States, there was no national public health law. In a time when traveling any significant distance was rare, infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics were often localized, to an extent that is difficult to imagine today. The origin of independent federal public health authority derives from laws designed to provide medical care for eighteenth-century merchant seamen, a group who traveled constantly and often had little access to care when they became ill in unfamiliar cities. Moreover, their illnesses threatened the mercantile trade that was essential to the economy of the fledging nation. The origins of what is now the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) began in 1798, when Congress established a fund to provide treatment for sick and injured merchant seamen. The PHS is now a component of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The core of federal public health law is found in the statutes that grant authority for various actions to DHHS, PHS, and CDC.","publish_time":"2010-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hunter, Nan D.","journal":"The Law of Emergencies","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7152008/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs3MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["U.S. Public Health Service","PHS","Congress","U.S. Department of Health and Human Services","CDC"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["Public Health Service","national public health law","core of federal public health law","Department of Health","origin of independent federal public health authority","PHS","current operations of public health emergency law","DHHS","origins","eighteenth-century merchant seamen","injured merchant seamen","medical care","treatment","infectious disease outbreaks","laws","significant distance","various actions","statutes","economy","epidemics","Human Services","mercantile trade","United States","fund","chapter","group","component","fledging nation","unfamiliar cities","little access","illnesses","colonies","Congress","time","state levels","CDC","extent"],"language":"en"},

In these devices, named as \u2018nanomechanical biosensors,\u2019 a biomolecular interaction produces a change in the mechanical behavior of the transducer (a movement at nanometer scale), which can be measured and analyzed in real time. Microcantilevers translate the molecular recognition of biomolecules into a nanomechanical motion that is commonly coupled to an optical read-out system. This chapter discusses the main aspects regarding the physics of microcantilever as well the optical read-out techniques. It reviews the state-of-the-art, and discusses the prospective future directions of this new family of biosensors. Nanomechanical sensors are derived from the microfabricated cantilevers used in atomic force microscopy (AFM) and are based on the bending or resonance change induced in the cantilever when a biomolecular interaction takes place on one of its surfaces. The cantilever response depends on its mechanical properties, which are determined mainly by their spring constant and resonance frequency. Both parameters depend on the cantilever material and its geometry. The increasing number of applications of microcantilevers as biosensors has established these systems as a versatile platform for real-time and in situmeasurements of physical, chemical, and biochemical interactions. Further research is banked upon to provide information for increasing the biosensor sensitivity.","publish_time":"2008-07-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alvarez, Mar; Zinoviev, Kirill; Moreno, Miguel; Lechuga, Laura M.","journal":"Optical Biosensors","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152376.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7152376/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs5ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nanomechanical biosensors","sensitive biosensors","Microcantilevers","new family of biosensors","biomolecular interaction","cantilever material","cantilever response","nanomechanical motion","Nanomechanical sensors","resonance change","chapter","optical read-out techniques","optical read-out system","physics of microcantilever","microcantilever structures","mechanical behavior","mechanical properties","resonance frequency","micro-electromechanical systems","increasing number of applications","microfabricated cantilevers","situmeasurements of physical","atomic force microscopy","prospective future directions","MEMs","molecular recognition of biomolecules","application of nano","movement","versatile platform","NEMs","main aspects","transducers","place","information","biochemical interactions","nanometer scale","AFM","spring constant","biosensor sensitivity","parameters","geometry","bending","devices","real time","research","surfaces"],"language":"en"},

The primary aim of this preliminary systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the effect of CRT for AN relative to control treatments in randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) on neuropsychological inefficiencies at end-of-treatment. Secondary aims were to assess the effect of CRT for AN on dropout, eating-disorder-related, and other psychological outcomes at end-of-treatment. Systematic review and meta-analytic procedures were conducted in accordance with PRISMA Guidelines. RCTs evaluating CRT for AN compared to a control treatment were identified via ProQuest, PsycINFO, PubMed, and SCOPUS. Seven RCTs and one quasi-RCT of CRT for AN were included. RCT quality ratings ranged from fair (n = 3) to good (n = 4). Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted using Hedge\u0027s g. Study heterogeneity was assessed using I2 and publication bias was assessed with Begg\u0027s adjusted-rank correlation and the trim-and-fill method. CRT was not associated with improvement in central coherence compared to control treatments at end-of-treatment (g = 0.25, 95% CI = -0.35, 0.85, k = 3). Set-shifting outcomes were mixed due to heterogeneity of set-shifting measures across studies. CRT may prevent dropout; yet, more studies are needed to draw conclusions. CRT did not confer advantage over control treatments for eating-disorder-related and other psychological outcomes at end-of-treatment. Future RCTs of CRT for AN should use precise measures to assess constructs (particularly for set shifting), increase sample size, and implement longitudinal follow-up.

To control this imminent threat, Jordan has enforced public health infection prevention and control measures, called for social distancing, seized all forms of inbound and outbound movement/ international travel, and enacted the Defence Law that transferred the authority to Minister of Defence to work and formulate orders according to the situation. In an effort to support the government in anticipating the requirements of the health system in the upcoming period, an in-depth reflection and examination of different scenarios of the disease spread were developed. This viewpoint suggested different strategies and measures for case detection and contact tracing, clinical management of cases, public health system functioning, and civil society organizations contribution. It is necessary to accelerate containment of the disease to protect the economy and to maintain the continuity of some activities to mitigate the subsequent social, economic and financial impacts. This requires finding a coping mechanism for a period that may be prolonged until laboratories develop a vaccine. In specific, it is strongly recommended to promote community health awareness towards public health prevention and control measures, increase the efficiency and comprehensiveness of the epidemiological investigation/ active and passive surveillance, and employ technology and digital health solutions to track cases and contacts. It is also recommended to increase and expand resources of intensive care units including respirators, increase the capacity and the number of trained health staff in the area of public health and epidemiology, ensure continued provision of essential public health programs and mobilize the resources of non-governmental sector and donors to provide services for refugees and vulnerable populations.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alqutob, Raeda; Al Nsour, Mohannad; Tarawneh, Mohammad Rasoul; Ajlouni, Musa; Khader, Yousef; Aqel, Ibrahim; Kharabsheh, Saad; Obeidat, Nathir","journal":"JMIR public health and surveillance","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/19332; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32407289/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs1MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["public health prevention","area of public health","public health system functioning","public health infection prevention","community health awareness","digital health solutions","continued provision of essential public health programs","number of trained health staff","control measures","cases of COVID","Jordan","clinical management of cases","different strategies","social distancing","upcoming period","Defence Law","Minister of Defence","disease spread","examination of different scenarios","resources of non-governmental sector","resources of intensive care units","case detection","contact tracing","services","epidemiological investigation","donors","in-depth reflection","epidemiology","passive surveillance","forms of inbound","international travel","civil society organizations contribution","outbound movement","respirators","comprehensiveness","capacity","technology","efficiency","refugees","financial impacts","authority","imminent threat","vulnerable populations","activities","viewpoint","requirements","contacts","continuity","orders","economy","containment","laboratories","coping mechanism","total","effort","situation","vaccine"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE The current study aims to test whether the blood flow within the contused spinal cord can be assessed in a rodent model via the acoustic window of the laminectomy utilizing transcutaneous ultrasound. SETTING Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Washington, Seattle WA. METHODS Long-Evans rats (n = 12) were subjected to a traumatic thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI). Three days and 10 weeks after injury, animals underwent imaging of the contused spinal cord using ultrafast contrast-enhanced ultrasound with a Vantage ultrasound research system in combination with a 15 MHz transducer. Lesion size and signal-to-noise ratios were estimated via transcutaneous, subcutaneous, or epidural ultrasound acquisition through the acoustic window created by the original laminectomy. RESULTS Following laminectomy, transcutaneous and subcutaneous contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging allowed for assessment of perfusion and vascular flow in the contused rodent spinal cord. An average loss of 7.2 dB from transcutaneous to subcutaneous and the loss of 5.1 dB from subcutaneous to epidural imaging in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was observed. The hypoperfused injury center was measured transcutaneously, subcutaneously and epidurally (5.78 \u00B1 0.86, 5.91 \u00B1 0.53, 5.65 \u00B1 1.07 mm2) at 3 days post injury. The same animals were reimaged again at 10 weeks following SCI, and the area of hypoperfusion had decreased significantly compared with the 3-day measurements detected via transcutaneous, subcutaneous, and epidural imaging respectively (0.69 \u00B1 0.05, 1.09 \u00B1 0.11, 0.95 \u00B1 0.11 mm2, p \u003C 0.001).

Theoretically, acute treatment with a flow-diversion device may offer a reasonable treatment option to prevent future bleeding and to remodel the diseased vessel segment. The authors identified two patients who underwent emergent treatment with the placement of a Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) in the setting of an acute rebleeding of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm previously treated with clip reconstruction. The first patient was a 50-year-old woman who underwent clip reconstruction for a broad-based right anterior choroidal artery aneurysm measuring approximately 2\u00D78 mm. Clip reconstruction was achieved with a single fenestrated clip. On day 14, the patient experienced a rebleeding episode.

After the procedure, she experienced another acute rebleeding episode and died. The treatment of reruptured intracranial aneurysms in a salvage fashion with emergent placement of PEDs in two patients resulted in good technical placement of the device covering the neck of the aneurysm, yet both patients experienced additional rebleeding and did not survive.

These new technologies will undoubtedly bring solutions to long-standing problems and health conditions. However, they will likely also have unintended effects or ethical implications accompanying them. It may be presumed that the research behind new technologies has been evaluated from an ethical perspective; however, the evidence that this has been done is scant. OBJECTIVE This study aims to understand whether and in what manner PhD dissertations focused on health technologies describe actual or possible ethical issues resulting from their research. METHODS The purpose of scoping reviews is to map a topic in the literature comprehensively and systematically to identify gaps in the literature or identify key evidence. The search strategy for this protocol will include electronic databases (eg, ProQuest, PubMed, Diva, SwePub, and LIBRIS). Searches will be limited to PhD dissertations published in the United States and Sweden in the last 10 years. The study will be mapped in 5 stages: (1) identifying the research question, (2) identifying relevant studies, (3) study selection, (4) retrieving and charting the data, and (5) collating, summarizing, and reporting the results. RESULTS The findings of this study will indicate if and how researchers, PhD students, and their supervisors are considering ethics in their studies, including both research ethics and the ethical implications of their work. The findings can guide researchers in determining gaps and shortcomings in current doctoral education and offer a foundation to adjusting doctoral research education. CONCLUSIONS In a society where technology and research are advancing at speeds unknown to us before, we need to find new and more efficient ways to consider ethical issues and address them in a timely manner. This study will offer an understanding of how ethics is currently being integrated into US and Swedish PhD dissertations and inform the future direction of ethics education at a doctoral level.

Pigs are often used as surgical models in translational research; however, reports of tissue reactions to both suture materials in pigs are limited. The aim of this study was to assess clinical and histologic responses of skin incisions closed with a subcuticular technique using glycomer 631 and lactomer 9-1 in pigs. RESULTS Skin incisions on 17 pigs were closed with glycomer 631 and lactomer 9-1, and a clinical reactive score (CRS) including erythema, swelling, discharge and dehiscence was calculated on postoperative days 7 and 14. Subcuticular tissue reaction was assessed histologically on postoperative day 14 (the presence of extravascular neutrophils, macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, lymphocytes, fibroblasts, bacterial colonies and the overall severity of the inflammatory response to the suture material), and the cumulative score of the variables was calculated as an aggregate tissue irritation score (ATIS). Tissue samples were examined for suture extrusion and evaluated microbiologically. The clinical reactive score did not differ between the suture materials. Only one ATIS variable, namely the overall severity of the inflammatory response, was lower (p = 0.029) when glycomer 631 was used. Suture extrusion was found in 10/17 of the incisions closed by glycomer 631 and in 7/13 of the incisions closed by lactomer 9-1. Trueperella pyogenes was isolated from the skin and from the area of tissue reaction in six pigs. CONCLUSIONS No difference in CRS between the suture materials was observed, and thus both materials may be used for the subcuticular technique in pigs.

Suture extrusion was observed in more than 50% of incisions regardless of the suture material, possibly due to a large amount of suture material in the wound.

In response, hospital-based transfusion medicine physicians instituted policies to conserve blood and decrease blood product usage. These efforts were aided by the US Surgeon General recommendation to cancel all elective procedures. Nevertheless, the duration, severity, and impact of the pandemic on the national blood supply was uncertain. Hospitals with in-house donor programs had the opportunity not only to control demand, but also increase supply. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS A hospital-based blood donor center was rapidly mobilized to increase the supply of in-house collected blood, in order to counteract a sudden but potentially long-term depletion of the national blood supply during a pandemic. RESULTS Collections increased approximately five-fold above baseline for whole blood units, while apheresis platelet units were maintained at the historical average for the blood donor center. Cancellation of elective procedures showed a modest, but not yet statistically significant decrease in average blood product usage per day, nevertheless the in-house collection rate was sufficient to meet demand. CONCLUSION A hospital-based blood donor center can quickly increase collection volumes and capacity in the face of a national emergency / pandemic. The desire to collect units should be balanced with safety concerns, need for sustainability, and blood product demand. This article is protected by copyright.

As no published data exists regarding robotic-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS), we conducted a survey to investigate its current status. Methods We performed a nationwide survey of all centers active in RATS, using a standardized questionnaire. The annual number of operations, mean duration of surgery, docking time, length of hospital stay(s), conversions, chest tube duration, the RATS program start date, robot system used, operating room capacity, and staplers and instruments used were recorded. Results Of the 22 centers contacted, 14 responded. In total, 786 RATS interventions were recorded. Most were anatomical lung resections, comprising 372 (bi-) lobectomies and 80 segmentectomies. During the study period, eight bronchoplastic procedures were performed robotically. There were 93 wedge lung resections, 148 thymectomies, 26 sympathectomies, and 59 other RATS procedures, and a single-center series of around 1,000 RATS thymectomies (excluded from statistical analysis). The average incision-suture time of the RATS lobectomy was 245 (range, 80-419) minutes, average residence time seven days. The conversion rate was 6.7% across all interventions, with significant inter-intervention differences. All surveyed centers plan to further expand RATS, with OR capacity being a frequent impediment. Five RATS interventions were performed in Germany in 2013, versus 320 in 2018. Conclusions Overall, RATS is becoming more established in everyday clinical practice in Germany. The number of operations, active centers, and trained RATS surgeons has increased steadily since 2013. A German-speaking operation course for entry into RATS already exists. Even extended resections can be carried out safely, and RATS has become standard procedure in some centers.","publish_time":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"M\u00F6ller, Thorben; Egberts, Jan-Hendrik; Eichhorn, Martin; Hofmann, Hans-Stefan; Kr\u00FCger, Ingo; R\u00FCckert, Jens-C; Sandhaus, Tim; Steinert, Matthias","journal":"Journal of thoracic disease","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd.2019.10.48; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31903271/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs2NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RATS"],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["RATS interventions","RATS thymectomies","RATS procedures","RATS program","RATS lobectomy","trained RATS surgeons","centers active","active centers","Germany","thoracic surgery","surveyed centers","mean duration of surgery","significant entry","average residence time","wedge lung resections","anatomical lung resections","extended resections","average incision-suture time","annual number of operations","robot system","surgical practice","nationwide survey","Background Robot","bronchoplastic procedures","chest tube duration","operating room capacity","everyday clinical practice","significant inter-intervention differences","date","conversions","minutes","single-center series","staplers","length of hospital","days","operation course","sympathectomies","study period","instruments","range","statistical analysis","standard procedure","published data","standardized questionnaire","lobectomies","segmentectomies","frequent impediment","current status","Methods","total","conversion rate","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Survivorship care plans should address five key areas that include surveillance and screening for new/reoccurring cancer; management of long-term effects of cancer treatment; health promotion; and care coordination/practice implications. To maximize the benefit of survivorship care for rural BCS, it is necessary to better understand their experiences and preferences. METHODS A systematic review of the extant literature addressing the survivorship needs and interventions for rural BCS was conducted. The following databases were searched for reports published between January, 2007, and December, 2018: PubMed, CINAHL, SCOPUS, PsycINFO (EBSCO), CAB Direct, and Sociological Abstracts. Reports published after 2007 with samples including and comprised of rural BCS in the United States were included. Screening of the search results followed PRISMA guidelines using Covidence systematic review software. RESULTS Findings were extracted from 30 reports disseminating findings of 14 research studies. The five areas of a survivorship care were counted/accounted for during data extraction. The included reports concentrated on health promotion (e.g., weight loss and exercise) and the management of long-term effects of cancer treatment as key outcomes. There is a gap in the literature addressing care coordination, surveillance, and screening. CONCLUSION Additional research including interventions for rural BCS that address more survivorship care areas would benefit this population and improve survivorship quality of life for rural BCS.","publish_time":"2020-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anbari, Allison Brandt; Wanchai, Ausanee; Graves, Rebecca","journal":"Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05308-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31970515/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs2OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Sociological Abstracts","PRISMA"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["rural BCS","survivorship care areas","benefit of survivorship care","Survivorship care plans","care coordination","survivorship quality of life","screening","included reports","PURPOSE Rural breast cancer survivors","reoccurring cancer","key areas","management of long-term effects of cancer treatment","health promotion","surveillance","interventions","United States","RESULTS Findings","Covidence systematic review software","key outcomes","extant literature","search results","research studies","CONCLUSION Additional research","PRISMA guidelines","PsycINFO","population","CAB Direct","EBSCO","weight loss","unique challenges","CINAHL","SCOPUS","exercise","knowledge","practice implications","Sociological Abstracts","PubMed","METHODS","gap","samples","accessibility of resources","experiences","following databases","data extraction","preferences"],"language":"en"},

Efforts geared towards general education about the disease and the rationale for quarantine and public health information provided to the general public can reduce stigmatization.

However, little is known about how alterations to the intestinal immune system and sphingolipids contribute to pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). We used WT mice, ROR\u03B3t-deficient mice, sphingosine kinase-deficient mice and local gut anti-inflammatory, 5-aminosalicyclic acid (5-ASA)-treated mice in a chronic-binge ethanol feeding model. Targeted lipidomics assessed the sphingolipids in gut and liver samples. Gut immune cell populations, the amounts of sphingolipids, and the level of liver injury were examined. Results: Alcohol intake induces a pro-inflammatory shift in immune cell populations in the gut, including an increase in Th17 cells. Using ROR\u03B3t-deficient mice, we found that Th17 cells are required for alcohol-associated gut inflammation and the development of ALD. Treatment with 5-ASA decreases alcohol-induced liver injury and reverses gut inflammation by the suppression of CD4\u002B /ROR\u03B3t\u002B /IL-17A\u002B cells. Increased Th17 cells were due to upregulation of SK1 activity and ROR\u03B3t activation. We found that S1P/S1PR1 signaling are required for the development of Th17 cell-mediated ALD. Importantly, in vivo intervention blocking of S1P/S1PR1 signaling markedly attenuated alcohol-induced liver inflammation, steatosis, and damage. Conclusion: Gut inflammation is a functional alteration of immune cells in ALD. Reducing gut Th17 cells leads to reduced liver damage. S1P signaling was crucial in the pathogenesis of ALD in a Th17 cell dependent manner. Furthermore, our findings suggest that compounds that reduce gut inflammation locally may represent a unique targeted approach in the treatment of ALD.","publish_time":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chu, Shenghui; Sun, Rui; Gu, Xuemei; Chen, Liang; Liu, Min; Guo, HaiXun; Ju, Songwen; Vatsalya, Vatsalya; Feng, Wenke; McClain, Craig J; Deng, Zhongbin","journal":"Hepatology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/hep.31321; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418220/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs3Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gut inflammation","gut Th17 cells","Increased Th17 cells","attenuated alcohol-induced liver inflammation","ROR\u03B3t-deficient mice","intestinal inflammation","local gut anti-inflammatory","liver samples","immune cell populations","development of Th17 cell-mediated","Alcohol intake","treated mice","WT mice","ASA decreases alcohol-induced liver injury","level of liver injury","reduced liver damage","functional alteration of immune cells","Th17 cell dependent manner","Chronic alcohol consumption","sphingosine kinase-deficient mice","pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease","ROR\u03B3t activation","intestinal immune system","pathogenesis of ALD","amounts of sphingolipids","treatment of","S1PR1","Targeted lipidomics","chronic-binge ethanol","unique targeted approach","pro-inflammatory shift","reverses","upregulation of SK1 activity","steatosis","aminosalicyclic acid","suppression of CD4","model","Results","intervention","alterations","IL","compounds","Conclusion","findings"],"language":"en"},

Although an ASFV p72 gene based real-time PCR assay (a.k.a. the Zsak assay) (Zsak et al. J. Clinical Microbiology, 43, 2005, 112) has been widely used for ASFV detection, several more ASFV sequences have become available in the 15 years since the design of the Zsak assay. In this study, we developed a new ASFV p72 gene based real-time PCR after analysis of all currently available sequences of the p72 gene and multiplexed the new assay with a modified Zsak assay aiming to have a broader coverage of ASFV strain/isolates. To reduce false negative detections, porcine house-keeping gene, beta actin (ACTB), was applied as an internal control. Eight ACTB sequences from the GenBank and 61 partial ACTB sequences generated in this study, and 1,012 p72 sequences from the GenBank and 23 p72 sequences generated at FADDL, were used for ACTB and ASFV primer and probe designs, respectively, to ensure broader host and ASFV coverage. Multiplexing ACTB in the reaction did not inhibit ASFV amplification. The multiplex assay was evaluated for strain/isolate coverage, sensitivity and specificity. The in silico analysis showed high ASFV strain/isolate coverage: 98.4% (978/994) of all p72 sequences currently available. The limit of detection (LOD) was 6 plasmid copies or 0.1-1 TCID50 /ml of ASFV isolates per reaction. Only targeted ASFV isolates and the viruses in the positive clinical samples were detected, indicating that the assay is highly specific (100% specificity). The test results of 26 ASFV isolates with different country origins showed that this newly developed multiplex assay performed better than the Zsak assay that has been widely accepted and used worldwide, indicating that it may be used as an alternative assay for ASFV detection.","publish_time":"2020-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yin; Xu, Lizhe; Noll, Lance; Stoy, Colin; Porter, Elizabeth; Fu, Jingping; Feng, Yuan; Peddireddi, Lalitha; Liu, Xuming; Dodd, Kimberly A; Jia, Wei; Bai, Jianfa","journal":"Transboundary and emerging diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13582; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32306531/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs4MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","ASF","OIE Terrestrial Manual","ASFV","ACTB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ASFV sequences","ASFV coverage","ASFV detection","ASFV primer","ASFV amplification","new ASFV p72 gene","p72 sequences","targeted ASFV isolates","high ASFV strain","new assay","broader coverage of ASFV strain","alternative assay","modified Zsak assay","available sequences","developed multiplex assay","partial ACTB sequences","isolate coverage","Multiplexing ACTB","Real-time PCR assays","GenBank","study","reaction","limit of detection","specificity","silico analysis","broader host","Clinical Microbiology","positive clinical samples","porcine house","Section","viruses","identification of ASF virus","rapid techniques","different country origins","beta actin","false negative detections","probe designs","LOD","TCID50","sensitivity","plasmid copies","OIE Terrestrial Manual","test results","years","FADDL","internal control"],"language":"en"},

Patients with severe COVID-19 had a significantly higher serum IL-6 levels compared to non-severe patients (mean difference (MD): 38.6 pg/mL, 95% CI: 24.3 - 52.9 pg/mL, p \u003C0.001, I2 = 98.5%).

Its safety and feasibility, with faster recovery and comparable long-term outcomes, have been widely published. Nonetheless, laparoscopic isolated caudate lobectomy is still rare and technically demanding. We herein present a video on laparoscopic total caudate lobectomy for caudate cholangiocarcinoma. METHODS The patient is a 61-year-old man who presented with epigastric distending discomfort. A contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was performed, showing a 4.6 \u00D7 3.9 cm tumor in the caudate lobe adjacent to the inferior vena cava, middle hepatic vein, right hepatic vein, as well as the bifurcation of the main trunk of the portal pedicle. The carbohydrate antigen was elevated to 54.58 U/ml (normal \u003C 37 U/ml), and his liver function was normal. With the preoperative diagnosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, laparoscopic caudate lobectomy was contemplated. RESULTS The operative time was 300 min. The estimated intraoperative blood loss was 180 ml. The patient was discharged on the seventh postoperative day without any complications. Histopathological examination showed a 4.2 cm cholangiocarcinoma (T2N0M0) with a negative margin. He received a course of adjuvant chemotherapy. No recurrence was noted upon follow-up at 6 months after the operation. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic resection for caudate lobe is a feasible and safe procedure. An experienced hepatobiliary surgeon could perform the procedure in selected cases, even with hepatic vein invasion.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wan, Hai-Feng; Xie, Kun-Lin; Li, Jia-Xin; Ho, Kit-Man; Wu, Hong; Huang, Ji-Wei","journal":"Annals of surgical oncology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-08577-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418077/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs4MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["laparoscopic caudate lobectomy","caudate cholangiocarcinoma","laparoscopic total caudate lobectomy","laparoscopic isolated caudate lobectomy","caudate lobe adjacent","middle hepatic vein","hepatic vein invasion","CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic resection","BACKGROUND Laparoscopic hepatectomy","patient","preoperative diagnosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma","safe procedure","liver function","management of malignant liver lesions","inferior vena cava","faster recovery","popularity","selected cases","year-old man","comparable long-term outcomes","estimated intraoperative blood loss","main trunk","feasibility","past decade","video","epigastric distending discomfort","experienced hepatobiliary surgeon","follow-up","contrast","magnetic resonance imaging","portal pedicle","safety","T2N0M0","bifurcation","tumor","operative time","postoperative day","negative margin","course of adjuvant chemotherapy","months","operation","complications","carbohydrate antigen","Histopathological examination","recurrence","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

So far, there are no studies in the Indian population comparing IADPSG with NICE criteria. OBJECTIVE To compare International Association of Pregnancy and Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus and its influence on maternal and perinatal outcomes. METHOD This prospective observational study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of a tertiary care institute in South India from March 2017 to October 2018. Six-hundred and eighty women with or without risk factors for GDM were recruited in the study and screened for GDM based on IADPSG and NICE criteria. Women with preexisting diabetes mellitus or with fasting plasma glucose \u2265 126 mg/dl were excluded. RESULTS The overall prevalence of GDM in our study was 27.2% by either IADPSG/NICE criteria. In this study, 25.1% women and 11.6% women were diagnosed as GDM using IADPSG and NICE criteria, respectively. The level of agreement between the two diagnostic criteria was found to be poor in our study and was statistically significant (kappa = 0.429, p \u003C 0.001). Women testing IADPSG-positive NICE-negative had a higher risk of GHTN, abortions, PROM, preterm delivery, caesarean section and congenital anomalies, meconium-stained liquor, and low Apgar scores at 1 min when compared to non GDM group. In addition, except for preterm delivery, women diagnosed as GDM by both IADPSG and NICE criteria had adverse outcomes such as preeclampsia, urinary tract infection, and polyhydramnios. Women diagnosed as GDM in IADPSG-negative NICE-positive had no significant adverse maternal or perinatal outcomes. CONCLUSIONS IADPSG criteria appear to be more robust than NICE criteria for diagnosis of GDM. Women with substantial risk of maternal and perinatal outcomes are better identified by IADPSG criteria who would have been missed if NICE criteria was used.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Todi, Sushila; Sagili, Haritha; Kamalanathan, Sadish Kumar","journal":"Archives of gynecology and obstetrics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-020-05564-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388777/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs4NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GDM","National Institute for Health and Care Excellence","NICE","GHTN"],"locations":["South India"],"keyphrases":["NICE criteria","CONCLUSIONS IADPSG criteria","women","diagnostic criteria","IADPSG-positive NICE-negative","IADPSG-negative NICE-positive","diagnosis of GDM","single standard criteria","GDM group","overall prevalence of GDM","perinatal outcomes","Study Groups","adverse outcomes","prospective observational study","substantial risk of maternal","preterm delivery","diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus","risk factors","tertiary care institute","preexisting diabetes mellitus","higher risk of GHTN","Care Excellence","National Institute","different countries","BACKGROUND Different screening procedures","congenital anomalies","meconium-stained liquor","caesarean section","PROM","abortions","preeclampsia","influence","Health","International Association of Pregnancy","urinary tract infection","Gynaecology","Indian population","fasting plasma glucose","low Apgar scores","Department of Obstetrics","South India","polyhydramnios","OBJECTIVE","METHOD","studies","kappa","addition","level of agreement"],"language":"en"},

Those who provide services designed to address MCC for Indigenous communities require synthesized information to develop interventions that meet the needs of their older adult population. This review seeks to answer the research question: What are the health and social care needs, priorities and preferences of Indigenous older adults (living outside of long-term care settings) with MCC and their caregivers? METHODS A scoping review, guided by a refinement of the Arksey \u0026 O\u0027Malley framework, was conducted. Articles were included if the authors reported on health and social care needs and priorities of older Indigenous adults. We also included articles that focused on Indigenous conceptions of wellness, resilience, well-being, and/or balance within the context of aging, and articles where authors drew from Indigenous specific worldviews, ways of knowing, cultural safety, cultural competence, cultural appropriateness, cultural relevance and community needs. RESULTS This scoping review included 9 articles that were examined using an Indigenous determinants of health (IDH) theoretical framework to analyze the needs of older adults and CGs. Five areas of needs were identified: accessible health services; building community capacity; improved social support networks; preservation of cultural values in health care; and wellness-based approaches. CONCLUSION The review highlights key determinants of health that influenced older adults\u0027 needs: education and literacy, ethnicity, and social support/network (proximal); health promotion and health care (intermediate); and a combination of historical and contemporary structures (distal). The findings highlight the importance of local Indigenous knowledge and perspectives to improve accessibility of culturally relevant health and social services.","publish_time":"2020-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Webkamigad, Sharlene; Rowe, Robyn; Peltier, Shanna; Froehlich Chow, Amanda; McGilton, Katherine S; Walker, Jennifer D","journal":"BMC geriatrics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-020-01552-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32306912/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs4ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MCC","Arksey \u0026 O\u0027Malley"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health care","Indigenous determinants of health","social care needs","health promotion","relevant health","needs of older adults","community needs","older adults\u0027 needs","accessible health services","priorities of older Indigenous adults","Indigenous communities","areas of needs","social services","preferences of Indigenous older adults","Articles","Indigenous conceptions of wellness","review highlights key determinants of health","Indigenous specific worldviews","BACKGROUND Indigenous people","cultural appropriateness","cultural competence","cultural safety","cultural relevance","MCC","scoping review","importance of local Indigenous knowledge","long-term care settings","improved social support networks","preservation of cultural values","older adult population","authors","community capacity","theoretical framework","O\u0027Malley framework","wellness-based approaches","literacy","high rates of multiple chronic conditions","perspectives","ethnicity","accessibility","refinement","synthesized information","ways","education","IDH","increase","younger ages","contemporary structures","combination of historical","well-being","interventions","CONCLUSION","resilience","context of aging","balance","populations","Arksey","findings","research question","CGs","caregivers","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE To study the clinical presentation of Covid-19 in Europe. METHODS Patients with positive diagnosis of Covid-19 were recruited from 18 European hospitals. Epidemiological and clinical data were obtained through a standardized questionnaire. Bayesian analysis was used for analyzing the relationship between outcomes. RESULTS 1,420 patients completed the study (962 females, 30.7% of health care workers). The mean age of patients was 39.17\u00B112.09 years. The most common symptoms were headache (70.3%), loss of smell (70.2%), nasal obstruction (67.8%), cough (63.2%), asthenia (63.3%), myalgia (62.5%), rhinorrhea (60.1%), gustatory dysfunction (54.2%) and sore throat (52.9%). Fever was reported by on 45.4%. The mean duration of Covid-19 symptoms of mild-to-moderate cured patients was 11.5\u00B15.7 days. The prevalence of symptoms significantly varied according to age and sex. Young patients more frequently had ear, nose, and throat complaints, whereas elderly individuals often presented fever, fatigue and loss of appetite. Loss of smell, headache, nasal obstruction and fatigue were more prevalent in female patients. The loss of smell was a key symptom of mild-to-moderate Covid19 patients and was not associated with nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea. Loss of smell persisted at least 7 days after the disease in 37.5% of cured patients. CONCLUSION The clinical presentation of mild-to-moderate Covid-19 substantially varies according to the age and the sex characteristics of patients.

Moreover, there is no widely accepted definition of PRIS, even though it is a potentially fatal condition. While many suspected cases of PRIS have been reported in both pediatric and adult populations, the actual propofol plasma concentration (Cp) has never been clarified. In this clinical report, we described the first suspected PRIS case in which the propofol Cp was measured 25 min after 226 min of propofol infusion (7.2 \u00B5g/mL), which was 12 times higher than the predicted value (0.6 \u00B5g/mL). In the presented case, we observed gradually progressive uncontrollable hypercapnia and tachycardia, followed by severe lactic acidosis during surgical anesthesia based on the target-controlled infusion of propofol. Levels of liver enzymes were slightly elevated which suggests little or no liver damage though propofol is mainly metabolized by the liver. Meanwhile, renal impairment, a common secondary feature of PRIS, occurred concomitantly when hypercapnia and metabolic acidosis were manifested. In this case, low or delayed propofol clearance might have been a triggering factor causing severe lactic acidosis.","publish_time":"2020-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ichikawa, Taku; Okuyama, Keiko; Kamata, Kotoe; Masui, Kenichi; Ozaki, Makoto","journal":"Journal of anesthesia","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00540-020-02773-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32222909/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs5NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRIS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["propofol Cp","suspected PRIS case","delayed propofol clearance","target-controlled infusion of propofol","suspected cases of PRIS","risk factors of propofol infusion syndrome","actual propofol plasma concentration","severe lactic acidosis","accepted definition of PRIS","common secondary feature of PRIS","metabolic acidosis","presented case","liver damage","\u00B5g","Levels of liver enzymes","progressive uncontrollable hypercapnia","tachycardia","adult populations","surgical anesthesia","triggering factor","pathophysiology","renal impairment","predicted value","times higher","day","clinical report","fatal condition"],"language":"en"},

Thirty-three studies met the inclusion criteria: 23 focusing on electrification and 10 focusing on electricity reliability. Using a modified socio-ecological model, 4 main levels of influence were identified: (1) individual, (2) household, (3) community, and (4) institutional. Electrification was generally associated with positive health outcomes, such as reduced mortality, lower rates of disease, and improved quality of and access to care, while poor electricity reliability was associated with negative health outcomes, including increased morbidity and mortality, lower quality of care, and reduced utilisation of health services. Although the overall quality of the evidence was weak, given the many potential pathways through which electricity may affect health, efforts should be made not only to increase the number of connected households globally, but to improve the reliability of the electricity supply as well.","publish_time":"2019-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Irwin, Bridget R; Hoxha, Klesta; Gr\u00E9pin, Karen A","journal":"Global public health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2019.1695873; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31770072/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs5NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health effects of access","health implications","electricity supply","poor electricity reliability","negative health outcomes","positive health outcomes","reduced utilisation of health services","lower quality of care","reduced mortality","improved quality","overall quality","LMICs","electrification","studies","conceptual model","potential pathways","lower rates of disease","modified socio-ecological model","increased morbidity","important issue","middle-income countries","MEDLINE","main levels of influence","databases CINAHL","Embase","evidence","inclusion criteria","community","number of connected households","paper","efforts","individual"],"language":"en"},

METHODS Scoping review based on literaature searches in national and international health science databases (Pubmed/Medline, Biblioteca virtual en salud (BVS), Scielo, COCHRANE and CUIDEN) and websites, and additionally by a \u0022snowball\u0022 system. MeSH terms were used: \u0022COVID-19\u0022, \u0022Pregnancy\u0022, \u0022Delivery, Obstetric\u0022 \u0022Pregnant Women\u0022 and \u0022Maternal\u0022. As limits in the search Spanish and English languages were selected. No limits were established in relation to the year of publication or type of article. RESULTS A total of 49 documents and articles were detected, of which 27 were analyzed, 18 were used, and 9 were discarded because they did not contain practical recommendations. The recommendations were grouped into 9 subjects: Prevention of infection in pregnant women, Prevention of infection in health care personnel attending pregnant women, Form of presentation and severity in pregnant women, Maternal-fetal transmission (vertical and perinatal), Maternal-fetal control of the pregnant woman infected with COVID-19, Control of the severely pregnant woman with COVID-19, Treatment of the pregnant woman with COVID-19, Management and route of termination of labor, Neonatal outcomes in women with COVID-19 and Breastfeeding. CONCLUSIONS Lack of strong evidence to support many of the recommendations for pregnant women with COVID-19, as they are based on previous experience with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. Further studies are needed to confirm the appropriateness of many of the recommendations and guidelines for action in the specific case of pregnant women and COVIC-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Torre, H\u00E9ctor Gonz\u00E1lez-de la; Rodr\u00EDguez-Rodr\u00EDguez, Ra\u00FAl; Mart\u00EDnez, Alicia Mart\u00EDn","journal":"Enfermeria clinica","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enfcli.2020.05.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425489/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs5NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pregnant woman","COVID","practical management of pregnant women","specific case of pregnant women","practical recommendations","Maternal-fetal control","Prevention of infection","Maternal-fetal transmission","COVIC","limits","health care personnel","standards of obstetric care","SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV infections","international health science databases","CONCLUSIONS Lack of strong evidence","Medline","Pubmed","Biblioteca virtual en salud","literaature searches","Form of presentation","BVS","labor","severity","Neonatal outcomes","Scielo","face","route of termination","action","order","Treatment","year of publication","COCHRANE","review","search Spanish","guidelines","Delivery","subjects","English languages","previous experience","type of article","CUIDEN","METHODS","relation","Pregnancy","new disease","total","documents","articles","websites","appropriateness","MeSH terms","Breastfeeding","snowball","system","studies"],"language":"en"},

The effects of lymphatic drainage dysfunction on periodontitis have not been well-studied. Here we show that lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor 1 (LYVE1)\u002B /podoplanin (PDPN)\u002B lymphatic vessels (LVs) are increased in the periodontal tissues, with accumulation close to the alveolar bone surface, in two murine periodontitis models: rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-associated periodontitis and ligature-induced periodontitis. Further, PDPN\u002B / alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03B1SMA)- lymphatic capillaries are increased, whereas PDPN\u002B / \u03B1SMA\u002B collecting LVs are decreased significantly in the inflamed periodontal tissues. Both mouse models of periodontitis have delayed lymph flow in periodontal tissues, increased TRAP-positive osteoclasts, and significant alveolar bone loss. Importantly, the local administration of adeno-associated virus for vascular endothelial growth factor C, the major growth factor that promotes lymphangiogenesis, increases the area and number of PDPN\u002B / \u03B1SMA\u002B collecting LVs, promotes local lymphatic drainage, and reduces alveolar bone loss in both models of periodontitis. Lastly, LYVE1\u002B / \u03B1SMA- lymphatic capillaries are increased, whereas LYVE1\u002B / \u03B1SMA\u002B collecting LVs are decreased significantly in gingival tissues of patients with chronic periodontitis compared with those of clinically healthy controls.

More than 60 VOCs were determined from 850 samples collected from four sites in and around the complexes through a 2-year monitoring campaign from 2005 to 2007. The VOCs of particular concern found in the area were benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, trichloroethylene, and formaldehyde, given their toxicity, concentration, and detection frequency. Toluene was the most abundant one. The VOC concentration rankings were consistent with their emission rankings. Most VOCs had higher concentrations at the industrial sites than at residential sites, indicating a significant impact of industrial emissions. The ambient levels of benzene and formaldehyde were additionally affected by vehicular emissions and secondary formation, respectively. Overall, the VOC levels increased in winter and at night, because of the local weather conditions. In contrast, the formaldehyde concentration increased in summer, owing to its secondary formation in the atmosphere. The ambient VOC levels in Sihwa-Banwol were higher than those in other parts of Korea. Additionally, the cumulative cancer risks posed by the toxic VOCs exceeded a tolerable risk level of 1 \u00D7 10-4 in not only the industrial areas but also the residential areas. The sum of the non-cancer risks in both areas significantly exceeded the threshold criterion of 1. The large amounts of aromatic compounds emitted from the industrial complexes are believed to play a crucial role in the elevated levels of surface ozone in the Seoul metropolitan area during the summer season. Therefore, comprehensive measures for controlling the VOC emissions in the Sihwa-Banwol area need to be prioritized to reduce the health risks for residents of not only this area but also the capital Seoul and its surrounding areas.","publish_time":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Min-Ji; Seo, Young-Kyo; Kim, Jong-Ho; Baek, Sung-Ok","journal":"Environmental science and pollution research international","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09217-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418108/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VOC"],"locations":["Korea","Seoul"],"keyphrases":["industrial areas","industrial sites","industrial complexes","largest industrial area","Sihwa-Banwol area","VOC emissions","ambient VOC levels","impact of industrial activities","significant impact of industrial emissions","toxic VOCs","Sihwa-Banwol complexes","formaldehyde concentration","VOC concentration rankings","residential areas","Seoul metropolitan area","ambient levels of benzene","residential sites","surrounding areas","VOCs of particular concern","vehicular emissions","non-cancer risks","cumulative cancer risks","health risks","toluene","secondary formation","elevated levels of surface ozone","capital Seoul","emission rankings","summer season","higher concentrations","parts of Korea","atmospheric volatile organic compounds","large amounts of aromatic compounds","night","xylenes","ethylbenzene","tolerable risk level","trichloroethylene","crucial role","toxicity","local weather conditions","detection frequency","comprehensive measures","residents","winter","year monitoring campaign","threshold criterion","atmosphere","contrast","samples"],"language":"en"},

In vitro methods are also used to investigate the effectiveness of encapsulation by quantifying the contrast enhancement enabled by the contrast agents.","publish_time":"2012-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bai, Meng-Yi; Moran, Christine H; Zhang, Lei; Liu, Changjun; Zhang, Yu; Wang, Lihong V; Xia, Younan","journal":"Advanced functional materials","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.201102582; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31866803/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["contrast agents","variety of contrast enhancement agents","PS hollow bead","hollow beads","hollow interior","thermoacoustic tomography","quick loading","effectiveness of encapsulation","micro-computed tomography","glass-transition temperature","iodinated organic compounds","saline solutions","perfluorooctane","direct flow","surfaces","slow diffusion","containers","holes","magnetic resonance","Polystyrene","wall","methods","sample"],"language":"en"},

Consideration of these risks and potential benefits are necessary when deciding to transfuse. Patient blood management (PBM) guidelines exist to assist in clinical decision-making, but they are underutilised. Exploration of barriers to the implementation and utilisation of the PBM guidelines is required. This study aimed to identify common barriers and implementation strategies used to implement PBM guidelines, with a comparison against current expert opinion. METHODS A restricted review approach was used to identify the barriers to PBM guideline implementation as reported by health professionals and to review which implementation strategies have been used. Searches were undertaken in MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus and the Cochrane library. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used to code barriers. The Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) tool was used to code implementation strategies, and subsequently, develop recommendations based on expert opinion. RESULTS We identified 14 studies suitable for inclusion. There was a cluster of barriers commonly reported: access to knowledge and information (n = 7), knowledge and beliefs about the intervention ( = 7) and tension for change (n = 6). Implementation strategies used varied widely (n = 25). Only one study reported the use of an implementation theory, model or framework. Most studies (n = 11) had at least 50% agreement with the ERIC recommendations. CONCLUSIONS There are common barriers experienced by health professionals when trying to implement PBM guidelines. There is currently no conclusive evidence to suggest which implementation strategies are most effective. Further research using validated implementation approaches and improved reporting is required.","publish_time":"2020-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Delaforce, Alana; Duff, Jed; Munday, Judy; Hardy, Janet","journal":"Implementation science : IS","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13012-020-0965-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31952514/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsxNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PBM"],"locations":["Cochrane"],"keyphrases":["Implementation Research","code implementation strategies","implementation theory","PBM guideline implementation","PBM guidelines","validated implementation approaches","common barriers","code barriers","cluster of barriers","Exploration of barriers","Expert Recommendations","ERIC recommendations","health professionals","knowledge","Change","current expert opinion","study","Patient blood management","Consolidated Framework","studies suitable","BACKGROUND Blood transfusions","restricted review approach","range of adverse patient outcomes","Embase","CFIR","PubMed","Scopus","coagulopathy","access","comparison","tool","improved reporting","risks","potential benefits","MEDLINE","CINAHL","immunomodulation","use","model","utilisation","Consideration","haemolysis","Cochrane library","METHODS","intervention","tension","information","conclusive evidence","risk of morbidity","mortality","Searches","inclusion","beliefs","clinical decision-making","agreement","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Methods- We used data from PROSCIS-B (Prospective Cohort With Incident Stroke Berlin). Cognitive function was assessed by Mini-Mental-State-Examination at baseline, and Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-modified after 1 to 3 years of follow-up. Patients were categorized according to hs-cTnT quartiles. We performed generalized linear regression to calculate risk ratios of cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental-State-Examination\u003C27; Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-modified \u003C32). Association of hs-cTnT with cognitive function over time was estimated using a linear mixed model. Results- We included 555 patients (mean age, 67 years, 62% male, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 2 [interquartile range, 1-5], hs-cTnT above upper reference limit 40%, baseline cognitive impairment 28%). Baseline Mini-Mental-State-Examination score and rate of cognitive impairment were lower in patients in the highest versus lowest hs-cTnT quartile (median Mini-Mental-State-Examination 27 versus 29, and 15.3% versus 43.0%, adjusted risk ratio, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.07-2.90], respectively). If anything, cognition seemed to improve in all groups, yet Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-modified scores were consistently lower in patients within the highest versus lowest hs-cTnT quartile (adjusted \u03B2, -1.33 [95% CI, -2.65 to -0.02]), without difference in the rate of change over time. Conclusions- In patients with mild-to-moderate first-ever ischemic stroke without dementia, higher hs-cTnT was associated with higher prevalence of cognitive impairment at baseline and lower Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-modified during 3-year follow-up.

We determined whether larger cancers can be safely transplanted, the risks of adverse events from RKT, and whether RKT confers a survival advantage for patients waiting for transplantation. Methods In a retrospective cohort study, 23 dialysis patients awaiting transplant underwent RKT at John Hunter Hospital, Australia between 2008 and 2015. Patients were \u003E60 years old and accepted onto the National Organ Matching Service. This RKT Group was divided into donor renal cancers \u226430 mm and \u003E30-\u226450 mm. Adverse event profiles for RKT recipients were compared with 22 standard live donor recipients using logistic regression analyses. Recipient and transplant survivals for RKT were compared with 2050 controls from Australian New Zealand Dialysis Transplant Registry using Cox regression models. To increase statistical power for survival analyses, data from 25 RKT recipients from Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane were added, thus creating 48 RKT recipients. Results There were no significant differences in mortality, transplant failure nor AEs between the 2 cancer Groups. RKT increased the risks of Adverse event profiles (odds ratio: 6.48 [2.92-15.44]; P \u003C 0.001). RKT reduced mortality risk by 30% (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.70 [0.36-1.07]; P = 0.299) compared with those continuing on the transplant list who may or may not be transplanted. RKT significantly reduced mortality risk for those remaining on dialysis (HR: 2.86 [1.43-5.72]; P = 0.003). Transplant survival for RKT was reduced compared with control deceased donor (HR: 0.42 [0.21-0.83]; P = 0.013) and live donor transplants (HR: 0.33 [0.02-0.86]; P =0.023). Conclusions The use of larger carefully selected cancer-resected kidneys for transplantation appears safe and effective. RKT confers a possible survival advantage compared with waiting for transplantation, an increased survival compared with those remaining on dialysis but reduced transplant survival.","publish_time":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sprott, Philip; Hibberd, Adrian D; Heer, Munish K; Trevillian, Paul R; Clark, David A; Johnson, David W; Oldmeadow, Christopher; Chiu, Simon; Attia, John R","journal":"Transplantation direct","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/txd.0000000000000946; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31773051/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsxOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RKT","National Organ Matching Service","RKT Group","Princess Alexandra Hospital"],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["RKT recipients","RKT Group","reduced transplant survival","transplantation of kidneys","transplant failure","survival analyses","transplant survivals","transplant list","increased survival","HR","dialysis patients","possible survival advantage","reduced mortality risk","standard live donor recipients","restored kidney transplantation","Australian New Zealand Dialysis Transplant Registry","live donor transplants","donor renal cancers","risks of Adverse event profiles","cancer excision","selected cancer-resected kidneys","source of kidneys","cancer Groups","control deceased donor","risks of adverse events","waiting","larger cancers","logistic regression analyses","odds ratio","use of larger","hazard ratio","Cox regression models","Princess Alexandra Hospital","John Hunter Hospital","data","controls","retrospective cohort study","significant differences","AEs","Brisbane","statistical power","National Organ Matching Service","evaluation","years old","Methods","Conclusions","Results"],"language":"en"},

We hypothesized that in a specific epidemiologic study based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the association of clinical thyroid disease with serum concentration of PFOA and PFOS was due to reverse causality. Thyroid hormone affects glomerular filtration, which in turn affects excretion of PFOA and PFOS. We evaluated this by linking a model of thyroid disease status over the lifetime to a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model of PFOA and PFOS. Using Monte Carlo methods, we simulated the target study population and analyzed the data using multivariable logistic regression. The target and simulated populations were similar with respect to age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, serum concentrations of PFOA and PFOS, and prevalence of clinical thyroid disease. The analysis showed little or no evidence of bias from the hypothesized mechanism. The largest bias was for the fourth quartile of PFOA in females, with an odds ratio of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90, 0.97). The reported odds ratio of clinical thyroid disease for this group was 1.63 (1.07, 2.47), and if it were corrected for the bias would have been 1.74 (1.14, 2.65).

However, little information is available regarding the safety of OLV in Fontan patients when hemidiaphragmatic paralysis is present. CASE PRESENTATION A 41-year-old woman who underwent repeated Fontan procedures was re-admitted to our hospital because of worsening shortness of breath. As left hemidiaphragmatic paralysis was considered to be contributing to her symptom, an open thoracic left diaphragmatic plication surgery was scheduled. A preoperative pulmonary artery angiogram revealed a remarkably reduced blood flow to the left lung. The surgeon requested OLV during the surgery. Despite our concern regarding the impact of OLV on the Fontan circulation, OLV did not result in major hemodynamic changes. CONCLUSION OLV can be safely implemented in patients with hemidiaphragmatic paralysis with preserved Fontan circulation. Preoperative pulmonary artery angiography may provide useful information for estimating the impact of OLV on the Fontan circulation.","publish_time":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sasaki, Yusuke; Kato, Jungo; Minoshima, Rie; Nagata, Hiromasa; Minamishima, Shizuka; Suzuki, Takeshi; Morisaki, Hiroshi","journal":"JA clinical reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40981-019-0270-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32026005/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsyMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BACKGROUND Surgeries"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Fontan patients","impact of OLV","safety of OLV","CONCLUSION OLV","preserved Fontan circulation","left hemidiaphragmatic paralysis","repeated Fontan procedures","left lung","preoperative pulmonary artery angiogram","Preoperative pulmonary artery angiography","useful information","open thoracic left diaphragmatic plication surgery","lung ventilation","little information","year-old woman","reduced blood flow","hospital","symptom","great challenges","worsening shortness of breath","CASE PRESENTATION","BACKGROUND Surgeries","major hemodynamic changes","surgeon","concern"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, the application of metabolomics in nutrition could provide significant information on the best nutrition regimen, optimal infantile growth and even in the characterization and improvement of commercial products\u0027 composition.These are only some of the fields in which metabolomics was applied, in the perspective of a precision-based, personalized care of human health.In this review, we discuss the available literature on such topic and provide some evidence regarding clinical application of metabolomics in heart diseases, auditory disturbance, nephrouropathies, adult and pediatric cancer, obstetrics, perinatal conditions like asphyxia, neonatal nutrition, neonatal sepsis and even some neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism.Our research group has been interested in metabolomics since several years, performing a wide spectrum of experimental and clinical studies, including the first metabolomics analysis of human breast milk. In the future, it is reasonable to predict that the current knowledge could be applied in daily clinical practice, and that sensible metabolomics biomarkers could be easily detected through cheap and accurate sticks, evaluating biofluids at the patient\u0027s bed, improving diagnosis, management and prognosis of sick patients and allowing a personalized medicine.

Several patterns have been described since the initial report by Recalcati,1 including erythematous maculo-papular,1 urticarial,1,2 chickenpox-like,1,3 purpuric peri-flexural,4 transient livedo reticularis,5 and acro-ischemic or chilblain-like lesions.6,7 Herein we report the observation a new pattern with erythema multiforme-like lesions in 4 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection. All of them were women, and the mean age was 66.75 years (range 58 - 77). The mean time period between the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to the appearance of cutaneous lesions was 19.5 days (range 16 - 24). One patient developed the skin rash during hospitalization. The remaining 3 patients had been previously discharged after clinical, analytical and radiologic improvement, and negativization of COVID-19 PCR test. These 3 patients returned to the Emergency department consulting for skin rashes 6, 7 and 4 days after discharge, respectively. Laboratory tests at the time of skin lesions showed worsening of one or more parameters, compared to those at the time of discharge (CRP, D-dimer and lymphocyte count). However, none of the patients presented recurrence of clinical symptoms of COVID-19. Microbiological studies were performed in 2 patients, excluding other infectious diseases (Table 1). In all patients, skin lesions begun as erythematous papules in upper trunk, that progressively turned to erythemato-violaceous patches with a dusky center, and a pseudo-vesicle in the middle. Typical target lesions were observed in two patients. Lesions were markedly coalescing in the back, and then spread to the face and limbs within 1 week, without involvement of palms and soles (Figure 1). Three patient had their oral cavity examined, showing palatal macules and petechiae. Histological examination was similar in all patients, revealing a normal basket-weave stratum corneum, and mild to moderate spongiosis in epidermis. The dermis showed dilated vessels filled with neutrophils, extravasation of red blood cells, and lymphocytic perivascular and interstitial infiltrate. Basal vacuolar changes with interface dermatitis was observed in 1 patient, and lymphocytic exocytosis in another (Figure 2). All patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids with progressive resolution of the skin lesions within 2-3 weeks. We are facing challenging times in Dermatology. New information and cutaneous manifestations possibly related to COVID-19 are emerging every day. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether these lesions are associated with the virus, the drug intake or any other conditions. Erythema multiforme (EM) is linked to infectious agents in 90% of the cases, while drug-associated EM is reported in less than 10% of cases. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae are the main agents, but other viruses have been reported, such as Adenovirus, Coxsackie, Parvovirus B19.8 We suggest that this EM-like or target-like exanthem might be another pattern of exanthem associated with COVID-19 infection. Recent articles also report targetoid lesions in exanthems of patients with COVID-19 infection.9,10 In addition, the presence of pseudo-vesicles and enanthem are two clues that suggest an infectious cause rather than a drug reaction. However, we cannot positively exclude the involvement of the various drugs administered to the patients. This is a first observation that will require further investigations.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jimenez-Cauhe, J; Ortega-Quijano, D; Carretero-Barrio, I; Suarez-Valle, A; Saceda-Corralo, D; Moreno-Garcia Del Real, C; Fernandez-Nieto, D","journal":"Clinical and experimental dermatology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/ced.14281; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32385858/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs0MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["exanthems of patients","hospitalized patients","time of skin lesions","targetoid lesions","appearance of cutaneous lesions","negativization of COVID","onset of COVID","Typical target lesions","infection","recurrence of clinical symptoms of COVID","skin rashes","drug-associated EM","Cutaneous manifestations","time of discharge","infectious agents","mean time period","new pattern","erythema multiforme","pattern of exanthem","days","infectious cause","drug intake","drug reaction","infectious diseases","range","Figure","observation","cases","initial report","erythematous papules","lymphocytic exocytosis","involvement of palms","mean age","main agents","New information","Microbiological studies","erythematous maculo-papular","presence of pseudo-vesicles","Herpes simplex virus","neutrophils","extravasation of red blood cells","transient livedo reticularis","normal basket-weave stratum corneum","dusky center","D-dimer","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","HSV","interface dermatitis","clues","CRP","radiologic improvement","progressive resolution","Emergency department consulting","purpuric peri-flexural","moderate spongiosis","systemic corticosteroids","palatal macules","chickenpox","Basal vacuolar changes","erythemato-violaceous patches","dilated vessels","enanthem","oral cavity","upper trunk","Recalcati","addition","worsening","lymphocyte count","interstitial infiltrate","Recent articles","Laboratory tests","Adenovirus","Coxsackie","Parvovirus B19","epidermis","limbs","soles","years","PCR test","chilblain","Histological examination","hospitalization","various drugs","challenging times","Dermatology","petechiae","women","viruses","middle","conditions","Table","weeks","patterns","parameters","investigations"],"language":"en"},

We now estimate the relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of increasing the number of centres from 24 to 30. METHODS We constructed a discrete event simulation (DES) to estimate the effectiveness and lifetime cost-effectiveness (from a payer perspective) using 1 year\u0027s incidence of stroke in England. 2000 iterations of the simulation were performed comparing baseline 24 centres to 30. RESULTS Of 80,800 patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke/year, 21,740 would be affected by the service reconfiguration. The median time to treatment for eligible early presenters (\u003C 270 min since onset) would reduce from 195 (IQR 155-249) to 165 (IQR 105-224) minutes. Our model predicts reconfiguration would mean an additional 33 independent patients (modified Rankin scale [mRS] 0-1) and 30 fewer dependent/dead patients (mRS 3-6) per year. The net addition of 6 centres generates 190 QALYs (95%CI - 6 to 399) and results in net savings to the healthcare system of \u00A31,864,000/year (95% CI -1,204,000 to \u00A35,017,000). The estimated budget impact was a saving of \u00A3980,000 in year 1 and \u00A37.07 million in years 2 to 5.

In order to improve the traceability of their trade, we developed 20 polymorphic microsatellite loci for the white-bellied pangolin (Phataginus tricuspis), the species most frequently found on African bushmeat markets. We genotyped 24 white-bellied pangolins from the Douala market, Cameroon, originating from the Ebo forest c. 75 km north-east of Douala. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 4 to 12 (mean = 6.95), and mean observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.592 (0.208-0.875) and 0.671 (0.469-0.836), respectively. Genetic diversity was higher than that cross-estimated from microsatellite loci developed for other species of pangolins. Two loci deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and two loci showed linkage disequilibrium. Genetic variance (PCoA) was increased with the addition of 13 pangolins of unknown origin, possibly suggesting that the Douala market is fed from differentiated source populations of white-bellied pangolins. Each of the 37 individuals had a unique multilocus genotype. The unbiased probability of identity (uPI) and the probability of identity among siblings (PIsibs) were both very low (uPI = 8.443 e-21; PIsibs = 1.011 e-07). Only five microsatellite loci were needed to reach the conservative value of PIsibs \u003C 0.01, overall indicating a powerful discriminating power of our combined loci. These 20 newly developed microsatellite loci might prove useful in tracing the local-to-global trade of the white-bellied pangolin, and will hopefully contribute to the DNA-assisted implementation of future conservation strategies at reasonable costs.","publish_time":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aguillon, Samantha; Din Dipita, Alain; Lecompte, Emilie; Missoup, Alain Didier; Tindo, Maurice; Gaubert, Philippe","journal":"Molecular biology reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-05511-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425300/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs1NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Douala"],"keyphrases":["developed microsatellite loci","white-bellied pangolins","combined loci","polymorphic microsatellite loci","species of pangolins","pangolins of unknown origin","Douala market","north-east of Douala","uPI","mean","differentiated source populations of white","unbiased probability of identity","conservative value of PIsibs","global trade","Genetic diversity","Genetic variance","implementation of future conservation strategies","corollary","Cameroon","Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium","cross","Phataginus tricuspis","reasonable costs","potential intermediate hosts","powerful discriminating power","addition","Ebo forest","linkage disequilibrium","individuals","unique multilocus genotype","DNA","PCoA","COVID","siblings","African bushmeat markets","number of alleles","traded mammals","traceability","pandemic","scaly anteaters","expected heterozygosities","order"],"language":"en"},

We hypothesized that the increase in the ankle-brachial index (ABI) with age is due to increased arterial stiffness and wave reflection and is thus associated with the pathogenesis of the renal small artery in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We recruited 122 patients with CKD (stages 1-5) who underwent renal biopsy and ABI measurements between 2010 and 2013. Renal small artery intimal thickening (SA-IT) severity was assessed by semiquantitative grading. The median age was 47 years, with a range of 15-86 years (47% women). The median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 62 mL/min/1.73 m2. Compared with patients with the lowest 1-3 SA-IT index quartile, those with the highest quartile of the SA-IT index were older in age had higher mean arterial pressure, ABI, brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity, and lower eGFR.

METHODS PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and CNKI were searched up to March 12, 2020. We included studies providing information regarding diagnostic test accuracy of chest CT for COVID-19 detection. The methodological quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. Sensitivity and specificity were pooled. RESULTS Sixteen studies (n = 3186 patients) were included. The risks of bias in all studies were moderate in general. Pooled sensitivity was 92% (95% CI = 86-96%), and two studies reported specificity (25% [95% CI = 22-30%] and 33% [95% CI = 23-44%], respectively). There was substantial heterogeneity according to Cochran\u0027s Q test (p \u003C 0.01) and Higgins I2 heterogeneity index (96% for sensitivity). After dividing the studies into two groups based on the study site, we found that the sensitivity of chest CT was great in Wuhan (the most affected city by the epidemic) and the sensitivity values were very close to each other (97%, 96%, and 99%, respectively). In the regions other than Wuhan, the sensitivity varied from 61 to 98%. CONCLUSION Chest CT offers the great sensitivity for detecting COVID-19, especially in a region with severe epidemic situation. However, the specificity is low. In the context of emergency disease control, chest CT provides a fast, convenient, and effective method to early recognize suspicious cases and might contribute to confine epidemic.

However, elite athletes, industrial workers, and military personnel, driven by the tasks at hand, may choose to continue working and face an increased risk of exertional heat illness (EHI). We wanted to examine the efficacy of a new core temperature (Tcr) estimation algorithm in assessing EHI risk. APPROACH Physiological responses of 21 male Royal Marines recruits (age 21\u00B12 y, height 1.79\u00B10.05 m, weight 80.5\u00B17.2 kg) were collected during a physically-demanding criterion road march (14.5 km in 90 min with a 9.6 kg load; air temperature 16\u00B0C, relative humidity \u2265 84%). Measured Tcr (thermometer pill) and estimated Tcr (ECTempTM Tcr-est) were compared. MAIN RESULTS Measured Tcr either increased to an asymptote Tcr \u003C 39.5\u00B0C (WARM; n=11), or progressively increased to Tcr \u003E 40.0\u00B0C (HOT; n=10). In the HOT group, Tcr-est reflected measured Tcr up to Tcr = 40.0\u00B0C (Bias = -0.10 \u00B1 0.37\u00B0C, root mean square error = 0.37 \u00B1 0.13\u00B0C). In the WARM group, Tcr-est overestimated Tcr (Bias = 0.34 \u00B1 0.40\u00B0C) and was higher from mid-point to end. A logistic regression (Skin temperature approximate entropy and mean heart rate) was able to predict group membership (95% accuracy) at 20 minutes, allowing a WARM group ECTemp(TM) correction factor (corrected Bias=0.00 \u00B1 0.29\u00B0C). SIGNIFICANCE The Tcr-est successfully tracked Tcr in the HOT group with high risk of exertional heat illness (EHI) (40% incidence).

Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are predominantly caused by viruses, resulting in the prescription of antibiotics to a few selected patients. Previous studies in primary health care centers (PHCCs) in Indonesia have shown a high percentage of antibiotic therapy for URTIs. This study tries to analyze the difference in profiles of antibiotic prescription in the treatment of children and adults with URTI in Bangka Tengah, Indonesia. Methods Random prescriptions from patients diagnosed with URTIs (sinusitis, bronchitis, common cold, and pharyngitis) from all PHCCs in Bangka Tengah were collected from January to February 2018. Prescriptions from patients with overlapping diagnoses, such as URTI with diarrhea or typhoid, were excluded. Results During the two months of data collection, 1348 prescriptions for adults and children with URTIs were studied. Children were 1.30 (95% CI, 1.03-1.58) times more likely to be treated with antibiotics compared to adults. Amoxicillin was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic both in children (92.3%) and adults (78.6%). Ciprofloxacin was commonly prescribed in adults (14.6%) but not in children (0.3%). Conclusions This study confirms the major antibiotic overuse in patients with URTI, especially in children. Owing to the fact that children are more likely to get URTI of viral origin, they receive high percentage of antibiotic therapy. These findings support the need for collaborated intervention to decrease unnecessary prescription of antibiotics in Bangka Tengah.","publish_time":"2020-01-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Novan Y I, Pratama; Primadi, Avianto","journal":"Journal of basic and clinical physiology and pharmacology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1515/jbcpp-2019-0248; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31926085/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs2NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AMR","URTI"],"locations":["Indonesia","Bangka Tengah"],"keyphrases":["adults","URTIs","prescribed antibiotic","treatment of children","profiles of antibiotic prescription","high percentage of antibiotic therapy","Bangka Tengah","Background Inappropriate antibiotic therapy","major antibiotic overuse","selected patients","unnecessary prescription of antibiotics","URTI of viral origin","PHCCs","Indonesia","study","Methods Random prescriptions","primary health care centers","collaborated intervention","Previous studies","bronchitis","pharyngitis","sinusitis","development of antimicrobial resistance","overlapping diagnoses","months of data collection","need","Upper respiratory tract infections","difference","AMR","findings","diarrhea","Conclusions","Results","times","typhoid","Amoxicillin","fact","viruses","Ciprofloxacin"],"language":"en"},

The differences in age, sex, and last CT scores determined before discharge between the two groups were analyzed, and correlations of the time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment with the time to disease resolution as well as with the highest CT score also underwent statistical analysis. RESULTS. A total of 25 subjects were enrolled in the study. The fitted tendency curves for group 1 and group 2 were significantly different, with peak points showing that the estimated highest CT score was 10 and 16 for each group, respectively, and the time to disease resolution was 6 and 13 days, respectively. The Mann-Whitney test showed that the last CT scores were lower for group 1 than for group 2 (p = 0.025), although the chi-square test found no difference in age and sex between the groups. The time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment had a positive correlation with the time to disease resolution (r = 0.93; p = 0.000) as well as with the highest CT score (r = 0.83; p = 0.006). CONCLUSION. Timely diagnosis and treatment are key to providing a better prognosis for patients with COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Guoquan; Gong, Tao; Wang, Guangbin; Wang, Jianwen; Guo, Xinfu; Cai, Erpeng; Li, Shirong; Li, Xiaohu; Yu, Yongqiang; Lin, Liangjie","journal":"AJR.

Progress is limited by an incomplete understanding of the -neurobiology of insomnia and hypersomnia. This work summarizes current concepts of the regulation of arousal and sleep and its modulation through noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS), including transcranial magnetic, current, and auditory stimulation. Particularly, we suggest: (1) characterization of patients with sleep problems - across diagnostic entities of mental disorders - based on specific alterations of sleep, including alterations of sleep slow waves, sleep spindles, cross-frequency coupling of brain oscillations, local sleep-wake regulation, and REM sleep and (2) targeting these with specific NIBS techniques.

The transmissibility of coronavirus from asymptomatic patients to healthy individuals has received enormous attention. An important study using the COVID-19 data from the city Ningbo, China, was carried out to estimate and compare the transmission rates of the coronavirus by the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. However, in the original analysis, the usual chi-squared tests were unduly used for some contingency tables with small cell counts including zero, which may violate the assumptions for the chi-squared test. OBJECTIVE We reanalyze the data from the city Ningbo with more appropriate statistical methods to draw more reliable and sound conclusions on the transmission rates of the coronavirus by the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. METHODS We exclude the cases associated with the super-spreader and adopt more appropriate statistical methods, including the permutation test and Fisher\u0027s exact test, to reanalyze the COVID-19 data from the city Ningbo. RESULTS After excluding the cases related to the super-spreader, Fisher\u0027s exact test yields p-value=.84, which indicates stronger evidence of no difference in the transmission rates compared with the original analysis. The odds ratio of transmission rates of coronavirus between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients is 1.2 with a 95% confidence interval [0.5, 2.8]. CONCLUSIONS Through a more in-depth and comprehensive statistical analysis of the Ningbo data, we conclude that there is no difference in the transmission rates of coronavirus between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yin, Guosheng; Jin, Huaqing","journal":"JMIR public health and surveillance","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/19464; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32442131/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs2ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Fisher"],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["asymptomatic patients","transmissibility of coronavirus","Ningbo data","odds ratio of transmission rates of coronavirus","city Ningbo","novel coronavirus disease","COVID","appropriate statistical methods","permutation test","original analysis","comprehensive statistical analysis","super-spreader","difference","cases","Fisher\u0027s exact test yields p-value","usual chi-squared tests","sound conclusions","healthy individuals","contingency tables","small cell counts","outbreak","enormous attention","stronger evidence","world","assumptions","China","important study","unprecedented rate","BACKGROUND","confidence interval","RESULTS","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

Unexpectedly, MAPK pathway aberrations are associated with remarkably long patient survival, even among patients with TP53 mutations (median \u223C14 yr). We explored underlying outcome-favoring mechanisms with omics followed by preclinical models. Strikingly, multiple hotspot and non-hotspot MAPK mutations (A/BRAF, HRAS, MAPK1, and MAP2K1/2) all abrogated ErbB3 activation, a well-established HNSCC progression signal. Inhibitor studies functionally defined ERK activity negatively regulating phospho-ErbB3 in MAPK-mutants. Furthermore, pan-pathway immunoprofiling investigations identified MAPK-mutant tumors as the only \u0022CD8\u002B T-cell-inflamed\u0022 tumors inherently bearing high-immunoreactive, constitutive cytolytic tumor microenvironments. Immunocompetent MAPK-mutant HNSCC models displayed active cell death and massive CD8\u002B T-cell recruitment in situ. Consistent with CD8\u002B T-inflamed phenotypes, MAPK-mutant HNSCC patients, independent of tumor-mutational burden, survived 3.3-4 times longer than WT patients with anti-PD1/PD-L1 immunotherapies. Similar prognosticity was noted in pan-cancers.

However, the exact interplay between HT, shoulder range of motion (ROM), competition level differences, and injury risk is unclear. OBJECTIVE To determine the relationship between HT, ROM, and injury risk in baseball players. Secondarily, to determine HT based on competition level. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases were searched from inception until November 4, 2018. STUDY SELECTION Inclusion criteria consisted of (1) HT measurements and (2) arm injury or shoulder ROM. STUDY DESIGN Systematic review. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level 3. DATA EXTRACTION Two reviewers recorded patient demographics, competition level, HT, shoulder ROM, and injury data. RESULTS A total of 32 studies were included. There was no difference between baseball players with shoulder and elbow injuries and noninjured players (side-to-side HT difference: mean difference [MD], 1.75 [95% CI, -1.83 to 2.18]; dominant arm: MD, 0.17 [95% CI, -1.83 to 2.18]). Meta-regression determined that for every 1\u00B0 increase in shoulder internal rotation (IR), there was a subsequent increase of 0.65\u00B0 in HT (95% CI, 0.28 to 1.02). HT did not explain external rotation (ER ROM: 0.19 [95% CI, -0.24 to 0.61]) or horizontal adduction (HA ROM: 0.18 [95% CI, -0.46 to 0.82]). There were no differences between HT at the high school, college, or professional levels. CONCLUSION No relationship was found between HT and injury risk. However, HT explained 65% of IR ROM but did not explain ER ROM or HA ROM. There were no differences in HT pertaining to competition level. The majority of IR may be nonmodifiable. Treatment to restore and maintain clinical IR may be important, especially in players with naturally greater torsion. HT adaptation may occur prior to high school, which can assist in decisions regarding adolescent baseball participation.","publish_time":"2020-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Helmkamp, Joshua K; Bullock, Garrett S; Rao, Allison; Shanley, Ellen; Thigpen, Charles; Garrigues, Grant E","journal":"Sports health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1941738119900799; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32027223/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs3OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HT","IR ROM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HT pertaining","HT adaptation","HT measurements","shoulder ROM","side-to-side HT difference","IR ROM","HA ROM","competition level differences","LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level","injury risk","injury data","baseball players","arm injury","shoulder internal rotation","noninjured players","clinical IR","majority of IR","shoulder range of motion","mean difference","high school","DATA EXTRACTION","MD","relationship","DATA SOURCES PubMed","adolescent baseball participation","elbow injuries","various injuries","external rotation","dominant arm","greater torsion","subsequent increase","CONTEXT Humeral torsion","STUDY DESIGN Systematic review","STUDY SELECTION Inclusion criteria","patient demographics","Web of Science","Embase","reviewers","CINAHL","college","Cochrane databases","decisions","exact interplay","professional levels","horizontal adduction","inception","benefits","Treatment","OBJECTIVE","CONCLUSION","total","studies","Meta-regression"],"language":"en"},

Objective To characterize the risk and degree of QT prolongation in patients with COVID-19 in association with their use of hydroxychloroquine with or without concomitant azithromycin. Design, Setting, and Participants This was a cohort study performed at an academic tertiary care center in Boston, Massachusetts, of patients hospitalized with at least 1 positive COVID-19 nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction test result and clinical findings consistent with pneumonia who received at least 1 day of hydroxychloroquine from March 1, 2020, through April 7, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures Change in QT interval after receiving hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin; occurrence of other potential adverse drug events. Results Among 90 patients given hydroxychloroquine, 53 received concomitant azithromycin; 44 (48.9%) were female, and the mean (SD) body mass index was 31.5 (6.6). Hypertension (in 48 patients [53.3%]) and diabetes mellitus (in 26 patients [28.9%]) were the most common comorbid conditions. The overall median (interquartile range) baseline QTc was 455 (430-474) milliseconds (hydroxychloroquine, 473 [454-487] milliseconds vs hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, 442 [427-461] milliseconds; P \u003C .001). Those receiving concomitant azithromycin had a greater median (interquartile range) change in QT interval (23 [10-40] milliseconds) compared with those receiving hydroxychloroquine alone (5.5 [-15.5 to 34.25] milliseconds; P = .03). Seven patients (19%) who received hydroxychloroquine monotherapy developed prolonged QTc of 500 milliseconds or more, and 3 patients (3%) had a change in QTc of 60 milliseconds or more. Of those who received concomitant azithromycin, 11 of 53 (21%) had prolonged QTc of 500 milliseconds or more and 7 of 53 (13 %) had a change in QTc of 60 milliseconds or more. The likelihood of prolonged QTc was greater in those who received concomitant loop diuretics (adjusted odds ratio, 3.38 [95% CI, 1.03-11.08]) or had a baseline QTc of 450 milliseconds or more (adjusted odds ratio, 7.11 [95% CI, 1.75-28.87]). Ten patients had hydroxychloroquine discontinued early because of potential adverse drug events, including intractable nausea, hypoglycemia, and 1 case of torsades de pointes. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, patients who received hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of pneumonia associated with COVID-19 were at high risk of QTc prolongation, and concurrent treatment with azithromycin was associated with greater changes in QTc. Clinicians should carefully weigh risks and benefits if considering hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, with close monitoring of QTc and concomitant medication usage.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mercuro, Nicholas J; Yen, Christina F; Shim, David J; Maher, Timothy R; McCoy, Christopher M; Zimetbaum, Peter J; Gold, Howard S","journal":"JAMA cardiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1834; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32356863/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs4NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["QT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","milliseconds vs hydroxychloroquine","concomitant azithromycin","baseline QTc","hydroxychloroquine monotherapy","use of hydroxychloroquine","day of hydroxychloroquine","likelihood of prolonged QTc","Importance Administration of hydroxychloroquine","high risk of QTc prolongation","close monitoring of QTc","QT interval","treatment of pneumonia","associated pneumonia","degree of QT prolongation","concomitant loop diuretics","concomitant medication usage","greater median","positive COVID","Measures Change","increased risk of corrected QT","interquartile range","potential adverse drug events","cohort study","greater changes","concurrent treatment","adjusted odds ratio","treatment of coronavirus disease","overall median","nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction test result","clinical findings consistent","academic tertiary care center","Boston","intractable nausea","occurrence","mean","SD","hypoglycemia","Massachusetts","Main Outcomes","body mass index","Participants","Relevance","benefits","association","case of torsades","cardiac arrhythmias","Conclusions","risks","common comorbid conditions","Design","Setting","pointes","Clinicians","female","Objective","diabetes mellitus","Results","Hypertension"],"language":"en"},

However, little is known about the clinical characteristics of kidney-related complications, including hematuria, proteinuria, and AKI. METHODS In this retrospective, single-center study in China, we analyzed data from electronic medical records of 333 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, including information about clinical, laboratory, radiologic, and other characteristics, as well as information about renal outcomes. RESULTS We found that 251 of the 333 patients (75.4%) had abnormal urine dipstick tests or AKI. Of 198 patients with renal involvement for the median duration of 12 days, 118 (59.6%) experienced remission of pneumonia during this period, and 111 of 162 (68.5%) patients experienced remission of proteinuria. Among 35 patients who developed AKI (with AKI identified by criteria expanded somewhat beyond the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes definition), 16 (45.7%) experienced complete recovery of kidney function. We suspect that most AKI cases were intrinsic AKI. Patients with renal involvement had higher overall mortality compared with those without renal involvement (28 of 251 [11.2%] versus one of 82 [1.2%], respectively). Stepwise multivariate binary logistic regression analyses showed that severity of pneumonia was the risk factor most commonly associated with lower odds of proteinuric or hematuric remission and recovery from AKI. CONCLUSIONS Renal abnormalities occurred in the majority of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Although proteinuria, hematuria, and AKI often resolved in such patients within 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms, renal complications in COVID-19 were associated with higher mortality.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pei, Guangchang; Zhang, Zhiguo; Peng, Jing; Liu, Liu; Zhang, Chunxiu; Yu, Chong; Ma, Zufu; Huang, Yi; Liu, Wei; Yao, Ying; Zeng, Rui; Xu, Gang","journal":"Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1681/asn.2020030276; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32345702/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs4NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["AKI"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hospitalized patients","majority of patients","renal involvement","renal complications","renal outcomes","AKI cases","intrinsic AKI","COVID","autopsy findings of patients","renal damage","experienced remission of pneumonia","severity of pneumonia","CONCLUSIONS Renal abnormalities","remission of proteinuria","clinical characteristics of kidney","kidney injury","Kidney Disease","hematuric remission","information","complete recovery of kidney function","higher mortality","hematuria","higher overall mortality","related complications","Global Outcomes definition","Stepwise multivariate binary logistic regression analyses","electronic medical records","lower odds of proteinuric","China","data","onset of symptoms","single-center study","risk factor","median duration","abnormal urine dipstick tests","retrospective","laboratory","weeks","illness","period","criteria","METHODS","days","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Since CPV-2 first emerged in the late 1970s, its rapid evolution has resulted in three antigenic variants: CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c. Here, we report, for the first time in Korea, two cases of CPV-2c infection in two dogs with severe diarrhea. The complete open reading frame (4,269 nt) of CPV-2, encoding both non-structural (NS) and structural (VP) proteins, was sequenced. Based on the amino acid Gln present at residue 426 of the VP2 gene, these strains were typed as CPV-2c, and were named Korea CPV-2c_1 and Korea CPV-2c_2. These strains shared 99.48% reciprocal nucleotide sequence identity and had the highest nucleotide identity (99.77-99.34%) with Asian CPV strains isolated in China, Italy (found in a dog imported from Thailand), and Vietnam from 2013-2017. Phylogenetic analysis based on the non-structural (NS1) and capsid (VP2) genes revealed that Korean CPV-2c strains clustered closely to Asian CPV strains, and separately from strains isolated in Europe, South America, and North America. Amino acid changes never reported before were observed in NS1 (Thr70Pro, Cys287Tyr), VP1 (Lys17Arg, Phe33Leu), and VP2 (Gln365His, Ala516Val). Additional observed mutations, including Phe267Tyr, Tyr324Ile, and Gln370Arg, have been previously reported in the recent CPV-2c strains with Asian origins. These results suggest that the Korean CPV-2c strains were potentially introduced via neighboring Asian countries.","publish_time":"2020-02-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moon, Bo Youn; Jang, Jiung; Kim, Seong-Hee; Kim, Yeon-Hee; Lee, Hyun-Kyoung; So, ByungJae; Park, Choi-Kyu; Lee, Kyoung-Ki","journal":"Transboundary and emerging diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32009300/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs5MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CPV"],"locations":["China","Thailand","Europe","South America","North America"],"keyphrases":["Asian CPV strains","Korea CPV","Korean CPV","cases of CPV","recent CPV","c strains","c infection","Asian origins","dogs","VP2 gene","neighboring Asian countries","NS1","highest nucleotide identity","Amino acid changes","reciprocal nucleotide sequence identity","South America","North America","amino acid Gln present","Additional observed mutations","acute hemorrhagic enteritis","residue","Phe267Tyr","fatal myocarditis","rapid evolution","etiological agent","complete open reading frame","VP1","Tyr324Ile","Cys287Tyr","Phe33Leu","Lys17Arg","capsid","Europe","Italy","genes","China","severe diarrhea","antigenic variants","Thr70Pro","Gln365His","Canine parvovirus type","Phylogenetic analysis","Thailand","proteins","Gln370Arg","Ala516Val","time","results","Vietnam"],"language":"en"},

HCV is transmitted primarily through parenteral exposures to infectious blood or body fluids that contain blood, most commonly through injection drug use. No vaccine against hepatitis C exists and no effective pre- or postexposure prophylaxis is available. More than half of persons who become infected with HCV will develop chronic infection. Direct-acting antiviral treatment can result in a virologic cure in most persons with 8-12 weeks of all-oral medication regimens. This report augments (i.e., updates and summarizes) previously published recommendations from CDC regarding testing for HCV infection in the United States (Smith BD, Morgan RL, Beckett GA, et al. Recommendations for the identification of chronic hepatitis C virus infection among persons born during 1945-1965. MMWR Recomm Rec 2012;61[No. RR-4]). CDC is augmenting previous guidance with two new recommendations: 1) hepatitis C screening at least once in a lifetime for all adults aged \u226518 years, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is \u003C0.1% and 2) hepatitis C screening for all pregnant women during each pregnancy, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is \u003C0.1%. The recommendation for HCV testing that remains unchanged is regardless of age or setting prevalence, all persons with risk factors should be tested for hepatitis C, with periodic testing while risk factors persist. Any person who requests hepatitis C testing should receive it, regardless of disclosure of risk, because many persons might be reluctant to disclose stigmatizing risks.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schillie, Sarah; Wester, Carolyn; Osborne, Melissa; Wesolowski, Laura; Ryerson, A Blythe","journal":"MMWR.

The purpose of this chapter is to reflect issues related to children during any infectious disease outbreak like COVID-19. Adults are mature enough to control their emotions and can act patiently, but immature minds are always perplexed and act in a very clingy way when some adverse situation is thrown to them. Children are ardent observers and act according to the reactions of the folks around them. It is difficult for them to conceal their behavior, and it is difficult for parents as well to manage their anxiety levels. During crisis period when social distancing and refrained outdoor activities have brought our children into a knotty situation, it is necessary that we understand their fears and myths, try to resolve their concerns in a polite way and strengthen their minds. At this stage the role of parents, teachers, educational institutes, social media, and international children\u2019s organizations need to be redefined. The importance of the decisions taken by the governing bodies should be explained to the children in an effective way, so that they do not panic and reflect a brave attitude. UNICEF in collaboration with international health support systems and departments has a major role to play. Appropriate planning for preparing the children for pandemics has to be incorporated in our system, so that any future crisis can be dealt in an easier way. Schools colleges and other educational institutes should execute immunization and hygiene and health practices in advance to promote prevention.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saxena, Rakhi; Saxena, Shailendra K.","journal":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/187de6dc853aaa6a110fa37949756b82d7f3b153.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7189392.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7189392/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjsyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UNICEF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["preparing children","pandemics","clingy way","polite way","easier way","effective way","educational institutes","role of parents","COVID","social media","international health support systems","social distancing","health practices","major role","crisis period","apt planning","adverse situation","knotty situation","future crisis","Appropriate planning","immature minds","international children\u2019s organizations","teachers","hygiene","departments","collaboration","immunization","lot of effort","outdoor activities","infectious disease outbreak","advance","UNICEF","ardent observers","decisions","prevention","reactions","concerns","Schools colleges","stage","emotional security","issues","manifolds","governing bodies","chapter","fears","myths","behavior","anxiety levels","resources","situations","brave attitude","purpose","importance","folks","food","nations","Adults","emotions"],"language":"en"},

Considering the severity of the current and previous outbreaks, no approved antiviral agent or effective vaccines are present for the prevention and treatment of infection during the epidemics. Although, various molecules have been shown to be effective against coronaviruses both in vitro and in vivo, but the antiviral activities of these molecules are not well established in humans.

Some of the very first applications of NAT using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were in the identification of HIV in blood. The recognition of other blood-borne viruses, in particular hepatitis B and hepatitis C, further prompted the application of molecular tests to clinical medicine. It was the ease of transmission of viruses through blood and blood products that was one of the main stimuli for the development of nucleic acid testing (NAT) in virology. The improvements in technology leading to automation, reduction in contamination, quantitation and increased sensitivity have enhanced this development and are likely to continue and expand, and so further improve patient management \u2013 hopefully with reductions in cost. The introduction of these more sensitive NAT assays has further reduced the likelihood of the acquisition of blood-borne viruses during transfusion or transplantation. The development of commercial viral load assays, or quantitative NAT, has revolutionised for example the clinical management of HIV infection and of other systemic diseases (e.g. cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, HHV-6, BK polyomavirus) that are a particular clinical issue in immunocompromised individuals (Table 6.1). Also, resistance genotyping tests can now be performed by sequencing the relevant drug targets e.g. HIV \u2013 most commonly the reverse transcriptase and protease regions, but now including integrase and envelope gp 41. Infections in immunocompromised patients may occur in the absence of classical symptoms and the use of PCR to diagnose, in a targeted fashion, the most common infections has revolutionised treatment of these infections in the immunocompromised patient. Knowledge of the most likely agents \u2013 for example, CMV in the first 3 months following bone marrow transplant, is often used because such reactivation infection is extremely common (and often fatal) in this population. The availability of polyoma virus PCR means a clinical transplant service is able to monitor their patients for polyoma virus and adjust the level of immunosuppression appropriately. The availability of rapid diagnosis for fungi or Pneumocystis means transplant clinical services can often reduce the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis for these agents. Therefore, as a result of these rapid diagnostic nucleic acid testing services, clinical services can directly improve patient therapy, thereby reducing side effects and improving outcomes as well as saving money.","publish_time":"2010-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dwyer, Dominic; Rawlinson, William","journal":"PCR for Clinical Microbiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7193710/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NAT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical services","management of blood","viruses","clinical medicine","clinical management of HIV infection","blood products","acquisition of blood","clinical transplant service","particular clinical issue","quantitative NAT","use of nucleic acid tests","applications of NAT","use of PCR","patient management","development of nucleic acid testing","sensitive NAT assays","availability of polyoma virus PCR","common infections","immunocompromised patients","rapid diagnostic nucleic acid testing services","example","identification of HIV","immunocompromised individuals","likely agents","patient therapy","particular hepatitis B","Epstein-Barr virus","availability of rapid diagnosis","application of molecular tests","use of antimicrobial prophylaxis","bone marrow transplant","resistance genotyping tests","development of commercial viral load assays","hepatitis C","reactivation infection","revolutionised treatment","fungi","automation","contamination","quantitation","HHV","cytomegalovirus","systemic diseases","polymerase chain reaction","Pneumocystis","increased sensitivity","absence of classical symptoms","integrase","protease regions","months","reverse transcriptase","BK polyomavirus","CMV","Table","main stimuli","result","likelihood","targeted fashion","ease of transmission","technology","effects","relevant drug targets","reductions","introduction","transfusion","virology","detection","level of immunosuppression","outcomes","envelope gp","improvements","cost","transplantation","Knowledge","recognition","money","population"],"language":"en"},

Traditionally, cell or animal-based experiments are required to confirm the acute oral toxicity of chemical compounds. However, these methods are often restricted by availability of experimental facilities, long experimentation time, and high cost. In this paper, we propose a novel convolutional neural network regression model, named BESTox, to predict the acute oral toxicity ([Formula: see text]) of chemical compounds. This model learns the compositional and chemical properties of compounds from their two-dimensional binary matrices. Each matrix encodes the occurrences of certain atom types, number of bonded hydrogens, atom charge, valence, ring, degree, aromaticity, chirality, and hybridization along the SMILES string of a given compound. In a benchmark experiment using a dataset of 7413 observations (train/test 5931/1482), BESTox achieved a squared correlation coefficient ([Formula: see text]) of 0.619, root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 0.603, and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.433. Despite of the use of a shallow model architecture and simple molecular descriptors, our method performs comparably against two recently published models.","publish_time":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Jiarui; Cheong, Hong-Hin; Siu, Shirley Weng In","journal":"Algorithms for Computational Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a3e91be98995a071412763f151d78c3773f7718.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7197065.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197065/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjsxODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute oral toxicity of chemical compounds","chemical properties of compounds","BESTox","Formula","Compound toxicity prediction","text","squared error","shallow model architecture","atom charge","given compound","absolute error","novel convolutional neural network regression model","squared correlation coefficient","occurrences of certain atom types","number of bonded hydrogens","valence","long experimentation time","simple molecular descriptors","drug discovery","chirality","critical task","aromaticity","availability of experimental facilities","degree","SMILES string","dataset","observations","hybridization","high cost","train","use","two-dimensional binary matrices","design field","animal-based experiments","cell","test","matrix","root","benchmark experiment","Despite","paper","MAE","RMSE","published models","methods"],"language":"en"},

Indeed, the UK government has enacted emergency legislation in its response by passing the Coronavirus Act 2020. Amongst other things, this act extends existing statutory powers to impose deprivations of liberty for public health purposes. The extension of such powers naturally raises concerns about whether their use will be compatible with human rights law. In particular, it is unclear whether their use will fall within the public heath exception to the Article 5 right to liberty and security of the person in the European Convention of Human Rights, enshrined in the UK law by virtue of the Human Rights Act 1998. In this paper, I use the Coronavirus Act introduced in the UK as a case study of how emergency legislation enacted in a pandemic may conflict with human rights law enshrined elsewhere in domestic law. Having outlined key features of existing statutory powers in the UK, and how they are extended under the Coronavirus Act, I briefly consider how the European Court of Human Rights has interpreted the public health exception to Article 5 rights. This analysis suggests two grounds on which deprivations of liberty performed in accordance with the emergency legislation introduced in the UK might be vulnerable to claims of Article 5 rights violations. First, the absence of specified time limits on certain deprivations of liberty means that they may fail the requirement of legal certainty championed by the European Court in its interpretation of the public health exception. Second, the Coronavirus Act\u2019s extension of powers to individual\u2019s lacking public health expertise may undermine the extent to which the act will ensure that deprivations of liberty are both necessary and proportionate.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pugh, Jonathan","journal":"J Law Biosci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9858f891834d2253d0814ca8e5c0e767bf57ccc3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197562/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjsyMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","European Court"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Human Rights Act","human rights law","UK law","European Court of Human Rights","public health exception","European Convention of Human Rights","rights violations","emergency legislation","public health purposes","certain deprivations of liberty","Coronavirus Act\u2019s extension of powers","public heath exception","Article","UK government","use","emergency measures","domestic law","individual\u2019s lacking public health expertise","key features of existing statutory powers","response","pandemic","absence of specified time limits","security","person","interpretation","virtue","world","SARS-CoV","case study","extent","accordance","requirement of legal certainty","grounds","things","concerns","Governments","analysis","paper"],"language":"en"},

In the early stage, we encountered a small but meaningful number of patients who were unintentionally scheduled for elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19. We intended to describe their clinical characteristics and outcomes. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 34 patients underwent elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19 at Renmin Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital, Tongji Hospital and Central Hospital in Wuhan, from January 1 to February 5, 2020. FINDINGS: Of the 34 operative patients, the median age was 55 years (IQR, 43\u201363), and 20 (58\u00B78%) patients were women. All patients developed COVID-19 pneumonia shortly after surgery with abnormal findings on chest computed tomographic scans. Common symptoms included fever (31 [91\u00B72%]), fatigue (25 [73\u00B75%]) and dry cough (18 [52\u00B79%]). 15 (44\u00B71%) patients required admission to intensive care unit (ICU) during disease progression, and 7 patients (20\u00B75%) died after admission to ICU. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients were older, were more likely to have underlying comorbidities, underwent more difficult surgeries, as well as more severe laboratory abnormalities (eg, hyperleukocytemia, lymphopenia). The most common complications in non-survivors included ARDS, shock, arrhythmia and acute cardiac injury. INTERPRETATION: In this retrospective cohort study of 34 operative patients with confirmed COVID-19, 15 (44\u00B71%) patients needed ICU care, and the mortality rate was 20\u00B75%.

At the same place a standardised trapping scheme is in operation. This study reveals for the first time a positive correlation between the migratory intensity of birds aloft and the numbers of trapped birds. By relating the migratory patterns of single species with the nocturnal migratory intensities, we show that the species composition aloft can at least partly be deduced from the number of grounded birds. The numbers of trapped pre\u2010Saharan migrants were related more strongly to the migratory intensity of the preceding night than were the numbers of trans\u2010Saharan migrants. Assuming that the number of trapped birds varies according to the weather to the same \u00ADextent as the migratory intensity of birds aloft, we conclude that in shorter range migrants the decision to engage in a migratory flight is influenced more strongly by weather conditions, and that the migratory activity of trans\u2010Saharan migrants is possibly more intensely controlled by their endogenous migratory urge.","publish_time":"2001-12-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zehnder, Susanna; Karlsson, Lennart","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cecbda106cbafe5dc1bb870d2c9f5514f077abe1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7202361/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjszMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["migratory intensity of birds","migratory flight","nocturnal migratory intensities","numbers of trapped birds","migratory activity of trans\u2010Saharan migrants","endogenous migratory urge","number of trapped birds","migratory patterns of single species","numbers of trans\u2010Saharan migrants","numbers of trapped pre\u2010Saharan migrants","number of grounded birds","shorter range migrants","species composition","weather conditions","nocturnal bird migration","decision","positive correlation","preceding night","standardised trapping scheme","Falsterbo","time","extent","months","place","operation","autumn","passive infrared device","period","study"],"language":"en"},

However, existing works rarely address the error (bias) that occurs due to the use of finite samples during the estimation of MI. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing methods address the bias issue for the high-order interaction term which is essential for better approximation of joint MI. In this paper, we first calculate the amount of bias of this term. Moreover, to select features using [Formula: see text] based search, we also show that this term follows [Formula: see text] distribution. Based on these two theoretical results, we propose Discretization and feature Selection based on bias corrected Mutual information (DSbM). DSbM is extended by adding simultaneous forward selection and backward elimination (DSbM[Formula: see text]). We demonstrate the superiority of DSbM over four state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and the number of selected features on twenty benchmark datasets. Experimental results also demonstrate that DSbM outperforms the existing methods in terms of accuracy, Pareto Optimality and Friedman test. We also observe that compared to DSbM, in some dataset DSbM[Formula: see text] selects fewer features and increases accuracy.

We propose a novel training method for this problem that extensively exploit the support set during the training process of a few-shot learning model. In particular, in addition to matching the query example with those in the support set for training, we seek to further match the examples within the support set themselves. This method provides more training signals for the models and can be applied to every metric-learning-based few-shot learning methods.

Centralized and federated machine learning solutions represent the predominant way of providing smart services for users.

Therefore, in certain situations machine learning models need to be trained in a collaborative and decentralized manner, similar to the way the data is originally generated without requiring any central authority for data or model aggregation. This paper presents a decentralized and adaptive k-means algorithm that clusters data from multiple sources organized in peer-to-peer networks. Our algorithm allows peers to reach an approximation of the global model without sharing any raw data. Most importantly, we address the challenge of decentralized clustering with skewed non-IID data and asynchronous computations by integrating HyperLogLog counters with k-means algorithm. Furthermore, our clustering algorithm allows nodes to individually determine the number of clusters that fits their local data.

In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Inference Network (HIN) to make full use of the abundant information from entity level, sentence level and document level. Translation constraint and bilinear transformation are applied to target entity pair in multiple subspaces to get entity-level inference information. Next, we model the inference between entity-level information and sentence representation to achieve sentence-level inference information. Finally, a hierarchical aggregation approach is adopted to obtain the document-level inference information. In this way, our model can effectively aggregate inference information from these three different granularities.

Due to inherent sparsity in high-dimensional data, distances between objects tend to become meaningless since the distances between any two objects measured in the full dimensional space tend to become the same for all pairs of objects. In this work, we present a novel oriented subspace clustering algorithm that is able to deal with such issues and detects arbitrarily oriented subspace clusters in high-dimensional data streams. Data streams generally implicate the challenge that the data cannot be stored entirely and hence there is a general demand for suitable data handling strategies for clustering algorithms such that the data can be processed within a single scan. We therefore propose the CashStream algorithm that unites state-of-the-art stream processing techniques and additionally relies on the Hough transform to detect arbitrarily oriented subspace clusters. Our experiments compare CashStream to its static counterpart and show that the amount of consumed memory is significantly decreased while there is no loss in terms of runtime.

However, graph data is highly sensitive to structural changes. Perturbing graph data for achieving differential privacy inevitably leads to inject a large amount of noise and the utility of anonymized graphs is severely limited. In this paper, we propose a microaggregation-based framework for graph anonymization which meets the following requirements: (1) The topological structures of an original graph can be preserved at different levels of granularity; (2) [Formula: see text]-differential privacy is guaranteed for an original graph through adding controlled perturbation to its edges (i.e., edge privacy); (3) The utility of graph data is enhanced by reducing the magnitude of noise needed to achieve [Formula: see text]-differential privacy. Within the proposed framework, we further develop a simple yet effective microaggregation algorithm under a distance constraint. We have empirically verified the noise reduction and privacy guarantee of our proposed algorithm on three real-world graph datasets. The experiments show that our proposed framework can significantly reduce noise added to achieve [Formula: see text]-differential privacy over graph data, and thus enhance the utility of anonymized graphs.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Iftikhar, Masooma; Wang, Qing; Lin, Yu","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13107b844d839be6db775811e17118efa630efc8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206283.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206283/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["original graph","utility of graph data","graph anonymization","differential privacy","publishing graph data","Perturbing graph data","real-world graph datasets","advances of graph analytics","privacy guarantee","edge privacy","proposed framework","text","Formula","proposed algorithm","noise reduction","magnitude of noise","utility of anonymized graphs","microaggregation-based framework","effective microaggregation algorithm","distance constraint","edges","controlled perturbation","important task","following requirements","structural changes","topological structures","different levels of granularity","experiments","paper"],"language":"en"},

To avoid recomputing the embedding over time, we explore streaming network embedding for two reasons: 1) to efficiently identify the nodes required to update the embeddings under multi-type network changes, and 2) to carefully revise the embeddings to maintain transduction over different parts of the network. Specifically, we propose a new representation learning framework, named Graph Memory Refreshing (GMR), to preserve both global types of structural information efficiently. We prove that GMR maintains the consistency of embeddings (crucial for network analysis) for isomorphic structures better than existing approaches.

As one of the typical techniques for cross-model searching, hashing methods project features with high dimension into short-length hash codes, thus effectively improving storage and retrieval efficiency. Recently, many efforts have been made to widely study supervised methods with promising performance. However, there still remain some problems. Conventionally, hash codes and projection functions are learnt by preserving the pairwise similarities between data items, which neglects the discriminative property of class associated with each data item. Most of the existing methods that utilise class labels also undertake the binary codes learning under a classification frame. The relations between binary codes and labels have not been well considered. To tackle these problems, we propose a shallow supervised hash learning method \u2013 Semantics-reconstructing Cross-modal Hashing (SCH), which reconstructs semantic representation and learns the hash codes for the entire dataset jointly. For the semantic reconstruction, the learned semantic representation is projected back into label space, extracting more semantic information. By leveraging reconstructed semantic representations, the hash codes are learnt by considering the underlying correlations between labels, hash codes and original features, resulting in a further performance improvement. Moreover, SCH learns the hash codes and functions without relaxing the binary constraints simultaneously, therefore, it further reduces the quantization errors. In addition, the linear computational complexity of its training makes it practicable to big data. Extensive experiments show that the proposed SCH can perform better than the state-of-the-art baselines.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Peng-Fei; Huang, Zi; Zhang, Zheng","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b4e579918bc265f99a0e011bafdf6810dc88c51.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206300.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206300/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SCH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["binary codes","short-length hash codes","Cross-modal data","semantic reconstruction","data items","semantic information","big data","learned semantic representation","shallow supervised hash learning method","class labels","supervised methods","various data sources","reconstructed semantic representations","cross-model","hashing methods project features","existing methods","proposed SCH","binary constraints","problems","Semantics-reconstructing Cross-modal Hashing","original features","extensive attention","fast searching","Extensive experiments","projection functions","promising performance","retrieval efficiency","performance improvement","discriminative property of class","high dimension","training","texts","linear computational complexity","label space","underlying correlations","storage","addition","images","typical techniques","classification frame","entire dataset","videos","similarities","state-of-the-art baselines","quantization errors","efforts"],"language":"en"},

However, the evidence for an association between PFAS and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (including gestational hypertension and preeclampsia) is equivocal and warrants further investigation. OBJECTIVES To examine the relationship between background levels of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) and the development of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia in a Canadian pregnancy cohort. We also explored the potential for effect modification according to fetal sex. METHODS Maternal plasma samples were collected in the first trimester from participants in the MIREC study and were analyzed for PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxS. Blood pressure was measured during each trimester. Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia were defined using the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada guidelines. Logistic regression models were used to derive adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between PFAS concentrations (per doubling of concentration as well as according to tertiles) and gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. Linear mixed models were used to examine the association between PFAS concentrations and changes in blood pressure throughout pregnancy. RESULTS Data from 1739 participants were analyzed. 90% of women were normotensive throughout pregnancy, 7% developed gestational hypertension without preeclampsia, and 3% developed preeclampsia. In the full analyses, neither PFOA nor PFOS were associated with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. However, each doubling of PFHxS plasma concentration was associated with higher odds of developing preeclampsia (OR = 1.32; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.70). In addition, participants in the highest PFHxS tertile (1.4-40.0 \u03BCg/L) had higher odds of developing preeclampsia relative to those in the lowest tertile (OR = 3.06; 95% CI: 1.27, 7.39). In stratified analyses, this effect was only apparent among women carrying a female fetus (OR = 4.90; 95% CI: 1.02, 22.3). However, among women carrying a male fetus, both PFOS and PFHxS were associated with gestational hypertension, but not preeclampsia. Higher plasma concentrations of all three PFAS were associated with increases in diastolic blood pressure throughout pregnancy, and PFOA and PFHxS were also associated with systolic blood pressure. Discrepant findings were similarly revealed in analyses stratified by fetal sex. CONCLUSIONS Higher levels of PFHxS were associated with the development of preeclampsia, but not gestational hypertension. Neither PFOA nor PFOS were associated with either outcome. However, we show, for the first time, that fetal sex may modify these associations, a finding which warrants replication and further study.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Borghese, Michael M; Walker, Mark; Helewa, Michael E; Fraser, William D; Arbuckle, Tye E","journal":"Environment international","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105789; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408216/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs5OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PFAS","PFOS","Linear"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of preeclampsia","development of gestational hypertension","PFOA","PFOS","higher odds of developing preeclampsia relative","PFAS concentrations","CONCLUSIONS Higher levels of PFHxS","doubling of PFHxS plasma concentration","Higher plasma concentrations","highest PFHxS tertile","diastolic blood pressure","systolic blood pressure","participants","fetal sex","women","stratified analyses","hypertensive disorders of pregnancy","Canadian pregnancy cohort","associations","doubling of concentration","trimester","adjusted odds ratios","background levels of perfluorooctanoic acid","perfluorooctane sulfonate","perfluorohexane sulfonate","effect modification","METHODS Maternal plasma samples","female fetus","MIREC study","lowest tertile","BACKGROUND Perfluoroalkyl substances","Logistic regression models","Linear mixed models","hepatic","changes","relationship","increases","Society of Obstetricians","\u03BCg","Gynaecologists of Canada guidelines","cardiovascular health outcomes","tertiles","number of developmental","replication","potential","confidence intervals","addition","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS Data","Discrepant findings","time","evidence","normotensive","investigation"],"language":"en"},

As programs make the transition from a standard approach to a resource constrained approach to transplantation, we utilize a framework for ethical decisions in settings of absolutely scarce resources to help guide programs in deciding which patients to transplant, which donors to accept, how to minimize risk, and how to ensure the best utilization of transplant team members.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wall, Anji E; Pruett, Timothy; Stock, Peter; Testa, Giuliano","journal":"American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.15914; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32282992/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["transplant programs","ethical decisions","times of constrained resources","patients","transition","best utilization of transplant team members","resource constrained approach","organ allocation","ethical values","standard approach","scarce resources","nuanced allocation scheme","times of absolute scarcity","utility consideration","settings","traditional justice","pandemic shifts","COVID","transplantation","framework","novel Coronavirus disease","United States","center","world","practical limitations","donors","extremes","risk","paper"],"language":"en"},

The efficacy of sizing and insertion was investigated, as well as complications. The literature was also reviewed to compare this material with other porcine-derived grafts in use for the management of lower eyelid retraction. METHODS This was a retrospective case series observing all patients who received lower eyelid Permacol implants by the two senior authors (AAM, TGH) for the management of lower eyelid retraction. Patient demographics, indications for surgery, graft size, degree of postoperative lid advancement, and complications were reviewed. RESULTS A total of 12 patients (16 eyelids) received Permacol implants for correction of lower eyelid retraction during the study period of 18 months (January 2015 to July 2017). Ten procedures were related to thyroid eye disease, 3 for reconstruction, 2 postcosmetic lower lid blepharoplasty, and one acquired anophthalmic socket. The average preoperative inferior scleral show (ISS) was 1.74 mm, and the average postoperative ISS was 0.82 mm. There was a mean lower eyelid elevation of 0.91 mm (p \u003C 0.005, Wilcoxon signed rank test) and mean ratio of graft height:preoperative ISS was 3.8:1 over a median of 8 months follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Permacol is a safe and effective alternative to autologous tissues for use as a spacer in patients with lower eyelid retraction of varying etiologies. It does undergo some resorption with time, however this can be predicted and incorporated into surgical planning; we recommend an implant height:ISS ratio of 4:1.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"McGrath, Lindsay A; Hardy, Thomas G; McNab, Alan A","journal":"Graefe\u0027s archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv fur klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00417-020-04660-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32253504/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ISS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["management of lower eyelid retraction","lower eyelid Permacol implants","correction of lower eyelid retraction","mean lower eyelid elevation","lower eyelid retraction of varying etiologies","patients","postcosmetic lower lid blepharoplasty","efficacy of Permacol","ISS ratio","preoperative ISS","average postoperative ISS","CONCLUSIONS Permacol","use","spacer","mean ratio of graft height","complications","porcine-derived grafts","graft size","degree of postoperative lid advancement","implant height","efficacy of sizing","months follow-up","decellularized porcine dermal-derived membrane","reconstruction","effective alternative","surgery","autologous tissues","senior authors","indications","rank test","TGH","eyelids","study period","retrospective case series","thyroid eye disease","Wilcoxon","AAM","Patient demographics","procedures","METHODS","material","surgical planning","anophthalmic socket","median","insertion","total","PURPOSE","resorption","time","literature"],"language":"en"},

However, the association of obesity with the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear. We examined this association using data from the only referral hospital in Shenzhen, China. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 383 consecutively hospitalized patients with COVID-19 admitted from 11 January 2020 to 16 February 2020 and followed until 26 March 2020 at the Third People\u0027s Hospital of Shenzhen were included. Underweight was defined as a BMI \u003C18.5 kg/m2, normal weight as 18.5-23.9 kg/m2, overweight as 24.0-27.9 kg/m2, and obesity as \u226528 kg/m2. RESULTS Of the 383 patients, 53.1% were normal weight, 4.2% were underweight, 32.0% were overweight, and 10.7% were obese at admission. Obese patients tended to have symptoms of cough (P = 0.03) and fever (P = 0.06) compared with patients who were not obese. Compared with normal weight patients, those who were overweight had 1.84-fold odds of developing severe COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 1.84, 95% CI 0.99-3.43, P = 0.05), while those who were obese were at 3.40-fold odds of developing severe disease (OR 3.40, 95% CI 1.40-2.86, P = 0.007), after adjusting for age, sex, epidemiological characteristics, days from disease onset to hospitalization, presence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease and cancer, and drug used for treatment. Additionally, after similar adjustment, men who were obese versus those who were normal weight were at increased odds of developing severe COVID-19 (OR 5.66, 95% CI 1.80-17.75, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS In this study, obese patients had increased odds of progressing to severe COVID-19. As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may continue to spread worldwide, clinicians should pay close attention to obese patients, who should be carefully managed with prompt and aggressive treatment.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cai, Qingxian; Chen, Fengjuan; Wang, Tao; Luo, Fang; Liu, Xiaohui; Wu, Qikai; He, Qing; Wang, Zhaoqin; Liu, Yingxia; Liu, Lei; Chen, Jun; Xu, Lin","journal":"Diabetes care","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20-0576; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32409502/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Obese patients","severe disease","normal weight patients","severe COVID","hospitalized patients","OBJECTIVE Patients","m2","cardiovascular disease","disease onset","liver disease","fold odds","severity of coronavirus disease","increased odds of progressing","odds ratio","association of obesity","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","increased risk of exacerbations","People\u0027s Hospital of Shenzhen","referral hospital","aggressive treatment","viral respiratory infections","diabetes","epidemiological characteristics","days","hospitalization","presence of hypertension","cancer","total","study","METHODS","sex","drug","close attention","symptoms of cough","RESEARCH DESIGN","age","data","China","similar adjustment","clinicians","CONCLUSIONS","prompt","fever","BMI","admission","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Between April 16 and April 19, 47 doctors and 146 patients filled in the questionnaires. The survey is ongoing. We present the first data. RESULTS A majority of German patients (76%) and physicians (71%) report moderate or high restriction in their daily life. A minority (patients 25%, physicians 13%) was not worried that necessary treatments or diagnostics were restricted. Organizing cancer care needs more time and efforts for 56% of all reporting doctors. 98% of all oncologists think that restriction of family visits has a negative impact on the mental health of cancer patients. Half of all participants (patients 43%, physicians 47%) expect negative consequences on the physical status of our patients.

This study aimed to determine the impact of methamphetamine use on adherence to ART among MSM living with HIV. From December 2018 to October 2019, MSM living with HIV were recruited (N = 351) and non-adherence to ART was defined as a Medication Adherence Report Scale score of \u003C23. Overall, 16.0% of the participants reported methamphetamine use in the prior three months and 13.4% of the participants had non-adherence to ART. The proportion of non-adherence to ART among HIV-positive MSM were 28.6% and 10.5% with and without methamphetamine use, respectively. After controlling for demographics, illicit drug use, and co-morbidities, methamphetamine use during the prior three months was associated with a higher risk of non-adherence to ART (adjusted odds ratio = 3.08; 95% confidence intervals: 1.24-7.69). Compared with HIV-positive MSM with non-adherence to ART, HIV-positive MSM with good adherence to ART had a higher CD4 counts and were more likely to achieve an undetectable viral load.

The voltage- and pH-dependent gating of the current is similar to that of hHv1 expressed in cell lines and that the current is blocked by 5-chloro-2-guanidinobenzimidazole (ClGBI) and activated by arachidonic acid (AA). Inhibition of hHv1 by ClGBI significantly decreases mineral matrix production of cMSCs induced by conditions mimicking physiological or pathological (inorganic phosphate, Pi) induction of osteogenesis. Wound healing assay and single cell motility analysis show that ClGBI significantly inhibits the migration of cMSCs.

Included studies were human empirical cross-sectional surveys, case-control studies, cohort studies and randomised controlled trials that assessed the association between methamphetamine and one of the mental health outcomes. Random effects meta-analysis was used to pool results for any use of amphetamines and amphetamine use disorders. Findings 149 studies were eligible and 59 were included in meta-analyses. There was significant heterogeneity in effects. Evidence came mostly from cross-sectional studies. Any use of amphetamines was associated with higher odds of psychosis (odds ratio [OR] = 2.0, 95%CI 1.3-3.3), violence (OR = 2.2, 95%CI 1.2-4.1; adjusted OR [AOR] = 1.4, 95%CI 0.8-2.4), suicidality OR = 4.4, 95%CI 2.4-8.2; AOR = 1.7, 95%CI 1.0-2.9) and depression (OR = 1.6, 95%CI 1.1-2.2; AOR = 1.3, 95%CI 1.2-1.4).

METHODS Eyes from 14 patients who underwent 27-gauge needle-guided intrascleral IOL fixation with built-in 8-0 absorbable sutures were studied. The 8-0 absorbable sutures were inserted into 27-gauge round needles and used to create sclerotomies at the 4 o\u0027clock and 10 o\u0027clock positions under the scleral flap. The sutures were used to tie knots at the end of each haptic and guide haptic externalization through the sclerotomy. After externalization, a sufficient flange was created at the end of each haptic and fixed under the scleral flaps. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), corneal endothelial cell density (ECD), IOL tilt and decentration, previous surgery history, and complications were determined. RESULTS Fourteen cases were analyzed. The majority of eyes exhibited an improvement in the BCVA after surgery. When comparing the last follow-up to preoperative visual acuity, the mean change in BCVA was \u002B 26.32 letters (p = 0.011).

The primary tumor is typically large with skin infiltration which affects quality of life. Surgical resection will result in an extensive defect which potentially deteriorates patients\u0027 quality of life if not properly managed. Keystone perforator island flap (KPIF) is a local advancement flap based on multiple perforators which can be a reliable reconstructive method to close an extensive defect. Methods This is a case series of 11 patients with symptomatic late-stage breast cancers indicated for neoadjuvant chemotherapy and subsequent mastectomy at Dharmais Cancer Hospital. The postmastectomy defect was closed with KPIF and clinical evaluation included flap success rate, percentage of flap necrotic area, and quality of life. There are modifications of the KPIF consisting of the more rounded shape and additional flap movement of the flap\u0027s distal lateral ends to the center resembling an \u0022omega\u0022 conformation. Results Mean percentage of flap necrosis area was 9.7% and none of the patients needed additional surgery. The patients\u0027 quality of life evaluated using Patient-reported Aesthetic European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life, Questionnaire-Core 30-questions (QLQ-C30) and Quality of Life, Questionnaire-Breast Cancer-23-questions (QLQ-BR23) was fair, with sufficiently good scores for global health status and functional scale, and minimal symptomatology burden. The lowest score was for fatigue and financial difficulties parameters from QLQ-C30 and sexual functioning and future perspective from QLQ-BR23. Conclusion This is a preliminary study to show that a KPIF could be considered as a method for defect-resurfacing reconstruction after mastectomy.","publish_time":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rini, Irena Sakura; Krisna, Made Ananda; Kamayana, Jenisa; Djarot, Kasih Rahardjo; Gunardi, Alberta Jesslyn","journal":"Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

The aim of our study is to evaluate left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) functions with speckle tracking echocardiography in preeclamptic patients. Fifty-five preeclamptic (mean age: 30.7 \u00B1 5.9 years) and 35 healthy pregnant women (mean age: 28.8 \u00B1 5.7 years) of the same race, similar age and gestational week were consecutively included. The diagnosis of preeclampsia was based on the criteria proposed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. LV and RV functions were assessed by both conventional and speckle tracking echocardiography after the 30th gestational week and at the postpartum 6th months. The preeclamptic patients had significantly larger left atrium, thicker interventricular septum, higher systolic pulmonary artery pressure and mitral E/e\u0027 ratio compared to controls during pregnancy while LV ejection fraction was similar. Preeclamptic patients had significantly lower LV and RV global longitudinal strain (GLS) during pregnancy compared to controls (- 18.0 \u00B1 2.6% vs. - 19.8 \u00B1 2.1% p = 0.001 and - 26.7 \u00B1 3.3% vs. 28.9 \u00B1 3.3% p = 0.002, respectively).

The COVID-19 pandemic is one such threat that requires not only a cohesive effort, but also enormous trust, to follow public health guidelines, maintain social distance, and share basic necessities. However, are democratic societies with civil liberties capable of doing this? Mobile technology has immense potential for addressing pandemics like COVID-19 as it gives us access to big data in terms volume, velocity, veracity, and variety. These data are particularly relevant to understand and mitigate the spread of pandemics such as COVID-19.

However, recanalization fails in about 16.5% of interventions. We report our experience with unsuccessful MT and analyze technical reasons plus patient-related parameters for failure. METHODS Five hundred ninety-six patients with acute ischemic stroke in the anterior circulation and intention to perform MT with an aspiration catheter and/or stent retriever were analyzed. Failure was defined as 0, 1, or 2a on the mTICI scale. Patients with failing MT were analyzed for interventional progress and compared to patients with successful intervention, whereby parameters included demographics, medical history, stroke presentation, and treatment. RESULTS One hundred of the 596 (16.8%) interventions failed. In 20 cases, thrombus could not be accessed or passed with the device. Peripheral arterial occlusive disease is common in those patients. In 80 patients, true stent retriever failure occurred. In this group, coagulation disorders are associated with poor results, whereas atrial fibrillation is associated with success. The administration of intravenous thrombolysis and intake of nitric oxide donors are associated with recanalization success. Intervention duration was significantly longer in the failing group. CONCLUSION In 20% of failing MT, thrombus cannot be reached/passed. Direct carotid puncture or surgical arterial access could be considered in these cases. In 80% of failing interventions, thrombus can be passed with the device, but the occluded vessel cannot be recanalized. Rescue techniques can be an option. Development of new devices and techniques is necessary to improve recanalization rates. Assessment of pre-existing illness could sensitize for occurring complications.","publish_time":"2020-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heider, Dominik M; Simgen, Andreas; Wagenpfeil, Gudrun; Dietrich, Philipp; Yilmaz, Umut; M\u00FChl-Benninghaus, Ruben; Roumia, Safwan; Fa\u00DFbender, Klaus; Reith, Wolfgang; Kettner, Michael","journal":"Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-020-04244-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31974796/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","failing MT","failing interventions","unsuccessful MT","failing group","thrombus","recanalization success","acute ischemic stroke","stroke presentation","true stent retriever failure","recanalization rates","cases","effective treatment","poor results","Rescue techniques","successful intervention","Intervention duration","patient-related parameters","surgical arterial access","Peripheral arterial occlusive disease","demographics","technical reasons","intake of nitric oxide donors","anterior circulation","medical history","Direct carotid puncture","intention","administration of intravenous thrombolysis","aspiration catheter","interventional progress","coagulation disorders","atrial fibrillation","Development of new devices","PURPOSE Mechanical thrombectomy","experience","Assessment of pre-existing illness","complications","occluded vessel","option","METHODS","CONCLUSION","mTICI scale"],"language":"en"},

The COVID-19 outbreak is unique in its rapid transmission and results in heavy stress for the front-line health care workers (HCWs). The current study aimed to exam posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) of HCWs fighting for the COVID-19 and to evaluate their sleep quality after one-month stressful suffering. 377 HCWs working in different provinces of China participated in the survey between February 1st and 5th. The demographic information was collected firstly. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were selected to measure PTSS and sleep quality. Results showed that one month after the outbreak, the prevalence of PTSS was 3.8% in HCWs. Female HCWs were more vulnerable to PTSS with hazard ratio of 2.136 (95% CI= 1.388-3.286). HCWs with higher exposure level also significantly rated more hyper-arousal symptoms (hazard ratio= 4.026, 95% CI= 1.233-13.140). There was a significant difference of sleep quality between participants with and without PTSS (Z value= 6.014, p\u003C0.001) and among different groups with various contact frequency (Chi-square=7.307, p=0.026). Path analysis showed that there was a significant indirect effect from exposure level to PTSS through sleep quality (coefficient =1.750, 95% CI of Boostroop test = 0.543-2.998). In summary, targeted interventions on sleep contribute to the mental recovery during the outbreak of COVID-19.

The objective of this study was to describe the PKPD relationship of chloroquine and its major metabolite, desethylchloroquine, in a P. vivax volunteer infection study. We analyzed data from 24 healthy subjects who were inoculated with blood-stage P. vivax malaria and administered a standard treatment course of chloroquine. The PK of chloroquine and desethylchloroquine was described by a two-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination. The relationship between plasma and whole blood concentrations of chloroquine and P. vivax parasitemia was characterized by a PKPD delayed response model, where the equilibration half-lives were 32.7 h (95% CI: 27.4-40.5) for plasma data and 24.1 h (95% CI: 19.0-32.7) for whole blood data. The estimated parasite multiplication rate was 17 folds per 48 hours (95% CI: 14-20) and maximum parasite killing rate by chloroquine was 0.213 h-1 (95% CI: 0.196-0.230), translating to a parasite clearance half-life of 4.5 h (95% CI: 4.1-5.0) and a parasite reduction ratio of 400 every 48 hours (95% CI: 320-500). This is the first study that characterized the PKPD relationship between chloroquine plasma and whole blood concentrations and P. vivax clearance using a semi-mechanistic population PKPD modelling.

We aimed to evaluate the effects of ARBs/ACEIs on COVID-19 in a retrospective, single-center study. 126 COVID-19 patients with preexisting hypertension at Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (HPHTCM) in Wuhan from January 5 to February 22, 2020 were retrospectively allocated to ARBs/ACEIs group (n=43) and non-ARBs/ACEIs group (n=83) according to their antihypertensive medication. 125 age- and sex-matched COVID-19 patients without hypertension were randomly selected as non-hypertension controls. In addition, the medication history of 1942 hypertension patients that were admitted to HPHTCM from November 1 to December 31, 2019 before COVID-19 outbreak were also reviewed for external comparison. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected, analyzed and compared between these groups. The frequency of ARBs/ACEIs usage in hypertension patients with or without COVID-19 were comparable. Among COVID-19 patients with hypertension, those received either ARBs/ACEIs or non-ARBs/ACEIs had comparable blood pressure. However, ARBs/ACEIs group had significantly lower concentrations of CRP (p=0.049) and procalcitonin (PCT, p=0.008). Furthermore, a lower proportion of critical patients (9.3% vs 22.9%; p=0.061), and a lower death rate (4.7% vs 13.3%; p=0.216) were observed in ARBs/ACEIs group than non-ARBs/ACEIs group, although these differences failed to reach statistical significance. Our findings thus support the use of ARBs/ACEIs in COVID-19 patients with preexisting hypertension.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Guang; Tan, Zihu; Zhou, Ling; Yang, Min; Peng, Lang; Liu, Jinjin; Cai, Jingling; Yang, Ru; Han, Junyan; Huang, Yafei; He, Shaobin","journal":"Hypertension","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1161/hypertensionaha.120.15143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32348166/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsyMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"],"locations":["Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["ACEIs group","non-ARBs","hypertension patients","ACEIs usage","use of ARBs","frequency of ARBs","effects of ARBs","preexisting hypertension","hypertension controls","lower proportion of critical patients","sex-matched COVID","angiotensin","HPHTCM","vs","lower concentrations of CRP","lower death rate","cellular receptor","receptor blockers","medication history","antihypertensive medication","comparable blood pressure","Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine","enzyme inhibitors","virus infection","elevated expression of ACE2","SARS-CoV","treatment","controversial role","demographic","retrospective","differences","laboratory data","single-center study","pathogenic inflammation","capability","Wuhan","outbreak","procalcitonin","external comparison","statistical significance","addition","PCT","findings","groups"],"language":"en"},

A substantial minority of patients hospitalized develop an Acute COVID-19 Cardiovascular Syndrome (ACovCS) that can manifest with a variety of clinical presentations, but often presents as an acute cardiac injury with cardiomyopathy, ventricular arrhythmias and hemodynamic instability in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. The etiology of this injury is uncertain, but is suspected to be related to myocarditis, microvascular injury, systemic cytokine-mediated injury or stress-related cardiomyopathy. Although histologically unproven, SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to directly replicate within cardiomyocytes and pericytes leading to viral myocarditis. Systemically elevated cytokines are also known to be cardiotoxic and have the potential to result in profound myocardial injury. Prior experience with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) has helped expedite the evaluation of several promising therapies including anti-viral agents, interleukin-6 inhibitors, and convalescent serum. Management of ACovCS should involve a multidisciplinary team including intensive care specialists, infectious disease specialists and cardiologists. Priorities for managing ACovCS include balancing the goals of minimizing healthcare staff exposure for testing that will not change clinical management with early recognition of the syndrome at a time point where intervention may be most effective. The aim of this paper is to review the best available data on ACovCS epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment. From these data, we propose a surveillance, diagnostic and management strategy that balances potential patient risks and healthcare staff exposure with improvement in meaningful clinical outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hendren, Nicholas S; Drazner, Mark H; Bozkurt, Biykem; Cooper, Leslie T","journal":"Circulation","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.120.047349; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32297796/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsyMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Management of ACovCS","acute cardiac injury","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","microvascular injury","Acute COVID","Coronavirus Disease","clinical management","SARS-CoV","Cardiovascular Syndrome","ACovCS epidemiology","profound myocardial injury","systemic cytokine-mediated injury","infectious disease specialists","management strategy","viral myocarditis","potential patient risks","meaningful clinical outcomes","stress-related cardiomyopathy","variety of clinical presentations","goals of minimizing healthcare staff exposure","absence of obstructive coronary artery disease","intensive care specialists","anti-viral agents","best available data","ventricular arrhythmias","improvement","hemodynamic instability","interleukin","pathogenesis","multidisciplinary team","testing","promising therapies","Prior experience","inhibitors","global pandemic","early recognition","intervention","time point","diagnosis","surveillance","cardiomyocytes","cardiologists","paper","evaluation","treatment","substantial minority of patients","pericytes","convalescent serum","significant morbidity","mortality","cardiotoxic","etiology","elevated cytokines","aim","Priorities"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, we isolated a PEDV using Vero cells and serially propagated 100 passages. PEDV SDSX16 was characterized in vitro and in vivo. The viral titers increased to 107.6 TCID50/mL (100th) by serial passages. The spike (S) gene and the whole gene of the SDSX16 virus was fully sequenced to assess the genetic stability and relatedness to previously identified PEDV. Along with successive passage in vitro, there were 18 nucleotides (nt) deletion occurred in the spike (S) gene resulting in a deletion of six amino acids when the SDSX16 strain was passaged to the 64th generation, and this deletion was stable until the P100. However, the ORF1a/b, M, N, E, and ORF3 genes had only a few point mutations in amino acids and no deletions. According to growth kinetics experiments, the SDSX16 deletion strain significantly enhanced its replication in Vero cells since it was passaged to the 64th generation. The animal studies showed that PEDV SDSX16-P10 caused more severe diarrhea and vomiting, fecal shedding, and acute atrophic enteritis than SDSX16-P75, indicating that SDSX16-P10 is enteropathogenic in the natural host, and the pathogenicity of SDSX16 decreased with successive passage in vitro. However, SDSX16-P10 was found to cause lower levels of cytokine expression than SDSX16-P75 using real-time PCR and flow cytometry, such as IL1\u03B2, IL6, IFN-\u03B2, TNF-\u03B1, indicating that SDSX16-P10 might inhibit the expression of cytokines.

Overall these data reveal that on the whole, psoriasis biologics do not show major increases in infection risk compared to placebo during the course of these trials.

A random sample of 45,000 participants between 45 and 74 years of age from the general population of Hamburg, Germany, are taking part in an extensive baseline assessment at one dedicated study center. Participants undergo 13 validated and 5 novel examinations primarily targeting major organ system function and structures including extensive imaging examinations. The protocol includes validate self-reports via questionnaires regarding lifestyle and environmental conditions, dietary habits, physical condition and activity, sexual dysfunction, professional life, psychosocial context and burden, quality of life, digital media use, occupational, medical and family history as well as healthcare utilization. The assessment is completed by genomic and proteomic characterization. Beyond the identification of classical risk factors for major chronic diseases and survivorship, the core intention is to gather valid prevalence and incidence, and to develop complex models predicting health outcomes based on a multitude of examination data, imaging, biomarker, psychosocial and behavioral assessments. Participants at risk for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, stroke and dementia are invited for a visit to conduct an additional MRI examination of either heart or brain. Endpoint assessment of the overall sample will be completed through repeated follow-up examinations and surveys as well as related individual routine data from involved health and pension insurances. The study is targeting the complex relationship between biologic and psychosocial risk and resilience factors, chronic disease, health care use, survivorship and health as well as favorable and bad prognosis within a unique, large-scale long-term assessment with the perspective of further examinations after 6 years in a representative European metropolitan population.","publish_time":"2019-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jagodzinski, Annika; Johansen, Christoffer; Koch-Gromus, Uwe; Aarabi, Ghazal; Adam, Gerhard; Anders, Sven; Augustin, Matthias; der Kellen, Ramona B; Beikler, Thomas; Behrendt, Christian-Alexander; Betz, Christian S; Bokemeyer, Carsten; Borof, Katrin; Briken, Peer; Busch, Chia-Jung; B\u00FCchel, Christian; Brassen, Stefanie; Debus, Eike S; Eggers, Larissa; Fiehler, Jens; Gallinat, J\u00FCrgen; Gelli\u00DFen, Simone; Gerloff, Christian; Girdauskas, Evaldas; Gosau, Martin; Graefen, Markus; H\u00E4rter, Martin; Harth, Volker; Heidemann, Christoph; Heydecke, Guido; Huber, Tobias B; Hussein, Yassin; Kampf, Marvin O; von dem Knesebeck, Olaf; Konnopka, Alexander; K\u00F6nig, Hans-Helmut; Kromer, Robert; Kubisch, Christian; K\u00FChn, Simone; Loges, Sonja; L\u00F6we, Bernd; Lund, Gunnar; Meyer, Christian; Nagel, Lina; Nienhaus, Albert; Pantel, Klaus; Petersen, Elina; P\u00FCschel, Klaus; Reichenspurner, Hermann; Sauter, Guido; Scherer, Martin; Scherschel, Katharina; Schiffner, Ulrich; Schnabel, Renate B; Schulz, Holger; Smeets, Ralf; Sokalskis, Vladislavs; Spitzer, Martin S; Tersch\u00FCren, Claudia; Thederan, Imke; Thoma, Tom; Thomalla, G\u00F6tz; Waschki, Benjamin; Wegscheider, Karl; Wenzel, Jan-Per; Wiese, Susanne; Zyriax, Birgit-Christiane; Zeller, Tanja; Blankenberg, Stefan","journal":"European journal of epidemiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10654-019-00577-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31705407/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsyODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["psychosocial risk","involved health","health outcomes","Hamburg City Health Study","participants","major chronic diseases","health care use","extensive imaging examinations","important risk","novel examinations","population-based cohort study","Endpoint assessment","large-scale long-term assessment","extensive baseline assessment","identification of classical risk factors","prognostic factors","resilience factors","psychosocial context","survivorship","general population of Hamburg","dedicated study center","repeated follow-up examinations","multitude of examination data","professional life","quality of life","major organ system function","heart failure","representative European metropolitan population","years of age","complex relationship","complex models","overall sample","random sample","coronary artery disease","unique research platform","digital media use","additional MRI examination","related individual routine data","activity","physical condition","sexual dysfunction","atrial fibrillation","lifestyle","environmental conditions","dietary habits","burden","structures","questionnaires","surveys","substantial knowledge","biomarker","HCHS","family history","core intention","stroke","network","bad prognosis","perspective","self-reports","pension insurances","valid prevalence","incidence","visit","dementia","behavioral assessments","healthcare utilization","protocol"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, on the basis of epidemiology and virology information, we reviewed relevant meta-analysis and clinical studies of anti-coronavirus therapeutics by TCM, in the aspect of mortality, symptom improvement, duration and dosage of corticosteroid, incidence of complications and the like. In addition, we also summarized preclinical rationale for anti-coronavirus activity by TCM in terms of virion assembly and release, as well as viral entry and replication, which could be a useful contribution for figuring out effective Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for coronavirus, including ingredients from single monomeric compounds, Chinese herbs, Chinese herb extracts and Chinese herb formulas, or potential targets for medicine.

Cardiac iron dysregulation has been recently implicated in cardiomyopathy. Here we investigated the protective effects of caloric restriction on cardiac remodeling in impaired leptin signaling obese mice. RNA-seq analysis was performed to assess the differential gene expressions in the heart of wild-type and ob/ob mice. In particular, to investigate the roles of caloric restriction on iron homeostasis-related gene expressions, 10-week-old ob/ob and db/db mice were assigned to ad libitum or calorie-restricted diets for 12 weeks. Male ob/ob mice exhibited LVH, cardiac inflammation, and oxidative stress. Using RNA-seq analysis, we identified that an iron uptake-associated gene, transferrin receptor, was upregulated in obese ob/ob mice with LVH. Caloric restriction attenuated myocyte hypertrophy, cardiac inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress in ob/ob and db/db mice. Furthermore, we found that caloric restriction reversed iron homeostasis-related lipocalin 2, divalent metal transporter 1, transferrin receptor, ferritin, ferroportin, and hepcidin expressions in the heart of ob/ob and db/db mice. These findings demonstrate that the cardioprotective effects of caloric restriction result from the cellular regulation of iron homeostasis, thereby decreasing oxidative stress, inflammation, and cardiac remodeling.

Spinal cord injury/dysfunction (SCI/D) is rarely described as a result of ecstasy ingestion. CASE PRESENTATION We present a case of a 19-year-old male patient who was admitted to our rehabilitation center, after developing a T11 AIS B SCI/D following recreational use of ecstasy. DISCUSSION In our case magnetic resonance imaging was inconclusive due to artifacts caused by metallic rods used for surgical scoliosis treatment in the past. This individual received no surgical or pharmacological treatments; however, it is questionable whether any specific treatments would have been beneficial. Ecstasy ingestion leads to a serotonin surge and induces microvascular changes. Neurovascular hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, de novo aneurysm formation, and subsequent rupture can occur. 5-hydroxytryptamine, which comes from serotonergic terminals, is a very potent vasoconstrictive amine and can thus lead to prolonged vasoconstriction and ischemia. It is most likely that the SCI/D in our case is the result of an ischemic event following the vasoconstrictive effects of ecstasy ingestion. It is important to stress the possible consequences of recreational ecstasy usage and in unexplained SCI/D, one should consider the possibility of drug-related causes.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kastaneer, Myrna Elena; Maijers, Maria Christina; Martina, Juan David","journal":"Spinal cord series and cases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41394-020-0277-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32345982/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjszOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SCI/D","AIS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["result of ecstasy ingestion","INTRODUCTION Ecstasy","D following recreational use of ecstasy","vasoconstrictive effects of ecstasy ingestion","unexplained SCI","CASE PRESENTATION","possible consequences of recreational ecstasy usage","popular drug","possibility of drug","used party drug","T11 AIS B SCI","case magnetic resonance imaging","subarachnoid hemorrhage","Neurovascular hemorrhage","specific treatments","pharmacological treatments","surgical scoliosis treatment","potent vasoconstrictive amine","novo aneurysm formation","multi-organ failure","cardiac diseases","neurological complications","metallic rods","artifacts","serotonin surge","dysfunction","ischemic event","Spinal cord injury","subsequent rupture","DISCUSSION","serotonergic terminals","Serious health hazards","microvascular changes","rehabilitation center","death","past","year-old male patient","marijuana","youngsters","related causes","individual","prolonged vasoconstriction","ischemia","hydroxytryptamine"],"language":"en"},

Three patients have undergone retroperitoneal single-site robot-assisted partial nephrectomy due to incidental finding of renal mass. Operation duration, estimated blood loss, warm ischemia time, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) change, and complication were evaluated. Renal cell carcinoma of the two clear cell type and one chromophobe was diagnosed based on the pathological examination. Initial two cases were successfully completed with minimal bleeding and warm ischemic time within 25 minutes. The last 3rd case has been converted to multiport operation due to limited retroperitoneal space and difficulty in managing upper pole renal mass.

Currently, there is no specific drug or vaccine besides symptomatic supportive therapy. Taking full advantage of the clinical experience of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) in preventing and controlling major epidemics such as SARS, it is an important mission for TCM to propose effective formula with immediate response and solid evidence by using modern biomedical knowledge and techniques(molecular docking assisted TCM formulation for short). In view of the high homology between the gene sequences of the novel coronavirus and SARS virus, and the similarities between the two in terms of pathogenic mechanism and clinical manifestations, our team established a rapid screening and optimization model for the prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus based on clinical experience and molecular docking technology. Firstly, the clinical team and the research team pre-developed and screened TCM formula by using \u0022back-to-back\u0022 manner. Then, the formula was optimized and determined by comparing and analyzing the results of the two groups. The results showed that the research team screened out 46 active ingredients from candidate TCMs that could act on the novel coronavirus S-protein-binding site of human ACE2 protein, which were mainly attributed to 7 herbs such as Lonicerae Japonicae Flos and Mori Folium. The result was largely consistent with the formula raised by the clinical group, verifying and supporting its rationality. This provides evidence for the scientific and potential efficacy of the TCM prescription from the perspective of treatment target analysis, and also suggests that the TCM prescription has the potential to directly inhibit viral infection in addition to improving clinical symptoms or syndromes. Based on this, our team optimized and formed a new anti-coronavirus TCM prescription \u0022Keguan Yihao\u0022, immediately providing the TCM prescription with certain clinical experience and objective evidence support for the prevention and treatment of new emergent infectious diseases in our hospital. The TCM prescription was combined with modern medicine symptomatic supportive treatment for clinical treatment, preliminary results showed better effect than symptomatic supportive therapy alone. This research has innovated the method mode in clinical practice and basic research integration of traditional Chinese medicine for the prevention and control of new emerging infectious diseases. It is of great significance to further improve the rapid response mechanism of TCM in face of major epidemics, and further improve the capability level of TCM to prevent and treat new emerging infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Niu, Ming; Wang, Rui-Lin; Wang, Zhong-Xia; Zhang, Ping; Bai, Zhao-Fang; Jing, Jing; Guo, Yu-Ming; Zhao, Xu; Zhan, Xiao-Yan; Zhang, Zi-Teng; Song, Xue-Ai; Qin, En-Qiang; Wang, Jia-Bo; Xiao, Xiao-He","journal":"Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200206.501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32281327/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs1MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TCM"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["clinical treatment","clinical team","TCM formulation","screened TCM formula","new anti-coronavirus TCM prescription","clinical practice","clinical manifestations","clinical symptoms","clinical group","certain clinical experience","capability level of TCM","rapid response mechanism of TCM","clinical experience of traditional Chinese medicine","modern medicine symptomatic supportive treatment","treatment of new emergent infectious diseases","prevention","coronavirus disease","research team pre-developed","novel coronavirus S-protein","symptomatic supportive therapy","control of new emerging infectious diseases","effective formula","basic research integration of traditional Chinese medicine","solid evidence","perspective of treatment target analysis","objective evidence","preliminary results","molecular docking technology","face of major epidemics","immediate response","rapid screening","potential efficacy","SARS virus","modern biomedical knowledge","terms of pathogenic mechanism","binding site of human ACE2 protein","better effect","techniques","Keguan Yihao","gene sequences","method mode","optimization model","Lonicerae Japonicae Flos","addition","active ingredients","vaccine","specific drug","viral infection","important mission","Mori Folium","high homology","hospital","candidate TCMs","countries","herbs","similarities","syndromes","advantage","great significance","regions","middle","view","manner","COVID","China","rationality","groups"],"language":"en"},

In primary autoimmune neutropenia, anti-neutrophil antibodies (ANeuA) bind to membrane antigens of neutrophils, which give rise to peripheral destruction of neutrophils. However, it is not always easy to detect these antibodies. This study aims to investigate the etiology of neutropenia, and at the same time to evaluate the immune mechanisms by ANeuA testing using granulocyte indirect immunofluorescence test. In our study, 310 neutropenic patients who were between 3 months and 18 years of age were evaluated. ANeuA screening tests were performed in 108 neutropenic patients (group 1), and these patients were divided into 2 subgroups as persistent neutropenia (group 1P, n=12) and recovered neutropenia (group 1R, n=96). Besides, a control group in the same age range was formed, consisting of 39 non-neutropenic children (group 2). ANeuA serum levels were also checked in these groups, and no statistically significant difference could be found between groups 1 and 2, or between groups 1P and 1R, regarding ANeuA levels. As a conclusion, our study was the first comprehensive research in Turkey investigating the large-scale etiology of neutropenia.

Methods: During February 5(th) to 10(th) , 2020, a national anonymous survey was conducted using an online questionnaire among PLHIV at least 18 years of age and had started antiretroviral treatment (ART) to collect the information on COVID-19 prevention, HIV-related health services and the needs on psychosocial support. Current status and needs of people living with HIV were analyzed in Hubei and other regions. Results: A total of 1 014 valid questionnaires were collected, with PLHIV respondents cross the country. The survey revealed that 93.79% of the respondents could obtain information regarding the prevention of COVID-19 from their communities or villages. Respondents were concerned with HIV-specific protective measures and personal protective equipment shortage. 32.64% of all respondents were not carrying sufficient antiretroviral medicines (ARVs) to meet the needs under traffic and travel restrictions, and some could face stock-outs in the coming month.

Little is known about the risk factors for the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in children. METHODS A retrospective case-control study was taken in children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus-2 infection in Wuhan Children\u0027s Hospital. Risk factors associated with the development of COVID-19 and progression were collected and analyzed. RESULTS Eight out of 260 children diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the study. Thirty-five children with COVID-19 infection matched for age, sex and date of admission, and who classified as non-severe type, were randomly selected from the hospital admissions. For cases with severe pneumonia caused by COVID-19, the most common symptoms were dyspnea (87.5%), fever (62.5%) and cough (62.5%). In laboratory, white blood cells count was significantly higher in severe children than non-severe children. Levels of inflammation bio-makers such as hsCRP, IL-6, IL-10 and D-dimer elevated in severe children compared with non-severe children on admission. The level of total bilirubin and uric acid clearly elevated in severe children compared with non-severe children on admission. All of severe children displayed the lesions on chest CT, more lung segments were involved in severe children than in non-severe children, which was only risk factor associated with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS More than 3 lung segments involved were associated with greater risk of development of severe COVID-19 in children. Moreover, the possible risk of the elevation of IL-6, high total bilirubin and D-dimer with univariable analysis could identify patients to be severe earlier.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yanli; Zhu, Feng; Wang, Cheng; Wu, Jing; Liu, Jie; Chen, Xue; Xiao, Han; Liu, Zhisheng; Wu, Zubo; Lu, Xiaoxia; Ma, Jiehui; Zeng, Ye; Peng, Hua; Sun, Dan","journal":"The Pediatric infectious disease journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000002739; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32384397/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs2Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe COVID","non-severe children","severe pneumonia","non-severe type","development of COVID","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus","risk factors","clinical outcomes of COVID","possible risk","greater risk of development","infection","D-dimer","lung segments","elevation of IL","date of admission","high total bilirubin","level of total bilirubin","univariable analysis","multivariable analysis","hospital admissions","Wuhan Children\u0027s Hospital","retrospective case-control study","white blood cells count","uric acid","chest CT","hsCRP","age","lesions","laboratory","Levels of inflammation bio-makers","METHODS","sex","BACKGROUND Novel coronavirus disease","patients","dyspnea","cases","common symptoms","fever","CONCLUSIONS","progression","cough","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The optimal rewarming rate is still unknown. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of 2 different protocols for rewarming after HCA on neurological outcome in an experimental animal model. METHODS Forty-four Sprague Dawley rats were cooled to 19 \u00B1 1\u00B0C body core temperature by cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). HCA was maintained for 60 min. Animals were randomized to receive slow (90 min) or fast (45 min) assisted rewarming with CPB to a target temperature of 35\u00B0C. After a total of 90 min of reperfusion in both groups, brain samples were collected and analysed immunohistochemically and with immunofluorescence. In 10 rats, magnetic resonance imaging was performed after 2 and after 24 h to investigate cerebral perfusion and cerebral oedema. RESULTS Interleukin 6, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and tumour necrosis factor \u03B1 in the hippocampus are significantly less expressed in the slow rewarming group, and microglia cells are significantly less activated in the slow rewarming group. Magnetic resonance imaging analysis demonstrated better cerebral perfusion and less water content in brains that underwent slow rewarming at 2 and 24 h. CONCLUSIONS Slow rewarming after HCA might be superior to fast rewarming in neurological outcome. The present experimental study demonstrated reduction in the inflammatory response, reduction of inflammatory cell activation in the brain, enhancement of cerebral blood flow and reduction of cerebral oedema when slow rewarming was applied.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Linardi, Daniele; Walpoth, Beat; Mani, Romel; Murari, Angela; Tessari, Maddalena; Hoxha, Stiljan; Anderloni, Marco; Decimo, Ilaria; Dolci, Sissi; Nicolato, Elena; Bontempi, Pietro; Merigo, Flavia; Luciani, Giovanni B; Faggian, Giuseppe; Rungatscher, Alessio","journal":"European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ejcts/ezaa143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408343/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs2MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCA","Sprague Dawley","CPB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["slow rewarming group","fast rewarming","CONCLUSIONS Slow rewarming","HCA","optimal rewarming rate","cerebral perfusion","reduction of cerebral oedema","neurological outcome","C-C motif","enhancement of cerebral blood flow","CPB","reduction of inflammatory cell activation","C body core temperature","Magnetic resonance imaging analysis","present experimental study","inflammatory response","brain samples","target temperature","experimental animal model","Sprague Dawley rats","intercellular adhesion molecule","tumour necrosis factor \u03B1","ligand","cardiopulmonary bypass","hypothermic circulatory arrest","water content","hippocampus","chemokine","microglia cells","brains","different protocols","reperfusion","effects","METHODS","groups","RESULTS Interleukin","factors","Animals","OBJECTIVES","total","goal","immunofluorescence"],"language":"en"},

Patients with advanced age and comorbidities have a higher incidence of mortality. Routine preoperative testing and symptom screening is recommended to identify those with COVID-19. Adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) for the surgical team is essential to protect healthcare workers and ensure an adequate workforce. For COVID-19 positive or suspected patients, the use of N95 respirators is recommended if available. The anesthesia method chosen should attempt to minimize aerosolization of the virus. Negative pressure rooms are strongly preferred for intubation/extubation and other aerosolizing procedures. Although transmission has not yet been shown during laparoscopic and robotic procedures, efforts should be made to minimize the risk of aerosolization. Ultra low particulate air filters are recommended for use during minimally invasive procedures to decrease the risk of viral transmission. Thorough cleaning and sterilization should be performed post-operatively with adequate time allowed for the operating room air to be cycled after procedures. COVID-19 patients should be separated from non-infected patients at all levels of care including recovery to decrease the risk of infection. Future directions will be guided by outcomes and infection rates as social distancing guidelines are relaxed and more surgical procedures are reintroduced. Recommendations should be adapted to the local environment and will continue to evolve as more data becomes available, the shortage of testing and PPE is resolved, and a vaccine and therapeutics for COVID-19 are developed.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Steward, James; Kitley, Weston Riley; Schmidt, C Max; Sundaram, Chandru P","journal":"Journal of endourology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2020.0342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32336150/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs2ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","surgical procedures","risk of infection","robotic procedures","aerosolizing procedures","invasive procedures","risk of aerosolization","risk of viral transmission","suspected patients","care of patients pre-","risk of viral illness","non-infected patients","risk-benefit assessment","PPE","surgical team","adequate time","surgery","adequate workforce","pandemic","healthcare workers","aspects of healthcare","infection rates","levels of care","Adequate personal protective equipment","shortage of testing","use of N95 respirators","operating room air","Routine preoperative testing","low particulate air filters","social distancing guidelines","outcomes","comorbidities","intubation","advanced age","higher incidence of mortality","symptom screening","global impact","recovery","sterilization","efforts","extubation","vaccine","urgency","Negative pressure rooms","Thorough cleaning","Future directions","data","coronavirus disease","therapeutics","local environment","anesthesia method","Recommendations","urologists"],"language":"en"},

Meanwhile, the outbreak also drew attention and concern from the World Health Organization (WHO). COVID-19 is another human infectious disease caused by coronavirus. The transmission of COVID-19 is potent and the infection rate is fast. Since there is no specific drug for COVID-19, the treatment is mainly symptomatic supportive therapy. In addition, it should be pointed out that patients with severe illness need more aggressive treatment and meticulous care. Recently, accurate RNA detection has been decisive for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The development of highly sensitive RT-PCR has facilitated epidemiological studies that provide insight into the prevalence, seasonality, clinical manifestations and course of COVID-19 infection. In this review, we summarize the epidemiology and characteristics of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Xiaoyi; Wei, Fengxiang; Hu, Liang; Wen, Lijuan; Chen, Ken","journal":"Archives of Iranian medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.34172/aim.2020.09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32271601/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs3MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["course of COVID","diagnosis of COVID","characteristics of COVID","transmission of COVID","infection rate","outbreak","aggressive treatment","novel coronavirus","epidemiological studies","prevalence","seasonality","concern","clinical manifestations","sensitive RT-PCR","severe illness","insight","attention","World Health Organization","human infectious disease","meticulous care","accurate RNA detection","development","patients","symptomatic supportive therapy","epidemiology","Wuhan","China","specific drug","review","addition"],"language":"en"},

We investigated the impact of acute and chronic changes in carbon supply on inter-guild competition in two moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBR), operated with (R1) and without (R0) external organic carbon supply. The microbial and nitrifying community composition of the reactors differed significantly. Interestingly, acute increases in the dissolved organic carbon inhibited nitrification in R1 ten times more than in R0. A sustained increase in the carbon supply decreased nitrification efficiency and increased denitrification activity to a greater extent in R1, and also increased the proportion of potential denitrifiers in both bioreactors. The findings suggest that autotrophic biofilms subjected to increases in carbon supply show higher nitrification and lower denitrification activity than carbon-fed biofilms. This has significant implications for the design of nitrifying bioreactors. Specifically, efficient removal of organic matter before the nitrification unit can improve the robustness of the bioreactor to varying influent quality. Thus, maintaining a low C/N ratio is important in nitrifying biofilters when acute carbon stress is expected or when anoxic activity (e.g. denitrification or H2S production) is undesirable, such as in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS).","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Navada, Sharada; Knutsen, Maja F; Bakke, Ingrid; Vadstein, Olav","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64027-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346018/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs3MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["external organic carbon supply","dissolved organic carbon","acute carbon stress","nitrifying biofilms","carbon supply decreased nitrification efficiency","supply ratio","nitrifying biofilters","nitrifying bacteria","R1","increased denitrification activity","design of nitrifying bioreactors","higher nitrification","nitrification unit","acute increases","lower denitrification activity","nitrifying community composition","N ratio","anoxic activity","impact of acute","R0","autotrophic biofilms","efficient removal of organic matter","resource competition","low C","inter-guild competition","moving bed biofilm reactors","chronic changes","ammonia nitrogen","MBBR","greater extent","H2S production","sustained increase","robustness","oxygen","recirculating aquaculture systems","times","significant implications","proportion of potential denitrifiers","RAS","space","influent quality","findings"],"language":"en"},

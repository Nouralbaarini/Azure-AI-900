Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) mediate viral infection of host cells. We reasoned that differences in ACE2 or TMPRSS2 gene expression in sputum cells among asthma patients may identify subgroups at risk for COVID19 morbidity. METHODS We analyzed gene expression for ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and for intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1)(rhinovirus receptor as a comparator), in sputum cells from 330 participants in the Severe Asthma Research Program-3 and 79 healthy controls. RESULTS Gene expression of ACE2 was lower than TMPRSS2, and expression levels of both genes was similar in asthma and health. Among asthma patients, male gender, African Americans race, and history of diabetes mellitus, was associated with higher expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) was associated with lower expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, but treatment with triamcinolone acetonide (TA) did not decrease expression of either gene. These findings differed from those for ICAM-1, where gene expression was increased in asthma and less consistent differences were observed related to gender, race, and use of ICS. CONCLUSION Higher expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in males, African Americans, and patients with diabetes mellitus provides rationale for monitoring these asthma subgroups for poor COVID19 outcomes. The lower expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with ICS use warrants prospective study of ICS use as a predictor of decreased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and decreased COVID19 morbidity.

However, at no time it was used the desirable community perspective and community participation throughout the process as it has been successfully done in other settings. Subsequently, with the closure of health centers, it ceased to be provided in some autonomous communities, when all the attention was transferred to the hospital setting. This exacerbated hospital-centrism, to the detriment of PHC and Home Care, is showing a high contagion in healthcare professionals. The circulation of professionals in the hospitals, where the main focus of infection is concentrated, and from these to their homes is a clear risk factor. In addition, we must not forget that Home Care is of special importance for the care of people with terminal illnesses or very advanced chronic diseases (dementia, COPD ...), although always taking into account recommendations tending to extreme precautions for infection for professionals, family and caregivers. This can be adapted to the pandemic situation by using tools that digital health offers (telephone care, video calls ...). Finally, it would be very interesting that, once the crisis was over, research was carried out that allowed the incorporation of people who have been treated by the health service during the pandemic, through the technique called public participation in research projects.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ram\u00F3n Mart\u00EDnez Riera, Jos\u00E9; Gras-Nieto, Elvira","journal":"Enfermeria clinica","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enfcli.2020.05.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32419772/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs5NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["care of people","Home Care","telephone care","fundamental tool of Primary Health Care","health service","digital health offers","community participation","closure of health centers","healthcare professionals","circulation of professionals","incorporation of people","pandemic situation","monitoring of infected people","public participation","research projects","hospital setting","desirable community perspective","main focus of infection","exacerbated hospital-centrism","advanced chronic diseases","tools","terminal illnesses","extreme precautions","control","technique","special importance","video calls","detriment of PHC","high contagion","dementia","COPD","attention","hospitals","family","uneven development","account recommendations","homes","clear risk factor","relevant role","families","process","caregivers","Spain","autonomous communities","crisis","time","COVID","settings","addition"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 is highly homologous to SARS-CoV and infects humans through the binding of the spike protein to ACE2. Here, we have systematically studied the molecular mechanisms of human infection with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV by protein-protein docking and MD simulations. It was found that SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 with a higher affinity than SARS-CoV, which may partly explain that SARS-CoV-2 is much more infectious than SARS-CoV. In addition, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a significantly lower free energy than that of SARS-CoV, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 is more stable and may survive a higher temperature than SARS-CoV. This provides insights into the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 because SARS-like coronaviruses have originated in bats. Our computation also suggested that the RBD-ACE2 binding for SARS-CoV-2 is much more temperature-sensitive than that for SARS-CoV. Thus, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 would decrease its infection ability much faster than SARS-CoV when the temperature rises. These findings would be beneficial for the disease prevention and drug/vaccine development of SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Jiahua; Tao, Huanyu; Yan, Yumeng; Huang, Sheng-You; Xiao, Yi","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v12040428; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32290077/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","evolution of SARS","spike protein of SARS","vaccine development of SARS","protein-protein docking","higher temperature","binds ACE2","RBD-ACE2 binding","temperature-sensitive","higher affinity","infection ability","novel coronavirus","molecular mechanisms of human infection","severe acute respiratory coronavirus","drug","disease prevention","MD simulations","humans","lower free energy","worldwide public health crisis","addition","Previous studies","findings","outbreak","coronaviruses","insights","bats","computation"],"language":"en"},

The significance of microcirculatory dysfunction in critically ill children and neonates is unknown, but microcirculatory variables can be measured using Doppler or videomicroscopy imaging techniques. We outline the current understanding of the role of the microcirculation in critical illness, review methods for its assessment, and perform a systematic review of how it has been monitored in critically ill neonates and children. DESIGN Systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42019117993). SETTING Not applicable. SUBJECTS Not applicable. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science. We included studies of critically ill patients 0 to 18 years old investigating microcirculatory blood flow. Two reviewers analyzed abstracts and articles. Results were qualitatively analyzed due to study heterogeneity. A total of 2,559 abstracts met search criteria, of which 94 underwent full-text review. Of those, 36 met inclusion criteria. Seven studies investigated microcirculatory changes in critically ill children. Twenty studies investigated the microcirculatory changes in neonates with variable diagnoses compared with a diverse set of clinical endpoints. Nine studies assessed the effects of age, sex, and birth weight on microvascular flow in neonates. Across all studies, microcirculatory dysfunction was associated with poor outcomes and may not correlate with observed macrovascular function. CONCLUSIONS Assessment of microvascular flow in critically ill children and neonates is possible, although significant challenges remain.

We aimed to determine presence of large vessel occlusion (LVO), thrombus length, infarction diameter, and occurrence of hemorrhagic transformation in AIS patients with preceding DOAC as compared to VKA therapy. METHODS Using a prospectively collected cohort of AIS patients, we performed univariate and multivariable regression analyses regarding imaging outcomes. Additionally, we provide a sensitivity analysis for the subgroup of patients with confirmed therapeutic anticoagulation. RESULTS We included AIS in patients with preceding DOAC (N = 75) and VKA (N = 61) therapy, median age 79 (IQR 70-83), 39% female. Presence of any LVO between DOAC and VKA patients (29.3% versus 37.7%, P = 0.361), and target LVO for endovascular therapy (26.7% versus 27.9%, P = 1.0) was equal with a similar occlusion pattern. DOAC as compared to VKA were associated with a similar rate of target LVO for EVT (aOR 0.835, 95% CI 0.368-1.898). The presence of multiple lesions and characteristics of the thrombus were similar in DOAC and VKA patients. Acute ischemic lesion diameter in real world patients was equal in patients taking DOAC as compared to VKA. Lesion diameter in VKA patients (median 13 mm, IQR 6-26 versus median 20 mm, IQR 7-36, P = 0.001), but not DOAC patients was smaller in the setting of confirmed therapeutic VKA. The frequency of radiological hemorrhagic transformation and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in OAC patients was low. Sensitivity analysis considering only patients with confirmed therapeutic anticoagulation did not change any of the results. CONCLUSION Preceding DOAC treatment showed equal rates of LVO and infarct size as compared to VKA in AIS patients. This study adds to the knowledge of imaging findings in AIS patients with preceding anticoagulation.","publish_time":"2020-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meinel, Thomas Raphael; Kaesmacher, Johannes; Gralla, Jan; Seiffge, David J; Auer, Elias; Frey, Sebasti\u00E9n; El-Koussy, Marwan; Arnold, Marcel; Fischer, Urs; G\u00F6ldlin, Martina; Jung, Simon; Hakim, Arsany","journal":"BMC neurology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12883-020-01678-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32160909/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsxNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AIS","DOAC","VKA","LVO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VKA patients","DOAC patients","subgroup of patients","cohort of AIS patients","therapeutic management of patients","therapeutic VKA","VKA therapy","real world patients","preceding anticoagulation","CONCLUSION Preceding DOAC treatment","confirmed therapeutic anticoagulation","equal rates of LVO","IQR","similar rate of target LVO","imaging characteristics","Acute ischemic lesion diameter","preceding direct oral anticoagulants","infarction diameter","imaging outcomes","similar occlusion pattern","median age","endovascular therapy","sensitivity analysis","results","presence of large vessel occlusion","occurrence of hemorrhagic transformation","acute ischemic stroke","knowledge of imaging findings","presence of multiple lesions","frequency of radiological hemorrhagic transformation","thrombus length","symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage","EVT","multivariable regression analyses","infarct size","diagnostic","setting","utility of neuroimaging","aOR","vitamin","antagonists","BACKGROUND","CI","study","METHODS","female"],"language":"en"},

We examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in Italy and South Korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations. This powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for COVID-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider the age composition of local and national contexts as well as intergenerational interactions.

Parenting Health Initiative (SELPHI) provides expectant and parenting youth ages 16-24 in Philadelphia with supports to improve educational, social, and economic outcomes to shape their health and the health of their children. Phone, text, video-based, and social media communication technology is built in to SELPHI\u0027s program design to facilitate case management and connect clients to a broad referral network. Given the novelty of using information and communication technology (ICT) in case management, the reported lessons learned seek to give providers a specific and nuanced picture of ICT in case management. METHODS In its initial 6-month implementation period, SELPHI\u0027s five case managers, called Navigators, served 59 clients. Data from feedback surveys and case records were collected from clients and Navigators. Data included client demographic characteristics, needs assessment, and contact records to inform continuous quality improvement (CQI). RESULTS ICT\u0027s benefits included having multiple ways to connect to difficult-to-reach clients, the ability to be more responsive to clients, and the flexibility to address scheduling and transportation barriers. ICT\u0027s challenges are related to Navigators\u0027 boundary setting, limitations on rapport building, and data security considerations. CQI data are presented to illustrate the lessons learned. Text messages were the most prevalent ICT; phone calls were most successful in engaging clients. Clients\u0027 ICT preferences differed by purpose of communication. DISCUSSION Findings suggest that programs should understand the nuances of client contact preferences. To maximize the benefits of ICT, programs must develop or adapt protocols based on preference and purpose of communication.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kang, Nichole; Patrick, Morgan; Williams, Frances; Hemady, Katharine; Aussendorf, Mara; Greenbacker, Livia; Kannam, Allison","journal":"Maternal and child health journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-020-02952-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418083/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsyNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Parenting Health Initiative","CQI"],"locations":["Philadelphia"],"keyphrases":["case management","case records","benefits of ICT","engaging clients","case managers","prevalent ICT","purpose of communication","CQI data","Clients\u0027 ICT preferences","nuanced picture of ICT","social media communication technology","contact records","data security considerations","Parenting Health Initiative","programs","nuances of client contact preferences","RESULTS ICT\u0027s benefits","phone calls","ICT\u0027s challenges","reported lessons","Text messages","SELPHI\u0027s program design","client demographic characteristics","parenting youth ages","rapport building","Navigators\u0027 boundary setting","limitations","month implementation period","providers","multiple ways","flexibility","continuous quality improvement","assessment","economic outcomes","video","information","feedback surveys","broad referral network","scheduling","transportation barriers","Philadelphia","protocols","novelty","ability","METHODS","DISCUSSION Findings","children","INTRODUCTION","Support"],"language":"en"},

Purpose To perform a meta-analysis to evaluate diagnostic performance measures, including predictive values, of chest CT and initial reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Materials and Methods MEDLINE and Embase were searched from January 1, 2020 to April 3, 2020 for studies on COVID-19 that reported the sensitivity and/or specificity of CT scans and/or RT-PCR assays. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were estimated by using random-effects models. The actual prevalence (i.e., the proportion of confirmed patients among those tested) in eight countries was obtained from web sources, and the predictive values were calculated. Meta-regression was performed to reveal the effect of potential explanatory factors on the diagnostic performance measures. Results The pooled sensitivity was 94% (95% CI: 91%, 96%; I2=95%) for chest CT and 89% (95% CI: 81%, 94%; I2=90%) for RT-PCR. The pooled specificity was 37% (95% CI: 26%, 50%; I2=83%) for chest CT. The prevalence of COVID-19 outside China ranged from 1.0% to 22.9%. For chest CT scans, the positive predictive value (PPV) ranged from 1.5% to 30.7%, and the negative predictive value (NPV) ranged from 95.4% to 99.8%. For RT-PCR,the PPV ranged from 47.3% to 96.4%, while the NPV ranged from 96.8% to 99.9%. The sensitivity of CT was affected by the distribution of disease severity, the proportion of patients with comorbidities, and the proportion of asymptomatic patients (all p \u003C 0.05). The sensitivity of RT-PCR was negatively associated with the proportion of elderly patients (p = 0.01).

The primary aim was to examine the association between rSO2 values (both baseline rSO2 and intraoperative decrease in rSO2) with the composite of morbidity endpoints. We retrospectively analyzed 356 cardiac surgical patients having continuously recorded data of intraoperative rSO2 values. Per institutional guidelines, patients received interventions to restore the rSO2 value to \u226580% of the baseline value. Analyzed rSO2 variables included baseline value, and area under the threshold below an absolute value of 50% (AUT50). Their association with outcome was analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. AUT50 (odds ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval; 1.01-1.08; p = 0.015) was shown to be an independent risk factor (along with age, chronic kidney disease, and cardiopulmonary bypass time) of adverse outcomes. In cardiac surgical patients who received interventions to correct decreases in rSO2, increased severity of intraoperative decrease in rSO2 as reflected by AUT below an absolute value of 50% was associated with a composite of adverse outcomes, implicating the importance of cerebral oximetry to monitor the brain as an index organ.","publish_time":"2020-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jo, Youn Yi; Shim, Jae-Kwang; Soh, Sarah; Suh, Sungmin; Kwak, Young Lan","journal":"Journal of clinical medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9030840; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32204551/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjszMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AUT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["baseline rSO2","intraoperative rSO2 decreases","rSO2 variables","correct rSO2 decreases","baseline value","recorded data of intraoperative rSO2 values","absolute value","interventions","cardiac surgical patients","correct decreases","increased severity of intraoperative decrease","cardiac surgery","composite of adverse outcomes","association","AUT50","baseline regional cerebral oxygen saturation","importance of cerebral oximetry","prognostic importance","composite of morbidity endpoints","cardiopulmonary bypass time","age","chronic kidney disease","evidence","area","brain","threshold","independent risk factor","multivariable logistic regression","institutional guidelines","odds ratio","confidence interval","index organ","primary aim"],"language":"en"},

By modulating key transcription factors, BTK may regulate macrophage polarization downstream of classic M1 and M2 polarizing stimuli and mitigate the hyperinflammatory state associated with COVID19. In favor of BTKi discontinuation, we note a potentially increased risk of secondary infections or impaired humoral immunity. We hypothesize that the potential benefit of blunting a hyper-inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 through attenuation of M1 polarization outweighs the potential risk of impaired humoral immunity, not to mention the risk of rapid progression of B-cell malignancy following BTKi interruption.

DATA SOURCES Electronic databases (Cochrane, PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov) were searched for studies comparing surgical excision alone to surgical excision with adjuvant HPV vaccination for CIN 2 or greater. Studies published from January 1990 to January 2019 were included. METHODS A total of 5,901 studies were reviewed. The primary outcomes evaluated included: recurrence of CIN 2 or greater, CIN 1 or greater, and HPV 16,18 associated CIN within 6-48 months. We used Covidence software to assist with screening, and meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS Six studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. In total 2,984 women were included; 1,360 (45.6%) received adjuvant HPV vaccination after surgical excision, and 1,624 (54.4%) received either placebo or surgical management alone for CIN 2 or greater. Recurrence of CIN 2 or greater occurred within 6-48 months in 115 women (3.9%) overall; however, recurrence was significantly lower for vaccinated women: 26 of 1,360 women (1.9%) vs 89 of 1,624 unvaccinated women (5.9%) (relative risk [RR] 0.36 95% CI 0.23-0.55). The risk of CIN 1 or greater was also significantly lower with adjuvant HPV vaccination, occurring in 86 of 1,360 vaccinated women (6.3%) vs 157 of 1,624 unvaccinated women (9.7%) (RR 0.67 95% CI 0.52-0.85). Thirty-five women developed recurrent CIN 2 or greater lesions specific to HPV 16,18; nine received adjuvant vaccination (0.9%) vs 26 who were unvaccinated (2.0%) (RR 0.41 95% CI 0.20-0.85). CONCLUSION Adjuvant HPV vaccination in the setting of surgical excision for CIN 2 or greater is associated with a reduced risk of recurrent cervical dysplasia overall and a reduction in the risk of recurrent lesions caused by the most oncogenic strains (HPV 16,18). Human papillomavirus vaccination should therefore be considered for adjuvant treatment in patients undergoing surgical excision for CIN 2 or greater.

The input features for ML training were selected based on the Delphi method and univariate logistic regression (LR). LR and artificial neural network (ANN) models were trained and subsequently used to predict the occurrence of DED in patients who underwent vitrectomy for the first time during the period. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) was used to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the ML models. The AUCs with use of the LR and ANN models were 0.741 and 0.786, respectively, suggesting satisfactory performance in predicting the occurrence of DED. When the two models were compared in terms of predictive power, the fitting effect of the ANN model was slightly superior to that of the LR model.

METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were longitudinally collected from 40 confirmed COVID-19 patients and examined for lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles by specific immunoassays. FINDINGS: Of the 40 COVID-19 patients enrolled, 13 severe cases showed significant and sustained decreases in lymphocyte counts [0\u00B76 (0\u00B76-0\u00B78)] but increases in neutrophil counts [4\u00B77 (3\u00B76-5\u00B78)] than 27 mild cases [1.1 (0\u00B78-1\u00B74); 2\u00B70 (1\u00B75-2\u00B79)]. Further analysis demonstrated significant decreases in the counts of T cells, especially CD8(\u002B) T cells, as well as increases in IL-6, IL-10, IL-2 and IFN-\u03B3 levels in the peripheral blood in the severe cases compared to those in the mild cases. T cell counts and cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients who survived the disease gradually recovered at later time points to levels that were comparable to those of the mild cases. Moreover, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (AUC=0\u00B793) and neutrophil-to-CD8(\u002B) T cell ratio (N8R) (AUC =0\u00B794) were identified as powerful prognostic factors affecting the prognosis for severe COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: The degree of lymphopenia and a proinflammatory cytokine storm is higher in severe COVID-19 patients than in mild cases, and is associated with the disease severity.

Restrictions from state governments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have resulted in a rapidly changing and evolving learning environment for todays\u2019 fellows. Innovative solutions must be sought to guarantee proper education is maintained and ensure the well-being of our trainees. METHODS: We assembled a panel of pain program directors who serve as officers/board members of the Association of Pain Program Directors to provide guidance and formulate recommendations to pain fellowship directors nationally. This guidance is based on reviewing current changes to Accreditation Council Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and American Board Anesthesiology policies and best available evidence and expert opinion on use of remote educational activities, research endeavors, and trainee wellness. CONCLUSIONS: The country is in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic. The impact on pain management fellowships has been severe and will likely last for months, resulting in extraordinary challenges to the administration of pain fellowship programs and the education of our fellows. Understanding revisions in ACGME policies, use of technology to promote remote learning opportunities, and providing trainees with opportunities to alleviate their anxieties and encourage mental health are beneficial strategies to implement. Together, we can implement innovative solutions to help overcome these challenges.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kohan, Lynn; Moeschler, Susan; Spektor, Boris; Przkora, Rene; Sobey, Cristopher; Brancolini, Scott; Wahezi, Sayed; Anitescu, Magdalena","journal":"Pain Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2631fee494e939474028a708250f7f604230ff71.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197561/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjsyMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Association of Pain Program Directors","Accreditation Council Graduate Medical Education","American Board Anesthesiology"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["administration of pain fellowship programs","Association of Pain Program Directors","panel of pain program directors","fellowship directors","pain management fellowships","ACGME policies","remote learning opportunities","unique challenges","extraordinary challenges","proper education","guidance","trainees","Innovative solutions","American Board Anesthesiology policies","board members","use of remote educational activities","todays\u2019 fellows","unprecedented pandemic","Accreditation Council Graduate Medical Education","evolving learning environment","best available evidence","expert opinion","research endeavors","current changes","Centers","officers","anxieties","technology","state governments","Disease Control","mental health","recommendations","beneficial strategies","trainee wellness","Restrictions","Prevention","midst","months","impact","COVID","BACKGROUND","country","revisions","well-being","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

That is because, in today\u2019s rapid-changing business environment, managers and executives need to be able to gain crucial insights about the ongoing project in as little time as possible. Recently, energy efficiency has become a greater field of research, and companies started concentrating on monitoring energy-related metrics. In addition, many of them have built their own internal tools (dashboards) to do just this. However, one of the major drawbacks of building specialized tools is the lack of adaptability. That is, they are often tailored to only one person (e.g. CEO), or a small group of them (e.g. board of directors, managers). Furthermore, the combination of metrics that is displayed to them does not change over time. This is a problem because most likely there exists a better metric combination that would allow users to get the crucial insights faster. To fill this gap, our ongoing research focuses on making the dashboards adaptable to multiple roles within the organization while optimizing for a certain goal. In some scenarios the dashboard\u2019s goal may be to detect defects, in others it may be to generate the most profit. As our primary research interest is to amplify energy efficiency, we have chosen that to be our dashboard\u2019s goal. Our previous work suggests that in order to handle compound metrics at scale it is needed to represent the dashboard as a complex system. This paper presents the design and the architecture of our proposed solution synergizing the notions from complexity theory, software architecture and user experience (UX) design.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ergasheva, Shokhista; Ivanov, Vladimir; Khomyakov, Ilya; Kruglov, Artem; Strugar, Dragos; Succi, Giancarlo","journal":"Open Source Systems","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a7e0c89bf7e8dfba7c61ffde483213d27fe452e2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7198242.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7198242/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjsyMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ongoing research","energy efficiency","combination of metrics","dashboard\u2019s goal","managers","design","monitoring energy-related metrics","crucial insights","primary research","compound metrics","certain goal","need","greater field of research","software architecture","ongoing project","specialized tools","dashboards adaptable","internal tools","little time","better metric combination","complexity theory","user experience","notions","business environment","order","proposed solution","UX","users","companies","executives","multiple roles","today\u2019s rapid","CEO","organizations","small group","disposal lead","board of directors","major drawbacks","lack of adaptability","scale","complex system","previous work","paper","scenarios","defects","gap","person","data","problem","information","addition","profit"],"language":"en"},

Colonization of the vaginal tract is normally dominated by Lactobacillus species. Both Lactobacillus and Enterococcus faecalis may secrete reutericyclin, which inhibits the growth of a variety of pathogenic bacteria. Increasing evidence suggests a potential therapeutic role for an analogue of reutericyclin, glycerol monolaurate (GML), against microbial pathogens. Previous studies using a macaque vaginal simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) transmission model demonstrated that GML reduces transmission and alters immune responses to infection in vitro. Previous studies showed that structural analogues of GML negatively impact other enveloped viruses. We sought to expand understanding of how GML inhibits HIV-1 and other enveloped viruses and show that GML restricts HIV-1 entry post-CD4 engagement at the step of coreceptor binding. Further, HIV-1 and yellow fever virus (YFV) particles were more sensitive to GML interference than particles \u201Cmatured\u201D by proteolytic processing. We show that high-pressure-liquid-chromatography (HPLC)-purified reutericyclin and reutericyclin secreted by Lactobacillus inhibit HIV-1.

Solid waste management protocols and system dynamic modeling support policy development as it uses waste prevention to explain the complex waste management systems and suggests methods for effective management. However, creating an effective waste system goes beyond the formulation of policies and legislation; it involves financial and technological proficiency, skilled human capacity, technical, social, resource recycling, educational awareness programs, and active public participation. Because of urbanization, Liberia\u2019s municipal solid waste (MSW) problems have become heightened, thereby impacting the economic, social, and political fabric of society by overburdening infrastructure and social facilities. The impact of urbanization must be addressed because urbanization, amongst several factors, including unsustainable management of MSW, degrades the environment and presents risks to public health. The purpose of this review was to highlight the current waste management activities in Liberia and provide information to the readers about the challenges facing the waste management sector and the challenges impeding the development of a sustainable waste management system. In Liberia, waste management activities are getting worse daily due to shortage of a comprehensive waste management framework, the absence of guidelines regarding the responsibilities of waste generators, and the decision-makers\u0027 lack of intent to design and implement a sustainable and integrated management system. Recommendations for collaborative efforts are made by focusing on delivering a waste strategy which concentrates on waste minimization, recycling, resource recovery, and promoting sustainable waste management practices for communities, small businesses, corporations, and government institutions in Liberia and other developing countries.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"David, Victor Emery; John, Yasinta; Hussain, Shahid","journal":"J Mater Cycles Waste Manag","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/07ac1abfe3b7b100db4640bdffdc0327add69412.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202682.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7202682/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjszMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Liberia"],"keyphrases":["waste management sector","sustainable waste management system","waste minimization","waste prevention","waste strategy","Solid waste management protocols","sustainable waste management practices","current waste management activities","effective waste system","comprehensive waste management framework","complex waste management systems","effective management","integrated management system","responsibilities of waste generators","appalling state of Liberia\u2019s municipal solid waste management system","unsustainable management of MSW","resource recycling","social facilities","challenges","review","impact of urbanization","system dynamic modeling support policy development","resource recovery","public health","active public participation","educational awareness programs","skilled human capacity","small businesses","communities","political fabric of society","technological proficiency","overburdening infrastructure","government institutions","corporations","absence of guidelines","shortage","methods","MSWM","environment","information","problems","formulation of policies","legislation","decision-makers\u0027 lack of intent","motivation","factors","readers","developing countries","risks","Recommendations","collaborative efforts","analysis","purpose"],"language":"en"},

In this context, most of recent approaches exploit similarity learning through comparing spatial-temporal patterns between normal and irregular records. However, they are limited in utilizing passenger-level information. First, all passenger transits are fused in a certain region at a timestamp whereas each passenger has own repetitive stops and time slots. Second, these differences in passenger profile result in high intra-class variance of normal records and blur the decision boundaries. To tackle these problems, we propose a modelling framework to extract passenger-level spatial-temporal profile and present a personalised similarity learning for irregular behavior detection. Specifically, a route-to-stop embedding is proposed to extract spatial correlations between transit stops and routes. Then attentive fusion is adopted to uncover spatial repetitive and time invariant patterns. Finally, a personalised similarity function is learned to evaluate the historical and recent mobility patterns. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on recall, F1 score and accuracy. Raw features and the extracted patterns are visualized and illustrate the learned deviation between the normal and the irregular records.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xuesong; Yao, Lina; Liu, Wei; Li, Can; Bai, Lei; Waller, S.

We propose a framework which facilitates unsupervised filter feature selection methods to exploit input data and feature group information simultaneously, encouraging features from different groups.

Once they are released, driven by potential monetary profit, the models may be duplicated, resold, or redistributed by adversaries, including greedy service providers themselves. To mitigate this threat, in this paper, we propose an innovative framework to protect the intellectual property of deep learning models, that is, watermarking the model by adding a new label to crafted key samples during training. The intuition comes from the fact that, compared with existing DNN watermarking methods, adding a new label will not twist the original decision boundary but can help the model learn the features of key samples better. We implement a prototype of our framework and evaluate the performance under three different benchmark datasets, and investigate the relationship between model accuracy, perturbation strength, and key samples\u2019 length.

As a result, many applications are memory bound, i.e., they are bottlenecked by the movement of data from main memory to compute units. One way to address this issue is through data prefetching, which relies on accurate prediction of memory accesses. While recent deep learning models have performed well on sequence prediction problems, they are far too heavy in terms of model size and inference latency to be practical for data prefetching. Here, we propose extremely compact LSTM models that can predict the next memory access with high accuracy. Prior LSTM based work on access prediction has used orders of magnitude more parameters and developed one model for each application (trace). While one (specialized) model per application can result in more accuracy, it is not a scalable approach. In contrast, our models can predict for a class of applications by trading off specialization at the cost of few retraining steps at runtime, for a more generalizable compact meta-model. Our experiments on 13 benchmark applications demonstrate that three compact meta-models can obtain accuracy close to specialized models using few batches of retraining for majority of the applications.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Srivastava, Ajitesh; Wang, Ta-Yang; Zhang, Pengmiao; De Rose, Cesar Augusto F.; Kannan, Rajgopal; Prasanna, Viktor K.","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/66178117b0f45a4700170b95b866658cf8c89323.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206302.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206302/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Big Data"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specialized models","compact meta-models","compact LSTM models","data prefetching","access prediction","generalizable compact meta-model","movement of data","main memory","class of applications","benchmark applications","accurate prediction of memory accesses","accuracy close","terms of model size","recent deep learning models","high accuracy","rise of Big Data","result","sequence prediction problems","batches of retraining","retraining steps","Prior LSTM","increasing compute power","GPUs","inference latency","TPUs","cost","significant effort","runtime","specialization","orders of magnitude","work","trading","heterogeneous architectures","parameters","issue","majority","units","experiments","trace","scalable approach","way","contrast"],"language":"en"},

For countries that have implemented restrictions on its population in a step-wise manner, monitoring of COVID-19 prevalence is of importance to guide decision on when to impose new, or when to abolish old, restrictions. We are here determining whether measures of odor intensity in a large sample can serve as one such measure. Online measures of how intense common household odors are perceived and symptoms of COVID-19 were collected from 2440 Swedes. Average odor intensity ratings were then compared to predicted COVID-19 population prevalence over time in the Swedish population and were found to closely track each other (r=-0.83). Moreover, we found that there was a large difference in rated intensity between individuals with and without COVID-19 symptoms and number of symptoms was related to odor intensity ratings. Finally, we found that individuals progressing from reporting no symptoms to subsequently reporting COVID-19 symptoms demonstrated a large drop in olfactory performance. These data suggest that measures of odor intensity, if obtained in a large and representative sample, can be used as an indicator of COVID-19 disease in the general population. Importantly, this simple measure could easily be implemented in countries without widespread access to COVID-19 testing or implemented as a fast early response before wide-spread testing can be facilitated.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Iravani, Behzad; Arshamian, Artin; Ravia, Aharon; Mishor, Eva; Snitz, Kobi; Shushan, Sagit; Roth, Yehudah; Perl, Ofer; Honigstein, Danielle; Weissgross, Reut; Karagach, Shiri; Ernst, Gernot; Okamoto, Masako; Mainen, Zachary; Monteleone, Erminio; Dinnella, Caterina; Spinelli, Sara; Mari\u00F1o-S\u00E1nchez, Franklin; Ferdenzi, Camille; Smeets, Monique; Touhara, Kazushige; Bensafi, Moustafa; Hummel, Thomas; Sobel, Noam; Lundstr\u00F6m, Johan N","journal":"Chemical senses","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/chemse/bjaa034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32441744/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs1NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["symptoms of COVID","predicted COVID","indicator of COVID","measures of odor intensity","population prevalence","general population","rated intensity","Average odor intensity ratings","large sample","number of symptoms","Swedish population","countries","large drop","large difference","testing","Online measures","disease","individuals","restrictions","representative sample","simple measure","fast early response","intense common household odors","pandemic","time","guide decision","importance","step-wise manner","widespread access","various strategies","olfactory performance","data","Swedes"],"language":"en"},

Delivering these interventions via electronic health (eHealth) may help increase their scalability. OBJECTIVE This scoping review aimed to provide the first comprehensive overview of dyadic eHealth interventions for individuals of all ages affected by mental or physical illness and their family members or friends who support them. The goal was to understand how dyadic eHealth interventions have been used and to highlight areas of research needed to advance dyadic eHealth intervention development and dissemination. METHODS A comprehensive electronic literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and PsycINFO was conducted for articles published in the English language through March 2019. Eligible records described a psychosocial eHealth intervention that intervened with both care recipients and their support person. RESULTS A total of 7113 records were reviewed of which 101 met eligibility criteria. There were 52 unique dyadic eHealth interventions identified, which were tested across 73 different trials. Of the unique interventions, 33 were conducted among dyads of children and their supporting parent, 1 was conducted with an adolescent-young adult care recipient population, and the remaining 18 were conducted among adult dyads. Interventions targeting pediatric dyads most commonly addressed a mental health condition (n=10); interventions targeting adult dyads most commonly addressed cancer (n=9). More than three-fourths of interventions (n=40) required some human support from research staff or clinicians. Most studies (n=64) specified one or more primary outcomes for care recipients, whereas less than one-fourth (n=22) specified primary outcomes for support persons. Where specified, primary outcomes were most commonly self-reported psychosocial or health factors for both care recipients (n=43) and support persons (n=18). Results of the dyadic eHealth intervention tended to be positive for care recipients, but evidence of effects for support persons was limited because of few studies specifying primary outcomes for supporters. Trials of dyadic eHealth interventions were most commonly randomized controlled trials (RCTs; n=44), and RCTs most commonly compared the dyadic eHealth intervention to usual care alone (n=22). CONCLUSIONS This first comprehensive review of dyadic eHealth interventions demonstrates that there is substantial, diverse, and growing literature supporting this interventional approach. However, several significant gaps were identified. Few studies were designed to evaluate the unique effects of dyadic interventions relative to individual interventions. There was also limited assessment and reporting of outcomes for support persons, and there were no interventions meeting our eligibility criteria specifically targeting the needs of older adult dyads. Findings highlight areas of research opportunities for developing dyadic eHealth interventions for novel populations and for increasing access to dyadic care.","publish_time":"2020-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shaffer, Kelly M; Tigershtrom, Ashley; Badr, Hoda; Benvengo, Stephanie; Hernandez, Marisol; Ritterband, Lee M","journal":"Journal of medical Internet research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/15509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32130143/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs1Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Allied Health Literature"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Trials of dyadic eHealth interventions","unique dyadic eHealth interventions","dyadic care","unique interventions","comprehensive review of dyadic eHealth interventions","comprehensive overview of dyadic eHealth interventions","individual interventions","fourths of interventions","BACKGROUND Dyadic psychosocial interventions","dyadic eHealth intervention development","unique effects of dyadic interventions relative","psychosocial eHealth intervention","support persons","care recipients","primary outcomes","human support","usual care","electronic health","Allied Health Literature","health factors","mental health condition","reporting of outcomes","dyads of children","pediatric dyads","studies","needs of older adult dyads","physical health conditions","adolescent-young adult care recipient population","comprehensive electronic literature search of PubMed","growing literature","research staff","areas of research opportunities","family members","RCTs","friends","different trials","eligibility criteria","Results","randomized controlled trials","evidence of effects","physical illness","scoping review","Eligible records","addressed cancer","supporting parent","EMBASE","Cumulative Index","novel populations","Cochrane","Nursing","ages","individuals","increasing access","PsycINFO","METHODS","clinicians","people","dissemination","articles","interventional approach","Findings","assessment","CONCLUSIONS","supporters","English language","OBJECTIVE","goal","significant gaps","total","scalability"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to develop and externally validate a simple symptom and risk-factor questionnaire to screen for patients with BE. Methods Questionnaires from 1299 patients in the BEST2 case-controlled study were analysed: 880 had BE including 40 with invasive oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) and 419 were controls. This was randomly split into a training cohort of 776 patients and an internal validation cohort of 523 patients. External validation included 398 patients from the BOOST case-controlled study: 198 with BE (23 with OAC) and 200 controls. Identification of independently important diagnostic features was undertaken using machine learning techniques information gain (IG) and correlation based feature selection (CFS). Multiple classification tools were assessed to create a multi-variable risk prediction model. Internal validation was followed by external validation in the independent dataset. Findings The BEST2 study included 40 features. Of these, 24 added IG but following CFS, only 8 demonstrated independent diagnostic value including age, gender, smoking, waist circumference, frequency of stomach pain, duration of heartburn and acid taste and taking of acid suppression medicines. Logistic regression offered the highest prediction quality with AUC (area under the receiver operator curve) of 0.87. In the internal validation set, AUC was 0.86. In the BOOST external validation set, AUC was 0.81. Interpretation The diagnostic model offers valid predictions of diagnosis of BE in patients with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux, assisting in identifying who should go forward to invasive testing. Overweight men who have been taking stomach medicines for a long time may merit particular consideration for further testing. The risk prediction tool is quick and simple to administer but will need further calibration and validation in a prospective study in primary care.

OBJECTIVES The present study aims to investigate the needs in the public health education programs, as well as need and availability of competent public health workforce in labour market of Saudi Arabia. METHODS A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was administered in two phases in the college of Health Sciences at the Saudi Electronic University (SEU). The first phase was carried out between September 2015 and December 2015, which involved interview with administrative heads of four health-related organizations. The second phase was performed in September 2017 and June 2018 after starting an undergraduate course in public health at the university. A total of 41 faculty and 408 students from different branches of SEU participated in the online survey. RESULTS According to administrative head of public health-related organization, there is a shortage of qualified workforce in public health. All the four organizations need workforce with the master degree in sub-speciality epidemiology. About 97.5% students agreed there is a shortage of public health speciality in these organizations. About 92.7% faculty had an opinion that there is a requirement to set-up educational programs in public health. To overcome the shortage of competent workforce, two organizations showed interest in updating their employees\u0027 skill through bridging courses. The students perceiving bachelor course in public health showed interest to accomplish master\u0027s degree in epidemiology (38.5%), public health education and promotion (36.5%) and infection control (35.5%). CONCLUSION There is a shortage of expertise in the public health organizations and there is a need for development of more public health schools in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The establishment of public health courses especially in the field of epidemiology at undergraduate and graduate level will help in the development of efficient and competent public health workforce.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Mohaithef, Mohammed; Javed, Nargis Begum; Elkhalifa, Ahmed Me; Tahash, Mohammed; Chandramohan, Sriram; Hazazi, Ahmed; Elhadi, Fatima Elsheikh Mohammed","journal":"Journal of epidemiology and global health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.2991/jegh.k.191123.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32175716/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs2ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Health Sciences","Saudi Electronic University","SEU"],"locations":["Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["public health organizations","public health schools","efficient public health workforce","shortage of public health speciality","public health education programs","health of population","establishment of public health courses","availability of competent public health workforce","health-related organizations","college of Health Sciences","administrative head of public health-related organization","shortage of competent workforce","shortage of qualified workforce","students","shortage of expertise","development of efficient","Saudi Electronic University","field of epidemiology","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","set-up educational programs","proper educational programs","sub-speciality epidemiology","undergraduate course","faculty","labour market of Saudi Arabia","master degree","master\u0027s degree","administrative heads","bachelor course","bridging courses","cross-sectional survey","online survey","different branches of SEU","needs","phases","requirement","graduate level","promotion","BACKGROUND","employees\u0027 skill","present study","METHODS","trainings","RESULTS","OBJECTIVES","opinion","CONCLUSION","total","infection control"],"language":"en"},

Increase thickness of TiO2 nanowires layer lowers the driving potential of the entire ECDs accompanied with reduced potential at the EC layer electrode, which further leads to decreased optical contrast and switching speed of the ECDs. Meanwhile, it can be found that the EC layer electrodes possess larger charge densities than those of TiO2 nanowire electrodes during the electrochemical redox process of these ECDs. However, the intrinsic injection and extraction charge densities of each single electrode are similar, which appears that the intrinsic charge balance of EC layer and TiO2 nanowires electrodes play more important role in the cycling stability of the ECDs. ECD with an optimum thickness of the TiO2 nanowires layer exhibits good electrochromic properties in term of high optical contrast (~45%), fast switching speed (3.23 s) and good cycling stability (which has nearly no decay after 5000 cycles).

METHODS The organisation of the University of Naples Federico II predictive pathology laboratory was assessed before (March-April 2019) and during (March-April 2020) the Italian lockdown. RESULTS The number of patients undergoing single or multiple biomarker testing was similar in 2019 (n=43) and in 2020 (n=45). Considering adequate samples for molecular testing, before the outbreak, next-generation sequencing was mostly used (35/42, 83.3%). Testing six genes had a reagent cost of \u20AC98/patient. Conversely, in 2020, almost all cases (38/41, 92.7%) were analysed by automated testing. This latter had for any single assay/gene a significant reagent cost (\u20AC95-\u20AC136) and a faster mean turnaround time (5.3 vs 7.9 working days).

Based on 402 papers published from 1992 to 2019, we adopted the approaches of bibliometric and social network analysis (SNA) to map and quantify publication years, research area distribution, international collaboration, keyword co-occurrence frequency, hierarchical clustering, highly cited articles and cluster timeline visualization. In view of the results, several hotspot clusters were identified, namely: physical injuries, workplace, mental health; occupational hazards and diseases, infectious factors; community health workers and occupational exposure. As for citations, we employed document co-citation analysis to detect trends and identify seven clusters, namely tuberculosis (TB), strength training, influenza, healthcare worker (HCW), occupational exposure, epidemiology and psychological. With the visualization of cluster timeline, we detected that the earliest research cluster was occupational exposure, then followed by epidemiology and psychological; however, TB, strength training and influenza appeared to gain more attention in recent years. These findings are presumed to offer researchers, public health practitioners a comprehensive understanding of HCWs\u002BOH research.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Bingke; Fan, Hao; Xie, Bingbing; Su, Ran; Zhou, Chaofeng; He, Jianping","journal":"International journal of environmental research and public health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17082625; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32290454/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs3NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["occupational exposure","mental health","health departments","occupational hazards","qualitative analysis of healthcare workers\u0027 occupational health","community health workers","OH research","public health practitioners","earliest research cluster","cluster timeline visualization","visualization of cluster timeline","influenza","TB","strength training","researchers","epidemiology","publication years","recent years","comprehensive understanding of HCWs","research area distribution","social network analysis","document co-citation analysis","hotspot clusters","international collaboration","diseases","keyword co-occurrence frequency","infectious factors","hierarchical clustering","cited articles","workplace","SNA","trends","field","approaches of bibliometric","physical injuries","increasing concern","academics","tuberculosis","citations","results","joint way","attention","view","study","findings","papers"],"language":"en"},

Endoscopic balloon dilatation (EBD) is a minimally invasive treatment intended to avoid surgery; however, whether EBD prevents subsequent surgery remains unclear. We aimed to reveal the factors contributing to surgery in patients with small bowel stricture and the factors associated with subsequent surgery after initial EBD. METHODS Data were retrospectively collected from surgically untreated CD patients who developed symptomatic small bowel stricture after 2008 when the use of balloon-assisted enteroscopy and maintenance therapy with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) became available. RESULTS A total of 305 cases from 32 tertiary referral centers were enrolled. Cumulative surgery-free survival was 74.0% at 1 year, 54.4% at 5 years, and 44.3% at 10 years. The factors associated with avoiding surgery were non-stricturing, non-penetrating disease at onset, mild severity of symptoms, successful EBD, stricture length \u003C 2 cm, and immunomodulator or anti-TNF added after onset of obstructive symptoms. In 95 cases with successful initial EBD, longer EBD interval was associated with lower risk of surgery. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that an EBD interval of \u2264 446 days predicted subsequent surgery, and the proportion of smokers was significantly high in patients who required frequent dilatation. CONCLUSIONS In CD patients with symptomatic small bowel stricture, addition of immunomodulator or anti-TNF and smoking cessation may improve the outcome of symptomatic small bowel stricture, by avoiding frequent EBD and subsequent surgery after initial EBD.","publish_time":"2020-01-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bamba, Shigeki; Sakemi, Ryosuke; Fujii, Toshimitsu; Takeda, Teruyuki; Fujioka, Shin; Takenaka, Kento; Kitamoto, Hiroki; Umezawa, Shotaro; Sakuraba, Hirotake; Inokuchi, Toshihiro; Fukata, Norimasa; Mizuno, Shinta; Yamashita, Masaki; Shinzaki, Shinichiro; Tanaka, Hiroki; Takedatsu, Hidetoshi; Ozaki, Ryo; Moriya, Kei; Ishii, Manabu; Kinjo, Tetsu; Ozeki, Keiji; Ooi, Makoto; Hayashi, Ryohei; Kakimoto, Kazuki; Shimodate, Yuichi; Kitamura, Kazuya; Yamada, Akihiro; Sonoda, Akira; Nishida, Yu; Yoshioka, Kyouko; Ashizuka, Shinya; Takahashi, Fumiaki; Shimokawa, Toshio; Kobayashi, Taku; Andoh, Akira; Hibi, Toshifumi","journal":"Journal of gastroenterology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00535-020-01670-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31989252/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs4MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["subsequent surgery","successful EBD","frequent EBD","successful initial EBD","BACKGROUND Small bowel stricture","outcome of symptomatic small bowel stricture","longer EBD interval","lower risk of surgery","stricture length","anti-TNF","untreated CD patients","Cumulative surgery-free survival","factors","cases","frequent dilatation","years","non-penetrating disease","onset of obstructive symptoms","Endoscopic balloon dilatation","anti-tumor necrosis factor","non-stricturing","addition of immunomodulator","Crohn\u0027s disease","use of balloon","mild severity of symptoms","maintenance therapy","enteroscopy","smoking cessation","common complications","tertiary referral centers","characteristic analysis","proportion of smokers","CONCLUSIONS","days","invasive treatment","Receiver","total","METHODS Data"],"language":"en"},

Provision of PMDs is complex, with cognitive functioning expressed by clinicians as a major concern. Even if PMD use can be predicted by the level of cognitive functioning, outcome tools used to assess readiness do not consider how cognitive functioning may affect PMD use. OBJECTIVE The specific aims of this review are to identify existing assessments used to assess cognitive functioning and PMD use, classify cognitive functions that are identified within existing assessments related to PMD use, and explore the relationships between cognitive functioning (ie, executive functions and attention) and PMD use. METHODS A systematic review will be conducted using the electronic databases MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO (Ovid), and Web of Science based on the concepts of PMD performance and capacity, and cognitive functioning. To be included, studies must have: a sample of PMD users (inclusive of age and diagnoses), an assessment of cognitive functioning, and an assessment of PMD capacity or performance. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health will be used to classify cognitive functions. Study quality will be assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Qualitative and quantitative studies will be analyzed in a complementary manner depending on their designs; a result-based convergent synthesis design will be applied. RESULTS This proposed systematic review protocol has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42019118957). It was funded by the Quebec Rehabilitation Research Network and approved on February 2019. CONCLUSIONS Results will inform the development of a PMD driving program that aims to enhance cognition. The results of this study will enhance understanding of the influence of cognitive functioning on PMD use and will support the clinical practice in choosing appropriate evaluative tools.

The recent emergence of the SARS coronavirus in the human population in 2003, with an ensuing global epidemic affecting more than 8000 individuals with a case fatality of about 10%, underlines the fact that respiratory viral infections of humans may originate in animals, and that many different influenza A viruses also occur naturally in animal reservoirs, representing a constant threat of zoonotic infections of humans and ensuing global pandemics. Avian influenza viruses have transmitted directly to humans from domestic poultry on several occasions in the last decade, and the current extensive burden of disease from avian influenza in South East Asia provides a real possibility for the emergence of a novel influenza virus pathogenic in humans.","publish_time":"2005-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zambon, Maria","journal":"Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/097faaef716ef7e6fcee71d705b273246d4b0f6f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1357303906002015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1357303906002015","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","SARS"],"locations":["South East Asia"],"keyphrases":["different influenza","control of influenza","Avian influenza viruses","human influenza strains","respiratory viral infections of humans","global burden of disease","novel influenza virus pathogenic","greatest disease burden","constant threat of zoonotic infections of humans","acute LRTIs","respiratory syncytial virus","current extensive burden of disease","global pandemics","ensuing global epidemic","Abstract Acute lower respiratory tract infections","antiviral drugs","use of neuraminidase inhibitor drugs","RSV infection","recent emergence","human population","South East Asia","real possibility","SARS coronavirus","options","major worldwide health problem","animal reservoirs","individuals","decade","occasions","successful vaccines","origin","animals","fact","childhood","domestic poultry","Vaccination","case fatality","conditions"],"language":"en"},

While it has been suggested that ARBs might lead to a higher susceptibility and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, experimental data suggest that ARBs may reduce acute lung injury via blocking angiotensin-II-mediated pulmonary permeability, inflammation and fibrosis. However, despite these hypotheses, specific studies on ARBs in SARS-CoV-2 patients are lacking. Methods The PRAETORIAN-COVID trial is a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled 1:1 randomized clinical trial in adult hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-infected patients (n=651). The primary aim is to investigate the effect of the ARB valsartan compared to placebo on the composite endpoint of admission to an intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation or death, within 14 days of randomization. The active-treatment arm will receive valsartan in a dosage titrated to blood pressure up to a maximum of 160mg b.i.d. and the placebo arm will receive matching placebo. Treatment duration will be 14 days; or until the occurrence of the primary endpoint, or until hospital discharge, if either of these occurs within 14 days. The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04335786, 2020). Summary The PRAETORIAN-COVID trial is a double-blind, placebo-controlled 1:1 randomized trial to assess the effect of valsartan compared to placebo on the occurrence of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation and death in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The results of this study might impact the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients globally.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gommans, D. H.

However, on March 26th the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), along with other leading medical organizations, released a joint statement warning clinicians that attempting this technique could lead to poor outcomes and high mortality. Nevertheless, several hospitals around the United States and abroad are turning to this technique out of desperation (e.g. New York), but little data exists to guide their approach. The overall objective of this study is to utilize a computational model of mechanically ventilated lungs to assess how patient-specific lung mechanics and ventilator settings impact lung tidal volume (Vt). Methods: We developed a single compartment computational model of four patients connected to a shared ventilator and validated it against a similar experimental study. We used this model to evaluate how patient-specific lung compliance (C) and resistance (R) would impact Vt under 5 ventilator settings of pre-set PIP, PEEP, and I:E ratio (suggested by Farkas, J.D. MD as an approach by hospitals to manage multiple patients on a single ventilator). Results: Our computational model predicts Vt within 10% of experimental measurements. Using this model to perform a parametric study, we provide proof-of-concept for an algorithm to better match patients in different hypothetical scenarios of a single ventilator shared by more than one patient. Conclusions: Assigning patients to pre-set ventilators based on their lung mechanics could be used to overcome some of the legitimate concerns of placing multiple patients on a single ventilator. We emphasize that our results are currently based on a computational model that has not been validated against any pre-clinical/clinical data. Therefore, clinicians considering this approach should not look to our study as an exact estimate of predicted patient tidal volumes.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kheyfets, V.

Abstract Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a great impact on healthcare systems. Spain, where headache is the main reason for outpatient neurology consultation, is one of the countries with the most reported cases of the disease. Objectives: This study aimed to analyse the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on headache units in Spain and to evaluate how neurologists see the future of these units. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of headache units during the sixth week of the state of alarm declared in Spain in response to the pandemic. Results: The response rate was 74%, with the participation of centres with different characteristics and from all Autonomous Communities of Spain. Limitations in face-to-face activity were reported by 95.8% of centres, with preferential face-to-face consultation being maintained in 60.4%, and urgent procedures in 45.8%. In 91.7% of centres, the cancelled face-to-face activity was replaced by telephone consultation. 95.8% of respondents stated that they would use personal protection equipment in the future, and 86% intended to increase the use of telemedicine. The majority foresaw an increase in waiting lists (93.8% for initial consultations, 89.6% for follow-up, and 89.4% for procedures) and a worse clinical situation for patients, but only 15% believed that their healthcare structures would be negatively affected in the future. Conclusions: As a consequence of the pandemic, headache care and research activity has reduced considerably. This demonstrates the need for an increase in the availability of telemedicine in our centres in the near future.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"L\u00F3pez-Bravo, Alba; Garc\u00EDa-Azor\u00EDn, David; Belv\u00EDs, Roberto; Gonz\u00E1lez-Oria, Carmen; Latorre, Germ\u00E1n; Santos-Lasaosa, Sonia; Guerrero-Peral, \u00C1ngel Luis","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e11cdf3d11f8969fe33c47ecda398f4f913d7a59.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213485320301079; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213485320301079?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Resumen","Objetivo","Estudio","Resultados"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["en procedimientos","incremento en","en revisiones y","telemedicina en nuestros centros en","protecci\u00F3n personal en","en primeras visitas","describi\u00F3 limitaciones en","los centros","consulta ambulatoria en Neurolog\u00EDa","los responsables","enorme impacto en los sistemas sanitarios","futuro y","los pa\u00EDses","los pacientes","Cefaleas en Espa\u00F1a y evaluar c\u00F3mo imaginan","pandemic","pretende incorporar en mayor medida","los procedimientos urgentes","actividad asistencial e investigadora en cefaleas se ha reducido","consulta presencial preferente y","increase","diferentes caracter\u00EDsticas y","estas estructuras los neur\u00F3logos responsables","pandemia COVID","headache care","participation of centres","near future","los encuestados afirm\u00F3 que emplear\u00E1 material","cancelled face-to-face activity","preferential face-to-face consultation","cross-sectional online survey of headache units","actividad presencial cancelada se sustituy\u00F3 por consulta telef\u00F3nica","y una peor situaci\u00F3n cl\u00EDnica","futuro cercano","telephone consultation","research activity","Autonomous Communities of Spain","use of telemedicine","outpatient neurology consultation","ha tenido","cree que su estructura asistencial se ver\u00E1 debilitada","great impact","availability of telemedicine","healthcare systems","response rate","reported cases","urgent procedures","healthcare structures","personal protection equipment","infecci\u00F3n por SARS-CoV","Estudio transversal mediante encuesta online distribuida","es uno","motivo principal","pero s\u00F3lo","oferta","cefalea constituye","realizada durante","sexta semana","todas","listas","espera","mantuvo","main reason","manera notable","necesidad","M\u00E9todos","donde","different characteristics","m\u00E1s casos notificados","participaci\u00F3n","Comunidades Aut\u00F3nomas","worse clinical situation","manifiesto","Resumen Introducci\u00F3n","lists","week","Conocer","consequence","mayor\u00EDa prev\u00E9","respuesta fue","Como consecuencia","state of alarm","Resultados","tasa","initial consultations","Esto pone","patients","Alarma","follow-up","Conclusiones","countries","neurologists","Abstract Introduction","disease","Results","study","Objetivo","Methods","majority","need","Limitations","Objectives","Conclusions","respondents"],"language":"en"},

We aim at investigating the sociodemographic and environmental determinants of wellbeing during global lockdown due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: A nationwide survey was sent online to the French population during the second week of global lockdown during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, between March 25, 2020 and March 30, 2020. Volunteers were recruited on social networks, online newspapers, and mailing lists. We analyzed sociodemographic and environmental variables obtained from a co-built and evidence-based questionnaire. Mental wellbeing was measured by the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS). Results: We analyzed data from 11,391 (56.6%) out of 20,235 participants who answered the questionnaire. After weighting data on age and gender distributions, 5415 of the respondents were male (47.5%), 5932 were female (52.1%), and 52 (0.5%) registered as other. Multivariate analyses indicated that various factors impacted mental wellbeing. Being female (p \u003C .001), a student (p \u003C .001), disabled (p = .001), or having no access to outdoor space (p = 0.02) was associated with lower WEMWBS scores. Conversely, being employed (p \u003C .001) and having more social contacts (p \u003C .01) were both associated with greater mental wellbeing.

Importantly, the monomeric and dimeric forms of FAN1 exhibit very different DNA binding modes. Here, we interrogate the functional differences between monomeric and dimeric forms of FAN1 and provide an explanation for the discrepancy in oligomeric state between the two hFAN1 structures. Specifically, we show that the flexible loop in question is needed for hFAN1 dimerization. While monomeric and dimeric bacterial or human FAN1 proteins cleave a short 5\u2019 flap strand with similar efficiency, optimal cleavage of a long 5\u2019 flap strand is contingent upon protein dimerization.

The 3C-like protease (3CLpro), a highly conserved protease indispensable for replication of coronaviruses, is a promising target for development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. To advance the speed of drug discovery and development, we investigated the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro by natural products derived from Chinese traditional medicines. Baicalin and baicalein were identified as the first non-covalent, non-peptidomimetic inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and exhibited potent antiviral activities in a cell-based system. Remarkably, the binding mode of baicalein with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro determined by X-ray protein crystallography is distinctly different from those of known inhibitors. Baicalein is perfectly ensconced in the core of the substrate-binding pocket by interacting with two catalytic residues, the crucial S1/S2 subsites and the oxyanion loop, acting as a \u201Cshield\u201D in front of the catalytic dyad to prevent the peptide substrate approaching the active site. The simple chemical structure, unique mode of action, and potent antiviral activities in vitro, coupled with the favorable safety data from clinical trials, emphasize that baicalein provides a great opportunity for the development of critically needed anti-coronaviral drugs.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Su, Haixia; Yao, Sheng; Zhao, Wenfeng; Li, Minjun; Liu, Jia; Shang, WeiJuan; Xie, Hang; Ke, Changqiang; Gao, Meina; Yu, Kunqian; Liu, Hong; Shen, Jingshan; Tang, Wei; Zhang, Leike; Zuo, Jianping; Jiang, Hualiang; Bai, Fang; Wu, Yan; Ye, Yang; Xu, Yechun","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/834c9f01bfe24ff36355dc80462859c4fb9780fc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.038687","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","CLpro","binding mode of baicalein","inhibition of SARS","potent antiviral activities","non-peptidomimetic inhibitors of SARS","development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs","substrate-binding pocket","catalytic residues","peptide substrate","catalytic dyad","known inhibitors","unique mode of action","cause coronavirus disease","conserved protease indispensable","anti-coronaviral drugs","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","promising target","S2 subsites","Human infections","crucial S1","replication of coronaviruses","natural products","clinical trials","simple chemical structure","favorable safety data","Chinese traditional medicines","oxyanion loop","X-ray protein crystallography","cell-based system","core","active site","COVID","speed of drug discovery","great opportunity","shield","Baicalin","cure"],"language":"en"},

We examined the effect of these interventions and behavioral changes on the incidence of COVID-19 as well as on influenza virus infections which may share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID-19. Methods: We reviewed policy interventions and measured changes in population behaviours through two telephone surveys, on January 20-23 and February 11-14. We analysed data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children. We estimated the daily effective reproduction number (R_t), for COVID-19 and influenza A(H1N1). Findings: COVID-19 transmissibility has remained at or below 1, indicating successful containment to date. Influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late January, with a 44% (95% confidence interval, CI: 34% to 53%) reduction in transmissibility in the community, and a 33% (95% CI: 24% to 43%) reduction in transmissibility based on paediatric hospitalization rates. In the two surveys we estimated that 74.5% and 97.5% of the general adult population wore masks when going out, and 61.3% and 90.2% avoided going to crowded places, respectively. Implications: Containment measures, social distancing measures and changes in population behaviour have successfully prevented spread of COVID-19. The social distancing measures and behavioural changes led to a substantial reduction in influenza transmission in early February 2020. However, it may be challenging to avoid fatigue and sustain these measures and population behaviours as COVID-19 continues to spread globally.

For this response to be most effective, it must reflect an evidence-based, pan-Canadian response. We designed four different prototypical patients with a combination of common COVID-19 symptoms and opportunities for exposure who were made to self-assess using the 10 provincial COVID-19 self-assessment tools on 1 April. These tools were developed to allow individuals to self-triage, allowing health systems direct capacity to testing and care. We assessed the consistency of the self-assessment tools and of the guidance provided to the patients. While the tools generally screen in three areas, the scope of included COVID-19 associated symptoms as well as the opportunities for exposure, and therefore transmission, vary between provinces such that no two provinces screened in the same way. This was, in turn, reflected in the inconsistency in guidance found. A patient with cough who had travelled abroad or had close contact with a confirmed case within 14 days received the most consistent guidance, with remaining patients receiving guidance ranging from mandatory quarantine or self-isolation to being told they did not have COVID-19 symptoms, guidance at odds with medical evidence. Thus, there is not a single, evidence-based Canadian standard of care simply for self-assessment. Without consistency in public health guidance, Canadians cannot appropriately self-isolate to mitigate community transmission, nor can the necessary valid and reliable data be collected to inform critical epidemiological models that help guide pandemic response. If federal and provincial governments are unable to coordinate a response, Parliament must use its available jurisdiction to legislate a duty on both to follow national standards, so as to improve coordination on COVID-19 in coming months.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Olibris, B.; Attaran, A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c1296d42263ec26744a49033bd602a82387b4ff.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.14.20065631v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Parliament"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["self-assessment tools","self-triage","self-isolation","consistent guidance","provincial COVID","public health guidance","pandemic response","provinces","pan-Canadian response","combination of common COVID","scope of included COVID","reduced risk response","associated symptoms","remaining patients","opportunities","medical evidence","exposure","health systems direct capacity","Canadian standard of care","different prototypical patients","community transmission","provincial governments","Canadians","mandatory quarantine","critical epidemiological models","reliable data","duty","confirmed case","Parliament","days","areas","Canada","odds","individuals","available jurisdiction","close contact","coordination","national standards","coming months","inconsistency","SARS-CoV","cough","turn","way"],"language":"en"},

A common question is if and when a country or region will reach herd immunity h. The classical herd immunity level hC is defined as hC=1-1/R0, where R0 is the basic reproduction number, for covid-19 estimated to lie somewhere in the range 2.2-3.5 depending on country and region. It is shown here that the disease-induced herd immunity level hD, after an outbreak has taken place in a country/region with a set of preventive measures put in place, is actually substantially smaller than hC. As an illustration we show that if R0=2.5 in an age-structured community with mixing rates fitted to social activity studies, and also categorizing individuals into three categories: low active, average active and high active, and where preventive measures affect all mixing rates proportionally, then the disease-induced herd immunity level is hD=43% rather than hC=1-1/2.5=60%. Consequently, a lower fraction infected is required for herd immunity to appear. The underlying reason is that when immunity is induced by disease spreading, the proportion infected in groups with high contact rates is greater than that in groups with low contact rates. Consequently, disease-induced immunity is stronger than when immunity is uniformly distributed in the community as in the classical herd immunity level.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Britton, T.; Trapman, P.; Ball, F.

The COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented threat to the health and economic prosperity of the world\u0027s population.

This research aims to understand whether the outbreak varies significantly between U.S. states and counties. Methods. A statistical model is estimated using publicly available outbreak data in the U.S., and regional differences are statistically analyzed. Results. There is significant variance in outbreak data between U.S. states and counties. At the state level, the outbreak rate follows a normal distribution with an average relative growth rate of 0.197 (doubling time 3.518 days). But there is a low degree of reliability between state-wide and county-specific data reported (ICC = 0.169, p \u003C 0.001), with a bias of 0.070 (standard deviation 0.062) as shown with a Bland-Altman plot. Conclusions. The results emphasize the need for policy makers to look at the pandemic from the smallest population subdivision possible, so that countermeasures can be implemented, and critical resources provided effectively. Further research is needed to understand the reasons for these regional differences.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Messner, Wolfgang; Payson, Sarah E","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0bbb15a89f51d158810412388d883c644c096aaf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.23.20076943v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bland"],"organizations":[],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["outbreak rate","available outbreak data","pandemic","states","counties","regional differences","Results","research","county-specific data","world\u0027s population","average relative growth rate","smallest population subdivision possible","normal distribution","economic prosperity","health","unprecedented threat","doubling time","low degree of reliability","countermeasures","ICC","policy makers","significant variance","country","need","state level","reasons","statistical model","Bland-Altman plot","bias","standard deviation","countries","regions","days","COVID","different ways","critical resources","Methods","Conclusions","Background","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

As of May 8th, 2020, more than half of the world is in lockdown, 3.6 million people have been infected, and over 250,000 of them have died. This is the first pandemic in human history that has been tracked on a daily basis across the world. Currently, progress is being tracked by a series of metrics, including new cases, deaths, and the effective reproduction number over time (R(t)), which epidemiologists have emphasized. While it is an important measure, R(t) is not observable and is dependent on the absolute number of active cases; therefore, two geographies could have a similar R(t) but be having very different experiences. Here, we propose a metric to monitor progress on addressing the COVID pandemic that we name \u0022progress to zero\u0022 or P0. P0 corresponds to the percentage decline from a previously recorded peak level. The metric ranges from 0% (representing a geography that has not yet peaked) to 100% (representing a geography wherein 0 cases have been recorded for at least seven days). Our metric helps leaders focus on progress to a desired goal, easily can be tracked over time, can quickly identify retreat from progress, and is comparable across geographies regardless of their size.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lavista Ferres, J.

Consequently, key epidemiological parameters may vary from country to country. Confirmed COVID-19 cases in in China have been used to estimate those parameters, that vary largely (reviewed in 1). The estimates also depend on testing frequency and case definitions that are prone to change during ongoing epidemics, providing additional uncertainties. The rise in fatal cases due to SARS-CoV2 could be a more reliable parameter, since missing of deaths is less likely. In the absence of changes in the management of severe COVID-19 cases, the rise in death cases should be proportional to the rise in virus infections. Although the fluctuating low numbers of fatal cases very early in the epidemic may lead to some uncertainty, more than 100 deaths per day are reported since 10.03.2020 in Italy and since 21.03.2020 in the US. Therefore, the dynamics of deaths were analysed to estimate the daily reproduction numbers (Rt) and the effectiveness of control measures. Thus, our analysis provides evidence that basic epidemiological parameters differ between countries to an extent compromising epidemiological predictions of the pandemic. It also suggests that suppression of spread in Italy and the US may be more difficult to achieve. Although we assume that variations in social behaviour are responsible for the different estimates of R0, selection of more rapidly spreading variants of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be excluded. Despite uncertainty in the reliability of the data used and lack of information on possible changes in the effectiveness of registration of COVID-19 deaths during the observation period, our findings should be considered as a working hypothesis demanding further investigations. As the number of deaths rapidly increases worldwide, we encourage more sophisticated modelling of the epidemic based on the dynamics of death cases by experts in the field.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ensser, Armin; Ueberla, Klaus","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.28.20046094","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["dynamics of deaths","dynamics of death cases","rise","number of deaths","fluctuating low numbers of fatal cases","basic epidemiological parameters","key epidemiological parameters","epidemiological predictions","Confirmed COVID","country","Italy","uncertainty","management of severe COVID","possible changes","effectiveness of registration","social behaviour","absence of changes","SARS-CoV2","variants of SARS","spread of pathogens","different estimates of R0","daily reproduction numbers","effectiveness of control measures","countries","cultural habits","lack of information","extent","testing frequency","ongoing epidemics","case definitions","data","selection","Population density","analysis","evidence","experts","observation period","additional uncertainties","findings","reliability","variations","pandemic","virus infections","reliable parameter","field","working hypothesis","investigations","sophisticated modelling","day","China","suppression"],"language":"en"},

We studied the exponential phase of the pandemic in Italy, Spain, and South Korea, and found the R0 to be 2.56 (95% CrI, 2.41-2.71), 3.23 (95% CrI, 3.06-3.4), and 2.36 (95% CrI, 2.22-2.5) if we use Bayesian priors that assume a large portion of cases are not detected. Weaker priors regarding the detection rate resulted in R0 values of 9.22 (95% CrI, 9.01-9.43), 9.14 (95% CrI, 8.99-9.29), and 8.06 (95% CrI, 7.82-8.3) and assumes nearly 90% of infected patients are identified. Given the mounting evidence that potentially large fractions of the population are asymptomatic, the weaker priors that generate the high R0 values to fit the data required assumptions about the epidemiology of COVID-19 that do not fit with the biology, particularly regarding the timeframe that people remain infectious. Our results suggest that models of transmission assuming a relatively lower R0 value that do not consider a large number of asymptomatic cases can result in misunderstanding of the underlying dynamics, leading to poor policy decisions and outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Gary; Strauss, Alexandra T; Pinz, Maxwell; Martinez, Diego A; Tseng, Katie K; Schueller, Emily; Gatalo, Oliver; Yang, Yupeng; Levin, Simon A; Klein, Eili Y","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c5269a7c32a9fd92159d03dc22de1545fcfeb803.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054338","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["CrI","large number of asymptomatic cases","large portion of cases","transmission of asymptomatic","Weaker priors","Bayesian priors","mild cases","high R0 values","lower R0 value","large fractions","models of transmission","Bayesian approach","exponential phase","epidemiology of COVID","beginning of pandemic events","behavior of exponential growth","lower prevalence of testing","Italy","bomb","data","detection rate","population","poor policy decisions","epidemiological compartmental modeling","underlying dynamics","Spain","South Korea","assumptions","misunderstanding","timeframe","outcomes","mounting evidence","people","results","infected patients","biology"],"language":"en"},

However, some governments are allegedly manipulating social media by hiring online commentators (also known as trolls) to spread propaganda and disinformation. In particular, an alleged system of professional trolls operating both domestically and internationally exists in Russia. In 2018, Twitter released data on accounts identified as Russian trolls, starting a wave of research. However, while foreign-targeted English language operations of these trolls have received significant attention, no research has analyzed their Russian language domestic and regional-targeted activities. We address this gap by characterizing the Russian-language operations of Russian trolls. We first perform a descriptive analysis, and then focus in on the trolls\u0027 operation related to the crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. Among other things, we find that Russian-language trolls have run 163 hashtag campaigns (where hashtag use grows abruptly within a month). The main political sentiments of such campaigns were praising Russia and Putin (29%), criticizing Ukraine (26%), and criticizing the United States and Obama (9%). Further, trolls actively reshared information with 76% of tweets being retweets or containing a URL. Additionally, we observe periodic temporal patterns of tweeting suggesting that trolls use automation tools. Further, we find that trolls\u0027 information campaign on the MH17 crash was the largest in terms of tweet count. However, around 68% of tweets posted with MH17 hashtags were likely used simply for hashtag amplification. With these tweets excluded, about 49% of the tweets suggested to varying levels that Ukraine was responsible for the crash, and only 13% contained disinformation and propaganda presented as news.

Application of DL to CT images may improve both the efficiency and capacity of case detection and long-term surveillance.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, B.; Liu, P.; Dai, L.; Yang, Y.; Xie, P.; Tan, Y.; Du, J.; Shan, W.; Zhao, C.; Zhong, Q.; Lin, X.; Guan, X.; Xing, N.; Sun, Y.; Wang, W.; Zhang, Z.; Fu, X.; Fan, Y.; Li, M.; Zhang, N.; Li, L.; Liu, Y.; Xu, L.; Zhao, Z.; Hu, X.; Fan, W.; Wang, R.; Wu, C.; Nie, Y.; Cheng, L.; Ma, L.; Li, Z.; Jia, Q.; Liu, M.; Guo, H.; Huang, G.; Shen, H.; An, W.; Li, H.; Zhou, J.; He, K.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.11.20093732v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-COVID","D CT images","COVIDNet","application of deep learning","prompt large-scale application","rRT-PCR","pneumonia patients","Case identification","capacity of case detection","real-time reverse transcription PCR","chest computed tomography","abnormalities","manifests","efficiency","reference method","modified DenseNet","limitations","long-term surveillance","assays","model","area","hypothesis","pandemic of coronavirus Disease","enormous loss of life","accuracy rate","curve","AUC","independent set","class","onset of symptoms","infections","data"],"language":"en"},

In this study we aimed to determine seropositivity of COVID-19 virus infection in population of a highly affected area in north of Iran. Methods: In a population-based cluster random sampling design through phone call invitation, a total of 196 household including 552 subjects agreed to participate in this study. Each participant were taken 50ml blood sample at health care center. Rapid test kits were used to detect antibody against COVID-19. Crude, population-weight adjusted and test performance adjusted prevalence of antibody seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2 were reported. Results: The prevalence of antibody seropositivity was 0.22 (95%CI: 0.19-0.26). The population weight adjusted estimate was 0.21 (95%CI: 0.14-0.29) and test performance adjusted prevalence was 0.33 (95%CI: 0.28-0.39). Based on these estimates the range of infected people in this province would be between 518000 and 777000.

Given the recent and rapid emergence of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cause of COVID-19 disease, viral protein variants have attracted research interest. However, little has yet been written about genetic risk factors among human hosts. Human genetic variation has proven to affect disease progression and outcome for important diseases such as HIV infection and malaria infestation. The fact that the human ACE2 protein is encoded on the X chromosome means that males who carry rare ACE2 coding variants will express those variants in all ACE2-expressing cells, whereas females will typically express those variants in a mosaic distribution determined by early X-inactivation events. This sex-based difference in ACE2 expression has unique implications for epidemiological studies designed to assess host genetic factors influencing progression from asymptomatic SARS-coV-2 infection to COVID-19. Here we present theoretical modelling of rare ACE2 coding variants documented to occur naturally in several human superpopulations and subpopulations, and show that rare variants predicted to affect the binding of ACE2 to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein exist in people. Though the rs4646116 (p.Lys26Arg) allele is found in 1 in 70 Ashkenazi Jewish males, and in 1 in 172 non-Finnish European males, this allele is found at higher frequencies in females. Furthermore, the class of missense ACE2 alleles predicted to affect SARS-CoV-2 binding are found in aggregate among 1.43% and 2.16% of Ashkenazi males and females, respectively, as well as in 0.58% and 1.24% of European males and females outside of Finland. These alleles are rarer in other population groups, and almost absent from East Asians genotyped to date. Though we are aware that full genome-wide and exome-wide sequencing studies may ultimately be required to assess human genetic susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 fully, we argue on the basis of strong prior probabilities that genotyping of this class of alleles is justified in cases of atypical SARS-CoV-2 diseases, such as asymptomatic super-spreaders (if any are identified), and in neonatal/paediatric-onset COVID-19 disease. Even relatively rare susceptibility factors (1% or fewer carriers) may become quantitatively important in the context of hundreds of thousands of infections. A small number of asymptomatic carriers, or a small number of super-spreaders, or a small segment of the population that is disproportionately likely to require intensive care, can magnify the medical, social and economic impacts of a pandemic of this size. The speed of the pandemic and the large number of affected cases worldwide justify efforts to identify all possible risk factors for adverse outcomes, including efforts to identify genetic susceptibility factors in human hosts.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gibson, William T.; Evans, Daniel M; An, Jianghong; Jones, Steven JM","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f0ae1368238df2fe1a040c098f25181484611f1f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.026633","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Finland","East Asians"],"keyphrases":["rare variants","human ACE2 protein","asymptomatic SARS-coV","Viral genetic variants","human genetic susceptibility","genetic susceptibility factors","binding of ACE2","genetic risk factors","Human genetic variation","ACE2 expression","host genetic factors","rare susceptibility factors","viral protein variants","human hosts","females","cases of atypical SARS-CoV","theoretical modelling of rare ACE2 coding variants","disease progression","Ashkenazi males","human superpopulations","rapid emergence of pandemic SARS-CoV","class of missense ACE2 alleles","small number of asymptomatic carriers","possible risk factors","Ashkenazi Jewish males","small number of super-spreaders","class of alleles","asymptomatic super-spreaders","non-Finnish European males","efforts","important diseases","HIV infection","spike protein","small segment","cause of COVID","large number of affected cases","paediatric-onset COVID","epidemiological studies","exome-wide sequencing studies","genome-wide","X chromosome","population groups","fewer carriers","early X-inactivation events","unique implications","adverse outcomes","sex-based difference","economic impacts","mosaic distribution","context of hundreds","subpopulations","East Asians","basis of strong prior probabilities","malaria infestation","intensive care","thousands of infections","date","rs4646116","Lys26Arg","higher frequencies","infected humans","Finland","research","cells","size","speed","people","aggregate"],"language":"en"},

Different countries have tried to control its spread by applying the basic principles of social distancing and testing. Healthcare professionals have been the frontline workers globally with different opinions regarding the preparation and management of this pandemic. We aim to get the opinion of Healthcare professionals in United Kingdom regarding their perceptions of preparedness in their workplace and general views of current pandemic management strategy. Method A questionnaire survey, drafted using Google Forms, was distributed among Healthcare professionals working in the National Health Service (NHS) across the United Kingdom. The study was kept open for the first 2 weeks of April 2020. Results A total of 1007 responses were obtained with majority of the responses from England (n=850, 84.40 %). There were 670 (66.53%) responses from doctors and 204 (20.26%) from nurses. Most of the respondents (95.23%) had direct patient contact in day to day activity. Only one third of the respondents agreed that they felt supported at their trust and half of the respondents reported that adequate training was provided to the frontline staff. Two-thirds of the respondents were of the view that there was not enough Personal Protective Equipment available while 80% thought that this pandemic has improved their hand washing practice. Most of the respondents were in the favour of an earlier lockdown (90%) and testing all the NHS frontline staff (94%). Conclusion Despite current efforts, it would seem this is not translating to a sense of security amongst the UK NHS workforce in terms of how they feel trained and protected. It is vital that Healthcare professionals have adequate support and protection at their workplace and that these aspects be actively monitored.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Iqbal, Muhammad Rafaih; Chaudhuri, Arindam","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f1508cc4e102910a45d7d4ca82a01bc0bd52dd78.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1743919120304258; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1743919120304258?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare","Google Forms","National Health Service","NHS","UK NHS"],"locations":["United Kingdom","England"],"keyphrases":["respondents","opinion of Healthcare professionals","responses","NHS frontline staff","global healthcare crisis","workplace","United Kingdom","day activity","frontline workers","testing","general views of current pandemic management strategy","UK NHS workforce","adequate support","adequate training","different opinions","current efforts","Different countries","increasing number of people","perceptions of preparedness","direct patient contact","National Health Service","protection","basic principles of social distancing","Google Forms","questionnaire survey","terms","half","preparation","sense of security","Personal Protective Equipment available","spread","England","hand washing practice","favour","trust","majority","Abstract Objective COVID","earlier lockdown","Method","Conclusion","aspects","total","doctors","thirds","study","weeks","nurses"],"language":"en"},

The disease progression associated with the pro-inflammatory host response prompted us to examine the role of early corticosteroid therapy in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a single pre-test, single post-test quasi-experiment in a multi-center health system in Michigan from March 12 to March 27, 2020. Adult patients with confirmed moderate to severe COVID were included. A protocol was implemented on March 20, 2020 using early, short-course, methylprednisolone 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day divided in 2 intravenous doses for 3 days. Outcomes of pre- and post-corticosteroid groups were evaluated. A composite endpoint of escalation of care from ward to ICU, new requirement for mechanical ventilation, and mortality was the primary outcome measure. All patients had at least 14 days of follow-up. Results: We analyzed 213 eligible subjects, 81 (38%) and 132 (62%) in pre-and post-corticosteroid groups, respectively. The composite endpoint occurred at a significantly lower rate in post-corticosteroid group compared to pre-corticosteroid group (34.9% vs. 54.3%, p=0.005). This treatment effect was observed within each individual component of the composite endpoint. Significant reduction in median hospital length of stay was observed in the post-corticosteroid group (8 vs. 5 days, p \u003C 0.001).

For individuals, information can help us make personal decisions and provide a sense of security. For the global community, information can inform policy decisions and offer critical insights into the epidemic of COVID-19 disease. Fully leveraging the power of information, however, requires large amounts of data and access to it. To achieve this, we are making steps to form an international consortium, Coronavirus Census Collective (CCC, coronaviruscensuscollective.org), that will serve as a hub for integrating information from multiple data sources that can be utilized to understand, monitor, predict, and combat global pandemics. These sources may include self-reported health status through surveys (including mobile apps), results of diagnostic laboratory tests, and other static and real-time geospatial data. This collective effort to track and share information will be invaluable in predicting hotspots of disease outbreak, identifying which factors control the rate of spreading, informing immediate policy decisions, evaluating the effectiveness of measures taken by health organizations on pandemic control, and providing critical insight on the etiology of COVID-19. It will also help individuals stay informed on this rapidly evolving situation and contribute to other global efforts to slow the spread of disease. In the past few weeks, several initiatives across the globe have surfaced to use daily self-reported symptoms as a means to track disease spread, predict outbreak locations, guide population measures and help in the allocation of healthcare resources.

This paper presents a simple theoretical model focussed on the implications of the wide range in interaction rates between individuals, both within the workplace and in the social setting. The model is based on well-mixed populations and so is not intended for studying geographic spread. The model shows that epidemic growth rate is largely determined by the upper interactivity quantiles of society, implying that the most efficient methods of epidemic control are interaction capping approaches rather than overall reductions in interaction. The theoretical model can also be applied to look at the dynamics of epidemic progression under various scenarios. The theoretical model suggests that with no intervention herd immunity would be achieved with a lower overall infection rate than if variation in interaction rate is ignored, because by this stage almost all the most interactive members of society would have had the infection; however the overall mortality with such an approach is very high. Scenarios for mitigation and suppression suggest that, by using interactivity capping, it should be possible to control an epidemic without extreme sanctions on the majority of the population if R0 of the uncontrolled infection is 2.4. However to control the infection rate to a specific level will always require the switching on and off of measures and for this reason eradication is likely to be a less costly policy in the long run. While social distancing alone can be used for eradication it is not be a good mechanism on its own to prevent reinfection. The use of robust testing, quarantining, and contact tracing would strengthen any social distancing measures, speed up eradication, and be a better tool for prevention of infection or reinfection.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bronk Ramsey, Christopher","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ea70d7e53b34b0fcca1057b534e9ddc95b2b2f96.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.11.20062042","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lower overall infection rate","epidemic growth rate","prevention of infection","uncontrolled infection","social distancing measures","simple theoretical model","interaction rates","social setting","efficient methods of epidemic control","dynamics of epidemic progression","overall reductions","overall mortality","reason eradication","interactivity capping","reinfection","various scenarios","upper interactivity quantiles of society","interactive members of society","contact tracing","implications","approaches","variation","quarantining","majority","individuals","wide range","better tool","costly policy","use of robust testing","extreme sanctions","R0","important measure","specific level","intervention herd immunity","long run","switching","workplace","suppression","well-mixed populations","paper","stage","epidemics","mitigation","good mechanism","geographic spread"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Introduction In the context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, the detection of virus-specific antibodies (AB) will play an increasing role. The presence or absence of such antibodies can potentially lead to considerations regarding immunity and infection. Issue How reliable are inferences from positive or negative test results regarding the actual presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies? Methods Calculation of the probability that, depending on the pretest probability (prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection) and test properties, antibodies are present or absent in the case of positive or negative test results. Results Sensitivity and specificity of different SARS-CoV-2 AB test systems vary between 53 % and 94 % and between 91 % and 99.5 %, respectively. When using a test with high test quality, the positive predictive value (PPV) is 42 % and 7 9%, respectively, with a pre-test probability of 1 % to 5 %, as can currently be assumed for the general population in Austria or Germany. For persons with an increased pre-test probability of 20 %, e. g. persons from high-risk professions, the PPW is 95 %, with a pre-test probability of 80 % the PPW is almost 100 %. The negative predictive value (NPV) is at least 99.7 % for persons with a low pre-test probability of up to 5 % and 79.1 % for persons with a pre-test probability of 80 %. When using test systems with lower sensitivity and specificity, the reliability of the results decreases considerably. The PPV is 5.9 % with a pre-test probability of 1 %. Conclusions A sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity are prerequisites for the application of antibody test systems. Positive test results are often false if the pre-test probability is low. Depending on the assumed prevalence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, there are substantial differences in the significance of a concrete test result for the respective affected persons.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Horvath, Karl; Semlitsch, Thomas; Jeitler, Klaus; Krause, Robert; Siebenhofer, Andrea","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d2a63b2f20b83de9e6d4a722463668115fae1e1b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1865921720300490; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1865921720300490","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Deutschland","Germany"],"keyphrases":["CoV","the detection of virus","prevalence of SARS","test probability of up to","and test properties","the case of positive or negative test results","the reliability of the results decreases considerably","The PPV is","test with high test quality","Methods Calculation of the probability that","the PPW is almost","Results Sensitivity and specificity of different SARS","the positive predictive value","the context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","The negative predictive value","and between","sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity are prerequisites for the application of antibody test systems","For persons with","depending on the pretest probability","Issue How reliable are inferences from positive or negative test results regarding the actual presence of SARS","When using test systems with lower sensitivity and specificity","assumed for the general population","test systems vary between","geringer Vortestwahrscheinlichkeit","erh\u00F6hten Vortestwahrscheinlichkeit","niedrigen Vortestwahrscheinlichkeit","iger Vortestwahrscheinlichkeit","The presence or absence of such antibodies can potentially lead to considerations regarding immunity and infection","Spezifit\u00E4t unterschiedlicher SARS","low pre","increased pre","AK Testsystemen","AK vorliegen","antibodies are present or","persons from high","positive Testresultate","specific antibodies","positive Vorhersagewert","is at","negativen AK Testresultaten","Anwendung","betroffenen Personen","Austria or Germany","AK Testsysteme variieren","negative pr\u00E4diktive Wert","geringerer Sensitivit\u00E4t","Ergebnisse Sensitivit\u00E4t","Infektion zeigen","negativen Testresultaten","Antik\u00F6rpern \u00DCberlegungen","positiven","virusspezifischen Antik\u00F6rpern","respectively","ausreichend hohe Sensitivit\u00E4t","tats\u00E4chliche Vorhandensein","anzunehmenden Pr\u00E4valenz","as can currently","Schweres Akutes Respiratorisches Syndrom Coronavirus","Pandemie","Voraussetzung","risk professions","wesentliche Unterschiede","NPV","pandemic","konkreten Testresultats","Abstract Introduction","Bedeutung","Nachweis","Conclusions","Deutschland","play","Immunit\u00E4t","Schlussfolgerungen","Fehlen","hoher Testg\u00FCte","falsch","Rahmen","Zusammenfassung Hintergrund","allgemeine Bev\u00F6lkerung","\u00D6sterreich","NPW","Aussagesicherheit","wichtige Rolle","Methodik Darstellung der Wahrscheinlichkeit","increasing role","Risikoberufen","Fragestellung","Testeigenschaften","the significance of","Positive test results are often false if the pre","Depending on the assumed prevalence of","concrete test result for the respective affected persons","test probability is low","there are substantial differences","SARS","infection"],"language":"de"},

Summary The COVID-19 pandemic is changing the organization of healthcare and has a direct impact on digestive surgery. Healthcare priorities and circuits are being modified. Emergency surgery is still a priority. Functional surgery is to be deferred. Laparoscopic surgery must follow strict rules so as not to expose healthcare professionals (HCPs) to added risk. The question looms large in cancer surgery \u2013 go ahead or defer? There is probably an added risk due to the pandemic that must be balanced against the risk incurred by deferring surgery. For each type of cancer \u2013 colon, pancreas, oesogastric, hepatocellular carcinoma \u2013 morbidity and mortality rates are stated and compared with the oncological risk incurred by deferring surgery and/or the tumour doubling time. Strategies can be proposed based on this comparison. For colonic cancers T1-2, N0, it is advisable to defer surgery. For advanced colonic lesions, it seems judicious to undertake neoadjuvant chemotherapy and then wait. For rectal cancers T3\u20134 and /or N\u002B, chemoradiotherapy is indicated, short radiotherapy must be discussed (followed by a waiting period) to reduce time of exposure in the hospital and to prevent infections. Most complex surgery with high morbidity and mortality \u2013 oesogastric, hepatic or pancreatic \u2013 is most often best deferred.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tuech, J.-J.; Gangloff, A.; Di Fiore, F.; Michel, P.; Brigand, C.; Slim, K.; Pocard, M.; Schwarz, L.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/48d54c7270e31e415c8bd6f5d01345eb243e0409.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878786X20300528; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878786X20300528","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["l\u2019h\u00F4pital"],"keyphrases":["deferring surgery","digestive surgery","Functional surgery is to be deferred","it is advisable to defer surgery","to added risk","Emergency surgery is still","chirurgie oncologique","chirurgie fonctionnelles","to the pandemic that must be balanced against the risk incurred","pandemic is changing the organization","to reduce time","Summary The COVID","to prevent infections","The question looms large in cancer surgery","r\u00E9alisation de la chirurgie digestive","or the tumour doubling time","exposure in the hospital","compared with the oncological risk incurred","chemoradiotherapy is indicated","cancers coliques","Most complex surgery with high morbidity","There is probably an added risk","colonic cancers T1","is most often best deferred","cancers du rectum T3","rectal cancers T3","Laparoscopic surgery must follow strict rules so as","it seems judicious to undertake neoadjuvant chemotherapy","short radiotherapy must be discussed","oesogastric","healthcare professionals","mortalit\u00E9","hepatic or pancreatic","Healthcare priorities","N0","chaque type de cancer","circuits de soins","pand\u00E9mie","risque oncologique li\u00E9","Strategies can be proposed based","mortality rates","forte morbi","retard de prise","each type","organisation des soins","risque op\u00E9ratoire","radio-chimioth\u00E9rapie","temps de doublement","advanced colonic lesions","l\u00E9sions coliques avanc\u00E9es","followed","stated","waiting period","hepatocellular carcinoma","parall\u00E8le","mise","pancreas","HCPs","this comparison","then wait","radioth\u00E9rapie courte","h\u00E9patocarcinome","pancr\u00E9as","ahead","majorit\u00E9 des chirurgies complexes","direct impact","being modified","priority","p\u00E9riode","attente","charge chirurgical","r\u00E8gles strictes","h\u00F4pital","priorit\u00E9s sanitaires","laparoscopie","urgence reste prioritaire","strat\u00E9gies","questionnement principal","professionnels","tumeur","exposition","adjuvante","interventions","surrisque","comparaison"],"language":"fr"},

However, routinely used severity scoring systems are often low on diagnosis, even in non-survivors. Therefore, clinical prediction models for mortality are urgently required. Methods: We developed and internally validated a multivariable logistic regression model to predict inpatient mortality in COVID-19 positive patients using data collected retrospectively from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan (299 patients). External validation was conducted using a retrospective cohort from Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan (145 patients). Nine variables commonly measured in these acute settings were considered for model development, including age, biomarkers and comorbidities. Backwards stepwise selection and bootstrap resampling were used for model development and internal validation. We assessed discrimination via the C statistic, and calibration using calibration-in-the-large, calibration slopes and plots. Findings: The final model included age, lymphocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase and SpO2 as independent predictors of mortality. Discrimination of the model was excellent in both internal (c=0.89) and external (c=0.98) validation. Internal calibration was excellent (calibration slope=1). External validation showed some over-prediction of risk in low-risk individuals and under-prediction of risk in high-risk individuals prior to recalibration. Recalibration of the intercept and slope led to excellent performance of the model in independent data. Interpretation: COVID-19 is a new disease and behaves differently from common critical illnesses. This study provides a new prediction model to identify patients with lethal COVID-19. Its practical reliance on commonly available parameters should improve usage of limited healthcare resources and patient survival rate.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xie, Jianfeng; Hungerford, Daniel; Chen, Hui; Abrams, Simon T; Li, Shusheng; Wang, Guozheng; Wang, Yishan; Kang, Hanyujie; Bonnett, Laura; Zheng, Ruiqiang; Li, Xuyan; Tong, Zhaohui; Du, Bin; Qiu, Haibo; Toh, Cheng-Hock","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a0c89a9b8ff3969d97b7cc4245489ff69f3a615.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.28.20045997","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["model development","new prediction model","final model","Internal calibration","internal validation","External validation","positive patients","vulnerable patients","calibration slopes","under-prediction of risk","over-prediction of risk","multivariable logistic regression model","lethal COVID","low-risk individuals","inpatient mortality","excellent performance","independent predictors of mortality","clinical prediction models","independent data","Wuhan","C statistic","recalibration","discrimination","high-risk individuals","Jinyintan Hospital","Tongji Hospital","new disease","lactate dehydrogenase","SpO2","lymphocyte count","usage of limited healthcare resources","available parameters","patient survival rate","retrospective cohort","bootstrap resampling","diagnosis","acute settings","intercept","biomarkers","practical reliance","stepwise selection","common critical illnesses","systems","pandemic","ability","plots","Findings","study","non-survivors","variables","severity","comorbidities","Background","Interpretation","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Predictive epidemiological modeling indicates that chances for resurgence are high. However, parametrization of the epidemiological nature of COVID-19 and the effect of relaxing social distancing is not well constrained, resulting in highly uncertain outcomes in view of managing future intensive care unit (ICU) needs. Methods and findings: For performance analysis of exit strategies we developed an open-source ensemble-based Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model. It takes into account uncertainties for the COVID-19 parametrization and social distancing measures. The model is calibrated to data of the outbreak and lockdown phase. For the exit phase, the model includes the capability to activate an emergency brake, reinstating lockdown conditions. Alternatively, the model uses an adaptive COVID-19 cruise control (ACCC) capable to retain a targeted ICU level. The model is demonstrated for the Netherlands and we analyzed progressive and adaptive exit strategies through a stress test of managing ICU rates. The progressive strategy reflects the outcome of social and economic pressure to use one-way steering toward progressively relaxing measures at an early stage. It is marked by a high probability for the activation of the emergency brake due to an unsolicited growth of ICU needs in the following months. Alternatively, the two-way steering ACCC can flatten ICU needs in a more gradual way and avoids activation of the emergency brake. It also performs well for seasonal variation in the reproduction number of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus. Conclusions: The adaptive strategy (ACCC) is favored, as it avoids the use of the emergency brake at the expense of small steps of restrictive measures and allows the exploration of riskier and potentially rewarding measures in the future pathways of the exit strategy.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Wees, J.-D.; van der Kuip, M.; Osinga, S.; van Westerloo, D.; Tanck, M.; Hanegraaf, M.; Pluymaekers, M.; Leeuwenburgh, O.; van Bijsterveldt, L.; Verreijdt, P.; Brunner, L.; Tutu van Furth, M.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fafc36b3b9b500f105a0deb9a964434e0a45f2a2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.16.20102947v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","ACCC"],"locations":["Netherlands"],"keyphrases":["exit strategy","relaxing measures","emergency brake","relaxing social distancing measures","adaptive COVID","exit phase","adaptive strategy","adaptive exit strategies","rewarding measures","ICU rates","progressive strategy","needs","effect of relaxing social distancing","outcome of social","unsolicited growth of ICU","targeted ICU level","epidemiological nature of COVID","performance analysis of exit strategies","activation","parametrization","two-way steering ACCC","lockdown phase","use","expense of small steps of restrictive measures","future pathways","one-way steering","coronavirus disease","high probability","reinstating lockdown conditions","Predictive epidemiological modeling","future intensive care unit","reproduction number of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus","view","stress test","chances","economic pressure","cruise control","pandemic","uncertain outcomes","exploration of riskier","open-source ensemble","resurgence","findings","data","capability","seasonal variation","gradual way","Methods","outbreak","early stage","Netherlands","Conclusions","following months","account uncertainties","SEIR","European countries","Background"],"language":"en"},

Early detection of affected patients within the huge population of patients with common cold symptoms is an important element of this effort but often hindered by limited testing resources. We aimed to identify predictive risk profiles for a positive PCR result in primary care. Methods: Multi-center cross-sectional cohort study on predictive characteristics over a period of 4 weeks in primary care patients in Germany. We evaluated age, sex, reason for testing, risk factors, symptoms, and expected PCR result for their impact on the test result. Results: In total, 374 patients in 14 primary care centers received SARS-CoV-2 PCR swab testing and were included in this analysis. A fraction of 10.7% (n=40) tested positive for COVID-19. Patients who reported anosmia had a higher odds ratio (OR: 4.54; 95%-CI: 1.51-13.67) for a positive test result while patients with a sore throat had a lower OR (OR: 0.33; 95%-CI: 0.11-0.97). Patients who had a first grade contact with an infected persons and showed symptoms themselves also had an increased OR for positive testing (OR: 5.16; 95% CI: 1.72-15.51). This correlation was also present when they themselves were still asymptomatic (OR: 12.55; 95% CI: 3.97-39.67). Conclusion: The reported contact to an infected person is the most important factor for a positive PCR result, independent of any symptoms of illness in the tested patient. Those persons with contact to an infected person should always get a PCR test. If no contact is reported and testing material is scarce, anosmia should increase the likelihood of performing a test, while a sore throat should decrease it.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Just, J.; Puth, M.-T.; Regenold, F.; Weckbecker, K.; Bleckwenn, M.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/32aebaac2b9cf45556f2def2cbf9b8ca38a0ab47.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.27.20081877v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["positive PCR result","positive testing","positive test result","PCR test","primary care patients","expected PCR result","PCR swab testing","reported contact","huge population of patients","testing material","symptoms of illness","Early detection of affected patients","infected persons","grade contact","primary care centers","limited testing resources","common cold symptoms","anosmia","sore throat","COVID","predictive risk profiles","predictive characteristics","risk factors","important factor","important element","tested patient","Multi-center cross-sectional cohort study","health systems","SARS-CoV","citizens","period","weeks","major challenge","Methods","reason","impact","policy makers","pandemic","effort","sex","Germany","higher odds ratio","age","likelihood","total","Results","Conclusion","correlation","fraction","Background","analysis"],"language":"en"},

As part of initial response activities in the United States, enhanced contact investigations were conducted to enable early identification and isolation of additional cases and to learn more about risk factors for transmission. Methods Close contacts of nine early travel-related cases in the United States were identified. Close contacts meeting criteria for active monitoring were followed, and selected individuals were targeted for collection of additional exposure details and respiratory samples. Respiratory samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results There were 404 close contacts who underwent active monitoring in the response jurisdictions; 338 had at least basic exposure data, of whom 159 had at least 1 set of respiratory samples collected and tested. Across all known close contacts under monitoring, two additional cases were identified; both secondary cases were in spouses of travel-associated case patients. The secondary attack rate among household members, all of whom had at least 1 respiratory sample tested, was 13% (95% CI: 4 - 38%). Conclusions The enhanced contact tracing investigations undertaken around nine early travel-related cases of COVID-19 in the United States identified two cases of secondary transmission, both spouses. Rapid detection and isolation of the travel-associated case patients, enabled by public awareness of COVID-19 among travelers from China, may have mitigated transmission risk among close contacts of these cases.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burke, R.

To facilitate the evaluation of antiviral CD8 T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2, we generated a publicly accessible database of epitopes predicted to bind any class I HLA protein across the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome. While a subset of epitopes from earlier betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV (SARS), have been validated experimentally, validation systems are often biased toward specific HLA haplotypes (notably HLA-A*02:01) that only account for a fraction of the haplotypes of individuals affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. To enable evaluation of epitopes across individuals with a variety of HLA haplotypes, we computed the predicted binding affinities between 9-mer peptides derived from the annotated SARS-CoV-2 peptidome across 9,360 MHC class I HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles. There were 6,748 unique combinations of peptides and HLA alleles (pMHCs) with a predicted binding affinity of less than 500nM, including 1,103 unique peptides and 1,022 HLA alleles, spanning 11 annotated superfamilies.

In a second step, relative importance metrics that perform an accurate partitioning of the R2 of the model are calculated. The results of this approach support the evidence of the model averaging analysis, given that temperature is the top driver explaining 45% of regional contagion disparities.

Therefore, this study was conducted to assess prevalence of depression, anxiety and depression-anxiety comorbidity, and associated factors during the COVID-19 lock-down in Nepal. Methods A quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted among the general population of Nepal. Data was collected from April 9 to April 16, 2020 using an e-questionnaire which was shared through different popular social media. A total of 349 participants were included. Self-reported depression and anxiety were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire and Generalized Anxiety tools respectively. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the factors associated with depression, anxiety and depression and anxiety co-morbidity. Results The prevalence rates of depression, anxiety and depression-anxiety co-morbidity were found to be 34.0%, 31.0% and 23.2% respectively. The multi-variate analysis showed that females, those living alone, health professionals and those who spent more time in accessing information about COVID-19 were significantly more likely to have depression, anxiety and depression-anxiety co-morbidity. Conclusions High rates of depression and anxiety and co-morbidity were found to be prevailing among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic lock-down in Nepal. The results suggest that only the scientific, but contextually appropriate messages about the disease should be disseminated to reduce unnecessary fears and anxiety.

Using an empirically determined understanding of SARS-CoV-2 natural history and detailed, country-level case data, we elucidate how variation in free-living virus survival influences key features of COVID-19 epidemics. Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 basic reproductive number (R0) and other key signatures of outbreak intensity are modulated by transmission between infected individuals and the environment. In addition, country-level outbreaks vary in the degree to which environmental transmission appears to modulate COVID-19 dynamics. Summarizing, we propose that informed models of sit and wait, environmental transmission are essential in emerging outbreaks, as they highlight how variation in environmental transmission may explain observed differences in disease dynamics from setting to setting, and can inform public health interventions.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ogbunugafor, B.; Meszaros, V.

Our cities are built by and for humans, but are also complex, adaptive biological systems involving a diversity of other living species. The majority of these species are invisible and constitute the city\u2019s microbiome. Our design decisions for the built environment shape these invisible populations, and we interact with them on a constant basis. A growing body of evidence shows us that our health and well-being are dependent on these interactions. Indeed, multicellular organisms owe meaningful aspects of their development and phenotype to interactions with the microorganisms\u2014bacteria or fungi\u2014with which they live in continual exchange and symbiosis. While the processing and sequencing of samples can be high-throughput, gathering samples is still very expensive, labor intensive, and can require mobilizing large numbers of volunteers to get a snapshot of the microbial landscape of a city, such as City Sampling Day (metasub.org). Here we postulate that honeybees may be effective collaborators in the sampling process, as they daily forage within a 2-mile radius of their hive. We describe the results of a pilot study conducted with 3 rooftop beehives in Brooklyn, NY, where we evaluated the potential of various hive materials (beeswax, honey, debris, pollen, propolis) to reveal information as to the surrounding metagenomic landscape, and where we conclude that the bee debris are the richest substrate. Based on these results, we profiled 4 additional cities in this manner: Sydney, Melbourne, Venice and Tokyo. While the molecular and computational methods used here were based on DNA analysis, it is possible they could be used to monitor RNA-based viruses such as Sars-Cov-2.

Full-genome-sequence computational analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome will allow us to understand the recent evolutionary events and adaptability mechanisms more accurately, as there is still neither effective therapeutic nor prophylactic strategy. In this study, we used population genetics analysis to infer the mutation rate and plausible recombination events that may have contributed to the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Furthermore, we localized targets of recent and strong positive selection. The genomic regions that appear to be under positive selection are largely co-localized with regions in which recombination from non-human hosts appeared to have taken place in the past. Our results suggest that the pangolin coronavirus genome may have contributed to the SARS-CoV-2 genome by recombination with the bat coronavirus genome. However, we find evidence for additional recombination events that involve coronavirus genomes from other hosts, i.e., Hedgehog and Sparrow. Even though recombination events within human hosts cannot be directly assessed, due to the high similarity of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we infer that recombinations may have recently occurred within human hosts using a linkage disequilibrium analysis. In addition, we employed an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach to estimate the parameters of a demographic scenario involving an exponential growth of the size of the SARS-CoV-2 populations that have infected European, Asian and Northern American cohorts, and we demonstrated that a rapid exponential growth in population size can support the observed polymorphism patterns in SARS-CoV-2 genomes.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vasilarou, Maria; Alachiotis, Nikolaos; Garefalaki, Joanna; Beloukas, Apostolos; Pavlidis, Pavlos","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d292018f419afdfc639309fe2aec1e8ce196ea21.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.21.054122","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","coronavirus genomes","additional recombination events","plausible recombination events","bat coronavirus genome","pangolin coronavirus genome","high similarity of SARS","non-human hosts","genome-sequence computational analysis","recent evolutionary events","population size","population genetics analysis","current coronavirus disease","linkage disequilibrium analysis","rapid exponential growth","strong positive selection","targets of recent","genomic regions","mutation rate","observed polymorphism patterns","parameters","Approximate Bayesian Computation approach","Northern American cohorts","COVID","demographic scenario","adaptability mechanisms","populations","prophylactic strategy","study","place","results","evidence","Hedgehog","Sparrow","pandemic","recombinations","past"],"language":"en"},

Acute and life-threatening respiratory symptoms are experienced by 10-20% of symptomatic patients, particularly those with underlying medical conditions that includes diabetes, COPD and pregnancy. One of the main challenges in the containment of COVID-19 is the identification and isolation of asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic individuals. As communities re-open, large numbers of people will need to be tested and contact-tracing of positive patients will be required to prevent additional waves of infections and enable the continuous monitoring of the viral loads COVID-19 positive patients.

But no studies to date have systematically described liver test abnormalities in patients with COVID-19. We evaluated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with abnormal liver test results. Methods Clinical records and laboratory results were obtained from 417 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the only referral hospital in Shenzhen, China from January 11 to February 21, 2020 and followed up to March 7, 2020. Information on clinical features of patients with abnormal liver tests were collected for analysis. Results Of 417 patients with COVID-19, 318 (76.3%) had abnormal liver test results and 90 (21.5%) had liver injury during hospitalization. The presence of abnormal liver tests became more pronounced during hospitalization within 2 weeks, with 49 (23.4%), 31 (14.8%), 24 (11.5%) and 51 (24.4%) patients having alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels elevated to more than 3\u00D7 the upper limit of normal, respectively. Patients with abnormal liver tests of hepatocellular type or mixed type at admission had higher odds of progressing to severe disease (odds ratios [ORs] 2.73; 95% CI 1.19\u20136.3, and 4.44, 95% CI 1.93\u201310.23, respectively). The use of lopinavir/ritonavir was also found to lead to increased odds of liver injury (OR from 4.44 to 5.03, both p \u003C0.01). Conclusion Patients with abnormal liver tests were at higher risk of progressing to severe disease. The detrimental effects on liver injury mainly related to certain medications used during hospitalization, which should be monitored and evaluated frequently. Lay summary Data on liver tests in patients with COVID-19 are scarce. We observed a high prevalence of liver test abnormalities and liver injury in 417 patients with COVID-19 admitted to our referral center, and the prevalence increased substantially during hospitalization. The presence of abnormal liver tests and liver injury were associated with the progression to severe pneumonia. The detrimental effects on liver injury were related to certain medications used during hospitalization, which warrants frequent monitoring and evaluation for these patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cai, Qingxian; Huang, Deliang; Yu, Hong; Zhu, Zhibin; Xia, Zhang; Su, Yinan; Li, Zhiwei; Zhou, Guangde; Gou, Jizhou; Qu, Jiuxin; Sun, Yan; Liu, Yingxia; He, Qing; Chen, Jun; Liu, Lei; Xu, Lin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5cfb31a4260bcc4507831e154f7d585ca9cb0000.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016882782030218X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016882782030218X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Background \u0026 Aims Recent","CI"],"locations":["Shenzhen","China"],"keyphrases":["presence of abnormal liver tests","abnormal liver test results","increased odds of liver injury","abnormal liver tests of hepatocellular type","Conclusion Patients","high prevalence of liver test abnormalities","clinical features of patients","hospitalization","severe disease","clinical characteristics of COVID","coronavirus disease","laboratory results","severe pneumonia","higher odds of progressing","odds ratios","certain medications","detrimental effects","CI","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","higher risk of progressing","Methods Clinical records","mixed type","aspartate aminotransferase","alanine aminotransferase","Recent data","referral hospital","referral center","Lay summary Data","total bilirubin","admission","gamma-glutamyl transferase levels","ORs","SARS-CoV","outbreak","frequent monitoring","date","progression","Shenzhen","China","evaluation","Information","impact","analysis","upper limit of normal","use of lopinavir","ritonavir","Background","light","weeks","studies"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN: Update of a systematic review and meta-analysis focussing on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs (c-RCTs) evidence only. DATA SOURCES: Eligible trials from the previous Cochrane review, search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase and CINAHL from 01 October 2010 to 01 April 2020, and forward and backward citation analysis of included studies. DATA SELECTION: RCTs and c-RCTs involving people of any age, testing the use of hand hygiene methods, surface disinfection or cleaning, and other miscellaneous barrier interventions. Face masks, eye protection, and person distancing are covered in Part 1 of our systematic review. Outcomes included acute respiratory illness (ARI), influenza-like illness (ILI) or laboratory-confirmed influenza (influenza) and/or related consequences (e.g. death, absenteeism from school or work). DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Six authors working in pairs independently assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool and extracted data. The generalised inverse variance method was used for pooling by using the random-effects model, and results reported with risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: We identified 51 eligible trials. We included 25 randomised trials comparing hand hygiene interventions with a control; 15 of these could be included in meta-analyses. We pooled 8 trials for the outcome of ARI. Hand hygiene showed a 16% relative reduction in the number of participants with ARI (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.86) in the intervention group. When we considered the more strictly defined outcomes of ILI and influenza, the RR for ILI was 0.98 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.14), and for influenza the RR was 0.91 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.34). Three trials measured absenteeism. We found a 36% relative reduction in absentee numbers in the hand hygiene group (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.71). Comparison of different hand hygiene interventions did not favour one intervention type over another. We found no incremental effects of combining hand hygiene with using face masks or disinfecting surfaces or objects. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the lack of evidence for the impact of hand hygiene in reducing ILI and influenza, the modest evidence for reducing the burden of ARIs, and related absenteeism, justifies reinforcing the standard recommendation for hand hygiene measures to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. Funding for relevant trials with an emphasis on adherence and compliance with such a measure is crucial to inform policy and global pandemic preparedness with confidence and precision.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Ansary, L.

Nationwide, there were more than 70,000 confirmed cases, and 2500 deaths. Most patients were elderly, with severe disease. For acute respiratory infection, RT-PCR is routinely used to detect causative viruses in respiratory secretions. Coronavirus RNA can be detected from nose and throat swabs, sputum and other lower respiratory tract secretions, blood and feces. Such specimens were examined by RT-PCR. Three targets, RdRP, E and N genes were detected, indicating samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2]. After patient recovery, a chest CT examination, combined with SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, confirmed diagnosis. However, some recovery patients with negative RNA tests turned RNA positive. The preliminary data is about 14% of discharged patients in Guangdong reported by the Guangdong Center for Disease Control (CDC). This is an important scientific issue. If samples are positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, patients should be managed according to infection source. Fortunately, there were no close contacts of second-generation cases. We herein report six SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed in our hospital, for the changes of results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA should attract attention. Most patients were elderly, with a low Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI). However, the association of the phenomenon with aging and GNRI has not yet been reported in detail. Further investigations are necessary to confirm and improve these findings. Similarly, discharged patient follow-up should be strengthened. This article is protected by copyright.

The coronavirus spike (S) protein, which facilitates viral attachment, entry and membrane fusion is heavily glycosylated and plays a critical role in the elicitation of the host immune response. The spike protein is comprised of two protein subunits (S1 and S2), which together possess 22 potential N-glycosylation sites. Herein, we report the glycosylation mapping on spike protein subunits S1 and S2 expressed on human cells through high resolution mass spectrometry. We have characterized the quantitative N-glycosylation profile on spike protein and interestingly, observed unexpected O-glycosylation modifications on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein subunit S1. Even though O-glycosylation has been predicted on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, this is the first report of experimental data for both the site of O-glycosylation and identity of the O-glycans attached on the subunit S1. Our data on the N- and O- glycosylation is strengthened by extensive manual interpretation of each glycopeptide spectra in addition to using bioinformatics tools to confirm the complexity of glycosylation in the spike protein. The elucidation of the glycan repertoire on the spike protein provides insights into the viral binding studies and more importantly, propels research towards the development of a suitable vaccine candidate.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shajahan, Asif; Supekar, Nitin T; Gleinich, Anne S; Azadi, Parastoo","journal":"Glycobiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwaa042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363391/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsxMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["O- glycosylation","spike protein of SARS","spike protein subunits S1","spike protein subunit S1","coronavirus spike","complexity of glycosylation","glycosylation mapping","unexpected O-glycosylation modifications","quantitative N-glycosylation profile","potential N-glycosylation sites","site of O","O-glycans","S2","SARS-CoV","viral binding studies","report of experimental data","viral attachment","receptor binding domain","novel coronavirus pandemic","development of new therapeutic strategies","human cells","RBD","glycopeptide spectra","insights","extensive manual interpretation","high resolution mass spectrometry","elicitation","addition","entry","membrane fusion","bioinformatics tools","identity","rapid progress of mortalities","glycan repertoire","current emergence","critical role","host immune response","suitable vaccine candidate","research","elucidation"],"language":"en"},

We explored the impact of insurance status, education, and income on survival and receipt of chemoradiation therapy. METHODS We included patients with ASCC from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program database from 2004 to 2016. Socioeconomic variables included insurance status, level of education, income, and unemployment rate. Cox proportional hazards and multivariate logistic regression were used to determine predictors of survival and receipt of chemoradiation. RESULTS We included a total of 10,868 cases of ASCC. The median age was 55, 10.4 % were black, and 65.4 % were female. Overall, 74.1 % of patients received combination chemoradiation. In multivariate analysis, poorer survival was found for Medicaid (HR 1.52, 95 % CI 1.34-1.74) and uninsured (HR 1.68, 95 % CI 1.35-2.10) patients, and for communities with the lowest rates of high school education (HR 1.17, 95 % CI 1.02-1.38), lowest income (HR 1.29, 95 % CI 1.08-1.54), and highest unemployment (HR 1.21, 95 % CI 1.03-1.40).

Use of immunomodulatory drug (IMID)/alkylator combinations declined from early to recent cohort (26% vs. 13%) but IMID (7% vs. 16%) use increased. Few patients (5%) received 1L maintenance therapy. Two-thirds of patients were treated with a fixed duration intent, with a median 7-month 1L DOT and progression-free survival (PFS) of 32.8 months in the early cohort. Both 1L DOT and PFS were longer with oral compared to injectable regimens. CONCLUSIONS Although frontline treatment patterns changed significantly, 1L DOT is short. The uptake of molecular testing and 1L maintenance is low. These results highlight areas of unmet need in NDMM.","publish_time":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mohty, Mohamad; Knauf, Wolfgang; Romanus, Dorothy; Corman, Shelby; Verleger, Katharina; Kwon, Youngmin; Cherepanov, Dasha; Cambron-Mellott, M Janelle; Vikis, Haris G; Gonzalez, Francisco; Gavini, Francois; Ramasamy, Karthik","journal":"European journal of haematology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/ejh.13439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418256/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsyMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PFS","DOT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DOT","patients of early","early cohort","thirds of patients","maintenance therapy","longer duration of therapy","non-transplant NDMM","alkylator combinations","treatment paradigm","frontline treatment patterns","recent cohorts","PFS","RESULTS","IMID","uptake of molecular testing","diagnosed multiple myeloma","fixed duration intent","proteasome inhibitor","PI","adults","retrospective chart review","outcomes","progression-free survival","METHODS","European countries","oral","areas of unmet need","months","immunomodulatory drug","risk","principal","study","OBJECTIVES","CONCLUSIONS","injectable regimens"],"language":"en"},

Wide-necked aneurysm can be defined with a dome-to-neck ratio or aspect ratio; however, clinical definitions of wide-necked aneurysms vary. This study aimed to determine the most useful definition of wide-necked aneurysm to predict the need for an adjunctive device. Methods Among 552 cases of aneurysms, 343 (62.1%) and 209 (37.9%) cases of unruptured and ruptured aneurysms, respectively, were treated in a single institution. For each aneurysm, the (1) dome-to-neck ratio, (2) aspect ratio, and (3) K-ratio (defined as [dome height\u002Bmaximum dome width]/[2\u00D7maximum neck width]) were measured. We statistically analyzed patient data to determine which of the three ratios was most predictive of the need for adjunctive devices. Results Among 552 cases of aneurysms, 277 (50.2%) and 275 (49.8%) cases were treated with and without adjunctive techniques, respectively. The mean dome-to-neck ratio, aspect ratio, and K-ratio were 1.17\u00B10.39, 1.58\u00B10.61, and 1.37\u00B10.47, respectively. The K-ratio was the strongest predictor of the use of adjunctive devices (P\u003C0.001), and 1.3 was the most appropriate K-ratio cut-off value (sensitivity, 72.9%; specificity, 63.6%). Conclusions K-ratio was the most useful predictor of the need for adjunctive devices in the treatment of endovascular aneurysms. These results suggest that the K-ratio may be used to define wide-necked aneurysms requiring complicated management via adjunctive devices.","publish_time":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Hyun Seok; Kwon, Soon Chan; Park, Eun Suk; Park, Jun Bum; Kim, Min Soo","journal":"Journal of cerebrovascular and endovascular neurosurgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.7461/jcen.2019.21.4.193; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32030342/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjsyMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neck ratio","aspect ratio","wide-necked aneurysms","cases of aneurysms","ratio cut-off value","adjunctive techniques","use of adjunctive devices","ruptured aneurysms","treatment of endovascular aneurysms","need","dome height","maximum dome width","mean dome","useful definition of wide","maximum neck width","Background Endovascular management of wide","cases of unruptured","clinical definitions of wide","useful predictor","Results","complicated management","strongest predictor","assisted-techniques","sensitivity","ratios","Methods","single institution","patient data","specificity","study","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

The impact of COVID-19 has been significant, raising concerns regarding public health risks in China and worldwide.

(1) Using the data from the China migrant population survey in 2017 (Sample size = 432,907), a matrix of the residence-birthplace (R-B matrix) of migrant populations is constructed. The matrix was used to analyze the confirmed cases of COVID-19 at Prefecture-level Cities from February 1-15, 2020 after the outbreak in Wuhan, by calculating the probability of influx or outflow migration. We obtain a satisfactory regression analysis result (R2 = 0.826-0.887, N = 330).

METHODS The authors developed consensus statements in 2 sections. The first was \u0022How should we/clinicians modify our clinical care pathway for people with epilepsy during the COVID-19 pandemic?\u0022 The second was \u0022What general advice should we give to people with epilepsy during this crisis? Authors individually scored statements on a scale of -10 (strongly disagree) to \u002B10 (strongly agree). 5/11 recommendations for physicians and 3/5 recommendations for individuals/families were rated by all authors as 7 or above (strongly agree) on the first round of rating. Subsequently, a tele-conference was held where statements for which there was a lack of strong consensus were revised. RESULTS After revision, all consensus recommendations received a score of 7 or above. The recommendations focus on administration of as much care as possible at home to keep people with epilepsy out of health care facilities, where they are likely to encounter COVID-19 (including strategies for rescue therapy), as well as minimization of risk of seizure exacerbation through adherence, and through ensuring a regular supply of medication. We also provide helpful links to additional helpful information for people with epilepsy and health providers. CONCLUSION These recommendation may help healthcare professionals provide optimal care to people with epilepsy during the coronavirus pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"French, Jacqueline A; Brodie, Martin J; Caraballo, Roberto; Devinsky, Orrin; Ding, Ding; Jehi, Lara; Jette, Nathalie; Kanner, Andres; Modi, Avani C; Newton, Charles R; Patel, Archana A; Pennell, Page B; Perucca, Emilio; Sander, Josemir W; Scheffer, Ingrid E; Singh, Gagandeep; Williams, Emma; Wilmshurst, Jo; Cross, J Helen","journal":"Neurology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000009632; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32327490/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["people","epilepsy","consensus recommendations","optimal care","consensus statements","health care facilities","urgent care facilities","best possible care","COVID","authors","clinical care pathway","Novel Coronavirus pandemic","lack of strong consensus","additional helpful information","helpful links","health providers","hospitalizations","healthcare professionals","visits","adherence","minimization of risk","seizure exacerbation","impact","home","CONCLUSION","strategies","individuals","clinicians","families","RESULTS","revision","physicians","METHODS","sections","administration","rescue therapy","regular supply of medication","OBJECTIVES","tele-conference","general advice","scale","score","crisis","round of rating"],"language":"en"},

Seemingly healthy imported camels are responsible for the ingress of serious diseases into Egypt. A striking example of this concerning public health globally is the Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which causes case fatalities of over 34%. Here, we determined the seroepidemiological situation of the MERS-CoV in imported camels and their traders in Upper Egypt. METHODOLOGY Sera of sixty-three dromedaries and twenty-eight camel traders were recruited (January 2015-December 2016). The age, gender, and sampling locality of each sampled camel and human were obtained. Semi-quantitative anti-MERS-CoV IgG ELISAs which utilize the purified spike protein domain S1 antigen of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV S1) were used to detect specific IgG antibodies against the virus. RESULTS The data showed that 58.73% of imported camels and 25% of traders had antibodies specific to MERS-CoV. Interestingly, like seroreactive camels, all seropositive humans were apparently healthy without any history of developing severe respiratory disease in the 14 days prior to sampling. Having specific antibodies among the examined camel sera was significantly different (P \u003C 0.0001) in relation to various sampling localities, gender and age groups. In contrast, the seropositivity rate of MERS-CoV IgG in humans did not differ significantly by any of the studied factors. CONCLUSIONS The current study provides the first serological evidence of occupational exposure of humans to MERS-CoV in Africa. Additionally, it reports that imported camels could be implicated in introducing MERS-CoV into Egypt. Accordingly, application of strict control measures to camel importation is a priority.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sayed, Amal Sm; Malek, Safaa S; Abushahba, Mostafa Fn","journal":"Journal of infection in developing countries","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.10862; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32146454/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sera"],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":["Middle East","Africa"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV S1","camel traders","seropositivity rate of MERS","healthy imported camels","camel importation","Semi-quantitative anti-MERS-CoV IgG ELISAs","sampled camel","specific IgG antibodies","antibodies specific","specific antibodies","seroreactive camels","examined camel sera","Upper Egypt","INTRODUCTION Camel trade","purified spike protein domain S1 antigen of MERS coronavirus","sampling locality","seropositive humans","gender","various sampling localities","Middle East respiratory coronavirus","age groups","METHODOLOGY Sera","serological evidence of occupational exposure of humans","severe respiratory disease","public health","relation","application of strict control measures","history","ingress of serious diseases","current study","days","dromedaries","striking example","contrast","priority","seroepidemiological situation","Africa","case fatalities","CONCLUSIONS","studied factors","data"],"language":"en"},

Methods: We used the Robert Koch Institute data on weekly COVID-19 cases in different age groups in Germany. To minimize the effect of changes in healthcare seeking behavior (e.g. for older adults) and testing practices, we included the following eight 5-year age groups in the analyses: 10-14y through 45-49y. For each age group g, we considered the proportion PL(g) of individuals in age group g among all detected cases aged 10-49y during weeks 13-14, 2020 (later period), as well as corresponding proportion PE(g) for weeks 10-11, 2020 (early period), and defined the relative risk RR(g) for the age group g to be the ratio RR(g)=PL(g)/PE(g). For each pair of age groups g1,g2, a higher value of RR(g1) compared to RR(g2), or, alternatively, a value above 1 for the odds ratio OR(g1,g2)=RR(g1)/RR(g2) for a COVID-19 case to be in group g1 vs. g2 for the later vs. early periods is interpreted as the relative increase in the population incidence of SARS-Cov-2 in the age group g1 compared to g2 for the later vs. early period. Results: The relative risk RR(g) was highest for individuals aged 20-24y (RR=1.4(95% CI (1.27,1.55))), followed by individuals aged 15-19y (RR=1.14(0.99,1.32)), aged 30-34y (RR= 1.07(0.99,1.16)), aged 25-29y (RR= 1.06(0.98,1.15)), aged 35-39y (RR=0.95(0.87,1.03)), aged 40-44y (RR=0.9(0.83,0.98)), aged 45-49y (RR=0.83(0.77,0.89)) and aged 10-14y (RR=0.78(0.64,0.95)). For the age group 20-24y, the odds ratio relative to any other age group for a case to be during the later vs. early period was significantly above 1. For the age group 15-19y, the odds ratio relative to any other age group either above 35y or 10-14y for a case to be during the later vs. early period was significantly above 1. Conclusions: The observed relative increase with time in the prevalence of individuals aged 15-34y (particularly those aged 20-24y) among detected COVID-19 cases in Germany is unlikely to be explained by increases in the likelihood of seeking medical care or the likelihood of being tested for individuals in those age groups compared to individuals aged 35-49y or 10-14y, and should be indicative of the actual increase in the prevalence of individuals aged 15-34y among SARS-CoV-2 infections in the German population. That increase likely reflects elevated mixing among individuals aged 15-34y (particularly those aged 20-24y) compared to other age groups, possibly due to lesser adherence to social distancing practices.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goldstein, Edward; Lipsitch, Marc","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62ce6510b370404f36111b8d0ddcd5091ab084b1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.20058719","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RR","g1"],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["age group g1","ratio RR","relative risk RR","year age groups","pair of age groups g1","g2","role of different age groups","higher value of RR","prevalence of individuals","later period","odds ratio relative","observed relative increase","SARS-CoV","early periods","detected cases","detected COVID","actual increase","different countries","weekly COVID","proportion PL","current social distancing practices","population incidence of SARS","Germany","testing practices","weeks","likelihood","corresponding proportion PE","German population","Robert Koch Institute data","lesser adherence","behavior","time","older adults","healthcare","infections","epidemics","uncertainty","analyses","effect of changes","medical care","Conclusions","Results","Methods","elevated mixing","Background"],"language":"en"},

In the light of recent outbreak of COVID19 Pandemic for which is there no specific treatment, prevention and awareness is the only key to overcome an adversity of such magnitude. Thus, we aimed to understand the knowledge, attitude and practices of undergraduate medical students pertaining to infection with the COVID19. Methods. An electronic survey developed using an online cloud-based website (Survey Monkey) was served to undergraduate medical students. Participants had a week to voluntarily complete the 8 minute long questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and figures were obtained from surveymonkey.com. Results. Of 2507 invitees across six medical colleges in India, 616 (24.6%) responded. Most undergraduates (age 21.5 years, 46.1% males) were undergoing internship (16.7%) or final year undergraduate training (54.1%). Knowledge regarding viral transmission, clinical-radiologic features, laboratory diagnosis and treatment was adequate among most students (Fig 1). However, the understanding of the incubation period and time to symptoms was less than satisfactory (Supplementary Table 1). Nearly three-fourths 461 (74.8%) were aware of the COVID-19 specific precautions. While their universities had advised most regarding hand hygiene, social distancing, symptom identification, and high-risk groups, fewer were advised to avoid staying back in hostels or drug prevention. Nearly 70% were reluctant to attend clinics from fear of getting infected or passing on to others. Most students read about COVID-19 regularly, and social media accounts of medical journals were the primary 78.9% source. Conclusion. Most medical students are aware of the basics of COVID19 infection and act as a potential reservoir to fill the gaps in Healthcare services should the need arise.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gupta, Latika; Agarwal, Vishwesh; Davalbhakta, Samira; Agarwal, Vikas; Misra, Durga","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/690178e12695c5fdc8e3a153914a5bec7030a6cb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.11.20061333","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["surveymonkey.com","Healthcare"],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["practices of undergraduate medical students","medical colleges","social media accounts of medical journals","basics of COVID19 infection","specific treatment","knowledge","social distancing","Survey Monkey","electronic survey","final year undergraduate training","specific precautions","drug prevention","light of recent outbreak of COVID19 Pandemic","regarding hand hygiene","symptom identification","clinical-radiologic features","laboratory diagnosis","online cloud-based website","symptoms","time","gaps","viral transmission","potential reservoir","attitude","high-risk groups","incubation period","awareness","Healthcare services","figures","clinics","fear","age","years","males","need","understanding","fewer","universities","invitees","India","Supplementary Table","minute long questionnaire","week","adversity","Descriptive statistics","undergraduates","internship","source","hostels","Participants","magnitude","Results","Background","Methods","fourths","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

The monitored parameter is the spread rate obtained from this time series (day-1) expressed in %/day. The scheme\u0027s capability is verified using the epidemic data from China and South Korea. Its projection capability is shown for Italy and United States with scenarios for the ensuing 30 days from April 2nd, 2020. The spread rate (relative rate of change of the time series) is very sensitive to sudden changes in the epidemic evolution and can be used to monitor in real-time the effectiveness of containment actions. The logarithm of this variable allows identifying clear trends of the evolution of the COVID-10 epidemic in these countries. The spread rate calculated from the number of confirmed cases of infection is interpreted as a probability per unit of time of virus infection and containment actions. Its product with the number of confirmed cases of infections yields the number of new cases per day.

Axonopathies are important medical entities in their own right, but in addition, illnesses once considered primary neuronopathies are now thought to begin with axonal degeneration. These disorders include Alzheimer\u0027s disease, Parkinson\u0027s disease, and motor neuron diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Moreover, conditional knockout of NTE in the mouse CNS produces vacuolation and other degenerative changes in large neurons in the hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum, along with degeneration and swelling of axons in ascending and descending spinal cord tracts. In humans, NTE mutations cause a variety of neurodegenerative conditions resulting in a range of deficits including spastic paraplegia and blindness. Mutations in the Drosophila NTE orthologue SwissCheese (SWS) produce neurodegeneration characterized by vacuolization that can be partially rescued by expression of wild-type human NTE, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for certain human neurological disorders. This chapter defines NTE and OPIDN, presents an overview of OP compounds, provides a rationale for NTE research, and traces the history of discovery of NTE and its relationship to OPIDN. It then briefly describes subsequent studies of NTE, including practical applications of the assay; aspects of its domain structure, subcellular localization, and tissue expression; abnormalities associated with NTE mutations, knockdown, and conventional or conditional knockout; and hypothetical models to help guide future research on elucidating the role of NTE in OPIDN.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Richardson, Rudy J.; Fink, John K.; Glynn, Paul; Hufnagel, Robert B.; Makhaeva, Galina F.; Wijeyesakere, Sanjeeva J.","journal":"Advances in Neurotoxicology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e439f862b60e38fdfaff4323d12fc6e1b5d29aa.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468748020300011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468748020300011","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OP","NTE","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NTE mutations","NTE research","role of NTE","conditional knockout of NTE","type human NTE","subsequent studies of NTE","OPIDN","Drosophila NTE orthologue SwissCheese","overview of OP compounds","distal degeneration of axons","axonal degeneration","certain human neurological disorders","peripheral nervous system","central nervous system","spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases","Parkinson\u0027s disease","mouse CNS","Alzheimer\u0027s disease","tissue expression","expression of wild","future research","motor neuron diseases","variety of neurodegenerative conditions","potential therapeutic approach","Abstract Systemic inhibition of neuropathy target esterase","aspects","subcellular localization","degenerative changes","SWS","vacuolation","abnormalities","knockdown","amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","large neurons","domain structure","practical applications","hypothetical models","right","hippocampus","assay","range of deficits","delayed neurotoxicity","descending spinal cord tracts","addition","illnesses","important medical entities","spastic paraplegia","thalamus","neurodegeneration","PNS","rationale","history of discovery","primary neuronopathies","Axonopathies","blindness","ALS","powerful model","cerebellum","humans","relationship","vacuolization","chapter"],"language":"en"},

Some studies showed discrepant results. However, timing for the treatment initiation and its setting (in-hospital or out-patient) are not consistent across studies. Methods: Monocentric retrospective study conducted from 2th March to 17th April 2020, in adults hospitalized in a tertiary hospital for COVID-19. Patients characteristics were compared between groups depending on the therapy received (HCQ/azithromycin taken [\u2265] 48 hours or other treatment). Outcomes were evaluated from admission, by the need for intensive care unit (ICU) support and/or death. Univariate analyses were performed using non-parametric tests and confirmed by a multiple logistic regression using Pearson correlation test. Results: Among 132 patients admitted for COVID-19 in the medicine ward, 45 received HCQ/azithromycin [\u2265] 48 hours, with a favorable outcome in 91.1% of cases (OR=6.2, p=0.002) versus others regimen (n=87). Groups were comparable at the baseline in terms of age, sex, comorbidities, extend in thoracic imaging, and severity. Among patients that required to be transferred to ICU (n=27) (for mechanical ventilation), median delay for transfer was 2 days (IQR 1-3).

Methods: We adopted Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Recovered (SEIR) model to estimate the course of COVID-19 outbreak in Delhi population and effect of public health intervention on the pandemic. We first estimated the basic reproductive rate (R0) based on the evidence from Wuhan, then ran the model considering no intervention implemented, followed by case isolation, social distancing, and lockdown, each implemented in isolation and in combinations to estimate the number of cases. Markov model was used to estimate the number of cases in various clinical scenarios of the disease. Sensitivity analysis conducted to estimate the effect of asymptomatic cases on case based interventions. Results: Estimated R0 in Delhi population was 6.18 (range 4.15 to 12.2). Effective reproductive rate (Rt) was least for case isolation (3.5). Lockdown showed highest reduction (28%) in number of prevalent cases on peak day and 22% reduction in patients in need of intensive care unit (ICU). Case isolation and lockdown together resulted in 50% reduction in number of prevalent cases and 42% reduction in patients in need of ICU care. Sensitivity analysis showed that the effect of case isolation was inversely proportionate to the proportion of asymptomatic (hidden) cases. Conclusions: Interventions should be implemented in combinations of individual and community level interventions to gain better outcome. Identifying and isolation of all cases as early as possible is important to flatten the pandemic curve.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nagappa, B.; Sakthivel, M.; Marimuthu, Y.; Rastogi, A.; Ramalingam, A.; Sarin, S.

Although virus isolation and serology were useful early in the SARS outbreak for diagnosing new cases, these tests are not generally useful because virus culture requires a BSL-3 laboratory and seroconversion is often delayed until 2 to 3 weeks after infection. The first qualitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS-coronavirus (CoV) were sensitive and capable of detecting 1 to 10 genome equivalents. These assays were quickly supplemented with quantitative real-time assays that helped elucidate the natural history of SARS, particularly the initial presence of low viral loads in the upper respiratory tract and high viral loads in the lower respiratory tract. The unique natural history of SARS-CoV infection dictates the testing of both respiratory and nonrespiratory specimens, the testing of multiple specimens from the same patient, and sending out positives to be confirmed by a reference laboratory. Commercially available reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS have recently appeared; however, meaningful evaluations of these assays have not yet been performed and their true performance has not been determined.

Abstract Introduction This study was undertaken to estimate the burden of morbidity associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza in children below 15 years of age. Patients and methods Children presenting with acute respiratory infection and/or isolated fever at the Basurto University Hospital, Bilbao, Spain between November 2010 and May 2011 were included in this study (NCT01592799). Two nasopharyngeal secretion samples were taken from each; one for a rapid influenza diagnostic test in the emergency department, and the second for laboratory analysis using real-time polymerase chain reaction and viral culture. Results A total of 501 children were recruited, of whom 91 were hospitalized. Influenza diagnosis was confirmed in 131 children (26.1%); 120 of 410 (29.3%) treated as outpatients and 11 of 91 (12.1%) hospitalized children. A total of 370 of 501 children (73.9%) had no laboratory test positive for influenza. The proportion of subjects with other respiratory viruses was 145/501 (28.9%) cases and co-infection with the influenza virus plus another respiratory virus was detected in 7/501 (1.4%) cases. Influenza virus types were: A (H1N1 and H3N2) 53.2% (67/126); B (Victoria and Yamagata) 46.0% (58/126); A\u002BB 0.8% (1/126). The median direct medical costs associated with each case of laboratory-confirmed influenza was \u20AC177.00 (N=131). No significant differences were observed between the medical costs associated with influenza A and B. Conclusion Almost half of the cases were influenza virus B type. The administration of a vaccine containing influenza A and B types to children below 15 years of age might reduce the overall burden of the illness.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ortiz-Lana, Naiara; Garrote, Elisa; Ar\u00EDstegui, Javier; Rementeria, Joseba; Garc\u00EDa-Mart\u00EDnez, Juan-Antonio; McCoig, Cynthia; Garc\u00EDa-Corbeira, Pilar; Devadiga, Raghavendra; Tafalla, M\u00F3nica","journal":"Anales de Pediatr\u00EDa","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/63286a7e31607c7879a6c761da3e336d71c9f6a0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1695403316303381; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1695403316303381","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pacientes","Resultados"],"organizations":["m\u00E9todos Los ni\u00F1os","al Hospital Universitario de Basurto","el Servicio de Urgencias","B.

Summary The influenza pandemic will create a major increase in demand for hospital admissions, particularly for critical care services. The recommendations detailed herein have been elaborated by experts from medical societies potentially involved in this situation and focus on general hospital organization. Intensive care units will initially face high demand for admission; the Healthcare Authorities must therefore study how ICU capacity can be expanded. Pediatric intensive care units will be particularly affected by this situation of relative bed shortage, since young children, particularly infants, are expected to be affected by severe clinical forms of avian flu. Therefore, the weight threshold for admission to the adult ICU was lowered to 20kg. Neonatal intensive care units (NICU) should remain, if possible, low viral density areas. Mixed (neonatal and pediatric) intensive care units could be dedicated to infants and children only. NICU admission of extreme premature babies should be limited in this difficult situation. Pediatric intensive care units (PICU) admission capacity could be doubled by using intermediate care and postoperative care units. The staff could be increased by doctors and nurses involved in canceled programmed activities. Healthcare workers transferred to PICU should be given special training.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guery, B.; Guidet, B.; Beloucif, S.; Floret, D.; LeGall, C.; Montravers, P.; Chouaid, C.; Jarreau, P.

Methods A mathematical model for the transmission of SARS-CoV2 in London. The model was parametrised using data on notified cases, deaths, contacts, and mobility to analyse the epidemic in the UK capital. We investigated the impact of multiple non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and combinations of these measures on future incidence of COVID-19. Results Immediate action at the early stages of an epidemic in the affected districts would have tackled spread. While an extended lockdown is highly effective, other measures such as shielding older populations, universal testing and facemasks can all potentially contribute to a reduction of infections and deaths. However, based on current evidence it seems unlikely they will be as effective as continued lockdown. In order to achieve elimination and lift lockdown within 5 months, the best strategy seems to be a combination of weekly universal testing, contact tracing and use of facemasks, with concurrent lockdown. This approach could potentially reduce deaths by 48% compared with continued lockdown alone. Conclusions A combination of NPIs such as universal testing, contact tracing and mask use while under lockdown would be associated with least deaths and infections. This approach would require high uptake and sustained local effort but it is potentially feasible as may lead to elimination in a relatively short time scale.","publish_time":"2020-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gosc\u00E9, Lara; Phillips, Professor Andrew; Spinola, P.; Gupta, Dr Rishi K.; Abubakar, Professor Ibrahim","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9393488b298effe4948ac5d76574293086a2fb72.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445320303157; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320303157?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":["London"],"keyphrases":["continued lockdown","lift lockdown","extended lockdown","concurrent lockdown","deaths","combination of weekly universal testing","measures","combination of NPIs","tracing","elimination","London","epidemic","facemasks","UK capital","mask use","approach","mathematical models","impact of multiple","epidemiological impact","reduction of infections","combinations","transmission of SARS","pharmaceutical interventions","months","older populations","early stages","notified cases","local effort","high uptake","contacts","alternative strategies","data","future incidence of COVID","affected districts","best strategy","Immediate action","short time scale","Abstract Objective","CoV2","policy","Methods","mobility","order","current evidence","spread","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

In univariate (but not multivariable) analyses, prevalence of smoking, per-capita gross domestic product, and colder average country temperature were positively associated with coronavirus-related mortality.

In particular, we verify a given clustering result for the GISAID data set, which was obtained analyzing the molecular differences in coronavirus populations by phylogenetic trees. For this purpose, we use alignment-free dissimilarity measures for sequences and combine them with learning vector quantization classifiers for virus type discriminant analysis and classification. Those vector quantizers belong to the class of interpretable machine learning methods, which, on the one hand side provide additional knowledge about the classification decisions like discriminant feature correlations, and on the other hand can be equipped with a reject option. This option gives the model the property of self controlled evidence if applied to new data, i.e. the models refuses to make a classification decision, if the model evidence for the presented data is not given. After training such a classifier for the GISAID data set, we apply the obtained classifier model to another but unlabeled SARS-CoV-2 virus data set. On the one hand side, this allows us to assign new sequences to already known virus types and, on the other hand, the rejected sequences allow speculations about new virus types with respect to nucleotide base mutations in the viral sequences. Author summary The currently emerging global disease COVID-19 caused by novel SARS-CoV-2 viruses requires all scientific effort to investigate the development of the viral epidemy, the properties of the virus and its types. Investigations of the virus sequence are of special interest. Frequently, those are based on mathematical/statistical analysis. However, machine learning methods represent a promising alternative, if one focuses on interpretable models, i.e. those that do not act as black-boxes. Doing so, we apply variants of Learning Vector Quantizers to analyze the SARS-CoV-2 sequences. We encoded the sequences and compared them in their numerical representations to avoid the computationally costly comparison based on sequence alignments. Our resulting model is interpretable, robust, efficient, and has a self-controlling mechanism regarding the applicability to data. This framework was applied to two data sets concerning SARS-CoV-2. We were able to verify previously published virus type findings for one of the data sets by training our model to accurately identify the virus type of sequences. For sequences without virus type information (second data set), our trained model can predict them. Thereby, we observe a new scattered spreading of the sequences in the data space which probably is caused by mutations in the viral sequences.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kaden, Marika; Bohnsack, Katrin Sophie; Weber, Mirko; Kud\u0142a, Mateusz; Gutowska, Kaja; Blazewicz, Jacek; Villmann, Thomas","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7fa2ace8a29fdb60340905bf4ceb038f5289dddf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.15.097741","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","GISAID"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus sequences","virus type of sequences","virus data set","new sequences","new data","viral sequences","data sets","rejected sequences","new virus types","presented data","data space","GISAID data set","virus type information","virus type discriminant analysis","published virus type findings","model evidence","hand","unlabeled SARS-CoV","novel SARS-CoV","resulting model","trained model","obtained classifier model","class of interpretable machine learning methods","variants of Learning Vector Quantizers","interpretable models","alignment-free methods","learning vector quantization classifiers","classification decisions","new scattered spreading","RNA sequence comparison","sequence alignments","viral epidemy","alignment-free dissimilarity measures","costly comparison","statistical analysis","reject option","nucleotide base mutations","discriminant feature correlations","given clustering result","property of self controlled evidence","respect","speculations","emerging global disease COVID","coronavirus populations","viruses","molecular differences","phylogenetic trees","Author summary","additional knowledge","promising alternative","self-controlling mechanism","development","applicability","properties","scientific effort","numerical representations","purpose","framework","Investigations","approach","black-boxes"],"language":"en"},

False-negative cases have important implications for COVID-19 management, isolation, and risk of transmission. We aimed to review and critically appraise evidence about the proportion of RT-PCR false-negatives at initial testing for COVID-19. Methods: We performed a systematic review and critical appraisal of literature with high involvement of stakeholders in the review process. We searched on MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, the WHO database of COVID-19 publications, the EPPI-Centre living systematic map of evidence about COVID-19, and the living systematic review developed by the University of Bern (ISPM). Two authors screened and selected studies according to the eligibility criteria and collected data of included studies (no-independent verification). Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. We calculated the false-negative proportion with the corresponding 95% CI using a multilevel mixed-effect logistic regression model using STATA 16. Certainty of the evidence about false-negative cases was rated using the GRADE approach for tests and strategies. The information is current up to 6 April 2020. Findings: Five studies enrolling 957 patients were included. All studies were affected by several biases and applicability concerns. Pooled estimation of false-negative proportion was 0.085 (95% CI= 0.034 to 0.196; tau-squared = 1.08; 95% CI= 0.27 to 8.28; p\u003C0.001); however, this estimation is highly affected by unexplained heterogeneity, and its interpretation should be avoided. The certainty of the evidence was judged as very low, due to the risk of bias, indirectness, and inconsistency issues. Conclusions: The collected evidence has several limitations, including risk of bias issues, high heterogeneity, and concerns about its applicability. Nonetheless, our findings reinforce the need for repeated testing in patients with suspicion of SARS-Cov-2 infection given that up to 29% of patients could have an initial RT-PCR false-negative result.

We found that expression of the membrane bound form of human FLT3L and SCF together with CXCL12 in a bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell line is sufficient to induce the contact-dependent specification of both type 1 and type 2 cDCs from CD34\u002B hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs).

Cases and deaths will increase as the virus continues its global march outward. In the absence of effective pharmaceutical interventions or a vaccine, wide-spread virological screening is required to inform where restrictive isolation measures should be targeted and when they can be lifted. However, limitations on testing capacity have restricted the ability of governments and institutions to identify individual clinical cases, appropriately measure community prevalence, and mitigate transmission. Group testing offers a way to increase efficiency, by combining samples and testing a small number of pools. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of group testing designs for individual identification or prevalence estimation of SARS-CoV-2 infection when testing capacity is limited. To do this, we developed mathematical models for epidemic spread, incorporating empirically measured individual-level viral kinetics to simulate changing viral loads in a large population over the course of an epidemic. We used these to construct representative populations and assess pooling strategies for community screening, accounting for variability in viral load samples, dilution effects, changing prevalence and resource constraints. We confirmed our group testing framework through pooled tests on de-identified human nasopharyngeal specimens with viral loads representative of the larger population. We show that group testing designs can both accurately estimate overall prevalence using a small number of measurements and substantially increase the identification rate of infected individuals in resource-limited settings.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cleary, B.; Hay, J.

The accuracy of early diagnosis is critical in the control of the spread of the virus. Although the real-time RT-PCR detection of the virus nucleic acid is the current golden diagnostic standard, it has high false negative rate when only apply single test. Objective Summarize the baseline characteristics and laboratory examination results of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Analyze the factors that could interfere with the early diagnosis quantitatively to support the timely confirmation of the disease. Methods All suspected patients with COVID-19 were included in our study until Feb 9th, 2020. The last day of follow-up was Mar 20th, 2020. Throat swab real-time RT-PCR test was used to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection. The difference between the epidemiological profile and first laboratory examination results of COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients were compared and analyzed by multiple logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under curve (AUC) were used to assess the potential diagnostic value in factors, which had statistical differences in regression analysis. Results In total, 315 hospitalized patients were included. Among them, 108 were confirmed as COVID-19 patients and 207 were non-COVID-19 patients. Two groups of patients have significance in comparing age, contact history, leukocyte count, lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p\u003C0.10). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed age, contact history and decreasing lymphocyte count could be used as individual factor that has diagnostic value (p\u003C0.05). The AUC of first RT-PCR test was 0.84 (95% CI 0.73-0.89), AUC of cumulative two times of RT-PCR tests was 0.92 (95% CI 0.88-0.96) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.93-0.99) for cumulative three times of RT-PCR tests. Ninety-six patients showed typical pneumonia radiological features in first CT scan, AUC was 0.74 (95% CI 0.60-0.73). The AUC of patients age, contact history with confirmed people and the decreased lymphocytes were 0.66 (95% CI 0.60-0.73), 0.67 (95% CI 0.61-0.73), 0.62 (95% CI 0.56-0.69), respectively. Taking chest CT scan diagnosis together with patients age and decreasing lymphocytes, AUC would be 0.86 (95% CI 0.82-0.90). The age threshold to predict COVID-19 was 41.5 years, with a diagnostic sensitivity of 0.70 (95% CI 0.61-0.79) and a specificity of 0.59 (95% CI 0.52-0.66). Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.71 and 0.50, respectively. Threshold of lymphocyte count to diagnose COVID-19 was 1.53x109/L, with a diagnostic sensitivity of 0.82 (95% CI 0.73-0.88) and a specificity of 0.50 (95% CI 0.43-0.57). Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.64 and 0.37, respectively. Conclusion Single RT-PCR test has relatively high false negative rate. When first RT-PCR test show negative result in suspected patients, the chest CT scan, contact history, age and lymphocyte count should be used combinedly to assess the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ai, J.; Gong, J.; Xing, L.; He, R.; Tian, F.; Wang, J.; Pei, S.

Although infrequent, neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported in patients who received chloroquine for the treatment of malaria or autoimmune diseases. In this study, we investigated these adverse events (AEs) using a large self-reporting database. Materials and Methods: We conducted a disproportionality analysis for the detection of neuropsychiatric AE signals associated with the use of chloroquine (or hydroxychloroquine), reported to FAERS database between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted reporting odds ratio (ROR) for the development of each of the neuropsychiatric AEs following the use of chloroquine was calculated using a multilevel model. Results: We included 2,389,474 AE cases, among which 520 cases developed neuropsychiatric AE following the use of chloroquine. Exposure to chloroquine was associated with a statistically significant high reporting of amnesia, delirium, hallucinations, depression, and loss of consciousness, (lower 95% confidence interval of the adjusted ROR \u003E 1), although the degree of increase in their ROR was limited. There was no statistically significant high reporting of any other neuropsychiatric AE, including suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation. Conclusion: Current pharmacovigilance study results did not suggest any potential link between the use of chloroquine and an increased risk of suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation, which would be informative during the emergency use of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sato, K.; Mano, T.; Iwata, A.; Toda, T.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b8a5c53047bbc39fc1d7c170c1086a78f60f3153.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.10.20061358v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs1NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AE","ROR"],"locations":["United States","Europe"],"keyphrases":["emergency use of chloroquine","neuropsychiatric AEs","neuropsychiatric symptoms","AE cases","detection of neuropsychiatric AE signals","emergency treatment","adjusted ROR","treatment of COVID","significant high reporting of amnesia","psychosis","Adjusted reporting odds ratio","large self-reporting database","treatment of malaria","confusion","agitation","quarter","Current pharmacovigilance study results","FAERS database","increased risk of suicide","delirium","depression","hallucinations","confidence interval","disproportionality analysis","potential link","loss of consciousness","Conclusion","coronavirus disease","development","hydroxychloroquine","patients","adverse events","Methods","autoimmune diseases","antimalarial drug","United States","Europe","degree of increase","multilevel model","Objectives","Materials","Exposure"],"language":"en"},

To assess the potential of similar viruses to become zoonotic in the future, bioinformatics of relatively conserved virus proteins, such as the L polymerase of arenaviruses, can be used to identify homology with viruses that might give future outbreaks. In this paper, new and archival metazoan transcriptome sequence data was used as a resource to identify similar sequences to known arenavirus sequences for the purpose of risk prediction. In essence, bioinformatics was utilized to provide a better understanding of the potential evolution and natural history of uncharacterized virus sequences in the GenBank database.

The aims of this investigation were to track changes and risk factors for mental health outcomes during state-mandated quarantine. Adults residing in Brazil (n = 360, 37.9 years of age, 68.9% female) were surveyed at the start of quarantine and 1 month later. Outcomes assessed included perceived stress, state anxiety and depression. Aside from demographics, behaviors and attitudes assessed included exercise, diet, use of tele-psychotherapy and number of COVID-19 related risk factors, such as perceived risk of COVID-19, information overload, and feeling imprisoned. Overall, all mental health outcomes worsened from Time 1 to time 2, although there was a significant gender x time interaction for stress. 9.7% of the sample reported stress above the clinical cut-off (2 SD above mean), while 8.0% and 9.4% were above this cutoff for depression and anxiety, respectively. In repeated measures analysis, female gender, worsening diet and excess of COVID-19 information was related to all mental health outcomes. Changes in diet for the worse were associated with increases in anxiety. Exercise frequency was clearly related to state anxiety (0 days/week \u003E 6 days/week). Those who did aerobic exercise did not have any increase in depression. Use of tele-psychotherapy predicted lower levels of depression and anxiety. In multiple regression, anxiety was predicted by the greatest number of COVID-19 specific factors. In conclusion, mental health outcomes worsened for Brazilians during the first month of quarantine and these changes are associated with a variety of risk factors.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Filgueiras, A.; Stults-Kolehmainen, M.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc2a918a321e476ddef922e873b63a76246963ce.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.12.20099374v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["state anxiety","mental health outcomes","perceived risk of COVID","related risk factors","excess of COVID","variety of risk factors","changes","greatest number of COVID","perceived stress","specific factors","included exercise","month of quarantine","state-mandated quarantine","female gender","worsening diet","tele-psychotherapy","lower levels of depression","days","week","Exercise frequency","start of quarantine","aerobic exercise","significant gender x time interaction","significant impact","information overload","country of Brazil","crisis of global proportions","repeated measures analysis","attitudes","Brazilians","pandemic","behaviors","years of age","demographics","investigation","conclusion","SD","Adults","sample","multiple regression","increases","cutoff","aims"],"language":"en"},

We present an insight into the spread of Covid19 in Nigeria in order to establish a suitable prediction model, which can be applied as a decisionsupportive tool for assigning health interventions and mitigating the spread of the Covid19 infection. Methodology: Daily spread data from February 27 to April 26, 2020, were collected to construct the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model using the R software. Stability analysis and stationarity test, parameter test, and model diagnostic were also carried out. Finally, the fitting, selection and prediction accuracy of the ARIMA model was evaluated using the AICc model selection criteria. Results: The ARIMA (1,1,0) model was finally selected among ARIMA models based upon the parameter test and Box Ljung test. A ten day forecast was also made from the model, which shows a steep upward trend of the spread of the COVID19 in Nigeria within the selected time frame. Conclusion: Federal Government of Nigeria through the presidential task force can apply the forecasted trend of much more spread to make more informed decisions on the additional measures in place to curb the spread of the virus. Application of the model can also assist in studying the effectiveness of the lockdown on the on the spread of Covid19 in Nigeria.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ibrahim, R.

Design: Systematic rapid review and meta-analysis. Data sources: MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO, searched up to 23 March 2020. Method: We selected observational and experimental studies examining the impact on mental health of epidemic outbreaks on HCWs. Titles and abstracts were screened by one reviewer, and full texts were evaluated by two reviewers independently. We extracted study characteristics, symptoms, prevalence of mental health problems, risk factors, mental health interventions, and its impact. We assessed risk of bias for each individual study. We conducted a narrative and tabulated synthesis of the results. We pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems. We followed the GRADE approach to assess the certainty in the evidence. Results: We included 61 studies (56 examining impact on mental health and five about interventions to reduce such impact). Most were conducted in Asia (59%), examined the impact of the SARS epidemic (69%), and took place in the hospital setting (79%). The pooled prevalence was higher for anxiety (45%, 95% CI 21 to 69%; 6 studies, 3,373 participants), followed by depression (38%, 95% CI 15 to 60%; 7 studies, 3,636 participants), acute stress disorder (31%, 95% CI 0 to 82%, 3 studies , 2,587 participants), burnout (29%, 95% CI 25 to 32%; 3 studies; 1,168 participants) and post-traumatic stress disorder (19%, 95% CI 11 to 26%, 10 studies, 3,121 participants). Based on 37 studies, we identified a broad number of risk factors for these conditions, including sociodemographic: younger age and female gender; social factors: lack of social support, social rejection or isolation, stigmatization; and occupational: working in a high risk environment (frontline staff), specific occupational roles (e.g., nurse), and lower levels of specialized training, preparedness and job experience. Two out of five interventions identified were educational aimed to prevent mental health problems by increasing HCWs resilience. These interventions showed positive effects in confidence in support and training, pandemic self-efficacy and interpersonal problems solving (very low certainty). One multifaceted intervention (based on training and organisational changes) targeted at hospital nurses during the SARS epidemic produced statistically significant improvements in anxiety, depression, and sleep quality (very low certainty). The impact of the two remaining interventions (multifaceted and based on psychotherapy provision) was unreported. Conclusion: The prevalence of anxiety, depression, acute and post-traumatic stress disorder, and burnout, was high both during and after the outbreaks. These problems not only have a long-lasting effect on the mental health of HCWs, but also hinder the urgent response to the current COVID-19 pandemic, by jeopardising attention and decision-making. Governments and healthcare authorities should take urgent actions to protect the mental health of HCWs. In light of the limited evidence regarding the impact of interventions to tackle mental health problems in HCWs, the risk factors identified in this study represent important targets for future interventions.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ricci Cabello, I.; Meneses Echavez, J.

The relatively large values of k implied that large cluster sizes, compatible with super-spreading, were unlikely.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"On Kwok, Kin; Hin Chan, Henry Ho; Huang, Ying; Cheong Hui, David Shu; Anantharajah Tambyah, Paul; In Wei, Wan; Kwan Chau, Patsy Yuen; Shan Wong, Samuel Yeung; Tze Tang, Julian Wei","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9dc334d0e8f0aa12a77c4c805869984fcae5b30.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670120302589; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670120302589?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs2NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong","Japan"],"keyphrases":["absence of super-spreading events","SUMMARY Super-spreading events","large values","ongoing outbreak","large cluster sizes","Hong Kong","R0","linked COVID","cases","early phase","empirical data","dispersion factor","clusters","Japan","public health teams","presence","basic reproductive number","Singapore","contribution","outbreaks","nature","epidemic","interventions"],"language":"en"},

It is characterized by distinct patterns of disease progression implying a diverse host immune response. However, the immunological features and molecular mechanisms involved in Covid-19 severity remain so far poorly known. Methods: We performed an integrated immune analysis that included in-depth phenotypical profiling of immune cells, whole-blood transcriptomic and cytokine quantification on a cohort of fifty Covid19 patients with a spectrum of disease severity. All patient were tested 8 to 12 days following first symptoms and in absence of anti-inflammatory therapy. Results: A unique phenotype in severe and critically ill patients was identified. It consists in a profoundly impaired interferon (IFN) type I response characterized by a low interferon production and activity, with consequent downregulation of interferon-stimulated genes. This was associated with a persistent blood virus load and an exacerbated inflammatory response that was partially driven by the transcriptional factor NF\u03BAB. It was also characterized by increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1 and interleukin (IL)-6 production and signaling as well as increased innate immune chemokines. Conclusion: We propose that type-I IFN deficiency in the blood is a hallmark of severe Covid-19 and could identify and define a high-risk population. Our study provides a rationale for testing IFN administration combined with adapted anti-inflammatory therapy targeting IL-6 or TNF-\u03B1 in most severe patients.

We participated in an unprecedentedly open and urgent iterative process to help develop and validate new swabs. Methods We tested prototypes for material suitability, collection sufficiency, PCR compatibility, and the likelihood that they could be mass-produced, individually packaged, and sterilized quickly. Suitable prototypes were selected for an ongoing IRB-approved clinical trial. Participants were outpatients suspected of COVID-19 who presented to our drive-through test station. Each participant was swabbed with a control swab followed by a prototype swab. For each prototype, at least 10 control-swab positive and 10 control-swab negative PCR results were collected. We measured concordance using Cohen\u0027s kappa, compared Ct values by Mann-Whitney U, and assessed staff preferences via written survey. Results We evaluated 45 materials and 150 designs from 23 individuals, laboratories, and companies. We have selected four so far for the clinical trial. Three have completed testing. For these, we obtained PCR results from control and prototype swabs from 230 people (74-79 pairs/prototype). Concordance was 0.85-0.89 on 10-19 control-swab positives and 58-67 control-swab negatives. Ct values were statistically indistinguishable from controls. Staff preferred two of the prototypes over the third but ultimately preferred the control swab most.

More generally, it provides a potential study design blueprint to other investigators for any interventional COVID-19 study looking to evaluate interventions for prevention or treatment of COVID-19 infection. This specific study described is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of doxycycline for the prevention of COVID-19 infection and disease in healthcare workers with ongoing high risk exposure to COVID-19. This study would consist of a 50-day Treatment Period (Day 0-Day 50), followed by an End of Study Visit, approximately 30 days after completion of study drug dosing. Initially, for approximately the first 4 to 6 weeks, an initial open-label arm would be enrolled with up to 1938 subjects who will be assigned to take 20mg doxycycline BID. In the double blind, placebo controlled arms approximately 3,692 participants would be randomized to either doxycycline or placebo for 50 days. Doxycycline is a rational candidate drug to be evaluated for repurposing against SARS-CoV-2. Doxycycline is a generally safe tetracycline derivative that has been available for decades, most commonly dosed at 100mg BID to treat bacterial infections. However, in addition to its anti-microbial properties, doxycycline (and more generally tetracycline derivatives) may have a role as an effective anti-viral agent and as an anti-inflammatory drug. Early studies indicate potential efficacy of minocycline against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [12], and doxycycline against Dengue and Chikungunya infection[9, 10]. In addition, doxycycline is known or proposed to target several pathways that regulate viral replication. [13, 14, 15]. Doxycycline is a particularly attractive candidate as a COVID-19 prophylactic given it has been used in clinical practice for decades and maintains an excellent safety profile as demonstrated in multiple clinical studies. Any effective prophylaxis for COVID-19 should be able to demonstrate high efficacy at preventing infection and/or lowering severity of disease. Equally important, it should demonstrate this efficacy at dosing levels that are highly unlikely to precipitate any untoward severe side effects. Doxycycline has been selected based on its ability to: 1) inhibit metalloproteinases (MMPs), implicated in initial viral entry into the cell as well as in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with severe COVID-19 infection [13, 16]; 2) potential to inhibit Papain-like proteinase (PLpro) responsible for proteolytic cleavage of the replicase polyprotein to release non-structural proteins 1, 2 \u0026 3 (Nsp1, Nsp2 and Nsp3) all essential for viral replication. [19]; 3) potential to inhibit 3C-like main protease (3CLpro) or Nsp5 which is cleaved from the polyproteins causes further cleavage of Nsp4-16 and mediates maturation of Nsps which is essential in the virus lifecycle. [19]; 4) act as an ionophore help transport Zinc intracellularly, increasing cellular concentrations of Zinc to inhibit viral replication. [6, 15]; 5) inhibit Nf-kB which may lower inflammatory response to COVID-19 infection, and lower risk of viral entry due to decreasing DPP4 cell surface receptor. [20, 21]; 6) inhibits (specifically low-dose doxycycline) expression of CD147/EMMPRIN that may be necessary for SARS-CoV-2 entry into T lymphocytes [22, 23].","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yates, P.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) due to novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) related infection (COVID-19) is characterized by severe ventilation perfusion mismatch leading to refractory hypoxemia. To date, there is no specific treatment available for 2019-nCoV. Nitric oxide is a selective pulmonary vasodilator gas used as a rescue therapy in refractory hypoxemia due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In has also shown in-vitro and clinical evidence that inhaled nitric oxide gas (iNO) has antiviral activity against other strains of coronavirus. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether inhaled NO improves oxygenation in patients with hypoxic SARS-CoV2. This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with 1:1 individual allocation. Patients will be blinded to the treatment. Methods and analysis. Intubated patients admitted to the intensive care unit with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe hypoxemia will be randomized to receive inhalation of NO (treatment group) or not (control group). Treatment will be stopped when patients are free from hypoxemia for more than 24 hours. The primary outcome evaluates levels of oxygenation between the two groups at 48 hours. Secondary outcomes include rate of survival rate at 28 and 90 days in the two groups, time to resolution of severe hypoxemia, time to achieve negativity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests. Ethics and dissemination. The study protocol has been approved by the Investigational Review Board of Xijing Hospital (Xian, China) and pending the Partners Human Research Committee (Boston, USA).

The epidemic has been mitigated by social distancing and the lockdown introduced on 17 and 23 March 2020 respectively. We recently reported a stochastic model of a mitigated epidemic which incorporated changes in social interactions and daily movements and whose simulations were consistent with the initial PHE daily mortality data. However, on 29 April, PHE revised their historic data to include out-of-hospital deaths in England. Out-of-hospital deaths occur sooner than in-hospital deaths. Here we show that if 20% of deaths, representing out-of-hospital deaths, are assigned a shorter illness period, then simulated daily mortality matches the revised PHE mortality at least until 4 May. We now predict that if the lockdown is gently relaxed in late May, whilst maintaining social distancing, there would be a modest second-wave which may be acceptable when weighed against the risks of maintaining the lockdown. Our model complements other more sophisticated work currently guiding national policy but which is not presently in the public domain.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lander, A.

Mental health is becoming an issue that cannot be ignored in our fight against it. This study aimed to explore the prevalence and factors linked to anxiety and depression in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: A total of 144 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in this study. We assessed depression and anxiety symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and social support using the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) among patients at admission. Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression. Results: Of the 144 participants, 34.72% and 28.47% patients with COVID-19 had symptoms of anxiety or depression, respectively. The bivariate correlations showed that less social support was correlated with more anxious (r=-0.196, p\u003C0.05) and depressive (r=-0.360\uFF0Cp\u003C0.05) symptoms among patients with COVID-19. The multiple linear regression analysis showed that gender (\u03B2=1.446, p=0.034), age (\u03B2=0.074, p=0.003), oxygen saturation (\u03B2 =-2.140, p=0.049), and social support (\u03B2 =-1.545, p=0.017) were associated with anxiety for COVID-19 patients. Moreover, age (\u03B2=0.084, p=0.001), family infection with SARS-CoV-2 (\u03B2 =1.515, p=0.027) and social support (\u03B2 =-2.236, p\uFF1C0.001) were the factors associated with depression.

This virus also was found in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). To determine the dynamics and associated lesions of hMPV infection, six cynomolgus macaques ( Macaca fascicularis ) were inoculated with hMPV and examined by pathological and virological assays. They were euthanized at 5 ( n = 2) or 9 ( n = 2) days post-infection (dpi), or monitored until 14 dpi ( n = 2). Viral excretion peaked at 4 dpi and decreased to zero by 10 dpi. Viral replication was restricted to the respiratory tract and associated with minimal to mild, multi-focal erosive and inflammatory changes in conducting airways, and increased numbers of macrophages in alveoli. Viral expression was seen mainly at the apical surface of ciliated epithelial cells throughout the respiratory tract, and less frequently in type 1 pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages. Both cell tropism and respiratory lesions were distinct from those of SARS-associated coronavirus infection, excluding hMPV as the primary cause of SARS. This study demonstrates that hMPV is a respiratory pathogen and indicates that viral replication is short-lived, polarized to the apical surface, and occurs primarily in ciliated respiratory epithelial cells.","publish_time":"2004-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuiken, Thijs; van den Hoogen, Bernadette G.; van Riel, Debby A.J.; Laman, Jon D.; van Amerongen, Geert; Sprong, Leo; Fouchier, Ron A.M.; Osterhaus, Albert D.M.E.","journal":"The American Journal of Pathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bad208dd9e4c71121ae4160ccf916c9f69eb62a3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002944010637509; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002944010637509","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs4Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory lesions","respiratory pathogen","associated lesions of hMPV infection","ciliated respiratory epithelial cells","unexplained respiratory tract illnesses","SARS-associated coronavirus infection","Viral replication","severe acute respiratory syndrome","Viral expression","Viral excretion","apical surface of ciliated epithelial cells","days post-infection","primary cause of SARS","alveolar macrophages","increased numbers of macrophages","inflammatory changes","airways","cynomolgus macaques","human metapneumovirus","patients","Macaca fascicularis","substantial proportion","type","cell tropism","dynamics","pneumocytes","alveoli","virological assays","study"],"language":"en"},

In spite of several observational studies and a few randomized controlled trials, the effect of hydroxychloroquine on patients with COVID 19 infection remains unclear. We undertook this systematic review with meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine among patients with COVID 19 infection. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, medRxiv, and other relevant resources until May 13, 2020. We included randomized controlled trials and observational studies in which hydroxychloroquine was adminstered and compared to a control group. Data were extracted, and quality assessment of the studies was carried out. We evaluated symptomatic progression, mortality, viral clearance, the evolution of changes on chest CT imaging, and adverse events. A fixed or random-effects model was used depending on outcome heterogeneity. Results We included eleven studies including, three randomized controlled trials and eight observational studies. Among these, 2354 patients received hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination, while 1952 did not. Mortality was reported at different points of time. The overall mortality was not significantly different among patients who received hydroxychloroquine compared to the control group (OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 0.76 to 2.62; p = 0.28). Clinical worsening or lack of symptomatic improvement did not differ between patients who received hydroxychloroquine compared to those who did not (OR 1.1, 95% CI: 0.6 to 2.02; p = 0.76). Viral clearance, assessed by RT-PCR, did not differ significantly between the hydroxychloroquine and the control groups (OR: 1.13, CI: 0.26 to 5.01; p = 0.87). The evolution of changes on chest CT imaging was reported only in two studies; a more pronounced improvement was observed with the use of hydroxychloroquine compared to standard care (OR: 2.68, CI: 1.1 to 6.6; P = 0.03). The incidence of adverse events was significantly higher with hydroxychloroquine (OR: 4.1, CI: 1.42 to 11.88; p = 0.009). Conclusions Our meta-analysis does not suggest improvement in clinical progression, mortality, or viral clearance by RT PCR among patients with COVID 19 infection who are treated with hydroxychloroquine.

To rule out the possibility that a potential association could be due to lithium\u0027s effect on psychiatric symptoms, we also studied the effect of the most common alternative to lithium to prevent mood episodes in bipolar disorder, valproate.

Aims: To estimate the prevalence of common mental health disorders in HCWs based in hospitals where pandemic-affected patients were treated. Method: Databases were searched for studies published before 30th March 2020. Quantitative synthesis was used to obtain estimates of the prevalence of mental health disorders in four time windows, determined a priori (the acute phase, i.e. during and up to 1.5 months post-pandemic; 1.5-5.9 months; 6-11.9 months; 12 months and later). Results: Nineteen studies met the review criteria. They predominantly addressed the acute phase of the SARS outbreak in Asia. The most studied outcomes were clinically-significant post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and general psychiatric caseness. For clinically significant PTSS in the acute phase, the prevalence estimate was 23.4% (95% CI 16.3, 31.2; N=4147; I2=96.2%); in the 12 months plus window, the estimate was 11.9% (8.4, 15.8; N=1136; I2=74.3%).

Conclusions: Mental health disorders are particularly common in HCWs working with pandemic-afflicted patients immediately following a pandemic, but the course of disorders following this period is poorly understood. PTSS remained elevated compared to the general population at 12 months, despite there being some evidence for natural recovery. There was considerable heterogeneity, likely linked to methodological differences. More extended follow up of HCWs is needed.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Allan, S.

We aimed to report several changes in the clinical characteristics at admission of patients with COVID-19. Methods Clinical records and laboratory results of patients suffering from COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed and matched with the admission dates to analyze the changes in characteristics at the onset of illness. Results Of the 89 affected patients, 31 [34.8%] patients were admitted from January 16 to 22, and 58 [65.2%] were admitted from January 23 to 29. Patients were admitted with more systemic symptoms, such as fever (21 [67.7%] of 31), fatigue (13 [41.9%] of 31), and myalgia (7 [22.6%] of 31), before January 23. More patients (10 [32.3%] of 31) admitted before January 23 had a small amount of sputum production compared with a smaller proportion (4 [6.9%] of 58) of the patients admitted after January 23. Other symptoms, such as cough, nausea, diarrhea, and chest tightness, were not significantly different between the two groups. In addition, the group admitted before January 23 had a larger proportion of patients with reduced lymphocyte (13 [54.2%] of 24), CD3 (11 [54.4%] of 21), and CD8 (9 [42.9%] of 21) counts and elevated serum amyloid A (SAA, 18 [75%] of 24). Conclusions The initial symptoms of recently infected patients seem more insidious, indicating that the new coronavirus may gradually evolve into a virus similar to influenza and latent in asymptomatic carriers for a long time.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Zhaowei; Hu, Jijia; Zhang, Zongwei; Jiang, Shan; Wang, Tao; Shi, Zhengli; Zhang, Zhan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ab795fc615df6457551a8e231dce1f268eef9d2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030833","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs4OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["admission of patients","infected patients","affected patients","laboratory results of patients","larger proportion of patients","COVID","clinical characteristics","changes","initial symptoms","systemic symptoms","new coronavirus","smaller proportion","admission dates","new period","Methods Clinical records","novel coronavirus disease","treatment","asymptomatic carriers","influenza","prevention","nausea","generation transmission","chest tightness","diarrhea","virus similar","sputum production","reduced lymphocyte","long time","elevated serum amyloid","SAA","emergence","cough","Conclusions","onset of illness","Background","fever","addition","groups","fatigue","myalgia","CD3","CD8"],"language":"en"},

SARS-CoV, the agent responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, utilizes ACE2 and TMPRSS2 host molecules for viral entry. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have recently been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. Additional host molecules including ADAM17, cathepsin L, CD147, and GRP78 may also function as receptors for SARS-CoV-2. To determine the expression and in situ localization of candidate SARS-CoV-2 receptors in the respiratory mucosa, we analyzed gene expression datasets from airway epithelial cells of 515 healthy subjects, gene promoter activity analysis using the FANTOM5 dataset containing 120 distinct sample types, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of 10 healthy subjects, immunoblots on multiple airway epithelial cell types, and immunohistochemistry on 98 human lung samples. We demonstrate absent to low ACE2 promoter activity in a variety of lung epithelial cell samples and low ACE2 gene expression in both microarray and scRNAseq datasets of epithelial cell populations. Consistent with gene expression, rare ACE2 protein expression was observed in the airway epithelium and alveoli of human lung. We present confirmatory evidence for the presence of TMPRSS2, CD147, and GRP78 protein in vitro in airway epithelial cells and confirm broad in situ protein expression of CD147 in the respiratory mucosa. Collectively, our data suggest the presence of a mechanism dynamically regulating ACE2 expression in human lung, perhaps in periods of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and also suggest that alternate receptors for SARS-CoV-2 exist to facilitate initial host cell infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aguiar, Jennifer A.; Tremblay, Benjamin J-M.; Mansfield, Michael J.; Woody, Owen; Lobb, Briallen; Banerjee, Arinjay; Chandiramohan, Abiram; Tiessen, Nicholas; Dvorkin-Gheva, Anna; Revill, Spencer; Miller, Matthew S.; Carlsten, Christopher; Organ, Louise; Joseph, Chitra; John, Alison; Hanson, Paul; McManus, Bruce M.; Jenkins, Gisli; Mossman, Karen; Ask, Kjetil; Doxey, Andrew C.; Hirota, Jeremy A.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.030742","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs5MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE2 expression","low ACE2 gene expression","SARS outbreak","periods of SARS","gene expression datasets","rare ACE2 protein expression","situ protein expression of CD147","airway epithelial cells","situ localization of candidate SARS-CoV","multiple airway epithelial cell types","variety of lung epithelial cell samples","scRNAseq datasets of epithelial cell populations","low ACE2 promoter activity","human lung samples","initial host cell infection","TMPRSS2 host molecules","alveoli of human lung","airway epithelium","GRP78 protein","presence of TMPRSS2","viral infection","gene promoter activity analysis","healthy subjects","single cell RNA sequencing","Additional host molecules","respiratory mucosa","alternate receptors","viral entry","distinct sample types","microarray","FANTOM5 dataset","immunohistochemistry","cathepsin","ADAM17","mechanism","agent responsible","confirmatory evidence","COVID","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

Self-collected swabs offer many advantages provided detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses is not compromised. METHODS In a prospective study, patients attending dedicated COVID-19 collection clinics were offered the option to first self-collect (SC) nasal and throat swabs prior to health worker collection (HC). Two different laboratory services participated, with HC at Site 1 collecting nasal and throat swabs and at Site 2 nasopharyngeal (NP) and throat swabs. Samples were analysed for SARS-CoV-2 as well as common respiratory viruses. Concordance of results between methods was assessed using Cohens kappa (\u03BA). RESULTS Of 236 patients sampled by HC and SC, 25 had COVID-19 (24 by HC and 25 by SC) and 63 had other respiratory viruses (56 by HC and 58 by SC). SC was highly concordant with HC (\u03BA = 0.890) for all viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and more concordant than HC to positive results by any method (\u03BA = 0.959 vs 0.933). CONCLUSIONS Self-collection of throat and nasal swabs offers a reliable alternative to health worker collection for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and other common respiratory viruses. High viral load of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the respiratory tract and sensitive molecular methods may explain these findings. Self-collection also provides patients with easier access to testing, reduces the exposure of the community and health workers to those undergoing testing and reduces the requirement for PPE.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wehrhahn, Michael C; Robson, Jennifer; Brown, Suzanne; Bursle, Evan; Byrne, Shane; New, David; Chong, Smathi; Newcombe, James P; Sivertsen, Terri; Hadlow, Narelle","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.20057901","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs5MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE","HC","SC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HC","SARS-CoV","throat swabs","SC","nasal swabs","Self-collected swabs","common respiratory viruses","health worker collection","BACKGROUND Swabs","CONCLUSIONS Self-collection of throat","diagnosis of SARS","collection clinics","patients","health workers","respiratory tract","detection rate of SARS","health care workers","High viral load of SARS","Site","testing","positive results","PPE","Concordance of results","sensitive molecular methods","dedicated COVID","reliable alternative","advantages","use of personal protective equipment","exposure","prospective study","easier access","option","risk of infection","NP","Cohens kappa","different laboratory services","findings","community","vs","requirement","Samples"],"language":"en"},

Here we developed a pilot-scale production of a purified inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine candidate (PiCoVacc), which induced SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, rats and non-human primates. These antibodies potently neutralized 10 representative SARS-CoV-2 strains, indicative of a possible broader neutralizing ability against SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating worldwide. Immunization with two different doses (3\u03BCg or 6 \u03BCg per dose) provided partial or complete protection in macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, respectively, without any antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. Systematic evaluation of PiCoVacc via monitoring clinical signs, hematological and biochemical index, and histophathological analysis in macaques suggests that it is safe.

The susceptibility of patients with rheumatic diseases, and the risks or benefits of immunosuppressive therapies for COVID-19 are unknown. Methods. We performed a retrospective study with patients under follow-up in rheumatology departments from seven hospitals in Spain.

Incidences of PCR\u002B confirmed COVID-19 were compared among groups. Results. Patients with chronic inflammatory diseases had 1.32-fold higher prevalence of hospital PCR\u002B COVID-19 than the reference population (0.76% vs 0.58%).

The mouse disease is primarily immune-mediated because demyelination is not detected in JHM-infected mice lacking T or B cells but does occur after transfer of JHM-specific T cells. Although less is known about the ability of antibodies to mediate demyelination, the presence of oligoclonally expanded B cells and high concentrations of antibodies (against self or infectious agents) in the central nervous system of many multiple sclerosis patients suggests that antibodies may also contribute to myelin destruction. Here, we show that anti-JHM antibodies, in the absence of T or B cells, caused demyelination in JHM-infected mice. Anti-JHM antibody was detected adjacent to areas of demyelination, consistent with a direct interaction between antibody and infected cells. Demyelination was reduced by 85 to 90% in infected RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice lacking normal expression of activating Fc receptors (FcR\u03B3\u2212/\u2212) and by \u223C76% when complement was depleted by treatment with cobra venom factor.

We report the median expected delay achievable in each scenario and an inner 50% interval. Results: Under baseline assumptions, introducing exit and entry screening in combination with traveller sensitisation can delay a local SARS-CoV-2 outbreak by 8 days (50% interval: 3-14 days) when the rate of importation is 1 infected traveller per week at time of introduction. The additional benefit of entry screening is small if exit screening is effective: the combination of only exit screening and traveller sensitisation can delay an outbreak by 7 days (50% interval: 2-13 days). In the absence of screening, with less effective sensitisation, or a higher rate of importation, these delays shrink rapidly to less than 4 days. Conclusion: Syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation in combination may have marginally delayed SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in unaffected countries.","publish_time":"2020-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Clifford, Samuel J; Pearson, Carl A B; Klepac, Petra; Van Zandvoort, Kevin; Quilty, Billy J; Eggo, Rosalind M; Flasche, Stefan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f29dfcd082fe2129574776158dcee28fe7a01cbc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022426","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs5Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["exit screening","effectiveness of traveller sensitisation","days","effective sensitisation","absence of screening","effectiveness of syndromic screening","local SARS-CoV","arrival rates of infected travellers","combination","infected air travellers","sustained SARS-CoV","delayed SARS-CoV","additional benefit of entry screening","interval","number of infected arrivals","unaffected countries","median expected delay achievable","secondary infections rates","higher rate of importation","community transmission","average number of secondary cases","introduction routes","time of introduction","unaffected country","present sensitivity analyses","symptom onset","rapid self-isolation","reporting","uncertainty","scenario","outbreaks","week","departure","baseline assumptions","aim","account","COVID","Conclusion","contact tracing","affected regions","stochastic simulations","symptoms","delays","interventions","Methods","Results","Background"],"language":"en"},

The United States and the United Kingdom estimated the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce COVID-19 deaths, but there is less evidence to support choice of control measures in middle-income countries4. We used Colombia, an upper-middle income country, as a case-study to assess the effect of social interventions to suppress or mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we show that a combination of social distancing interventions, triggered by critical care admissions, can suppress and mitigate the peak of COVID-19, resulting in less critical care use, hospitalizations, and deaths. We found, through a mathematical simulation model, that a one-time social intervention may delay the number of critical care admissions and deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a series of social interventions (social and work distance and school closures) over a period of a year can reduce the expected burden of COVID-19, however, these interventions imply long periods of lockdown. Colombia would prevent up to 97% of COVID-19 deaths using these triggered series of interventions during the first year.

Approach: We fit a spatiotemporal Negative Binomial generalised linear model to Public Health England SARS-CoV-2 testing data at the Lower Tier Local Authority region level. We assume an order-1 autoregressive model for case progression within regions, coupling discrete spatial units via observed commuting data and time-varying measures of traffic flow. We fit the model via maximum likelihood estimation in order to calculate region-specific risk of ongoing transmission, as well as measuring regional uncertainty in incidence. Results: We detect marked heterogeneity across England in COVID-19 incidence, not only in raw estimated incidence, but in the characteristics of within-region and between-region dynamics of PHE testing data. There is evidence for a spatially diverse set of regions having a higher daily increase of cases than others, having accounted for current case numbers, population size, and human mobility. Uncertainty in model estimates is generally greater in rural regions. Conclusions: A wide range of spatial heterogeneity in COVID-19 epidemic distribution and infection rate exists in England currently. Future work should incorporate fine-scaled demographic and health covariates, with continued improvement in spatially-detailed case reporting data. The method described here may be used to measure heterogeneity in real-time as behavioural and social interventions are relaxed, serving to identify \u0022hotspots\u0022 of resurgent cases occurring in diverse areas of the country, and triggering locally-intensive surveillance and interventions as needed. Caveats: There is general concern over the ability of PHE testing data to capture the true prevalence of infection within the population, though this approach is designed to provide measures of spatial prevalence based on testing that can be used to guide further future testing effort. Now-casts of epidemic characteristics are presented based on testing data alone (as opposed to \u0022true\u0022 prevalence in any one area). The model used in this analysis is phenomenological for ease and speed of principled parameter inference; we choose the model which best fits the current spatial case timeseries, without attempting to enforce \u0022SIR\u0022-type epidemic dynamics.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fronterre, C.; Read, J.

Knowledge of coronavirus-related risk factors can help countries build more systematic and successful responses to COVID-19 disease outbreak. Here we used Supervised Machine Learning and Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK) techniques to reveal correlates and patterns of COVID-19 Disease outbreak in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Methods: We analyzed time series aggregate data compiled by Johns Hopkins University on the outbreak of COVID-19 disease across SSA. COVID-19 data was merged with additional data on socio-demographic and health indicator survey data for 39 of SSA 48 countries that reported confirmed cases and deaths from coronavirus between February 28, 2020 through March 26, 2020. We used supervised machine learning algorithm, Lasso for variable selection and statistical inference. EBK was used to also create a raster estimating the spatial distribution of COVID-19 disease outbreak. Results: The lasso Cross-fit partialing out predictive model ascertained seven variables significantly associated with the risk of coronavirus infection (i.e. new HIV infections among pediatric, adolescent, and middle-aged adult PLHIV, time (days), pneumococcal conjugate-based vaccine, incidence of malaria and diarrhea treatment). Our study indicates, the doubling time in new coronavirus cases was 3 days. The steady three-day decrease in coronavirus outbreak rate of change (ROC) from 37% on March 23, 2020 to 23% on March 26, 2020 indicates the positive impact of countries\u0027 steps to stymie the outbreak. The interpolated maps show that coronavirus is rising every day and appears to be severely confined in South Africa. In the West African region (i.e. Burkina Faso, Ghana, Senegal, CotedIviore, Cameroon, and Nigeria), we predict that new cases and deaths from the virus are most likely to increase. Interpretation: Integrated and efficiently delivered interventions to reduce HIV, pneumonia, malaria and diarrhea, are essential to accelerating global health efforts. Scaling up screening and increasing COVID-19 testing capacity across SSA countries can help provide better understanding on how the pandemic is progressing and possibly ensure a sustained decline in the ROC of coronavirus outbreak.

Calculation of metamedians from the two papers classifying severe disease according to death alone gave 1.1 1x109/L lymphocytes (95% CI 1.0-1.1) for \u201Csurvivors\u201D (n=163) and 0.63 1x109/L lymphocytes (95% CI 0.60-0.63) for \u201Cnon-survivors\u201D (n=253) of SAR-CoV-2 disease. Conclusions: Lower lymphocyte counts are significantly associated with more severe disease in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lymphocytopenia may therefore be useful laboratory measure to allow prognostication of patients presenting with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brown, Robin A C; Barnard, Jane; Harris-Skillman, Eva; Harbinson, Bronwen; Dunne, Beata; Drake, Jonathan; Roche, Sophie; Harris, Edward; Gunnel, James; Frost, Joshu; Angus, Brian; Hodgson, Susanne","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.20064659","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs2MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Metanalysis"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["definition of severe disease","SARS-CoV","clinical disease","non-severe SAR-CoV","increased disease severity","prognostication of patients","severity of SARS","papers","lymphocytes","non-survivors","metamedians of 1x109","low lymphocyte count","death","meta-analysis","infection","Lower lymphocyte counts","p-value","favourable outcomes","Calculation of metamedians","useful laboratory measure","risk of poor outcomes","multi-organ failure","acute respiratory distress syndrome","association","systematic review","Lymphocytopenia","Wilcoxon test","Conclusions","Evidence","Methods","Markers","Metanalysis","data","Background","Heterogenicity","Results","7x109"],"language":"en"},

Methods: We used individual-case data from mainland China and cases detected outside mainland China to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the CFR by relating the aggregate distribution of cases by dates of onset to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for the demography of the population, and age and location-based under ascertainment. We additionally estimated the CFR from individual linelist data on 1,334 cases identified outside mainland China. We used data on the PCR prevalence in international residents repatriated from China at the end of January 2020 to obtain age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio (IFR). Using data on age stratified severity in a subset of 3,665 cases from China, we estimated the proportion of infections that will likely require hospitalisation. Findings: We estimate the mean duration from onset-of-symptoms to death to be 17.8 days (95% credible interval, crI 16.9,19.2 days) and from onset-of-symptoms to hospital discharge to be 22.6 days (95% crI 21.1,24.4 days). We estimate a crude CFR of 3.67% (95% crI 3.56%,3.80%) in cases from mainland China. Adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment of milder cases in Wuhan relative to the rest of China, we obtain a best estimate of the CFR in China of 1.38% (95% crI 1.23%,1.53%) with substantially higher values in older ages. Our estimate of the CFR from international cases stratified by age (under 60 or 60 and above) are consistent with these estimates from China. We obtain an overall IFR estimate for China of 0.66% (0.39%,1.33%), again with an increasing profile with age. Interpretation: These early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and demonstrate a strong age-gradient in risk.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Verity, Robert; Okell, Lucy C; Dorigatti, Ilaria; Winskill, Peter; Whittaker, Charles; Imai, Natsuko; Cuomo-Dannenburg, Gina; Thompson, Hayley; Walker, Patrick; Fu, Han; Dighe, Amy; Griffin, Jamie; Cori, Anne; Baguelin, Marc; Bhatia, Sangeeta; Boonyasiri, Adhiratha; Cucunuba, Zulma M; Fitzjohn, Rich; Gaythorpe, Katy A M; Green, Will; Hamlet, Arran; Hinsley, Wes; Laydon, Daniel; Nedjati-Gilani, Gemma; Riley, Steven; van-Elsand, Sabine; Volz, Erik; Wang, Haowei; Wang, Yuanrong; Xi, Xiayoue; Donnelly, Christl; Ghani, Azra; Ferguson, Neil","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ac26ccdd374e8538b460d6666e7cb16692478f0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033357","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs2NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CFR"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["rest of China","outside mainland China","international cases","obtained age-stratified estimates","age stratified severity","days","crI","onset of symptoms","crude CFR","best estimate","strong age-gradient","aggregate distribution of cases","early estimates","under-ascertainment of milder cases","individual-case data","dates of onset","infection fatality ratio","individual linelist data","range of case fatality ratio","hospital discharge","demography","international residents","spectrum of COVID","overall IFR","Wuhan relative","outcome","observed cumulative deaths","time","subset","PCR prevalence","constant attack rate","disease","indication","credible interval","mean duration","higher values","older ages","risk","Background","population","location","end","Findings","proportion of infections","Methods","Interpretation","increasing profile","hospitalisation","magnitude"],"language":"en"},

Here we assayed both antibody and T-cell reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens in COVID-19 convalescent patients and healthy donors sampled before and during the pandemic. Our results show that while anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can distinguish convalescent patients from healthy donors, the magnitude of T-cell response was more pronounced in healthy donors sampled during COVID-19 pandemic than in donors sampled before the outbreak. This hints at the possibility that some individuals have encountered the virus but were protected by T-cell cross-reactivity observed. A public and diverse T-cell response was observed for two A*02-restricted SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, revealing a set of T-cell receptor motifs displaying germline-encoded features. Bulk CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein S is characterized by multiple groups of homologous T-cell receptor sequences some of which are shared across multiple donors, indicating the existence of immunodominant epitopes. Overall, our findings indicate that T cells form an efficient response to SARS-CoV-2 and alongside the antibodies can serve as a useful biomarker for surveying SARS-CoV-2 exposure and immunity.

A series of intervention strategies have been implemented, but didn\u0027t stop its spread. Methods: Two mathematical models have been developed to simulate the current epidemic situation in the city of Wuhan and in other parts of China. Special considerations were given to the mobility of people for the estimation and forecast the number of asymptomatic infections, symptomatic infections, and the infections of super-spreading events (Isse). Findings: The basic reproductive number (R0) was calculated for the period between 18 January 2020 and 16 February 2020: R0 declined from 5.75 to 1.69 in Wuhan and from 6.22 to 1.67 in the entire country (not including the Wuhan area). At the same time, Wuhan is estimated to observe a peak in the number of confirmed cases around 6 February 2020. The number of infected individuals in the entire country (not including the Wuhan area) peaked around February 3. The results also show that the peak of new asymptomatic cases per day in Wuhan occurred on February 6, and the peak of new symptomatic infections have occurred on February 3. Concurrently, while the number of confirmed cases nationwide would continue to decline, the number of real-time COVID-19 inpatients in Wuhan has reached a peak of 13,030 on February 14 before it decreases. The model further shows that the COVID-19 cases will gradually wane by the end of April 2020, both in Wuhan and the other parts of China. The number of confirmed cases would reach the single digit on March 27 in Wuhan and March 19 in the entire country. The five cities with top risk index in China with the exclusion of Wuhan are: Huanggang, Xiaogan, Jingzhou, Chongqing, and Xiangyang city. Interpretations: Although the national peak time has been reached, a significant proportion of asymptomatic patients and the infections of super-spreading events (Isse) still exist in the population, indicating the potential difficulty for the prevention and control of the disease. As the Return-to-Work tide is approaching and upgrading, further measures (e.g., escalatory quarantine, mask wearing when going out, and sit apart when taking vehicles) will be particularly crucial to stop the COVID-19 in other cities outside of Wuhan.","publish_time":"2020-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pan, Jinhua; Yao, Ye; Liu, Zhixi; Li, Mengyi; Wang, Ying; Dong, Weizhen; Kan, Haidong; Wang, Weibing","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025387","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs2OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["city of Wuhan","Wuhan area","exclusion of Wuhan","number of confirmed cases","number of asymptomatic infections","peak of new asymptomatic cases","number of real-time COVID","peak of new symptomatic infections","cases occurrence","infections of super-spreading events","basic reproductive number","number of infected individuals","parts of China","entire country","national peak time","Isse","cities","R0","significant proportion of asymptomatic patients","Xiangyang city","Coronavirus Disease","Jingzhou","Chongqing","Huanggang","inpatients","day","potential difficulty","prevention","control","risk index","Xiaogan","estimation","single digit","current epidemic situation","escalatory quarantine","mobility of people","population","Findings","Interpretations","Return","Work tide","provinces","neighboring countries","series of intervention strategies","Methods","mathematical models","measures","mask","Special considerations","Background","vehicles","period","results","end"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we present a model-based systems analysis to assess the effectiveness of social distancing measures in terms of intensity and duration of application.

Despite governmental initiatives aimed at containing the spread of the disease, several countries are experiencing unmanageable increases in the demand for ICU beds, medical equipment, and larger testing capacity. Efficient COVID-19 diagnosis enables healthcare systems to provide better care for patients while protecting caregivers from the disease. However, many countries are constrained by the limited amount of test kits available, the lack of equipment and trained professionals. In the case of patients visiting emergency rooms (ERs) with a suspect of COVID-19, a prompt diagnosis can improve the outcome and even provide information for efficient hospital management. In this context, a quick, inexpensive and readily available test to perform an initial triage at ER could help to smooth patient flow, provide better patient care, and reduce the backlog of exams. Methods: In this Case-control quantitative study, we developed a strategy backed by artificial intelligence to perform an initial screening of suspect COVID-19 cases. We developed a machine learning classifier that takes widely available simple blood exams as input and predicts if that suspect case is likely to be positive (having SARS-CoV-2) or negative(not having SARS-CoV-2). Based on this initial classification, positive cases can be referred for further highly sensitive testing (e.g. CT scan, or specific antibodies). We used publicly available data from the Albert Einstein Hospital in Brazil from 5,644 patients. Focussing on using simple blood exams, a sample of 599 subjects that had the fewest missing values for 16 common exams were selected. From these 599 patients, only 81 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (determined by RT-PCR). Based on this data, we built an artificial intelligence classification framework, ER-CoV, aiming at determining which patients were more likely to be negative for SARS-CoV-2 when visiting an ER and that were categorized as a suspect case by medical professionals. The primary goal of this investigation is to develop a classifier with high specificity and high negative predictive values, with reasonable sensitivity. Findings: We identified that our framework achieved an average specificity of 92.16% [95% CI 91.73 - 92.59] and negative predictive value (NPV) of 95.29% [95% CI 94.65% - 95.90%]. Those values are completely aligned with our goal of providing an effective low-cost system to triage suspected patients at ERs. As for sensitivity, our model achieved an average of 63.98% [95% CI 59.82% - 67.50%] and positive predictive value (PPV) of 48.00% [95% CI 44.88% - 51.56%]. An error analysis identified that, on average, 45% of the false negative results would have been hospitalized anyway, thus the model is making mistakes for severe cases that would not be overlooked, partially mitigating the fact that the test is not high-sensitive. All code for our AI model, called ER-CoV is publicly available at https://github.com/soares-f/ER-CoV. Interpretation: Based on the capacity of our model to accurately predict which cases are negative from suspected patients arriving at emergency rooms, we envision that this framework can play an important role in patient triage. Probably the most important outcome is related to testing availability, which at this point is extremely low in many countries. Considering the achieved specificity, we would reduce by at least 90% the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests performed at emergency rooms, with the chance of getting a false negative at around 5%. The second important outcome is related to patient management in hospitals. Patients predicted as positive by our framework could be immediately separated from the other patients while waiting for the results of confirmatory tests. This could reduce the spread rate inside hospitals since in many hospitals all suspected cases are kept in the same ward. In Brazil, where the data was collected, rate infection is starting to quickly spread, the lead time of a SARS-CoV-2 can be up to 2 weeks.

Viral Papain-Like cysteine protease (PLpro, NSP3) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication and represents a promising target for the development of antiviral drugs. Here, we used a combinatorial substrate library containing natural and a wide variety of nonproteinogenic amino acids and performed comprehensive activity profiling of SARS-CoV-2-PLpro. On the scaffold of best hits from positional scanning we designed optimal fluorogenic substrates and irreversible inhibitors with a high degree of selectivity for SARS PLpro variants versus other proteases. We determined crystal structures of two of these inhibitors (VIR250 and VIR251) in complex with SARS-CoV-2-PLpro which reveals their inhibitory mechanisms and provides a structural basis for the observed substrate specificity profiles. Lastly, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-PLpro harbors deISGylating activities similar to SARS-CoV-1-PLpro but its ability to hydrolyze K48-linked Ub chains is diminished, which our sequence and structure analysis provides a basis for. Altogether this work has revealed the molecular rules governing PLpro substrate specificity and provides a framework for development of inhibitors with potential therapeutic value or drug repositioning.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rut, Wioletta; Lv, Zongyang; Zmudzinski, Mikolaj; Patchett, Stephanie; Nayak, Digant; Snipas, Scott J.; El Oualid, Farid; Huang, Tony T.; Bekes, Miklos; Drag, Marcin; Olsen, Shaun K.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ea22ca5c8622d58a7133ec6ad3667b2821e2bb31.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.29.068890","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","SARS PLpro variants","PLpro substrate specificity","development of inhibitors","comprehensive activity profiling of SARS","PLpro harbors deISGylating activities similar","irreversible inhibitors","observed substrate specificity profiles","combinatorial substrate library","structural basis","development of antiviral drugs","positional scanning","wide variety of nonproteinogenic amino acids","optimal fluorogenic substrates","high degree of selectivity","potential therapeutic value","framework","cysteine protease","NSP3","molecular rules","drug repositioning","promising target","scaffold of best hits","K48-linked Ub chains","COVID","novel coronavirus infection","sequence","ability","inhibitory mechanisms","VIR251","complex","replication","Viral Papain","cases","structure analysis","VIR250","proteases","Wuhan","crystal structures","China"],"language":"en"},

It is therefore necessary to evaluate the disease outcomes among the African countries as the situation unfolds for early identification of best practices for adoption. Methods: In this study, COVID-19 disease outcomes (confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries), testing capacities and disease management approaches among African countries were evaluated. The relationship between COVID-19 infections in African countries and their performance on global resilient indices including the Human Development Index (HDI), performance on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Global Risk Index (GRI) were also examined. Data acquired from various standard databases were evaluated over a period of 75 days from the date of reporting the index case. Results: This study has revealed compelling spatial differences in the incidence, deaths and recoveries from COVID-19 among African countries. Egypt, South Africa, Morocco and Algeria were clustered as countries with highest values of COVID-19 disease outcomes on the continent during the 75-day period of observation. The cluster analysis and comparison of countries in terms of percentage recovered cases of confirmed infections revealed that Mauritius, Mauritania, Gambia, Burkina Faso, Madagascar, Togo and Uganda had the highest scores. Comparative analysis of COVID-19 across the world revealed that the parameters were relatively inconsequential in Oceania and Africa continents, while Europe, North America and Asia had significantly higher cases of disease outcomes. For COVID-19 testing capacities, South Africa, Ghana and Egypt are leading in total number of tests carried out. However when the number of tests carried out were related to population number of the countries, Djibouti, Mauritius, Ghana and South Africa are found to be the leading countries. With respect to management of the disease in Africa, all the countries adopted the WHO protocols, personal hygiene, economic palliatives and social distancing measures. Only three countries in Africa (Madagascar, Togo and Burkina Faso) had a state supported initiative to utilise traditional medicines or herbs as alternatives to control COVID-19. Additionally, most of the countries are providing prompt treatment of the patients with a range of drugs especially Hydroxychloroquine, Chloroquine and Chloroquine-Azithromycin combination. The study found that no strong relationship currently exists between the global resilient indicators (HDI, SDG and GRI) and COVID-19 cases across Africa. Conclusions: This study has revealed compelling spatial differences in disease outcomes among African countries and also found testing capacities for COVID-19 to be abysmally low in relation to the population. During the 75 days of observation, African countries have recorded significantly low number of deaths associated with COVID-19 and relatively high recovery rates. Countries in Africa with higher rate of recovery from the disease were found to have adopted strict adherence to some of WHO protocol to contain the disease, isolate all those who test positive to the disease and provide prompt treatment of the patients with a range of drugs especially Hydroxychloroquine, Chloroquine and Chloroquine-Azithromycin combination. The study recommends that the approaches adopted by the African countries which achieved high recovery rates from COVID-19 should be integrated into healthcare management plans for the disease across the continent even as the situation unfolds.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Otitoloju, A.

The government acted swiftly to contain transmission, with extensive public health measures. At the end of 30 days, Sri Lanka had 197 cases, 54 recovered and 7 deaths; a staged relaxing of the lockdown is now underway. This paper proposes a theoretical basis for estimating the limits within which transmission should be constrained in order to ensure that the case load remains within the capacity of the health system. Methods: We used the Susceptible, Infected, Recovered (SIR) model to explore the number of new infections and estimate ICU bed requirement at different levels of R0 values after lockout. We developed a web-based application that enables visualization of cases and ICU bed requirements with time, with adjustable parameters that include: population exposed; proportion asymptomatic; number of active and recovered cases; infectious period; R0 or doubling time; proportion critically ill; available ICU beds; duration of ICU stay; and uncertainty of projection. Results: The three-day moving average of the caseload suggested two waves of transmission from Day 0 to 17 (R0=3.32, 95% CI 1.85 - 5.41) and from Day 18 - 30 (R=1.25, 95%CI: 0.93 - 1.63). We estimate that if there are 156 active cases with 91 recovered at the time of lockout, and R increases to 1.5 (doubling time 19 days), under the standard parameters for Sri Lanka, the ICU bed capacity of 300 is likely to be saturated by about 100 days days, signalled by 18 new infections (95% CI 15 - 22) on Day 14 after lockout. Conclusion: Our model suggests that to ensure that the case load remains within the available capacity of the health system after lockout, transmission should not exceed R=1.5. This model and the web-based application may be useful in other low and middle income countries which have similar constraints on health resources.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ediriweera, Dileepa S; de Silva, Nilanthi R; Malavige, Neelika G; de Silva, H Janaka","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/68220aa23881ccc06387388320fd8b20d6f3a0aa.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.11.20061481","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs4MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["time of lockout","days days","ICU bed capacity","ICU bed requirements","duration of ICU","doubling time","Sri Lanka","active cases","health system","model","available ICU beds","available capacity","visualization of cases","waves of transmission","health resources","case load","number of new infections","number of active","web-based application","R increases","extensive public health measures","local case of COVID","different levels of R0 values","proportion asymptomatic","adjustable parameters","standard parameters","middle income countries","similar constraints","infectious period","caseload","population","three-day moving average","SIR","staged relaxing","theoretical basis","lockdown","Results","limits","deaths","order","end","uncertainty of projection","paper","Background","Methods","Conclusion","government"],"language":"en"},

Aim: The purpose of the present study was to investigate why a clinical MRSA isolate yielded false negative test results with widely used, commercial orfX/SCCmec junction site PCR tests. Methods: A collection of isolates that belonged to the same epidemic strain as the index isolate were investigated with commercial MRSA assays and all isolates were sequenced in order to explain this observation. Results: It was found that isolates of the epidemic European CC1-MRSA-IV clone, which likely originated in South-Eastern Europe and subsequently spread to Western Europe, generally exhibit this behaviour. The failure of the assays was attributable to a characteristic large insertion in the orfX/SCCmec integration site presumably targeted by such tests. In contrast to MW2 (GenBank BA000033.2, a CC1 USA400 strain which also harbours SCCmec IVa), the European CC1 clone harbours an insertion of ca. 5,350 nucleotides adjacent to orfX. This sequence starts with a novel SCC terminal sequence alternate to dcs and encodes six different hypothetical proteins (E7MHX1, ydiL2, C5QAP8, A8YYX4, npd-SCC, H4AYD7; nucleotide positions 280,690-286,024 of GenBank RBVO000005.1). An SCCmec element with the same insertion was previously found in a Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate (GenBank MH188467.1) suggesting transfer between staphylococcal species.

However, abrogating the inflammatory response in infectious diseases may impair a desired host response and predispose to secondary infection. To determine whether IL-6 inhibition is associated with an increased occurrence of secondary infections in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). We retrospectively reviewed the medical record of patients during an 8-week span and compared the incidence of secondary infection in patients who did and did not receive tocilizumab. The study was approved by the IRB. Additionally, we included representative histopathologic post-mortem findings from several COVID-19 cases that underwent autopsy at our institution. The study was conducted in a cohorted COVID-19 ICU at a tertiary care university medical center. Patients 18 years of age or older admitted to the adult COVID-19 intensive care unit with COVID-19 were randomly selected. We reviewed the occurrence and nature of secondary infections and clinical outcomes in patients who did and did not receive tocilizumab. Measures were formulated prior to the study. For autopsy findings, we were interested in the lung pathology. 60 patients were selected of which 28 had received tocilizumab while 32 had not. Receiving tocilizumab was associated with a higher risk of secondary bacterial (64.3% vs. 31.3%, p=0.010) and fungal (7.1% vs. 0%, p=0.096) infections. 7 cases underwent autopsy. In 3 cases, tocilizumab had previously been given. All 3 patients demonstrated evidence of pneumonia on pathology. Of the 4 cases that had not been given tocilizumab, 2 showed evidence of aspiration pneumonia and 2 exhibited diffuse alveolar damage. Experimental therapies are currently being applied to COVID-19 outside of clinical trials. Anti-inflammatory therapies such as anti-IL-6 therapy have the potential to impair viral clearance, predispose to secondary infection, and cause harm.

The Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to widespread concerns about the risk of infection in patients with rheumatic diseases (RD) receiving disease modifying ant-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and other immunosuppressants (IS). Methods. A SurveyMonkey based electronic survey was conducted amongst members of the Indian Rheumatology Association to understand the need for changes in prevailing practices. Results. Of the 861 invitees, 221 responded. In the wake of the pandemic, 47.5% would reduce biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) while only 12.2% would reduce the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs. 64.2% were likely to defer change in IS, the reluctance being most with rituximab (58.3%) followed by cyclophosphamide (53.3%), anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agents (52.4%) and Janus kinase inhibitors (34.39%). Hydroxychloroquine was the preferred choice (81.9%) for the treatment of COVID-19 followed by protease inhibitors (22.1%) and intravenous immunoglobulin (8.1%). Chloroquine was less preferred (19%).

Health systems will need surge capacity to absorb acute increases in caseload due to the pandemic. We assessed the capacity of the Kenyan health system to absorb surges in the number of people that will need hospitalization and critical care because of the COVID-19. Methods We assumed that 2% of the Kenyan population get symptomatic infection by SARS-Cov-2 based on modelled estimates for Kenya and determined the health system surge capacity for COVID-19 under three transmission curve scenarios, 6, 12, and 18 months. We estimated four measures of hospital surge capacity namely: 1) hospital bed surge capacity 2) ICU bed surge capacity 3) Hospital bed tipping point, and 5) ICU bed tipping point. We computed this nationally and for all the 47 county governments. Results The capacity of Kenyan hospitals to absorb increases in caseload due to COVID-19 is constrained by the availability of oxygen, with only 58% of hospital beds in hospitals with oxygen supply. There is substantial variation in hospital bed surge capacity across counties. For example, under the 6 months transmission scenario, the percentage of available general hospital beds that would be taken up by COVID-19 cases varied from 12% Tharaka Nithi county, to 145% in Trans Nzoia county. Kenya faces substantial gaps in ICU beds and ventilator capacity. Only 22 out of the 47 counties have at least 1 ICU unit. Kenya will need an additional 1,511 ICU beds and 1,609 ventilators (6 months transmission curve) to 374 ICU beds and 472 ventilators (18 months transmission curve) to absorb caseloads due to COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barasa, E.; Ouma, P.

Acute appendicitis is a very specific situation and the prevalence of this disease leads us to reconsider this particular disease in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. Indeed, while the currently recommended treatment for uncomplicated acute appendicitis is surgical appendectomy, the non-surgical alternative of medical management by antibiotic therapy alone has been widely evaluated by high-quality studies in the literature. Insofar as the main limitation of exclusively medical treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis is the risk of recurrent appendicitis, this treatment option represents an alternative of choice to reduce the intra-hospital overload in this context of health crisis. The aim of this work is therefore to provide physicians and surgeons with a practical guide based on a review of the literature on the medical treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults, to offer this alternative treatment to the right patients and under good conditions, especially when access to the operating room is limited or impossible.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Collard, Maxime; Lefevre, J\u00E9r\u00E9mie H.; Maggiori, L\u00E9on","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9d41e2dc68f1ef32a6180ba932dda9b781ec566d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878788620301193; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878788620301193?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["medical treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis","alternative treatment","treatment option","recommended treatment","urgent care","non-surgical alternative of medical management","risk of recurrent appendicitis","alternative of choice","right patients","COVID","quality of care","health care system","context of health crisis","surgeons","literature","non-urgent surgeries","massive inflow of patients","surgical appendectomy","particular disease","adults","intra-hospital overload","priority","order","France","overloaded hospitals","specific situation","antibiotic therapy","access","physicians","practical guide","good conditions","Deferring hospitalization","review","emergency surgery","main limitation","operating room","prevalence","Summary","loss of chance","work","high-quality studies","aim"],"language":"en"},

SARS-CoV-2 shares both high sequence similarity and the use of the same cell entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Several studies have provided bioinformatic evidence of potential routes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive and urinary systems. However, whether the reproductive system is a potential target of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been determined. Here, we investigate the expression pattern of ACE2 in adult human testes at the level of single-cell transcriptomes. The results indicate that ACE2 is predominantly enriched in spermatogonia and Leydig and Sertoli cells. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) indicates that Gene Ontology (GO) categories associated with viral reproduction and transmission are highly enriched in ACE2-positive spermatogonia, while male gamete generation related terms are downregulated. Cell-cell junction and immunity-related GO terms are increased in ACE2-positive Leydig and Sertoli cells, but mitochondria and reproduction-related GO terms are decreased. These findings provide evidence that the human testis is a potential target of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may have significant impact on our understanding of the pathophysiology of this rapidly spreading disease.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Zhengpin; Xu, Xiaojiang","journal":"Cells","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9040920; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32283711/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","potential target of SARS","ACE2-positive spermatogonia","ACE2-positive Leydig","Cell-cell junction","infection","bioinformatic evidence of potential routes of SARS","reproduction-related","cell transcriptomes","expression pattern of ACE2","immunity-related","Sertoli cells","cell entry receptor","male gamete generation related terms","human testis","viral reproduction","novel coronavirus","Gene Ontology","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","adult human testes","Gene Set Enrichment Analysis","use","GSEA","mitochondria","level of single","Wuhan","categories","angiotensin","transmission","shares","high sequence similarity","patients","Hubei Province","enzyme","urinary systems","significant impact","reproductive system","pathophysiology","understanding","China","findings","studies","COVID","disease","results"],"language":"en"},

We described a multimodal approach to assess patient eligible for hemispherectomy and possibly predicting post-surgical outcomes. METHODS We describe pre- and post-surgical clinical features along with neuroradiological results by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), MR-tractography (MRT), and neurophysiological study by single and paired pulses transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in a child with cerebral palsy with epileptic encephalopathy, eligible for epilepsy surgery. RESULTS Presurgical TMS evaluation showed a lateralization of motor function on the left motor cortex for both arms, and results were confirmed by MRI studies. Interestingly, after surgery, both epilepsy and motor performances improved and TMS showed enhancement of intracortical inhibition and facilitation activity. CONCLUSION Functional hemispherectomy is an effective treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy, and multimodal presurgical assessment may be a useful approach to guide surgeons in selecting patients.

The conceptual model draws on existing theory and previous research and was empirically tested on a sample of cruise ship employee internet users. Result show that while being onboard a cruise ship, employees experience strong social pressure to be constantly available and they fear of missing out on important information and life events. Thus, relatedness to friends and family needs satisfaction is of paramount importance for cruise ship employees because they are fully aware that they are dispensable and replaceable to cruise ship companies, however to their friends and family, they are indispensable and unique. Moreover, employees who engage in other tasks/activities while taking part in online communication with friends and family exhibit reduced performance, which leads to poor interaction and social dissatisfaction. Lastly, employees experiencing under-reciprocating exchanges show significant negative effects on their well-being.

The results of the search yielded 5 studies which met the criteria for inclusion and analysis. All studies compared TCA (n = 922) with EEA (n = 141) outcomes for OGMs. Overall, the rate of gross total resection (GTR) was lower among the endoscopic group (70.9%) relative to the transcranial group (91.5%). The rate of post-operative CSF leak was 6.3% vs. 25.5% for the transcranial and endoscopic groups, respectively. Post-operative anosmia was higher for patients undergoing EEA (95.9%) compared with patients in the transcranial group (37.4%). In this analysis, EEA was associated with a lower rate of GTR and higher incidences of CSF leaks and post-operative anosmia. However, with increasing surgeon familiarity of the endoscopic anatomy and technique for managing ASB pathologies, a nuanced approach may be used to minimize patient morbidity and widen the spectrum of skull base surgery.","publish_time":"2019-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Purohit, Aarti; Jha, Roshani; Khalafallah, Adham M; Price, Carrie; Rowan, Nicholas R; Mukherjee, Debraj","journal":"Neurosurgical review","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10143-019-01193-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31709465/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EEA","TCA","CSF","GTR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["outcomes of EEA management","Post-operative anosmia","transcranial group","rate of post-operative CSF leak","post-operative complications","TCA","studies","lower rate of GTR","endoscopic endonasal approach","conventional transcranial approach","endoscopic anatomy","endoscopic groups","treatment of OGMs","rate of gross total resection","ASB pathologies","higher incidences of CSF leaks","nuanced approach","patients","analysis","management of anterior skull base","spectrum of skull base surgery","increasing utility","optimal treatment strategy","increasing surgeon familiarity","olfactory groove meningiomas","incidence of cerebrospinal fluid","technique","study","patient morbidity","criteria","inclusion","Data","systematic review","results","search","project"],"language":"en"},

The patient was initially evaluated at hospital A on February 15; at that time, COVID-19 was not suspected, as the patient denied travel or contact with symptomatic persons. During a 4-day hospitalization, the patient was managed with standard precautions and underwent multiple aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), including nebulizer treatments, bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation, endotracheal intubation, and bronchoscopy. Several days after the patient\u0027s transfer to hospital B, a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 returned positive. Among 121 hospital A health care personnel (HCP) who were exposed to the patient, 43 (35.5%) developed symptoms during the 14 days after exposure and were tested for SARS-CoV-2; three had positive test results and were among the first known cases of probable occupational transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to HCP in the United States. Little is known about specific risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in health care settings. To better characterize and compare exposures among HCP who did and did not develop COVID-19, standardized interviews were conducted with 37 hospital A HCP who were tested for SARS-CoV-2, including the three who had positive test results. Performing physical examinations and exposure to the patient during nebulizer treatments were more common among HCP with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 than among those without COVID-19; HCP with COVID-19 also had exposures of longer duration to the patient. Because transmission-based precautions were not in use, no HCP wore personal protective equipment (PPE) recommended for COVID-19 patient care during contact with the index patient. Health care facilities should emphasize early recognition and isolation of patients with possible COVID-19 and use of recommended PPE to minimize unprotected, high-risk HCP exposures and protect the health care workforce.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heinzerling, Amy; Stuckey, Matthew J; Scheuer, Tara; Xu, Kerui; Perkins, Kiran M; Resseger, Heather; Magill, Shelley; Verani, Jennifer R; Jain, Seema; Acosta, Meileen; Epson, Erin","journal":"MMWR.

PARTICIPANTS Older participants and their caregivers (N=51) enrolled in ongoing clinical research studies. MEASUREMENTS Questions about perceptions of safety to attend research visit, the level of panic among the general public, and medical center\u0027s preparedness in handling the pandemic. Other questions identified the source of pandemic information and the preference of a phone or in-person visit. RESULTS Mean age was 69.3 (\u00B19.4) years, 53% were male, 39% were caregivers, and 65% were Caucasian. Majority (78%) of the participants felt safe/very safe attending the scheduled research appointment; 63% felt that the extra screening made them feel safe/very safe; 82% felt that the medical center was prepared/very prepared for the pandemic. Participants split evenly on their preference for phone vs. in-person visits. Family members and television news media were the commonly used sources of pandemic information irrespective of their education. Perceptions were influenced by gender and source of information, not by age or education. Females perceived higher level of panic compared to males (p=0.02). Those relying on news media felt safer compared to those that relied on family members (p=0.008). CONCLUSION Even though informants felt that the medical center was prepared to handle the pandemic, only half the participants preferred the in-person visit. Pandemic information was obtained from family members or the television news media. Knowing patients\u0027 perspectives may help researchers be better prepared for future pandemics.

There have been recent calls for more HCS to be conducted in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), where many relevant diseases are endemic. HCS in general, and HCS in LMICs in particular, raise numerous ethical issues. This paper summarises the findings of a project that explored ethical and regulatory issues related to LMIC HCS via (i) a review of relevant literature and (ii) 45 qualitative interviews with scientists and ethicists. Among other areas of consensus, we found that there was widespread agreement that LMIC HCS can be ethically acceptable, provided that they have a sound scientific rationale, are accepted by local communities and meet usual research ethics requirements. Unresolved issues include those related to (i) acceptable approaches to trade-offs between the scientific aim to produce generalisable results and the protection of participants, (iii) the sharing of benefits with LMIC populations, (iii) the acceptable limits to risks and burdens for participants, (iv) the potential for third-party risk and whether the degree of acceptable third-party risk is different in endemic settings, (v) the conditions under which (if any) it would be appropriate to recruit children for disease-causing HCS, (v) appropriate levels of payment to participants and (vi) appropriate governance of (LMIC) HCS. This paper provides preliminary analyses of these ethical considerations in order to (i) inform scientists and policymakers involved in the planning, conduct and/or governance of LMIC HCS and (ii) highlight areas warranting future research. Insofar as this article focuses on HCS in (endemic) settings where diseases are present and/or widespread, much of the analysis provided is relevant to HCS (in HICs or LMICs) involving pandemic diseases including COVID19.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jamrozik, Euzebiusz; Selgelid, Michael J","journal":"Journal of medical ethics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2019-106001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32381683/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LMIC HCS","HCS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease-causing HCS","governance of LMIC HCS","LMICs","LMIC populations","relevant diseases","infecting research participants","protection of participants","acceptable approaches","endemic settings","acceptable limits","appropriate governance","numerous ethical issues","degree of acceptable third-party risk","ethical considerations","pandemic diseases","regulatory issues","future research","scientists","Unresolved issues","paper","appropriate levels of payment","review of relevant literature","scientific aim","usual research ethics requirements","widespread agreement","areas of consensus","sound scientific rationale","local communities","generalisable results","project","preliminary analyses","Human infection challenge studies","order","trade-offs","pathogens","risks","burdens","qualitative interviews","sharing of benefits","ethicists","middle-income countries","planning","findings","COVID19","potential","children","analysis","policymakers","micro-organisms","recent calls","article","conditions"],"language":"en"},

The virus causes relatively minor damage to young, healthy populations, imposing life-threatening danger to the elderly and people with diseases of chronic inflammation. Therefore, if we could reduce the risk for vulnerable populations, it would make the COVID-19 pandemic more similar to other typical outbreaks. Children don\u0027t suffer from COVID-19 as much as their grandparents and have a much higher melatonin level. Bats are nocturnal animals possessing high levels of melatonin, which may contribute to their high anti-viral resistance. Viruses induce an explosion of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, and melatonin is the best natural antioxidant that is lost with age. The programmed cell death coronaviruses cause, which can result in significant lung damage, is also inhibited by melatonin. Coronavirus causes inflammation in the lungs which requires inflammasome activity. Melatonin blocks these inflammasomes. General immunity is impaired by anxiety and sleep deprivation. Melatonin improves sleep habits, reduces anxiety and stimulates immunity. Fibrosis may be the most dangerous complication after COVID-19. Melatonin is known to prevent fibrosis. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary but yet imposes risks due to oxidative stress, which can be reduced by melatonin. Thus, by using the safe over-the-counter drug melatonin, we may be immediately able to prevent the development of severe disease symptoms in coronavirus patients, reduce the severity of their symptoms, and/or reduce the immuno-pathology of coronavirus infection on patients\u0027 health after the active phase of the infection is over.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shneider, Alex; Kudriavtsev, Aleksandr; Vakhrusheva, Anna","journal":"International reviews of immunology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/08830185.2020.1756284; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32347747/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsxMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Melatonin"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high levels of melatonin","higher melatonin level","safe over-the-counter drug melatonin","current COVID","coronavirus patients","anxiety","pandemic","Fibrosis","immuno-pathology of coronavirus infection","healthy populations","minor damage","vulnerable populations","sleep habits","sleep deprivation","General immunity","diseases of chronic inflammation","significant lung damage","development of severe disease symptoms","high anti-viral resistance","patients\u0027 health","people","reactive oxygen species","explosion of inflammatory cytokines","life-threatening danger","nocturnal animals","active phase","programmed cell death coronaviruses cause","Bats","lungs","best natural antioxidant","devastating events","risks","recent history","typical outbreaks","severity","dangerous complication","inflammasome activity","Mechanical ventilation","oxidative stress","grandparents","Children","inflammasomes"],"language":"en"},

Engaging in research co-design - the meaningful involvement of end-users in research - may help address this research waste. This rapid overview of reviews addressed three related questions, namely (1) what approaches to research co-design exist in health settings? (2) What activities do these research co-design approaches involve? (3) What do we know about the effectiveness of existing research co-design approaches? The review focused on the study planning phase of research, defined as the point up to which the research question and study design are finalised. METHODS Reviews of research co-design were systematically identified using a rapid overview of reviews approach (PROSPERO: CRD42019123034). The search strategy encompassed three academic databases, three grey literature databases, and a hand-search of the journal Research Involvement and Engagement. Two reviewers independently conducted the screening and data extraction and resolved disagreements through discussion. Disputes were resolved through discussion with a senior author (PB). One reviewer performed quality assessment. The results were narratively synthesised. RESULTS A total of 26 records (reporting on 23 reviews) met the inclusion criteria. Reviews varied widely in their application of \u0027research co-design\u0027 and their application contexts, scope and theoretical foci. The research co-design approaches identified involved interactions with end-users outside of study planning, such as recruitment and dissemination. Activities involved in research co-design included focus groups, interviews and surveys. The effectiveness of research co-design has rarely been evaluated empirically or experimentally; however, qualitative exploration has described the positive and negative outcomes associated with co-design. The research provided many recommendations for conducting research co-design, including training participating end-users in research skills, having regular communication between researchers and end-users, setting clear end-user expectations, and assigning set roles to all parties involved in co-design. CONCLUSIONS Research co-design appears to be widely used but seldom described or evaluated in detail. Though it has rarely been tested empirically or experimentally, existing research suggests that it can benefit researchers, practitioners, research processes and research outcomes. Realising the potential of research co-design may require the development of clearer and more consistent terminology, better reporting of the activities involved and better evaluation.","publish_time":"2020-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Slattery, Peter; Saeri, Alexander K; Bragge, Peter","journal":"Health research policy and systems","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12961-020-0528-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32046728/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsxNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["research co-design approaches","effectiveness of research co-design","CONCLUSIONS Research co-design","potential of research co-design","research outcomes","health research","research skills","research processes","research question","research waste","METHODS Reviews of research co-design","study design","effectiveness of existing research","journal Research Involvement","study planning phase of research","activities","meaningful involvement of end-users","rapid overview of reviews approach","involved interactions","training participating end-users","researchers","better reporting","discussion","results","academic databases","application contexts","hand-search","negative outcomes","meaningful benefits","search strategy","health settings","better evaluation","grey literature databases","focus groups","consistent terminology","clear end-user expectations","development of clearer","regular communication","set roles","PROSPERO","interviews","practitioners","data extraction","screening","disagreements","scope","theoretical foci","parties","recommendations","related questions","surveys","senior author","PB","CRD42019123034","recruitment","records","Engagement","point","BACKGROUND Billions of dollars","qualitative exploration","quality assessment","reviewers","total","dissemination","patients","inclusion criteria","Disputes"],"language":"en"},

Four mistletoe species, including Viscum coloratum, inhabit Korea. Leaves and branches of V. coloratum, defined as edible or medicinal mistletoe species in Korean, are used to prepare Korean herbal medicines as well as leached tea. However, other mistletoe species including Taxillus sutchuenensis var. duclouxii, Korthalsella japonica, and Loranthus tanakae are frequently distributed as authentic V. coloratum in Korean markets because of similarities in the branches morphology and Korean names of these species with V. coloratum. Although herbal medicines and food products prepared from the other mistletoe species are inauthentic, they are sold at high prices because of the rarity of these species. Thus, it is important to distinguish between authentic and inauthentic adulterant mistletoe species. In this study, we developed species-specific primer, based on matK sequences, suitable for both conventional PCR and real time PCR (qPCR) assay. These assays allowed rapid discrimination among all four mistletoe species. Moreover, qPCR assay enabled the detection of trace amounts of adulterant mistletoe species in V. coloratum samples. Furthermore, we used these assays to monitor commercial mistletoe products distributed in Korean markets. Our data suggest that these methods would serve as a reliable genetic tool to prevent adulteration and standardize the quality of commercial V. coloratum products.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Wook Jin; Yang, Sungyu; Choi, Goya; Park, Inkyu; Noh, Pureum; Lee, A Yeong; Kim, Hyo Seon; Moon, Byeong Cheol","journal":"Phytochemistry","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2020.112400; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408189/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsxNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["medicinal mistletoe species","inauthentic adulterant mistletoe species","coloratum products","commercial mistletoe products","Korean herbal medicines","detection of trace amounts of adulterant mistletoe species","Korean markets","Viscum coloratum","coloratum samples","Korean names","food products","quality of commercial","qPCR assay","branches of","assays","conventional PCR","quality control","branches morphology","processed food","real time PCR","duclouxii","Korthalsella japonica","safety","Taxillus sutchuenensis","similarities","matK sequences","adulteration","edible","Loranthus tanakae","species-specific primer","Adulterants","rapid discrimination","reliable genetic tool","pharmacological efficacy","leached tea","methods","high prices","rarity","study","Leaves","data"],"language":"en"},

This study provides a preliminary epidemiological analysis of the first 45 days of COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria. We estimated the early transmissibility via time-varying reproduction number based on the Bayesian method that incorporates uncertainty in the distribution of serial interval (time interval between symptoms onset in an infected individual and the infector), and adjusted for disease importation. By 11 April 2020, 318 confirmed cases and 10 deaths from COVID-19 have occurred in Nigeria. At day 45, the exponential growth rate was 0.07 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.05-0.10) with a doubling time of 9.84 days (95% CI: 7.28-15.18). Separately for imported cases (travel-related) and local cases, the doubling time was 12.88 days and 2.86 days, respectively. Furthermore, we estimated the reproduction number for each day of the outbreak using a three-weekly window while adjusting for imported cases. The estimated reproduction number was 4.98 (95% CrI: 2.65-8.41) at day 22 (19 March 2020), peaking at 5.61 (95% credible interval (CrI): 3.83-7.88) at day 25 (22 March 2020). The median reproduction number over the study period was 2.71 and the latest value on 11 April 2020, was 1.42 (95% CrI: 1.26-1.58).

Magnesium plays a critical role in vitamin D biosynthesis and metabolism; and deficiencies in magnesium and vitamin D show associations with poor cognition. However, no study has examined their interaction. This study aimed to evaluate the associations of magnesium intake and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations, indicating vitamin D status, with cognition, and interaction between these nutrients in older adults. METHODS Based on the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) 2011-2014, the study included 2466 participants aged \u2265 60 years who completed the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) and had data available on serum 25(OH)D and magnesium intake. Cognitive impairment was defined as a DSST score lower than the lowest quartile. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were measured by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS Higher total magnesium intake was independently associated with higher DSST scores (highest quartile vs lowest: \u03B2 = 4.34, 95% CI 1.14-7.54). The association of total magnesium intake with high DSST score was primarily observed among women, non-Hispanic whites, physically active participants and those with sufficient vitamin D status, although the interactions were not significant. The odds of cognitive impairment was reduced with increasing intake of total magnesium (p trend \u003C 0.01) and higher level of serum 25(OH)D (p trend = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Findings suggest that high magnesium intake alone may improve cognitive function in older adults, and the association may be stronger among subjects with sufficient vitamin D status. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peeri, Noah C; Egan, Kathleen M; Chai, Weiwen; Tao, Meng-Hua","journal":"European journal of nutrition","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00394-020-02267-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388734/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsyNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Health and Nutrition Survey","Digit Symbol Substitution Test","DSST"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["D concentrations","hydroxyvitamin D","vitamin D biosynthesis","high magnesium intake","associations of magnesium intake","sufficient vitamin D status","increasing intake of total magnesium","association of total magnesium intake","RESULTS Higher total magnesium intake","OH","cognitive function","study","higher DSST scores","high DSST score","higher level of serum","odds of cognitive impairment","lowest quartile","p trend","older adults","highest quartile vs lowest","increasing attention","active participants","poor cognition","CONCLUSIONS Findings","metabolism","subjects","deficiencies","critical role","National Health","non-Hispanic whites","Digit Symbol Substitution Test","women","aging","data available","Nutrition Survey","NHANES","US population ages","years","nutrients","interactions","HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry","PURPOSE","METHODS","studies"],"language":"en"},

We explored the effect of the number of Pipeline embolization devices (PEDs; Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland) deployed on rates of aneurysm occlusion and complications. METHODS Consecutive patients who underwent saccular intracranial aneurysm treatment solely with the PED were included in this retrospective study. Computed tomographic, magnetic resonance, or digital subtraction angiographic images at 6 and 12 months and last follow-up (\u003E12 months) were reviewed for aneurysm occlusion. Complication and retreatment rates were recorded and analyzed statistically. RESULTS The study included 141 aneurysm treatments in 119 patients. A single PED was deployed in 105 cases, two PEDs in 31 cases, and three PEDs in 5 cases (total = 182 devices). Six-month angiographic data were available for 103 patients. Occlusion rates were 67.1% for single-PED cases and 90.0% for cases with \u003E 1 PED (p = 0.028). The 12-month occlusion rate (follow-up available for 132) for single-PED cases was 74.7% compared to 91.7% for multiple-PED cases (p = 0.04). On multivariate analysis, number of PEDs was an independent predictor of aneurysm occlusion at 12 months (odds ratio 6.3, 95% confidence interval 1.8-22.8, p = 0.005). Thromboembolic complication rates were the same in the single- and multiple-PED treatment groups (2.8%).

Reporting of data on benefits and harms of treatments in surgical RCTs should support clinical decision-making. Correct and complete reporting of the outcomes of clinical trials is mandatory to appreciate available evidence and to inform patients properly before asking informed consent. METHODS RCTs published between January 2005 and January 2017 in 15 leading journals comparing a surgical treatment with any other treatment were reviewed systematically. The CONSORT checklist, including the extension for harms, was used to appraise the publications. Beneficial and harmful treatment outcomes, their definitions and their precision measures were extracted. RESULTS Of 1200 RCTs screened, 88 trials were included. For the differences in effect size of beneficial outcomes, 68 per cent of the trials reported a P value only but not a 95 per cent confidence interval. For harmful effects, this was 67 per cent. Only five of the 88 trials (6 per cent) reported a number needed to treat, and no study a number needed to harm.

Additionally, PbtO2 signals have been used to derive indices thought to be associated with cerebrovascular reactivity in TBI. However, their true relationship to slow-wave vasogenic fluctuations associated with cerebral autoregulation remains unclear. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between slow-wave fluctuations of intracranial pressure (ICP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and PbtO2 over time. Using the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) high resolution ICU sub-study cohort, we evaluated those patients with recorded high-frequency digital intra-parenchymal ICP and PbtO2 monitoring data of a minimum of 6 h in duration. Digital physiologic signals were processed for ICP, MAP, and PbtO2 slow-waves using a moving average filter to decimate the high-frequency signal. The first 5 days of recording were analyzed. The relationship between ICP, MAP and PbtO2 slow-waves over time were assessed using autoregressive integrative moving average (ARIMA) and vector autoregressive integrative moving average (VARIMA) modelling, as well as Granger causality testing. A total of 47 patients were included. The ARIMA structure of ICP and MAP were similar in time, where PbtO2 displayed different optimal structure. VARIMA modelling and IRF plots confirmed the strong directional relationship between MAP and ICP, demonstrating an ICP response to MAP impulse. PbtO2 slow-waves, however, failed to demonstrate a definite response to ICP and MAP slow-wave impulses. These results raise questions as to the utility of PbtO2 in the derivation of cerebrovascular reactivity measures in TBI. There is a reproducible relationship between slow-wave fluctuations of ICP and MAP, as demonstrated across various time-series analytic techniques. PbtO2 does not appear to reliably respond in time to slow-wave fluctuations in MAP, as demonstrated on various VARIMA models across all patients. These findings suggest that PbtO2 should not be utilized in the derivation of cerebrovascular reactivity metrics in TBI, as it does not appear to be responsive to changes in MAP in the slow-waves. These findings corroborate previous results regarding PbtO2 based cerebrovascular reactivity indices.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zeiler, Frederick A; Cabeleira, Manuel; Hutchinson, Peter J; Stocchetti, Nino; Czosnyka, Marek; Smielewski, Peter; Ercole, Ari","journal":"Journal of clinical monitoring and computing","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-020-00527-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418148/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjszOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","Digital","ICP","IRF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PbtO2 slow-waves","PbtO2 signals","slow-wave fluctuations of ICP","utility of PbtO2","MAP slow-wave impulses","ICP response","MAP impulse","PbtO2 monitoring data","slow-wave vasogenic fluctuations","ARIMA structure of ICP","slow-wave fluctuations of intracranial pressure","cerebrovascular reactivity indices","CENTER-TBI","true relationship","reproducible relationship","patients","recorded high-frequency digital intra-parenchymal ICP","derivation of cerebrovascular reactivity measures","derivation of cerebrovascular reactivity metrics","strong directional relationship","VARIMA modelling","traumatic brain injury","moving average filter","vector autoregressive integrative moving average","high-frequency signal","various time-series analytic techniques","various VARIMA models","findings","Brain tissue oxygen","Digital physiologic signals","high resolution ICU sub-study cohort","strong associations","arterial pressure","previous results","definite response","different optimal structure","Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research","IRF plots","minimum","cerebral autoregulation","global outcome","questions","Granger causality testing","duration","days of recording","goal","total"],"language":"en"},

Healthcare workers are at increased risk for infection, and specific requirements for their protection are advisable to ensure the functioning of the basic healthcare system, including the availability of general practitioners (GPs). Understanding the transmission risk is particularly important for guiding evidence-based protective measures in the primary healthcare setting. METHODS Healthcare worker contacts of an initially undiagnosed COVID-19 case, who were without personal protective equipment, in particular not wearing facemasks, were screened with nasopharyngeal swabs and polymerase chain reaction tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), irrespective of respiratory symptoms or fever seven days after initial contact. The details of exposure to the index case were obtained during routine contact investigation after unintentional pathogen exposure. RESULTS Twenty-one healthcare workers reported contacts with the index case. Three healthcare workers reported respiratory symptoms (cough) or low-grade fever within 4 days. None of them tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of symptom onset. All 21 healthcare workers tested SARS-CoV-2 negative 7 days after initial index case contact, including the three healthcare workers with previous symptoms. Ten of the 21 healthcare workers reported a cumulative exposure time of \u003E15 minutes. Longer cumulative contact times were associated with more individual contacts, reduced contact time per contact and activities with physical patient contact. The closest relative of the index patient tested SARS-CoV-2 positive 2 days after the index case presented at the hospital emergency department. CONCLUSION We found a low risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a primary care setting. These findings are compatible with previous reports of the highest transmission probability in household settings with prolonged close contacts. The current protective measures for healthcare workers, including strict adherence to basic standard hygiene and facemasks, offer considerable protection during short periods of contact with symptomatic COVID-19 cases by diminishing the risk of direct and indirect transmission.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Canova, Vera; Lederer Schl\u00E4pfer, Heidi; Piso, Rein Jan; Droll, Armin; Fenner, Lukas; Hoffmann, Tobias; Hoffmann, Matthias","journal":"Swiss medical weekly","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2020.20257; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32333603/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjszOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Healthcare workers","initial contact","initial index case contact","SARS-CoV","primary healthcare setting","basic healthcare system","reduced contact time","transmission risk","METHODS Healthcare worker contacts","days","physical patient contact","cumulative contact times","index patient","short periods of contact","routine contact investigation","low risk of SARS","respiratory symptoms","cumulative exposure time","individual contacts","increased risk","risk of direct","previous symptoms","indirect transmission","facemasks","highest transmission probability","prolonged close contacts","current protective measures","symptomatic COVID","undiagnosed COVID","details of exposure","personal protective equipment","unintentional pathogen exposure","time of symptom onset","primary care setting","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","considerable protection","previous reports","coronavirus disease","low-grade fever","basic standard hygiene","polymerase chain reaction tests","household settings","strict adherence","activities","nasopharyngeal swabs","cough","specific requirements","guiding evidence","infection","functioning","cases","availability of general practitioners","hospital emergency department","GPs","findings","BACKGROUND","minutes","RESULTS","epidemic","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Based on the reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST) framework, this study presents an examination of individual differences in some relevant psychological factors. Design Cross-sectional psychometric. Methods UK respondents (N = 202) completed a personality questionnaire (RST-PQ), measures of illness attitudes, concerns about the impact of coronavirus on health services and socio-economic infrastructures, personal safety, and likelihood of voluntary self-isolation. Results Respondents most concerned were older, had negative illness attitudes, and scored higher on reward reactivity (RR), indicating the motivation to take positive approach action despite prevailing worry/anxiety. Personal safety concerns were highest in those with negative illness attitudes and higher fight-flight-freeze system (FFFS, reflecting fear/avoidance) scores. Results suggest people are experiencing psychological conflict: between the urge to stay safe (FFFF-related) and the desire to maintain a normal, pleasurable (RR-related) life. Ways of ameliorating conflict may include maladaptive behaviours (panic buying), reflecting reward-related displacement activity. Intended self-isolation related to FFFS, but also low behavioural inhibition system (related to anxiety) scores. Older people reported themselves less likely to self-isolate. Conclusions Interventions need to consider individual differences in psychological factors in behaviour change, and we discuss relevant literature to inform policy makers and communicators. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST) personality systems can influence perception of persuasive health messages. However, there is limited evidence for their direct effects on health concerns and behaviours, and none relating to specific infectious diseases. What does this study add? Reward reactivity (RR) is associated with concern about impact of coronavirus on the NHS and other social infrastructures, indicating the motivation to take positive-approach action despite worry/anxiety. Personal safety concerns are related to fight-flight-freeze system traits (FFFS, reflecting fear/avoidance). Intended self-isolation related to FFFS, but also low behavioural inhibition system (related to anxiety) scores. Older people reported themselves less likely to self-isolate. Results suggest psychological conflict: between the urge to stay safe (FFFF-related) and the desire to maintain a normal, pleasurable life (RR-related).

Re-education rather than indiscriminate elimination of these fibroblasts has emerged as a new strategy for combination therapy. Here, we studied the effects of global loss of pro-fibrotic non-coding regulatory microRNA-21 (miR-21) in K-Ras-driven p53-deleted genetically engineered mouse models of PDAC. Strikingly, loss of miR-21 accelerated tumor initiation via mucinous cystic neoplastic lesions and progression to locally advanced invasive carcinoma from which animals precipitously succumbed at an early age. The absence of tumor-restraining myofibroblasts and a massive infiltrate of immune cells were salient phenotypic features of global miR-21 loss. Stromal miR-21 activity was required for induction of tumor-restraining myofibroblasts in in-vivo isograft transplantation experiments. Low miR-21 expression negatively correlated with a fibroblast gene expression signature and positively with an immune cell gene expression signature in TCGA PDAC data set (n = 156) mirroring findings in the mouse models. Our results exposed an overall tumor suppressive function of miR-21 in in-vivo PDAC models. These results have important clinical implications for anti-miR-21-based inhibitory therapeutic approaches under consideration for PDAC and other cancer types. Mechanistic dissection of the cell-intrinsic role of miR-21 in cancer-associated fibroblasts and other cell types will be needed to inform best strategies for pharmacological modulation of miR-21 activity in order to remodel the tumor microenvironment and enhance treatment response in PDAC.

In this study, we observed that MERS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein suppresses type I and III IFN gene expression. The N protein suppresses Sendai virus-induced IFN-\u03B2 and IFN-\u03BB1 by reducing their promoter activity and mRNA levels as well as downstream IFN stimulated genes (ISGs). Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) is known to recognize viral RNA and induce IFN expression through tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25)-mediated ubiquitination of RIG-I caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs). We discovered that MERS-CoV N protein suppresses RIG-I-CARD-, but not MDA5-CARD-induced IFN-\u03B2 and IFN-\u03BB1 promoter activity. By interacting with TRIM25, N protein impedes RIG-I ubiquitination and activation and inhibits the phosphorylation of transcription factors IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF-\u03BAB that are known to be important for IFN gene activation. By employing recombinant Sindbis virus-EGFP replication system, we showed that viral N protein downregulated the production of not only IFN mRNA but also bioactive IFN proteins. Taken together, MERS-CoV N protein functions as an IFN antagonist. It suppresses RIG-I-induced type I and type III IFN production by interfering with TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination. Our study sheds light on the pathogenic mechanism of how MERS-CoV causes disease.IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV causes death of about 35% of patients. Published studies showed that some coronaviruses are capable of suppressing interferon (IFN) expression in the early phase of infection and MERS-CoV proteins can modulate host immune response. In this study, we demonstrated that MERS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein suppresses the production of both type I and type III IFNs via sequestering TRIM25, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is essential for activating RIG-I signaling pathway. Ectopic expression of TRIM25 rescues the suppressive effect of the N protein. In addition, the C-terminal domain of the viral N protein plays a pivotal role in the suppression of IFN-\u03B2 promoter activity. Our findings reveal how MERS-CoV evades innate immunity and provide insights into the interplay between host immune response and viral pathogenicity.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Chi-You; Liu, Helene Minyi; Chang, Ming-Fu; Chang, Shin C","journal":"Journal of virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00099-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32295922/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs1MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["III","Retinoic"],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":["Sendai"],"keyphrases":["IFN expression","IFN production","IFN mRNA","suppression of IFN","IFN antagonist","viral N protein","IFN gene expression","MERS-CoV N protein functions","IFN gene activation","bioactive IFN proteins","MERS-CoV proteins","MERS-CoV nucleocapsid","IFN-\u03BB1 promoter activity","IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV","downstream IFN stimulated genes","induced type","Sendai virus-induced IFN-\u03B2","TRIM25-mediated RIG","mediated ubiquitination of RIG","phosphorylation of transcription factors IFN-regulatory factor","Ectopic expression of TRIM25","sequestering TRIM25","\u03B2 promoter activity","viral pathogenicity","viral RNA","caspase activation","host immune response","IFNs","hundreds of downstream antiviral genes","study sheds light","pathogenic mechanism","frontlines of antiviral defense mechanism","mRNA levels","MDA5-CARD","Retinoic acid-inducible gene","recombinant Sindbis virus-EGFP replication system","insights","interplay","pivotal role","E3 ubiquitin ligase","early phase of infection","C-terminal domain","suppressive effect","IRF3","tripartite motif","disease","recruitment domains","innate immunity","coronaviruses","CARDs","ISGs","death","NF-\u03BAB","addition","interferons","Published studies","findings","patients","pathway"],"language":"en"},

The generation of hybrid peptides by combining the genes that encode two different bacteriocins has made it possible to study the mechanisms of action of the bacteriocins that compose them and also develop new peptides with improved biotechnological applications. Hybrid bacteriocins may be obtained in several ways. In our laboratory, by combining enterocin CRL35 and microcin V (Ent35-MccV), we obtained a broad-spectrum peptide that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Ent35-MccV is sensitive to the action of intestinal proteases and is heat resistant, which makes it a good candidate for use as a biopreservative. For this reason, the peptide was tested in skim milk and beef burgers as food models. We also obtained more potent variants of the hybrid by modifying the central amino acid of the hinge region that connects the two bacteriocins.

Current treatments are insufficiently efficacious and associated with side effects. Myotonia can be triggered by voluntary movement (electrically-induced myotonia) or percussion (mechanically-induced myotonia). Whether distinct molecular mechanisms underlie these triggers is unknown. Our goal was to identify ion channels involved in mechanically-induced myotonia and to evaluate block of the channels involved as a novel approach to therapy. METHODS We developed a novel system to enable study of mechanically-induced myotonia using both genetic and pharmacologic mouse models of myotonia congenita. We extended ex vivo studies of excitability to in vivo studies of muscle stiffness. RESULTS As previous work suggests activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channels by mechanical stimuli in muscle, we examined the role of this cation channel. Mechanically-induced myotonia was markedly suppressed in TRPV4-null muscles and in muscles treated with TRPV4 small molecule antagonists. The suppression of mechanically-induced myotonia occurred without altering intrinsic muscle excitability such that myotonia triggered by firing of action potentials (electrically-induced myotonia) was unaffected. When injected intraperitoneally, TRPV4 antagonists lessened the severity of myotonia in vivo by approximately 80%. INTERPRETATION These data demonstrate for the first time that there are distinct molecular mechanisms triggering electrically- and mechanically-induced myotonia. Our data indicates that activation of TRPV4 during muscle contraction plays an important role in triggering myotonia in vivo. Elimination of mechanically-induced myotonia by TRPV4 inhibition offers a new approach to treating myotonia. This article is protected by copyright.

Cystatin C serum concentration seems to be superior to creatinine-based determination of kidney injury in adults and children. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technology provides non-invasive and real-time measurement of renal tissue oxygenation. Here, we compared renal tissue oximetry (rSrO\u2082) with conventional diagnostic criteria cystatin C and creatinine concentration in children undergoing pLTx. MATERIAL AND METHODS rSrO\u2082 was measured intraoperatively in children undergoing pLTx over the left kidney, and was statistically compared with pre- and postoperative serum creatinine and cystatin C concentrations. RESULTS rSrO\u2082 was affected by hemoglobin concentration, bilirubin concentration, and FiO\u2082. Statistical analysis demonstrated that rSrO\u2082 was significantly reduced in children with preoperative pathologic increased cystatin C concentrations compared to children without (63.7\u00B14.3 vs. 53.4\u00B14.9, p\u003C0.05).

The current COVID-19 pandemic illustrates this at a global level. The sudden increased demand on delivery systems puts unique pressures on pre-established care pathways. These extraordinary times require efficient tools for smart governance and resource allocation. OBJECTIVE To develop an innovative web-based solution addressing the seemingly unsurmountable challenges of triage, monitoring, and delivery of non-hospital services unleashed by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Based on the literature, an existing shared health record platform, and discussions between health care providers, decision-makers, academia, and the private sector in response to the COVID 19 epidemic, an adaptable crisis management digital platform was envisioned and designed with the goal of improving the system\u0027s response. RESULTS The Crisis Management Platform was developed and offered to health authorities in Ontario on a non-profit basis. It has the capability to dramatically streamline patient intake, triage, monitoring, referral, and delivery of non-hospital services. It decentralizes provision of services (by moving them online), and centralizes data gathering and analysis, maximizing utilization of existing human resources, facilitating evidence-based decision-making, and minimizing the risk to both users and providers. It has unlimited scaleup possibilities (only constrained by human health risk resource availability) with minimal marginal cost. Similar web-based solutions have the potential to fill an urgent gap in resource allocation, becoming a unique asset for health systems governance and management during critical times. They highlight the potential effectiveness of web-based solutions if built on an outcome-driven architecture. CONCLUSIONS Data and web-based approaches in response to public health crisis are key to evidence-driven oversight and management of public health emergencies.

The utility of SSDs has been well reviewed and they are viewed as a high tier assessment tool in environmental risk assessment and other disciplines. SSDs seek to improve upon probabilistic extrapolation of laboratory (and sometimes field) collected ecotoxicity data for environmental protection by modeling the diversity of multiple experimental results in the form of a single statistical distribution which reduces or eliminates the need for extrapolation with deterministic assessment factors. SSDs thus depend heavily on both statistical and biological knowledge. In this commentary we review recently published literature identifying areas of improvement based on fundamental statistical theory or application in environmental assessment contexts. We reveal that sound application of SSDs relies heavily upon a grasp of probability distributions, how asymmetric confidence intervals are derived for distributions common to SSDs, the influence of sample size on parameter estimation, and how these are collectively applied across the myriad of regulatory systems globally.

Antimicrobial prophylaxis and pre-emptive therapy have improved survival of these patients; however, the failure rates of prophylaxis are not negligible. The aim of this systematic review is to explore the reasons behind failure of antimicrobial prophylaxis and pre-emptive therapy. SETTING This systematic review included prospective randomised controlled trials and prospective single-arm studies. PARTICIPANTS The studies included were on prophylaxis and pre-emptive therapy of opportunistic infections in transplant recipients. Studies were included from databases MEDLINE, CENTRAL and Embase published until October first 2018. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcome measures were breakthrough infections, adverse events leading to stopping of treatment, switching medication or dose reduction. Secondary outcome measures were acquired resistance to antimicrobials, antifungals or antivirals and death. RESULTS From 3317 identified records, 30 records from 24 studies with 2851 patients were included in the systematic review. Seventeen focused on prophylactic and pre-emptive treatment of cytomegalovirus and seven studies on invasive fungal infection. The main reasons for failure of prophylaxis and pre-emptive therapy were adverse events and breakthrough infections, which were described in 54% (13 studies) and 38% (9 studies) of the included studies, respectively. In 25%, six of the studies, a detailed description of patients who experienced failure of prophylaxis or pre-emptive therapy was unclear or lacking. CONCLUSIONS Our results show that although failure is reported in the studies, the level of detail prohibits a detailed analysis of failure of prophylaxis and pre-emptive therapy. Clearly reporting on patients with a negative outcome should be improved. We have provided guidance on how to detect failure early in a clinical setting in accordance to the results from this systematic review.

Additionally, SGE inhibited LPS-induced I\u03BAB degradation in RAW 264.7 cells. Western blot analysis of the cytosolic and nuclear fractions, as well as immunofluorescence assay results, revealed that SGE suppressed LPS-induced p65 nuclear translocation in RAW 264.7 cells. Moreover, SGE reduced LPS-induced interleukin (IL)-1\u03B2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 (TNF-\u03B1) mRNA expression and IL-1\u03B2 and IL-6 protein expression in RAW 264.7 cells. Collectively, these results indicate that SGE suppresses the NF-\u03BAB signaling pathway and thereby inhibits the production of NO, IL-1\u03B2, and IL-6.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Ju Gyeong; Kim, Min Jeong; Lee, Ji Su; Sydara, Kongmany; Lee, Sangwoo; Byun, Sanguine; Jung, Sung Keun","journal":"Journal of microbiology and biotechnology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.4014/jmb/1911.11042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32238770/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs3NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SGE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LPS-induced interleukin","SGE inhibited LPS-induced I\u03BAB degradation","cells","SGE attenuated LPS-induced phosphorylation of I\u03BAB kinase","LPS-induced p65 nuclear translocation","LPS-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase","mRNA expression","protein expression","Western blot analysis","TNF-\u03B1","nuclear fractions","mediated nitrite production","immunofluorescence assay results","tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","anti-inflammatory effects of Smilax guianensis Vitman extract","iNOS","inhibitor of kappa B","inflammation","lipopolysaccharide","NF-\u03BAB","cyclooxygenase","study","pathway","development of inflammatory diseases","Nutraceutical treatments","COX"],"language":"en"},

The subsequent COVID-19 pandemic rapidly affected the health and economy of the world. The global approach to the pandemic was to isolate populations to reduce the spread of this deadly virus while vaccines began to be developed. In March 2020, the first phase I clinical trial of a novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine, mRNA-1273, which encodes the spike protein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2, began in the United States (US). The production of mRNA-based vaccines is a promising recent development in the production of vaccines. However, there remain significant challenges in the development and testing of vaccines as rapidly as possible to control COVID-19, which requires international collaboration. This review aims to describe the background to the rationale for the development of mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and the current status of the mRNA-1273 vaccine.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Fuzhou; Kream, Richard M; Stefano, George B","journal":"Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.924700; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32366816/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs3NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","United States"],"keyphrases":["development of mRNA","based vaccines","production of mRNA","production of vaccines","based SARS-CoV","testing of vaccines","encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine","pandemic","subsequent COVID","promising recent development","S protein","spike protein","outbreak of coronavirus disease","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","novel lipid nanoparticle","LNP","clinical trial","Hubei Province","China","Wuhan","spread","current status","phase","health","economy","background","significant challenges","deadly virus","rationale","United States","world","global approach","populations","international collaboration","review"],"language":"en"},

The success of a reliable and sensitive asymptomatic diagnosis relies on the identification and measurement of informative biomarkers from human host and virus in a rapid, sensitive, and inexpensive manner. The objective of this article is to describe an innovative multidisciplinary approach to develop an efficient, inexpensive, and easy-to-use portable instrument (bCUBE\u00AE by Hyris Ltd) that can be employed as a surveillance system for the emergency caused by SARS-CoV-2. A solution for Coronavirus testing, compliant with CDC guidelines, is scheduled to be released in the next weeks. In addition, we will describe a workflow and path of an integrated multi-omic approach that will lead to host and pathogen biomarker discovery in order to train the instrument to provide reliable results based on a specific biomarker\u0027s fingerprint of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martinelli, Federico; Perrone, Anna; Della Noce, Isabella; Colombo, Lorenzo; Lo Priore, Stefano; Romano, Simone","journal":"Immunological reviews","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/imr.12857; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32329102/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs3ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Hyris Ltd","CDC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","human host","Coronavirus testing","novel coronavirus","specific biomarker\u0027s fingerprint of SARS","health laboratories","reliable results","inexpensive manner","easy-to-use portable instrument","sensitive asymptomatic diagnosis","innovative multidisciplinary approach","health laboratory environments","public aggregation places","integrated multi-omic approach","identification","measurement of informative biomarkers","boats","order","pathogen biomarker discovery","workflow","trains","bCUBE","CDC guidelines","serious challenges","emergency","viral infections","ongoing outbreak","robust diagnostic methodologies","article","airports","Hyris","solution","success","earliest appearance of symptom","urgent need","surveillance system","humans","objective","addition","weeks"],"language":"en"},

EIDs are a particularly challenging target for global health preparedness, including for vaccine development. Insufficient attention has been given to challenges, lessons learned, and potential solutions to support and sustain vaccine industry engagement in vaccine development for EIDs. Drawing from lessons from the most recent Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as the 2009 H1N1 influenza, 2014-2016 Ebola, and 2015-16 Zika outbreaks preceding it, we offer our perspective on challenges facing EID vaccine development and recommend additional solutions to prioritize in the near term.

The efficacy of T3 in preventing/treating these NCDs is similar or greater compared to tocopherol (TF). TF may lower the efficacy of T3 because the efficacy of the combination of TF and T3 was lower than T3 alone in some studies.

Complications of dysphagia include aspiration leading to chest infection and pneumonia, malnutrition, increased length of hospital stay and re-admission to hospital. To date, most dysphagia interventions in acute care have been tested with acute stroke populations. While intervention studies in critical care have been emerging since 2015, they are limited and so there is much to learn about the type, the delivery and the intensity of treatments in this setting to inform future clinical trials. The aim of this systematic review is to summarise the evidence regarding the relationship between dysphagia interventions and clinically important patient outcomes in acute and critical care settings. METHODS We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Web of Science, CINAHL and clinical trial registries from inception to the present. We will include studies conducted with adults in acute care settings such as acute hospital wards or units or intensive care units and critical care settings. Studies will be restricted to randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing a new dysphagia intervention with usual care or another intervention. The main outcomes that will be collected include length of time taken to return to oral intake, change in incidence of aspiration and pneumonia, nutritional status, length of hospital stay and quality of life. Key intervention components such as delivery, intensity, acceptability, fidelity and adverse events associated with such interventions will be collected to inform future clinical trials. Two independent reviewers will assess articles for eligibility, data extraction and quality appraisal. A meta-analysis will be conducted as appropriate. DISCUSSION No systematic review has attempted to summarise the evidence for oropharyngeal dysphagia interventions in acute and critical care. Results of the proposed systematic review will inform practice and the design of future clinical trials.

We describe our experience of using the V-Y principle in advancement flaps designed around a distinct perforator to reconstruct soft tissue defects of the upper limb. The shortcomings of fasciocutaneous and fascial flaps requiring skin grafting can be eliminated. METHODS This was a 10-year retrospective review of patients who had V-Y flaps based on a distinct perforator for defects of the shoulder, axilla, arm, elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand. Defects of the digits and thumb were excluded. RESULTS There were 59 flaps in 52 patients with an average age of 44 years (18-72 years). Skin malignancy was the most common primary etiology. The average defect size was 35 cm (9-80 cm). There were no total flap failures; however, there were 4 partial losses, which healed by secondary intention. Seven flaps had to be explored for the hematoma evacuation. CONCLUSIONS The use of V-Y flaps based on distinct perforators in the upper limb retains limb aesthetics, allows early mobility and is a safe and reliable technique.","publish_time":"2020-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kennedy, Anne-Marie; Lloyd, Mark Sheldon; Niranjan, Niri S","journal":"Annals of plastic surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0000000000002138; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31904650/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs4NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["V-Y"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["V-Y flaps","advancement flaps","fascial flaps","upper limb","V-Y principle","distinct perforators","limb aesthetics","use of V","years","soft tissue defects","Skin malignancy","skin grafting","average age","average defect size","year retrospective review of patients","shoulder","forearm","elbow","axilla","early mobility","wrist","shortcomings of fasciocutaneous","common primary etiology","reconstruction","CONCLUSIONS","pleasing result","partial losses","secondary intention","reliable technique","total flap failures","INTRODUCTION","aim","hand","digits","thumb","experience","hematoma evacuation","function","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

To reduce energy demand, China has implemented an energy cap policy and pledged to limit total energy consumption to around 5000 million tons of standard coal equivalent by 2020 in the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020). The prospect of achieving this target relies on the understanding of China\u0027s energy growth pattern. To this end, we investigate the transformation of the growth pattern in China\u0027s energy consumption from 2005 to 2015. We combine environmental input-output approach and structural decomposition analysis to study the factors that influence the changes in China\u0027s energy consumption. Results show that energy consumption growth shifted from export-driven before the Financial Crisis (2005-2007) to investment-driven during the Financial Crisis (2007-2010) and to consumption-driven both in the Economic Recovery (2010-2012) and in the New Normal (2012-2015). Consumption volume was the major promoting factor of the growth in energy consumption, but it became less important over time. In contrast, energy intensity was the primary factor offsetting energy consumption growth, with varying contribution over the period 2005-2015. Correspondingly, we further discuss how relevant policies for each period contribute to shaping the growth pattern and give recommendations for energy policymakers.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guang, Fengtao; Wen, Le","journal":"Environmental science and pollution research international","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09206-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418106/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs4NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["the Economic Recovery"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["energy consumption growth","China\u0027s energy consumption","total energy consumption","Decoupling energy consumption","energy intensity","energy policymakers","energy demand","understanding of China\u0027s energy growth pattern","Consumption volume","energy cap policy","economic growth","period","Financial Crisis","primary factor","Economic Recovery","major promoting factor","structural decomposition analysis","environmental input-output approach","factors","varying contribution","export","transformation","tons of standard coal equivalent","recommendations","changes","realization of sustainable development","target","contrast","Results","relevant policies","investment","Five-Year Plan","time","prospect"],"language":"en"},

Soluble cluster of differentiation (CD)14 subtype (sCD14-ST also termed presepsin PSP) is a regulatory factor that modulates immune responses by interacting with T and B cells, useful for early diagnosis, prognosis and risk stratification prediction. METHODS In 75 consecutive patients suffering from COVID-19 microbiology proven infection, admitted to intensive care unit (ICU, n=21, 28%) and/or in infectious disease ward (IW, n=54, 72%), PSP (Pathfast, Mitsubishi, Japan) has been measured in addition to routine laboratory tests performed during the period of hospitalization (from January to March 2020). RESULTS PSP demonstrates: -statistically significant higher values (Mann-Whitney test) in 6 patients died (median, IQR= 1046, 763-1240; vs 417, 281-678 ng/L, p\u003C0.05); -statistically significant but poor correlations with CRP (r= 0.59 p\u003C0.001), LDH (r=0.52, p\u003C0.001) and PCT (r=0.72, p\u003C0.001) measured at the same day; -a significant relationship between concentrations and ICU stay. In fact patients showing PSP values higher than 250 ng/L (cut-off for risk stratification) did stay in ICU for a significantly longer time (median 17 days, IQR 12-31; p\u003C0.001) than those exhibiting lower values (median 10 days, IQR 7-18). CONCLUSIONS The data obtained seems to demonstrate the role of PSP in providing prognostic information in COVID-19 patients, allowing to identify, during the early phase of the monitoring, the patients suffering from a more severe disease which will be hospitalized for a more long time.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zaninotto, Martina; Maria Mion, Monica; Cosma, Chiara; Rinaldi, Daniela; Plebani, Mario","journal":"Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.04.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32333860/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs4NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PSP","Mitsubishi","ICU"],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["PSP values higher","presepsin PSP","COVID","role of PSP","RESULTS PSP","fact patients","ICU","consecutive patients","median","IQR","significant higher values","severe disease","significant relationship","lower values","days","respiratory Coronavirus disease","risk stratification prediction","infectious disease ward","early diagnosis","early phase","longer time","long time","severe form of pneumonia","intensive care unit","prognosis","B cells","leading complication","microbiology proven infection","Mann-Whitney test","regulatory factor","CRP","prognostic information","immune responses","sCD14-ST","routine laboratory tests","addition","subtype","Japan","IW","poor correlations","Soluble cluster of differentiation","period of hospitalization","BACKGROUND","Pathfast","Mitsubishi","cut-off","concentrations","monitoring","LDH","PCT","renamed SARS-CoV","data","METHODS","vs","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Thus, we aimed to describe the therapeutic history of feline cases infected by itraconazole-resistant Sporothrix brasiliensis in an endemic region of Southern Brazil. Medical records of cats attended at the Veterinary Clinic Hospital (Pelotas/RS, Brazil) between 2016 and 2017 were reviewed. Twelve cases of infection by S. brasiliensis with that showed high minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values (\u2265 4 \u03BCg/mL) to itraconazole by M38-A2 of CLSI were selected. At the hospital consultation, disseminated (cats 1-l0, 12) and localized (cat 11) skin lesions remained in the cats, even after treatment with fluconazole, ketoconazole (02/12), and itraconazole (ITZ, 09/12) performed before this study. High doses (25-100 mg/kg/day) of ITZ for up to 4 months (03/12, cats 2, 6, 12) or over 12 months (05/12, cats 1, 5, 7, 8, 11) did not provide a clinical cure, except for the association of ITZ plus potassium iodide (01/12, cat 12) for 3 months, which proved useful in infections with itraconazole-resistant S. brasiliensis. However, the combined issues of abandonment of therapy by owners for financial reasons, difficulties surrounding therapy administration (03/12, cats 6, 11, 12), and the inappropriate choice of medication (01/12, cat 6), together reflect the reality of this endemic region, which greatly compromises clinical healing. This study highlighted the occurrence of refractory cases by itraconazole-resistant S. brasiliensis in cats from Southern Brazil, as well as the abandonment of treatment and therapeutic errors.

In our study, we did a retrospective review of medical records from COVID-19 patients admitted to one ward of Tongji Hospital of Hua Zhong University of Science and Technology from 10 February to 13 April 2020. From 10 February to 13 April 2020, there were 108 patients of COVID-19 admitted in the one ward of Tongji Hospital. Among them, eight cases were readmission patients because the RT-PCR result of SARS-CoV-2 was positive again after discharge. On the second admission, they had no symptoms and their chest CT was almost normal. Data from laboratory tests of the re-admission patients showed that all eight patients had normal white blood cell count, lymphocyte count. The inflammatory factors like procalcitonin and interleukin 6 were normal. After treatment, two patients met the standard and were discharged. The other six patients were still in the hospital because their RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 did not get three consecutive negative results and the course of two patients had persisted more than 90 days. We still needed to be alert that these patients could infect other people as a source of infection, and we also needed to be alert that these patients become chronic virus carriers.

Italy has been one of the first countries dealing with the outbreak of COVID-19 and severe measures have been adopted to limit viral transmission. The spread of COVID-19 may have several implications in organ transplant activity that physicians should be aware of. The initial experience gained during the COVID-19 outbreak shows that around 10% of infected patients in Italy need intensive care management to overcome the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Due to the exponential rise of infected patients we are now facing an actual risk of saturation of intensive care unit (ICU) beds. A restriction in the number of ICU beds available for both donors and transplant recipients may unfavorably influence the overall donation activity, and eventually lead to a reduced number of transplants. Preliminary Italian data show that a 25% reduction of procured organs has already occurred during the first 4 weeks of COVID-19 outbreak. This underlines the need to closely monitor what will be further happening in ICUs due to the COVID-19 spread in the attempt to preserve transplant activity, especially in Western countries where deceased donors represent the major organ resource.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Angelico, R; Trapani, S; Manzia, T M; Lombardini, L; Tisone, G; Cardillo, M","journal":"American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.15904; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32243677/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs5NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spread of COVID","outbreak of COVID","weeks of COVID","organ transplant activity","transplant recipients","Italy","need","number of ICU beds available","intensive care management","intensive care unit","overall donation activity","spread of Coronavirus Disease","deceased donors","Western countries","exponential rise of infected patients","major organ resource","reduced number of transplants","actual risk of saturation","physicians","implications","acute respiratory distress syndrome","attempt","severe measures","restriction","Preliminary Italian data","reduction of procured organs","pandemic dimension","initial experience","viral transmission","ICUs"],"language":"en"},

The present study introduces Poincar\u00E9-index20-30 Hz, targeting the 20- to 30-Hz frequency, as the frequency range reported to contain large electromyogram (EMG) portions in frontal EEG. We combined Poincar\u00E9-index20-30 Hz with the conventional Poincar\u00E9-index0.5-47 Hz using a deep learning technique to adjust to BIS values, and examined whether this layered Poincar\u00E9 analysis can provide an index of anaesthesia level like BIS. A total of 83,867 datasets of these two Poincar\u00E9-indices and BIS-monitor-derived parameters were continuously obtained every 3 s from 30 patients throughout general anaesthesia, and were randomly divided into 75% for a training dataset and 25% for a test dataset. Two Poincar\u00E9-indices and two supplemental EEG parameters (EMG70-110 Hz, suppression ratio) in the training dataset were trained in a multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), with reference to BIS as supervisor. We then evaluated the trained MLPNN model using the test dataset, by comparing the measured BIS (mBIS) with BIS predicted from the model (PredBIS). The relationship between mBIS and PredBIS using the two Poincar\u00E9-indices showed a tight linear regression equation: mBIS = 1.00 \u00D7 PredBIS \u002B 0.15, R = 0.87, p \u003C 0.0001, root mean square error (RMSE) = 7.09, while the relationship between mBIS and PredBIS simply using the original Poincar\u00E9-index0.5-47 Hz was weaker (R = 0.82, p \u003C 0.0001, RMSE = 7.32).

METHODS A total of 30 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to 5 groups with complete random experiment design: Sham group (Sham), MCT group, TXL group, sildenafil (SIL) group and combination group (TXL\u002BSIL), 6 rats in each group. Rats were injected with 50 mg/kg MCT solution for inducing PAH model except for those in the sham group. From the day of modeling, rats of TXL, SIL and TXL\u002BSIL groups were given TXL (1.2 g/kg), SIL (10 mg/kg) and combination solution (TXL:1.2 g/kg, SIL: 10 mg/kg) respectively, and rats in Sham and MCT groups were given normal saline (5 mL/kg). The samples were collected and tested after 21 consecutive days of intragastric administration. Echocardiography was used to measure the related indices of RVF, including pulmonary arterial flow spectrum, pulmonary artery diameter (PAD), right ventricular wall thickness (RVWT), right ventricular diameter (RVD), tricuspidannular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), right atrium transverse diameter (RAT), and inferior vena cava diameter (IVCD). Elastic Verhoeff-Van Gieson staining was adopted to measure the percentage of wall thickness (WT%) of pulmonary arteriols. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to measure the cross-sectional area (CSA) of right ventricular cardiomyocytes. RESULTS MCT-induced PAH rat model was successfully established. In MCT group the wall of pulmonary arterioles exhibited a prominent-increase thickness, PAD, RVWT, RVD, RAT, IVCD, WT%, right ventricular hypertrophy index (RVHI) as well as CSA of RV cardiomyocyte significantly increased (all P\u003C0.01), and TAPSE markedly decreased (P\u003C0.01). At the same time, TXL prominently improved all of the above indices (all P\u003C0.01). In comparison with SIL, TXL significantly reduced RVD (P\u003C0.05) and decreased CAS of RV cardiomyocytes (P\u003C0.01), but TAPSE in SIL group was much larger than in TXL group (P\u003C0.01). Moreover, TAPSE in TXL\u002BSIL group was larger than that in TXL group (P\u003C0.01), while the two groups performed equally well in terms of the other indices. CONCLUSION Early intervention of TXL could inhibit pulmonary arterioles remodeling, and improve RVF by attenuating right ventricular hypertrophy, and TXL has a stronger effect on inhibiting right ventricular remodeling than SIL.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gao, Lu; Li, Shao-Dan; Zhang, Yin; Liu, Yi; Yang, Ming-Hui","journal":"Chinese journal of integrative medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11655-020-3229-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418178/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs2MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MCT","SIL","PAH","CSA","RVD","TXL","TXL SIL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TXL group","rats of TXL","Sham group","combination group","SIL groups","right ventricular cardiomyocytes","ventricular diameter","MCT groups","CONCLUSION Early intervention of TXL","ventricular remodeling","ventricular wall thickness","ventricular function","TAPSE","MCT solution","pulmonary artery diameter","wall of pulmonary arterioles","pulmonary arteriols","right atrium transverse diameter","pulmonary arterioles remodeling","ventricular hypertrophy index","pulmonary arterial hypertension","RESULTS MCT-induced PAH rat model","pulmonary arterial flow spectrum","percentage of wall thickness","related indices of RVF","PAD","reduced RVD","inducing PAH model","RVWT","adult male Sprague-Dawley rats","IVCD","combination solution","inferior vena cava diameter","effect of early intervention of Tongxinluo","decreased CAS of RV cardiomyocytes","CSA of RV cardiomyocyte","stronger effect","Hematoxylin-eosin staining","Elastic Verhoeff-Van Gieson staining","tricuspidannular plane systolic excursion","sildenafil","complete random experiment design","total","RVHI","cross-sectional area","normal saline","day of modeling","consecutive days of intragastric administration","METHODS","monocrotaline","comparison","OBJECTIVE","terms","Echocardiography","time","samples"],"language":"en"},

This leads to an overtreatment of tuberculosis and to underdiagnosis of possible differential diagnoses. METHODS This open-label, parallel-group, superiority randomized controlled trial is done in a rural and an urban center in Tanzania. HIV-positive and -negative adults (\u226518 years) with clinically suspected extrapulmonary tuberculosis are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to an intervention- or control group, stratified by center and HIV status. The intervention consists of a management algorithm including extended focused assessment of sonography for HIV and tuberculosis (eFASH) in combination with chest X-ray and microbiological tests. Treatment with anti-tuberculosis drugs is started, if eFASH is positive, chest X-ray suggests tuberculosis, or a microbiological result is positive for tuberculosis. Patients in the control group are managed according national guidelines. Treatment is started if microbiology is positive or empirically according to the treating physician. The primary outcome is the proportion of correctly managed patients at 6 months (i.e patients who were treated with anti-tuberculosis treatment and had definite or probable tuberculosis, and patients who were not treated with anti-tuberculosis treatment and did not have tuberculosis). Secondary outcomes are the proportion of symptom-free patients at two and 6 months, and time to death. The sample size is 650 patients. DISCUSSION This study will determine, whether ultrasound in combination with other tests can increase the proportion of correctly managed patients with clinically suspected extrapulmonary tuberculosis, thus reducing overtreatment with anti-tuberculosis drugs.

After about 10 years, in 2012, another similar coronavirus triggered the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia. Both caused severe pneumonia killing 774 and 858 people with 8700 cases of confirmed infection for the former, and 2494 for the latter, causing significant economic losses. 8 years later, despite the MERS outbreak remaining in certain parts of the world, at the end of 2019, a new zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and responsible of coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), arose from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It spread rapidly and to date has killed 3,242 persons with more than 81,000 cases of infection in China and causing over 126,000 global cases and 5,414 deaths in 166 other countries around the world, especially Italy. SARS-CoV-2 would seem to have come from a bat, but the intermediate reservoir continues to be unknown. Nonetheless, as for SARS-CoV and MERS CoV, the Spillover effect linked to animal-human promiscuity, human activities including deforestation, illegal bush-trafficking and bushmeat, cannot be excluded. Recently, however, evidence of inter-human only transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been accumulated and thus, the outbreak seems to be spreading by human-to-human transmission throughout a large part of the world. Herein we will provide with an update on the main features of COVID-19 and suggest possible solutions how to halt the expansion of this novel pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Contini, Carlo; Di Nuzzo, Mariachiara; Barp, Nicole; Bonazza, Aurora; De Giorgio, Roberto; Tognon, Mauro; Rubino, Salvatore","journal":"Journal of infection in developing countries","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.12671; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32235085/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs2NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS","Wuhan, Hubei Province"],"locations":["Guangdong","southern China","China","Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","MERS CoV","transmission of SARS","world","human transmission","human activities","years","MERS outbreak","similar coronavirus","cases of infection","animal-human promiscuity","evidence of inter-human","new zoonotic coronavirus","responsible of coronavirus Disease","global cases","cases of confirmed infection","Guangdong Province of southern China","appearance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","Hubei Province","severe pneumonia","main features of COVID","deforestation","Spillover effect","illegal bush-trafficking","people","expansion","certain parts","intermediate reservoir","bushmeat","update","possible solutions","deaths","countries","Wuhan","end","Saudi Arabia","significant economic losses","bat","novel pandemic","persons","Italy"],"language":"en"},

MATERIAL AND METHOD In this observational qualitative study, all patients admitted to a Norwegian local hospital (B\u00E6rum Hospital) with proven COVID-19 infection were included consecutively from the start of the outbreak. We present here patient characteristics, symptoms, clinical findings, experience of using clinical scoring systems and course of illness based on data in medical records. RESULTS In the period 9-31 March 2020, 42 patients, of whom 28 (67 %) were men, were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 infection. The median age was 72.5 years (range 30-95). Fever (79 %), reduced general condition (79 %), dyspnoea (69 %) and cough (67 %) were the most common symptoms. A total of nine patients (21 %) had a critical course of illness with treatment in the Intensive Care Department and/or death during their stay in hospital. Patients with a critical course had a higher average score on National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) on admission (7.6 vs 3.3). Only one of the most severely ill patients scored \u2265 2 on the quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) on admission. INTERPRETATION Most patients admitted to our hospital with COVID-19 had a fever and respiratory tract symptoms. A high percentage of patients had a critical course of illness. A NEWS2 score of \u2265 5 on admission may be a useful aid in identifying patients at risk of a critical course of illness, while CRB-65 and qSOFA score \u2265 2 proved to be of little usefulness for this purpose in our material.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ihle-Hansen, H\u00E5kon; Berge, Trygve; Tveita, Anders; R\u00F8nning, Else Johanne; Ern\u00F8, Per Erik; Andersen, Elizabeth Lyster; Wang, Christian Hjorth; Tveit, Arnljot; Myrstad, Marius","journal":"Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.4045/tidsskr.20.0301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32378844/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs3Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Intensive Care Department","National Early Warning Score","Organ Failure Assessment"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["critical course of illness","ill patients","high percentage of patients","NEWS2 score","qSOFA score","B\u00E6rum Hospital","admission","proven COVID","Norwegian local hospital","clinical findings","common symptoms","higher average score","respiratory tract symptoms","MATERIAL","outbreak","infection","Fever","National Early Warning Score","clinical scoring systems","Norwegian hospitals","quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment","experience","treatment","risk","death","knowledge","Intensive Care Department","CRB","observational qualitative study","health system","METHOD","great need","useful aid","data","patient characteristics","new challenges","median age","years","range","purpose","medical records","little usefulness","dyspnoea","start","stay","vs","period","BACKGROUND","INTERPRETATION","general condition","cough","RESULTS","total"],"language":"en"},

In Iran, the first case of the COVID-19 was reported after spread from China and other countries. Fever, cough, and fatigue were the most common symptoms of this virus. In worldwide, the incubation period of COVID-19 was 3 to 7 days and approximately 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe, requiring oxygen, and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. To mount an antiviral response, the innate immune system recognizes molecular structures that are produced by the invasion of the virus. COVID-19 infection induces IgG antibodies against N protein that can be detected by serum as early as day 4 after the onset of disease and with most patients seroconverting by day 14. Laboratory evidence of clinical patients showed that a specific T-cell response against SARS-CoV-2 is important for the recognition and killing of infected cells, particularly in the lungs of infected individuals. At present, there is no specific antiviral therapy for COVID-19 and the main treatments are supportive. In this review, we investigated the innate and acquired immune responses in patients who recovered from COVID-19, which could inform the design of prophylactic vaccines and immunotherapy for the future.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rokni, Mohsen; Ghasemi, Vida; Tavakoli, Zahra","journal":"Reviews in medical virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.2107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32267987/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs3OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Iran","China"],"keyphrases":["emergence of COVID","incubation period of COVID","SARS-CoV","antiviral response","new virus","spread","innate immune system","specific antiviral therapy","specific T-cell response","immune responses","Laboratory evidence of clinical patients","important pathogen","critical infections","infected cells","lungs of infected individuals","IgG antibodies","N protein","molecular structures","fatigue","immunotherapy","novel coronavirus","design of prophylactic vaccines","future","common symptoms","recognition","main treatments","outbreak","ways","onset of disease","urgent need","oxygen","Fever","cough","ventilation","humans","serum","invasion","present","case","China","countries","beginning","Iran","days","review"],"language":"en"},

The virus belongs to the \u03B2 genus Coronavirus in the family Corornaviridae, and is closely related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing severe symptoms of pneumonia. The virus is transmitted through droplets, close contact, and other means, and patients in the incubation period could potentially transmit the virus to other persons. According to current observations, 2019-nCoV is weaker than SARS in pathogenesis, but has stronger transmission competence; it\u0027s mechanism of cross-species spread might be related with angiotensin-converting enzyme \u2161 (ACE2), which is consistent with the receptor SARS-CoV. After the outbreak of this disease, Chinese scientists invested a lot of energy to carry out research by developing rapid diagnostic reagents, identifying the characters of the pathogen, screening out clinical drugs that may inhibit the virus, and are rapidly developing vaccines. The emergence of 2019-nCoV reminds us once again of the importance of establishing a systematic coronavirus surveillance network.

METHODS Fifty-two patients with bilateral hernia were enrolled in this double-blind randomized controlled trial (NCT02023203). Each hernia, in the same patient, was randomized to implant LP-PTFE or SP-PPL mesh during totally extraperitoneal laparoscopic hernia repair. Patients were followed at 7 days, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 60 months after surgery. Visual analog scale (VAS) score was employed to evaluate the outcomes. Student\u0027s t test was used in case of normally distributed continuous variables, while the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used in case of not normally distributed variables. Chi square test was used for analysis of categorical variables. RESULTS Median VAS discomfort score with SP-PPL was significantly higher than LP-PTFE at 1 and 3 months after surgery (p = 0.003 in both cases). LP-PTFE showed significantly lower median score than SP-PPL at 7 days after surgery (p = 0.025) regarding pain at movement. Testicular pain was lower in case of LP-PTFE than SP-PPL at 7 days, 1 and 3 months after surgery (p = 0.005, p = 0.004 and p = 0.004, respectively). LP-PTFE was significantly more difficult to handle (p = 0.001). At 60 months, one recurrence was observed in the LP-PTFE group (p = 1.0000). CONCLUSIONS LP-PTFE has less postoperative discomfort and pain up to 3 months after surgery, without differences after that period, although it shows more difficulty in handling and recurrences occur even if not statistically significant.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alarc\u00F3n, I; Balla, A; Soler Fr\u00EDas, J R; Barranco, A; Bellido Luque, J; Morales-Conde, S","journal":"Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-020-02200-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32350735/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs4Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CONCLUSIONS LP-PTFE","LP-PTFE group","case of LP","surgery","months","SP-PPL mesh","mesh handling","days","polypropylene mesh","polytetrafluoroethylene mesh","postoperative discomfort","Testicular pain","distributed variables","lower median score","RESULTS Median VAS discomfort score","chronic discomfort","difficulty","mm2","bilateral hernia","distributed continuous variables","patients","Chi square test","Student\u0027s t test","analysis of categorical variables","extraperitoneal laparoscopic hernia repair","nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test","terms of postoperative acute","long-term recurrence rate","double-blind randomized controlled trial","NCT02023203","Visual analog scale","study","recurrences","METHODS","period","differences","PURPOSE Aim","outcomes","movement","cases"],"language":"en"},

Indeed, from February 2020, Italy is facing an explosion of COVID-19 cases. In particular, the Italian observed case fatality rate (CFR) is much higher than the other countries. Recently, it has been hypothesized that the extensive number of intergenerational contacts - typical of Italian culture - could contribute to explain the high number of deaths observed in Italy. However, through an analysis performed for all the Italian regions, here it is shown that the deaths are localized in specific regions and that the CFRs of different Italian regions are overlapping with the rates of European countries. Moreover, through a correlation analyses between CFRs and different social habits, it is shown that no positive correlation is observed between social behaviours and CFRs. In conclusion, this analyses clearly rejects the possibility that social habits and intergenerational contacts can contribute to explain such a profound effect on the number of deaths observed in Italy during COVID-19 outbreak and more effort should be addressed to evaluate the real amount of positive cases.

The vessel densities (VD) of the superficial capillary plexus (SCP), deep capillary plexus (DCP), and retinal peripapillary capillary plexus (RPCP) were assessed using OCT-A in patients with ED and healthy subjects. All the participants were evaluated and scanned for systemic and hormonal disorders and those with ED also underwent penile Doppler ultrasonography (PDU). After recording the data, the participants were divided into three groups: organic ED, psychogenic ED, and healthy control. The relationships between the OCT-A parameters and other clinical findings were analyzed. The right eyes of 80 patients with ED and 40 healthy volunteers were evaluated in this study. Of the ED patients, 46 were included in the organic ED group according to the results of PDU. The VDs of DCP, SCP, and the temporal sector of RPCP were significantly lower in the organic ED group than the psychogenic ED and healthy control groups. The VDs of SCP and DCP were correlated with the peak systolic velocity of both left and right penile cavernous arteries. The VDs of DCP were also correlated with the left and right resistive indexes. In conclusion, the OCT-A data of SCP and especially DCP could be helpful in evaluating ED, and provide reliable information about the origin of the disease along with the other laboratory testing and penile vascular evaluation.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yilmaz, Hayati; Gultekin, Mehmet Hamza; Yalcin, Ahmet","journal":"International journal of impotence research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41443-020-0289-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346132/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs5MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["DCP","SCP","RPCP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ED patients","psychogenic ED","organic ED group","VDs of DCP","VDs of SCP","data of SCP","healthy control groups","healthy volunteers","healthy subjects","deep capillary plexus","superficial capillary plexus","retinal peripapillary capillary plexus","study design","participants","right eyes","penile vascular evaluation","penile Doppler ultrasonography","penile cavernous arteries","results of PDU","temporal sector of RPCP","laboratory testing","optical coherence tomography angiography","disease","differential diagnosis of","device","erectile dysfunction","microvascular network","reliable information","parameters","origin","peak systolic velocity","hormonal disorders","vessel densities","clinical findings","values","resistive indexes","relationships","conclusion","aims"],"language":"en"},

METHODS Sixty Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 6 groups according to a random number table: control group, model group, high-, medium- and low-dose BXD groups (9.2, 4.6 and 1.8 g/(kg\u00B7d), respectively), and domperidone group (10 mg/(kg\u00B7d)), 10 rats per group. DGP model was established initially by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ), and was confirmed by recording gastric emptying, intestinal transport velocity and gastric myoelectric activity of rats after 2 months. Each group was treated with a corresponding drug for 4 weeks. The mRNA and protein expressions of phospholipase C (PLC), inositol triphosphate (IP3), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) dependent protein kinase G (PKG) were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively, while nitric oxide (NO) and cGMP expressions were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Gastric tissues were obtained from rats for primary cell culture preparation. Gastric SM cells were treated with 0.8 \u00B5mol/L of STZ or STZ plus 1,000, 500 and 200 \u00B5g/mL of BXD or STZ plus 2.5 \u00B5mol/mL of domperidone for 24, 48, 72 or 96 h, respectively. The length of gastric SM cells and intracellular Ca2\u002B concentration ([Ca2\u002B]i) before and after BXD treatment was measured. RESULTS Compared with the model group, high- and medium-dose BXD and domperidone significantly increased the expressions of PLC, IP3, NO, nNOS, cGMP and PKG in rat\u0027s gastric tissue (P\u003C0.01). Gastric SM cells treated with BXD showed a time- and dose-dependent increase in cell viability (P\u003C0.01). The treatment with high- and medium-dose BXD and domperidone inhibited the increase in gastric SM cells length and increased [Ca2\u002B]i compared with the model cells (P\u003C0.01). CONCLUSIONS Treatment with high- and medium-dose BXD significantly attenuated STZ-induced experimental DGP in rats. The therapeutic effect of BXD on DGP rats might be associated with the PLC-IP3-Ca2\u002B/NO-cGMP-PKG signal pathway.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Bin; Zeng, Ke-Wu; Hong, Zi-Fu; Ti, Gui-Xiang; Wang, Li-Yun; Lu, Pin; Liu, Zhen","journal":"Chinese journal of integrative medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11655-020-3077-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418177/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs5MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Banxia Xiexin Decoction","DGP","BXD","SM","STZ","PLC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BXD treatment","medium-dose BXD","model rats","DGP rats","mechanism of BXD","model group","length of gastric SM cells","gastric SM cells length","gastric emptying","Gastric tissues","model cells","DGP model","domperidone group","gastric myoelectric activity of rats","low-dose BXD groups","treatment of DGP","therapeutic effect of BXD","rat\u0027s gastric tissue","cGMP expressions","control group","dose-dependent increase","relaxation of gastric smooth muscle","PLC-IP3","expressions of PLC","Sprague-Dawley rats","attenuated STZ","experimental DGP","cGMP-PKG signal pathway","intracellular Ca2","CONCLUSIONS Treatment","nNOS","\u00B5mol","dependent protein kinase G","protein expressions of phospholipase C","experiments of signal pathway","neuronal nitric oxide synthase","cell viability","primary cell culture preparation","effect of Banxia Xiexin Decoction","intestinal transport velocity","cyclic guanosine monophosphate","diabetic gastroparesis","Western blot","inositol triphosphate","reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","random number table","contraction","prevention","concentration","time","single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin","mRNA","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","corresponding drug","METHODS","months","\u00B5g","weeks","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Peripheral arterial calcification reduces acute success and long-term patency of endovascular therapy for PAD. Several calcium modification devices are available for use in peripheral interventions. Outcomes after peripheral intravascular lithotripsy (IVL), a novel approach using pulsatile sonic waves to treat luminal and medial calcium in patients with PAD, have not been extensively characterized. Therefore, we sought to perform an individual patient-level data (IPD) pooled analysis of available studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IVL in the treatment of PAD. METHODS AND RESULTS We pooled IPD, including baseline and procedural variables, from five prospective studies which assessed IVL in the treatment of patients with extensive peripheral artery calcification. Final postprocedural percent diameter stenosis (%DS) and procedural angiographic complications were assessed by independent core laboratory. Efficacy endpoints were analyzed using linear mixed effects models and safety endpoints were tabulated overall and by vascular bed. Among 336 patients who underwent endovascular revascularization with use of IVL, there was a significant reduction between pre-procedural and final %DS of 55.1% (95% confidence interval 53.3-57.0%, p \u003C .0001). Core-laboratory assessed lesion-level complications, including flow-limiting dissections (Types D-F), vessel perforation, distal embolization, thrombus, abrupt closure, and no reflow, occurred in 4/328 (1.22%) of treated lesions. CONCLUSIONS The present IPD of five prospective studies, marking the largest analysis to date evaluating the use of IVL in significantly calcified PAD lesions, demonstrates this treatment strategy to be both effective and safe.","publish_time":"2020-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Madhavan, Mahesh V; Shahim, Bahira; Mena-Hurtado, Carlos; Garcia, Lawrence; Crowley, Aaron; Parikh, Sahil A","journal":"Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography \u0026 Interventions","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.28729; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31957955/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs5MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PAD","IVL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of IVL","treatment of PAD","safety of IVL","Peripheral arterial calcification","treatment of patients","peripheral interventions","calcified PAD lesions","prospective studies","BACKGROUND Peripheral arterial disease","peripheral intravascular lithotripsy","pooled analysis of available studies","extensive peripheral artery calcification","present IPD","procedural angiographic complications","pre-procedural","procedural variables","safety endpoints","treatment strategy","Efficacy endpoints","Core-laboratory","lesion-level complications","independent core laboratory","largest analysis","medial calcium","endovascular revascularization","treated lesions","calcium modification devices","long-term patency of endovascular therapy","individual patient-level data","common manifestations of atherosclerotic disease","Final postprocedural percent diameter stenosis","acute success","distal embolization","vessel perforation","linear mixed effects models","thrombus","pulsatile sonic waves","flow","Types D-F","novel approach","dissections","significant reduction","abrupt closure","baseline","Outcomes","date","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","confidence interval","vascular bed"],"language":"en"},

The management of the disease is mostly supportive, and respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome is the leading cause of death in a significant proportion of affected patients. Preliminary data point out that dramatic increase in IL-6 and subsequent cytokine release syndrome may account for the development of fatal interstitial pneumonia. Inhibition of IL-6 by blocking its specific receptor with monoclonal antibodies has been advocated as a promising attempt. Here we assess the potential utility of myo-Inositol, a polyol already in use for treating the newborn Respiratory Distress Syndrome, in downregulating the inflammatory response upon Sars-CoV-2 infection. Myo-Inositol proved to reduce IL-6 levels in a number of conditions and to mitigate the inflammatory cascade, while being devoid of any significant side effects. It is tempting to speculate that inositol could be beneficial in managing the most dreadful effects of Sars-CoV-2 infection.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bizzarri, M; Lagan\u00E0, A S; Aragona, D; Unfer, V","journal":"European review for medical and pharmacological sciences","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202003_20715; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32271462/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs5NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Sars-CoV","Myo-Inositol","acute respiratory distress syndrome","newborn Respiratory Distress Syndrome","respiratory failure","dreadful effects of Sars","outbreak of Sars","Inhibition of IL","infection","subsequent cytokine release syndrome","inflammatory response","inflammatory cascade","potential utility of myo","significant proportion of affected patients","leading cause of death","dramatic increase","serious challenges","COVID","monoclonal antibodies","development of fatal interstitial pneumonia","specific receptor","number of conditions","people\u0027s health","Preliminary data","levels","disease","polyol","management","promising attempt"],"language":"en"},

We hypothesized that early bisphenol A (BPA) and bisphenol S (BPS) exposures would be associated with sex-dependent changes in preschool executive function. METHODS A subsample of the Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition (APrON) cohort (n = 312) provided maternal second trimester (prenatal) and 3-month postpartum (postnatal) urine samples, from which BPA and BPS concentrations were quantified. When children were age 2 and 4, mothers completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool Version (BRIEF-P). Changes in standardized T scores on the BRIEF-P indexes of inhibitory self-control, flexibility, and emergent metacognition were investigated. RESULTS Adjusted multivariate regression analyses showed that child sex modified the associations between maternal postnatal BPA and changes in executive function. Higher maternal postnatal BPA concentrations predicted increasing difficulties from age 2 to 4 in the domains of inhibitory self-control and emergent metacognition in female, but not male children. The other bisphenol concentrations were not associated with changes in executive function. CONCLUSION Due to the ubiquity of BPA exposure among breastfeeding women, these findings justify further investigation on the effects of postnatal bisphenol exposure on child cognitive development. IMPACT Higher concentrations of maternal BPA at 3-month postpartum were associated with increasing difficulties in inhibitory self-control and emergent metacognition from age 2 to 4 in girls, but not boys.Prenatal BPA and prenatal/postnatal BPS were not significant predictors of change in executive function in boys and girls.The current study extends previous research to show that maternal postnatal BPA could also impact child executive function.Due to the ubiquity of BPA exposure among breastfeeding women, the current findings suggest that additional precautions may be needed to protect infants\u0027 neurodevelopment from indirect exposure to BPA.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"England-Mason, Gillian; Liu, Jiaying; Martin, Jonathan W; Giesbrecht, Gerald F; Letourneau, Nicole; Dewey, Deborah","journal":"Pediatric research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-020-0922-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408341/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs5Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BPA","Behavior Rating Inventory"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Prenatal BPA","ubiquity of BPA exposure","child executive function","Higher maternal postnatal BPA concentrations","preschool executive function","executive function development","IMPACT Higher concentrations of maternal BPA","effects of postnatal bisphenol exposure","bisphenol concentrations","BACKGROUND Early bisphenol exposure","child sex","indirect exposure","emergent metacognition","age","bisphenol S","Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool Version","sex-dependent changes","domains of inhibitory self-control","BRIEF-P indexes of inhibitory self-control","increasing difficulties","breastfeeding women","current findings","month postpartum","boys","child cognitive development","girls","potential sex effects","current study","male children","consequences","Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes","Nutrition","APrON","female","flexibility","previous research","associations","significant predictors of change","multivariate regression analyses","standardized T scores","urine samples","investigation","infants\u0027 neurodevelopment","subsample","cohort","mothers","additional precautions","METHODS","RESULTS","exposures","trimester","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

This virus produces the Covid-19 disease, which has become a pandemic of devastating effects not only healthwise, but also, importantly, from an economic, political and social point of view. This essay seeks to establish the scientific evidence-based elements that guide public policies for prevention and control. Some of these elements are: a) epidemiologic intelligence. This includes not only the strategy of public surveillance, but also sentinel and event-based surveillance, as it is impossible to actually identify all positive cases; b) Mitigating measures against the spread of the epidemic, such as social distancing and hygiene, washing hands, quarantine, restricting movement and using masks, among others; c) Measures to suppress transmission when the number of cases is very high, such as strict measures to stay at home; d) strengthening health services \u0027capacity for medical attention and improving health services\u0027 ability to prevent transmission, including the use of diagnostic tests; e) the development of prophylactic vaccines against Covid-19, as well as the development of therapeutic agents. All of these actions must be rapidly implemented, from a multidisciplinary and multisectorial public health perspective, and they absolutely must also be taken with the community\u0027s participation as shared responsibility. Therefore, public health literacy is needed.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lazcano-Ponce, Eduardo; Alpuche-Aranda, Celia","journal":"Salud publica de Mexico","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.21149/11408; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32304371/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs5ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["public health literacy","health promotion","multisectorial public health perspective","health services\u0027 ability","public policies","strategy of public surveillance","Mitigating measures","transmission","strict measures","Covid","event-based surveillance","positive cases","scientific evidence-based elements","social distancing","number of cases","conceptual perspective","virus emergency","development of prophylactic vaccines","social point of view","development of therapeutic agents","medical attention","respect","decisions","capacity","access information","individual competencies","express opinions","hands","knowledge","home","SARS-CoV","use of diagnostic tests","quarantine","motivation","hygiene","face","spread","epidemic","prevention","process","pandemic of devastating effects","environments","community\u0027s participation","shared responsibility","healthwise","masks","movement","control","disease","maintenance","different contexts","life","essay","epidemiologic intelligence","actions"],"language":"en"},

Even after 11 years of this discovery, the role of this gene in AD has not yet been fully elucidated and the association of its variants was not validated in Latin American populations. We genotyped five CR1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs rs6656401, rs3849266, rs2274567, rs4844610, and rs12034383) in up to 162 AD patients and 137 controls through PCR-SSP and iPLEX MassARRAY Platform (Sequenom), and measured soluble CR1 (sCR1) levels in plasma of 40 AD patients and 39 controls with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Homozygosity for haplotype rs3849266*C_rs2274567*A (CA/CA genotype) was associated with susceptibility to AD (OR = 2.94, p = 0.018). Patients presented higher sCR1 levels in plasma than controls (p = 0.038). Furthermore, patients that carry the rs2274567*G allele (p.1208Arg) presented higher sCR1 levels than A/A (p.1208His/His) homozygotes (p = 0.036). This is the first study to validate the association of CR1 polymorphisms with late-onset Alzheimer\u0027s disease, as well as to evaluate sCR1 levels in a Latin American population. SNPs present in the regulatory and coding regions of this gene may be playing a key role in the observed association, probably by interfering in A\u03B2 plaques clearance. Inhibition may be due to the increase in local sCR1 levels observed in patients, which may result from polymorphisms leading to larger isoforms of CR1 and/or structural alterations of the protein that makes it less functional, as well as increased vesiculation of the molecules.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kretzschmar, Gabriela Canalli; Antoniazzi, Angela Adriane Hanel; Oliveira, Luana Caroline; Nisihara, Renato Mitsunori; Petzl-Erler, Maria Luiza; de Souza, Ricardo Lehtonen R; Boldt, Angelica Beate Winter","journal":"Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12031-020-01547-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388800/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs1NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AD patients","association of CR1 polymorphisms","higher sCR1 levels","CR1 gene","local sCR1 levels","controls","rs2274567","soluble CR1","observed association","CR1 single nucleotide polymorphisms","larger isoforms of CR1","plasma","late-onset Alzheimer\u0027s disease","Latin American populations","SNPs rs6656401","SNPs present","haplotype rs3849266","key role","CA genotype","PCR-SSP","Sequenom","iPLEX MassARRAY Platform","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","coding regions","ELISA","rs4844610","variants","structural alterations","G allele","increased vesiculation","protein","Homozygosity","discovery","susceptibility","rs12034383","A\u03B2 plaques clearance","molecules","years","study","Inhibition","homozygotes"],"language":"en"},

Their protein composition and gluten dependent technological traits have been comprehensively studied, however, little information is available about their carbohydrate dependent viscous properties. The aim of this work was the comprehensive rheological characterisation of all sublines of B\u00E1nk\u00FAti 1201 maintained at Martonv\u00E1s\u00E1r and to investigate their variability if the carbohydrate dependent viscous behaviour would be also included in the analyses. RESULTS The majority of the lines reflected the famously good mixing quality of B\u00E1nk\u00FAti, however, much higher diversity of pasting behaviour was detected. Cluster analysis of the Mixolab data was performed resulting four sample groups. Since several lines of similar mixing properties had significantly different pasting characteristics, it was assumed that classification was mainly based on the viscous properties. From each clusters 2-3 representative samples were selected for wider examination using conventional testing methods. These results also supported the higher variability of pasting behaviour of the lines, which can be critical for end product quality. The members of the second cluster can be highlighted due to their waxy wheat like behaviour. CONCLUSIONS Possible reasons of the great variability of pasting behaviour could be the compositional and structural differences of starch and other carbohydrates (e.g. arabinoxylans). Complex rheological characterisation and study of molecular background can provide information about important traits in the point of view of technology and product development, which are unknown in the case of old wheat varieties and landraces.

The term \u0022epigenetics\u0022 refers to regulatory mechanisms that control gene expression but are not related to changes in DNA sequence. These include DNA methylation, histone modifications, and regulation of transcription via non-coding RNAs. Epigenetic modifications, occurring in response to external stressors, lead to changes in gene expression, and thus lie at the intersection between genetics and the environment. In this review, we examine data from in vitro studies, animal studies, and the existing human sepsis studies in epigenetics to demonstrate that epigenetic mechanisms are likely central to the pathogenesis of sepsis and that epigenetic therapies may have potential in the treatment of sepsis and its associated organ failures. DATA SOURCES Online search of published scientific literature via Pubmed using the term \u0022epigenetics\u0022 in combination with the terms \u0022sepsis\u0022, \u0022infection\u0022, \u0022bacterial infection\u0022, \u0022viral infection\u0022, \u0022critical illness\u0022, \u0022acute respiratory distress syndrome\u0022, and \u0022acute lung injury\u0022. STUDY SELECTION Articles were chosen for inclusion based on their relevance to sepsis, acute inflammation, sepsis-related immune suppression, and sepsis-related organ failure. Reference lists were reviewed to identify additional relevant articles. DATA EXTRACTION Relevant data was extracted and synthesized for narrative review. DATA SYNTHESIS Epigenetic regulation is a key determinant of gene expression in sepsis. At the onset of infection, host-pathogen interactions often result in epigenetic alterations to host cells that favor pathogen survival. In parallel, the host inflammatory response is characterized by epigenetic modifications in key regulatory genes, including tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1\u03B2. In human sepsis patients, multiple epigenetic modifying enzymes show differential expression in early sepsis, suggesting a role for epigenetics in coordinating the response to infection. In the later stages of sepsis, epigenetic modifications accompany endotoxin tolerance and the immune-suppressed state. In animal models, treatment with epigenetic modifiers can mitigate the effects of sepsis and improve survival as well as reverse sepsis-associated organ injury. CONCLUSIONS Epigenetic modifications are associated with key phases of sepsis, from the host-pathogen interaction, to acute inflammation, to immune suppression. Epigenetic markers show promise in the diagnosis and prognosis of sepsis and epigenetic modifying agents show promise as therapeutic tools in animal models of sepsis. Human studies in the area of epigenetics are sorely lacking and should be a priority for sepsis researchers.","publish_time":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Binnie, Alexandra; Tsang, Jennifer L Y; Hu, Pingzhao; Carrasqueiro, Gabriela; Castelo-Branco, Pedro; Dos Santos, Claudia C","journal":"Critical care medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000004247; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167492/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs2MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of sepsis","pathogenesis of sepsis","early sepsis","prognosis of sepsis","effects of sepsis","sepsis researchers","human sepsis patients","animal models of sepsis","key phases of sepsis","epigenetic mechanisms","existing human sepsis studies","epigenetic modifiers","epigenetic alterations","epigenetic therapies","Epigenetic markers","later stages of sepsis","sepsis-related immune suppression","sepsis-related organ failure","CONCLUSIONS Epigenetic modifications","small number of human sepsis studies","reverse sepsis-associated organ injury","DATA SYNTHESIS Epigenetic regulation","epigenetic modifying agents","Human studies","multiple epigenetic modifying enzymes","animal studies","DATA EXTRACTION Relevant data","acute inflammation","histone modifications","viral infection","bacterial infection","area of epigenetics","onset of infection","key determinant of gene expression","host-pathogen interactions","host inflammatory response","differential expression","pathogen survival","acute lung injury","associated organ failures","key regulatory genes","regulation of transcription","promise","regulatory mechanisms","central role","changes","acute respiratory distress syndrome","immune-suppressed state","additional relevant articles","DATA SOURCES Online search of published scientific literature","DNA methylation","DNA sequence","narrative review","STUDY SELECTION Articles","therapeutic tools","tumor necrosis factor","endotoxin tolerance","Pubmed","lead","diagnosis","critical illness","inclusion","external stressors","fields of microbiology","interleukin","non-coding RNAs","cells","relevance","combination","potential","OBJECTIVES Recent evidence","terms","immunology","Reference lists","intersection","environment","priority"],"language":"en"},

Analyses from Two German Studies.","doi":"10.1007/s10995-020-02937-z","pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":"32388767","license":"unk","abstract":"OBJECTIVE Non-medical antenatal care (ANC) refers to a range of non-medical services available to women during pregnancy aiming at supporting women and prepare them for the birth and the postpartum period. In Germany, they include antenatal classes, breastfeeding classes and pregnancy-specific yoga or gymnastics courses. Studies suggest that various types of non-medical ANC carry benefits for both the women and their babies. Little is known about the uptake of non-medical ANC among different socioeconomic population subgroups, but one may expect lower utilization among socio-economically disadvantaged women. We analyzed factors contributing to the utilization of non-medical ANC in general and antenatal classes in particular. METHODS Baseline data of the Bielefeld BaBi birth cohort (2013-2016) and the Berlin perinatal study (2011-2012) were analyzed. Comparing the two cohorts allowed to increase the socio-economic and migration background variance of the study population and to capture the effect of the local context on uptake of services. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to study associations between the uptake of non-medical ANC and socio-economic and migration status. RESULTS In Berlin and Bielefeld, being a first generation migrant and having lower levels of education were associated with lower non-medical ANC uptake. In Berlin, being a 2nd generation woman or having a low income was also associated with lower uptake. CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE Our study suggests that non-medical ANC remains in some part the prerogative of non-migrant, well-educated and economically privileged women. Since differences in non-medical ANC have the potential to create inequalities in terms of birth outcomes and maternal health during pregnancy and post-partum, more efforts are needed to promote the use of non-medical ANC by all population groups.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ludwig, Angelique; Miani, C\u00E9line; Breckenkamp, J\u00FCrgen; Sauzet, Odile; Borde, Theda; Doyle, Ina-Merle; Brenne, Silke; H\u00F6ller-Holtrichter, Chantal; David, Matthias; Spallek, Jacob; Razum, Oliver","journal":"Maternal and child health journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-020-02937-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388767/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs2Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ANC"],"locations":["Bielefeld","Berlin"],"keyphrases":["uptake of non-medical ANC","utilization of non-medical ANC","lower non-medical ANC uptake","use of non-medical ANC","various types of non-medical ANC","OBJECTIVE Non-medical antenatal care","range of non-medical services available","prerogative of non-migrant","lower uptake","study population","uptake of services","antenatal classes","lower utilization","disadvantaged women","privileged women","Berlin perinatal study","study associations","breastfeeding classes","lower levels of education","population groups","generation migrant","Bielefeld BaBi birth cohort","pregnancy-specific yoga","terms of birth outcomes","different socioeconomic population subgroups","migration status","generation woman","migration background variance","maternal health","post-partum","METHODS Baseline data","inequalities","effect","potential","benefits","low income","Multivariate logistic regression analyses","efforts","gymnastics courses","local context","PRACTICE","Studies","differences","postpartum period","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","Germany","factors","cohorts","babies"],"language":"en"},

METHODS Sixty-seven TA patients, who had IL-6 levels detected at the first visit and had a regular follow-up of at least 2 years, were enrolled. Data recorded up to March 31, 2019, including clinical presentations, laboratory indices, treatments, and radiological images were collected and used for analysis. The value of IL-6 in predicting disease relapse and imaging progression was analyzed. RESULTS IL-6 levels were positively related with disease activity index, including Kerr scores, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Patients were divided into three groups according to baseline serum IL-6 levels: low group (\u003C 5.4 pg/mL, n = 29), medium group (5.4-11.5 pg/mL, n = 20), and high group (\u003E 11.5 ng/mL, n = 18). Patients in the medium and high group had higher disease activity than those in the low group (p \u003C 0.01). Baseline IL-6 levels were correlated with luminal stenosis (p \u003C 0.05), although no significant correlations with long-term imaging progression were observed. Patients with more than 2 episodes of disease relapses were most commonly seen in the medium group (p \u003C 0.05). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis indicated that medium and high IL-6 levels were positive predictors for disease relapse (HR 4.3, 95%CI 1.3-18.7 p = 0.07 for medium group; HR 2.1, 95% CI 0.7-48.9, p = 0.19 for high group) with disease status and treatment adjusted.

Nevertheless, many occupational health and safety (OHS) guidelines are still not based on the best available evidence. In the last decade, numerous systematic reviews on behavioural, relational and mixed interventions to reduce occupational injuries and diseases have been carried out, but a comprehensive synopsis is yet missing. The aim of this overview of reviews is to provide a comprehensive basis to inform evidence-based decision-making about interventions in the field of OHS. METHODS We conducted an overview of reviews. We searched MEDLINE (Ovid), the Cochrane Library (Wiley), epistemonikos.org and Scopus (Elsevier) for relevant systematic reviews published between January 2008 and June 2018. Two authors independently screened abstracts and full-text publications and determined the risk of bias of the included systematic reviews with the ROBIS (Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews) tool. RESULTS We screened 2287 abstracts and 200 full-texts for eligibility. Finally, we included 25 systematic reviews with a low risk of bias for data synthesis and analysis. We identified systematic reviews on the prevention of occupational injuries, musculoskeletal, skin and lung diseases, occupational hearing impairment and interventions without specific target diseases. Several interventions led to consistently positive results on individual diseases; other interventions did not show any effects, or the studies are contradictory. We provide detailed results on all included interventions. DISCUSSION To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive overview of behavioural, relational and mixed interventions and their effectiveness in preventing occupational injuries and diseases. It provides policymakers with an important basis for making evidence-based decisions on interventions in this field.

Previous research has suggested that humans also show the inversion effect to objects that they have expertise about, and this is called the expert effect. We investigated whether chimpanzees show the expert effect and how humans and chimpanzees differ by testing chimpanzees (human experts) with human body stimuli and testing humans (chimpanzee experts) with chimpanzee and human body stimuli in body recognition tasks. The main finding was that humans (chimpanzee experts) showed the expert effect to chimpanzee bodies, while chimpanzees partially showed it to human bodies. This suggests that compared with chimpanzees, the special processing in humans can be more flexibly tuned for other objects. We also tested humans that were not chimpanzee experts using chimpanzee body stimuli. Although they showed similar performances as the chimpanzee experts, the two groups had differences in some situations, indicating the effect of expertise.

Considering the uncertainties surrounding BCG efficacy and the lower likelihood of TB exposure in low-incidence countries, most have discontinued mass vaccination, choosing instead a targeted vaccination strategy among high-risk groups. Given the increased risk of TB infection in Canadian Indigenous communities compared to the general Canadian population, these communities are a pertinent example of high-incidence groups in an otherwise low-burden country, warranting particular consideration regarding BCG vaccination strategy. This systematic review aims to synthesise and critically appraise the literature on BCG vaccination strategies in high-risk groups in low-incidence settings to provide policy considerations relevant to the Canadian Indigenous context. METHODS A literature search of the Medline and Embase databases was conducted, returning studies pertaining to BCG vaccine efficacy, TB incidence under specific vaccination policies, BCG-associated adverse events, and vaccination policy guidelines in low-burden countries. Study screening was tracked using the Covidence systematic review software (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia), and data pertaining to the above points of interest were extracted. RESULTS The final review included 49 studies, spanning 15 countries. Although almost all of these countries had implemented a form of mass or routine vaccination previously, 11 have since moved to targeted vaccination of selected risk groups, in most cases due to the low risk of infection among the general population and thus the high number of vaccinations needed to prevent one case in the context of low-incidence settings. Regarding identifying risk groups for targeted screening, community-based (rather than individual risk-factor-based) vaccination has been found to be beneficial in high-incidence communities within low-incidence countries, suggesting this approach may be beneficial in the Canadian Indigenous setting. CONCLUSIONS Community-based vaccination of high-incidence communities may be beneficial in the Canadian Indigenous context, however, where BCG vaccination is implemented, delivery strategies and potential barriers to achieving adequate coverage in this setting should be considered. Where an existing vaccination program is discontinued, it is crucial that an effective TB surveillance system is in place, and that case-finding, screening, and diagnostic efforts are strengthened in order to ensure adequate TB control. This is particularly relevant in Canadian Indigenous and other remote or under-served communities, where barriers to surveillance, screening, and diagnosis persist.","publish_time":"2019-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Faust, Lena; Schreiber, Yoko; Bocking, Natalie","journal":"BMC public health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-019-7868-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31711446/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs4Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bacille"],"organizations":["BCG","Veritas Health Innovation"],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["BCG vaccination policies","BCG vaccination strategies","BCG vaccination strategy","mass vaccination","low-incidence countries","TB incidence","routine vaccination","incidence groups","low-burden countries","targeted vaccination strategy","vaccination of selected risk groups","high-incidence communities","low-incidence settings","high-TB","vaccination policy guidelines","specific vaccination policies","context of low","Canadian Indigenous communities","existing vaccination program","BCG efficacy","low risk of infection","CONCLUSIONS Community-based vaccination of high","Canadian Indigenous context","low-burden country","Canadian Indigenous setting","increased risk of TB infection","BCG vaccine efficacy","identifying risk groups","high-risk groups","targeted screening","general Canadian population","adequate TB control","effective TB surveillance system","lower likelihood of TB exposure","Study screening","pertinent example of high","high number of vaccinations","individual risk-factor","general population","studies","final review","Covidence systematic review software","policy considerations relevant","delivery strategies","potential barriers","literature search","adequate coverage","form of mass","data pertaining","Veritas Health Innovation","adverse events","particular consideration","Melbourne","Australia","Medline","order","place","tuberculosis","cases","BACKGROUND Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00E9rin","Embase databases","approach","METHODS","diagnostic efforts","uncertainties","points","diagnosis"],"language":"en"},

We set out to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the lives of these patients in the US. METHODS Participants in a US-wide longitudinal observational registry responded to a supplemental COVID-19 questionnaire by email on March 25, 2020 about their symptoms, COVID-19 testing, healthcare changes, and related experiences during the prior two weeks. Analysis compared responses by diagnosis, disease activity, and new onset of symptoms. Qualitative analysis was conducted on optional free-text comment fields. RESULTS Of the 7,061 participants invited, 530 responded, with RA the most frequent diagnosis (61%). Eleven met COVID-19 screening criteria, of which two sought testing unsuccessfully. Six others sought testing, three were successful, and all were negative. Not quite half (42%) reported a change to their care in the prior two weeks. Qualitative analysis revealed four key themes: emotions in response to the pandemic, perceptions of risks from immunosuppressive medications, protective measures to reduce risk of COVID-19 infection, and disruptions in accessing rheumatic disease medications including hydroxychloroquine. CONCLUSION After two weeks, many with rheumatic diseases already had important changes to their healthcare, with many altering medications without professional consultation or due to hydroxychloroquine shortage.

SETTING SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from a 58-year-old man from Wuhan, China who arrived in Melbourne on 19 January 2020 and was admitted to the Monash Medical Centre, Melbourne from the emergency department on 24 January 2020 with fever, cough, and progressive dyspnoea. MAJOR OUTCOMES Clinical course and laboratory features of the first reported case of COVID-19 (the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2) in Australia; isolation, whole genome sequencing, imaging, and rapid sharing of virus from the patient. RESULTS A nasopharyngeal swab and sputum collected when the patient presented to hospital were each positive for SARS-CoV-2 (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). Inoculation of Vero/hSLAM cells with material from the nasopharyngeal swab led to the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 virus in culture. Electron microscopy of the supernatant confirmed the presence of virus particles with morphology characteristic of viruses of the family Coronaviridae. Whole genome sequencing of the viral isolate and phylogenetic analysis indicated the isolate exhibited greater than 99.99% sequence identity with other publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Within 24 hours of isolation, the first Australian SARS-CoV-2 isolate was shared with local and overseas reference laboratories and major North American and European culture collections.

Recent research has also associated MDSCs with numerous obstetrical and gynecological diseases. During pregnancy, MDSCs accumulate to ensure maternal-fetal immune tolerance, whereas they are decreased in patients who suffer from early miscarriage or preeclampsia. While the etiology of endometriosis is still unknown, abnormal accumulation of MDSCs in the peripheral blood and peritoneal fluid, alongside an increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been observed in these patients, which is central to the cellular immune regulations by MDSCs. Additionally, the regulation of MDSCs observed in tumors is also applicable to gynecologic neoplasms, including ovarian cancer and cervical cancer. More recently, emerging evidence has shown that there are high levels of MDSCs in premature ovarian failure (POF) and in vitro fertilization (IVF), but the underlying mechanisms are unknown.

The World Health Organization declared the pandemic diffusion of COVID-19, and restrictive measures to limit contagion have been taken in several countries. The virus has a predominantly respiratory transmission through aerosol and droplets. The importance of infection control is therefore crucial in limiting the effects of virus diffusion. We aim to discuss the risks related to dental practice and current recommendations for dental practitioners. A literature search was performed to retrieve articles on the management of COVID-19 diffusion in dental practice. The documented clinical experience, the measures of professional prevention, and the actual Italian situation were reported and described. Four articles were retrieved from the literature search. Among the eligible articles, 3 reported measures to contrast COVID-19 diffusion. The infection management protocols suggested were reviewed. Finally, recommendations based on the Italian experience in terms of patient triage, patients\u0027 entrance into the practice, dental treatment, and after-treatment management are reported and discussed.

In this review we have investigated the available literature on COVID-19 transmission during MIS, address the implications of current and previously published recommendations and discuss steps to mitigate COVID-19 transmission during MIS for staff and patient safety.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Porter, James; Blau, Elliot; Gharagozloo, Farid; Martino, Martin; Cerfolio, Robert; Duvvuri, Umamaheswar; Caceres, Aileen; Badani, Ketan; Bhayani, Sam; Collins, Justin; Coelho, Rafael; Rocco, Bernard; Wiklund, Peter; Nathan, Senthil; Parra-Davila, Eduardo; Ortiz-Ortiz, Carlos; Maes, Kris; Dasgupta, Prokar; Patel, Vipul","journal":"BJU international","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/bju.15105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32383520/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Royal Colleges","MIS"],"locations":["Great Britain","Ireland"],"keyphrases":["transmission","possibility of COVID","invasive surgery","laparoscopic surgery","Royal Colleges of Surgery","available literature","patient safety","implications of current","CO2 insufflant","published recommendations","current outbreak","viral pathogen release","Society of American Gastrointestinal","SAGES","Great Britain","Endoscopic Surgeons","appropriate utilization","Ireland","statements","uncertainty","presence","prior evidence","Surgical governing bodies","concern","regard","viruses","steps","staff","basis","caution","lack of understanding","pandemic","review"],"language":"en"},

Initially; 73 studies were identified and; after selecting them according to eligibility criteria; 10 were included. RESULTS The main recommendations based on the available evidence indicate emotional management measures such as offering support groups to professionals, ensuring their social non-discrimination, strengthening their confidence and control capacity through training actions, as well as reinforcing the recognition of nurses by the community. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The accumulated evidence comes from experience with previous outbreaks of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. Stress was the most studied aspect, concerning issues such as social stigma, professionalism, intention to care, burnout, ethical conflicts, anxiety, depression or guilt.

In vitro studies indicate that the antiviral effect of chloroquine diphosphate (CQ) requires a high concentration of the drug. Objective To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 CQ dosages in patients with severe COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This parallel, double-masked, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial with 81 adult patients who were hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was conducted from March 23 to April 5, 2020, at a tertiary care facility in Manaus, Brazilian Amazon. Interventions Patients were allocated to receive high-dosage CQ (ie, 600 mg CQ twice daily for 10 days) or low-dosage CQ (ie, 450 mg twice daily on day 1 and once daily for 4 days). Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcome was reduction in lethality by at least 50% in the high-dosage group compared with the low-dosage group. Data presented here refer primarily to safety and lethality outcomes during treatment on day 13. Secondary end points included participant clinical status, laboratory examinations, and electrocardiogram results. Outcomes will be presented to day 28. Viral respiratory secretion RNA detection was performed on days 0 and 4. Results Out of a predefined sample size of 440 patients, 81 were enrolled (41 [50.6%] to high-dosage group and 40 [49.4%] to low-dosage group). Enrolled patients had a mean (SD) age of 51.1 (13.9) years, and most (60 [75.3%]) were men. Older age (mean [SD] age, 54.7 [13.7] years vs 47.4 [13.3] years) and more heart disease (5 of 28 [17.9%] vs 0) were seen in the high-dose group. Viral RNA was detected in 31 of 40 (77.5%) and 31 of 41 (75.6%) patients in the low-dosage and high-dosage groups, respectively. Lethality until day 13 was 39.0% in the high-dosage group (16 of 41) and 15.0% in the low-dosage group (6 of 40). The high-dosage group presented more instance of QTc interval greater than 500 milliseconds (7 of 37 [18.9%]) compared with the low-dosage group (4 of 36 [11.1%]). Respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only 6 of 27 patients (22.2%). Conclusions and Relevance The preliminary findings of this study suggest that the higher CQ dosage should not be recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 because of its potential safety hazards, especially when taken concurrently with azithromycin and oseltamivir. These findings cannot be extrapolated to patients with nonsevere COVID-19.

AIM To assess the efficacy of colonoscopy, capsule, enema, and nasogastric tube (NGT) FMT for the treatment of recurrent CDI. METHODS We reported clinical outcomes of colonoscopy, capsule, enema, and NGT FMT for the treatment of recurrent CDI according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. During January 2000 to January 2018, three databases were searched: PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL. Primary outcome was overall cure rate which was assessed using a random effects model; secondary outcomes included adverse effects as well as subgroup analyses comparing donor relationship, sample preparation, and study design. RESULTS Twenty-six studies (1309 patients) were included in the study. FMT was administered using colonoscopy in 16 studies (483 patients), NGT in five studies (149 patients), enema in four studies (360 patients), and capsules in four studies (301 patients). The random effects of pooled FMT cure rates were colonoscopy 94.8% (CI 92.4-96.8%; I2 15.6%), capsule 92.1% (CI 88.6-95.0%; I2 7.1%), enema 87.2% (CI 83.4-90.5%; I2 0%), and NGT/NDT 78.1% (CI 71.6-84.1%; I2 0%). On subgroup analysis of colonoscopy FMT, sample preparation methods had comparable cure rates: fresh 94.9% compared to 94.5%. Similarly, cure rates were unaffected by donor relationship: mixed 94.5% compared to unrelated donor 95.7%. CONCLUSION CDI cure rates with FMT performed with colonoscopy are superior to enema and NGT FMT, while those with FMT with colonoscopy and capsule are comparable.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ramai, Daryl; Zakhia, Karl; Fields, Paul J; Ofosu, Andrew; Patel, Goonja; Shahnazarian, Vahe; Lai, Jonathan K; Dhaliwal, Amaninder; Reddy, Madhavi; Chang, Shannon","journal":"Digestive diseases and sciences","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-020-06185-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32166622/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjsxOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDI","NGT FMT","NGT/NDT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NGT FMT","enema","patients","studies","subgroup analysis of colonoscopy FMT","random effects of pooled FMT cure rates","efficacy of colonoscopy","I2","comparable cure rates","CONCLUSION CDI cure rates","clinical outcomes of colonoscopy","treatment of recurrent CDI","donor relationship","overall cure rate","sample preparation methods","adverse effects","subgroup analyses","random effects model","unrelated donor","capsules","secondary outcomes","recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections","study design","Meta-Analyses guidelines","Systematic Reviews","administration","Preferred Reporting Items","routes of fecal microbiota transplantation","nasogastric tube","BACKGROUND","Primary outcome","PubMed","EMBASE","databases","CINAHL","NDT","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

We determined the prevalence of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 and characterized the symptoms of patients with mild COVID-19. METHODS We recruited the study participants from a community facility designated for isolation of patients without moderate-to-severe symptoms of COVID-19 in South Korea. The prevalence of asymptomatic patients at admission and the detailed symptoms of mild COVID-19 were evaluated through a questionnaire-based survey. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS Of the 213 patients with COVID-19, 41 (19.2%) were asymptomatic until admission. Among the remaining patients with mild COVID-19, the most common symptom was cough (40.1% [69/172]), followed by hyposmia (39.5% [68/172]) and sputum (39.5%, [68/172]). Of the 68 patients with hyposmia, 61 (90%) patients had accompanying symptoms such as hypogeusia, nasal congestion, or rhinorrhea. Fever (\u003E37.5 \u00B0C) was only observed in 20 (11.6%). CONCLUSIONS As much as one-fifth of patients with COVID-19 had remained asymptomatic from exposure to admission. Hyposmia was quite frequent among patients with mild COVID-19, whereas fever was not.

DATA SOURCES The Cochrane, Embase, PsycINFO and PubMed databases were searched for studies published between 1983 and December 2019. The reference lists of included studies were additionally examined and Scopus citation searches conducted. REVIEW METHODS Study screening and data extraction were independently completed by two reviewers. Randomised controlled trials comparing motivational interviewing interventions for multiple sclerosis to usual care, wait-list or other active intervention controls were examined. Studies were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Standardised mean differences (Hedges\u0027 g), 95% confidence intervals and P values were calculated for all health and behavioural outcomes. RESULTS Ten randomised controlled trials, involving a pooled sample of 987 adults with relapsing-remitting or progressive multiple sclerosis and mild to moderate impairment, were identified. Most trials had a low or unclear risk of methodological bias. Motivational interviewing, when used in conjunction with other counselling or rehabilitation techniques, resulted in significant immediate medium-to-very large improvements in multiple physical, psychological, social and behavioural outcomes (range: g = .34-2.68). Maintenance effects were promising (range: g = .41-1.11), although less frequently assessed (Nstudies = 5) and of limited duration (1-7 months). Individual and group-based interventions, delivered in-person or by telephone, were all effective. CONCLUSIONS Motivational interviewing is a flexible counselling technique that may improve rehabilitation care for multiple sclerosis. However, evidence for persisting benefits to health outcomes and behaviour is currently limited.","publish_time":"2019-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dorstyn, Diana S; Mathias, Jane L; Bombardier, Charles H; Osborn, Amanda J","journal":"Clinical rehabilitation","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0269215519895790; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31867992/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjsyMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CONCLUSIONS Motivational"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["motivational interviewing interventions","progressive multiple sclerosis","CONCLUSIONS Motivational interviewing","health outcomes","behavioural outcomes","Randomised controlled trials","rehabilitation care","Hedges\u0027 g","range","evidence","Cochrane Risk of Bias tool","rehabilitation techniques","usual care","data extraction","unclear risk of methodological bias","DATA SOURCES","reference lists of included studies","limited duration","flexible counselling technique","group-based interventions","Embase","relapsing","large improvements","pooled sample","REVIEW METHODS Study screening","PsycINFO","persisting benefits","conjunction","individuals","confidence intervals","PubMed databases","moderate impairment","adults","P values","Standardised mean differences","active intervention controls","Scopus citation searches","person","RESULTS","healthcare","Maintenance effects","telephone","months","OBJECTIVE","reviewers","Nstudies"],"language":"en"},

The current study was conducted to assess anxiety and fear of getting infected among dentists while working during the current novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) outbreak. In addition, dentists\u0027 knowledge about various practice modifications to combat COVID-19 has been evaluated. A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey from 10th to 17th March 2020. The well-constructed questionnaire was designed and registered at online website (Kwiksurveys) and validated. A total of 669 participants from 30 different countries across the world responded. After scrutiny, completed questionnaires (n = 650) were included in the study. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 25. Chi-Square and Spearman correlation tests were applied to control confounders and assess the relation of dentists\u0027 response with respect to gender and educational level. More than two-thirds of the general dental practitioners (78%) from 30 countries questioned were anxious and scared by the devastating effects of COVID-19. A large number of dentists (90%) were aware of recent changes in the treatment protocols. However, execution of amended treatment protocol was recorded as 61%. The majority of the dentists (76%) were working in the hospital setting out of which 74% were from private, and 20% were from government setups. Individually we received a large number of responses from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, but collectively more than 50% of the responses were from other parts of the world. Despite having a high standard of knowledge and practice, dental practitioners around the globe are in a state of anxiety and fear while working in their respective fields due to the COVID-19 pandemic impact on humanity.

METHODS Keratinocyte viability and in vitro wound closure were assessed in keratinocyte cultures. Effects of topical TASE (0.5 \u03BCg/mL of allicin in 97% ethanol) on acute cutaneous WH were determined in a murine model of acute cutaneous wound. Twelve mice were alternately assigned to the vehicle- and TASE-treated groups (n=6 per group). Expression levels of mRNA for keratinocyte differentiation marker-related proteins (filaggrin, loricrin and involucrin) and lipid synthetic enzymes (elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 4 (ELOVL4), fatty acid synthase (FA2H), 3-hydroxy- 3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCoA), and serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT)) were assessed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction on day 3 and 8 after wounding, while transepidermal water loss (TEWL) rates were measured in wounded areas. RESULTS TASE accelerated WH both in vivo (40% vs. 22% reduction in wound area, P\u003C0.01) and in vitro (90% vs. 65% reduction in wound area, P\u003C0.01). Moreover, topical applications of TASE upregulated the expression levels of epidermal mRNA for ELOVL4, HMGCoA, SPT, filaggrin, loricrin and involucrin (P\u003C0.05 vs. vehicle-treated controls) on day 3 after wounding. Likewise, TASE significantly lowered TEWL rates in comparison with vehicle alone on day 8 (33.06\u00B12.09 g/(m2\u00B7h) vs. 24.60\u00B12.04 g/(m2\u00B7h), P\u003C0.01). CONCLUSIONS Topical applications of TASE stimulated keratinocyte proliferation and formation of epidermal permeability barrier function, leading to acceleration of acute cutaneous WH.

METHODS Two hundred twenty infants (440 ears) were examined through AEP test once, and 47 (94 ears) of them went back for a second examination and were diagnosed with viral meningitis. The first AEP tests were compared with the second results in 47 infants. I latency, V latency, I-III interpeak latency (IPL), and III-V IPL were checked. RESULTS In the first AEP test conducted on 440 ears, the average values of I and V latency and I-III IPL were delayed as compared with normal values. The second AEP results were conducted on 47 infants 92.36 days after the first exam. I latency and V latency of second exam were improved significantly (p \u003C 0.05), but I-III and III-V IPL showed no significant changes. Two hearing impaired patients (4 ears) were confirmed through chart reviews. CONCLUSION The AEP test is a helpful study for early detection of hearing problem.

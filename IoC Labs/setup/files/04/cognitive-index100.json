Much information has been gathered on digestive enzymes, development of the digestive system, and metabolism. Investigations have clarified further the role of colostrum in immunity and nutrition of the young calf. Several sources of nutrients have been tested for their suitability in formulation of acceptable milk replacers and calf starters. Once-a-day feeding of milk, colostrum, or milk replacer and early weaning are practical management procedures. Labor and cost efficient methods of feeding and caring for young calves have developed. Extensive work on rearing rates and methods of rearing was published during these 25 yr. Successful schemes have evolved for feeding heifers to freshen at an optimal age and to occupy a respectful position in the milking line. Developments in housing have been phenomenal \u2013 from the calf hutch to environmentally controlled nurseries for calves. Heifer housing has ranged from relatively simple, but labor-efficient housing, to complete confinement systems. Herd health programs have developed to minimize many disease problems that can be particularly disastrous in large herds. Contract rearing of herd replacements has become a more frequently chosen option in this period. Budgets for rearing calves from birth to freshening have appeared in recommendations for raising heifers.","publish_time":"2010-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Otterby, D.E.; Linn, J.G.","journal":"J Dairy Sci","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131487/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjs4NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rearing calves","methods of rearing","young calf","rearing rates","calf hutch","knowledge of calf","calf starters","Heifer housing","young calves","labor-efficient housing","efficient methods of feeding","heifers","formulation of acceptable milk replacers","digestive enzymes","digestive system","role of colostrum","herd replacements","Herd health programs","early weaning","practical management procedures","suitability","immunity","nutrition","respectful position","complete confinement systems","Extensive work","controlled nurseries","birth","optimal age","milking line","Budgets","chosen option","disease problems","period","large herds","Strides","Successful schemes","Contract","recommendations","metabolism","information","Developments","day","sources of nutrients","Investigations"],"language":"en"},

Historically, these viruses have generated limited interest due to their inability to infect vertebrate cells. This viewpoint has changed in recent years because some ISFs have been shown to enhance or suppress the replication of medically important flaviviruses in co-infected mosquito cells. Additionally, comparative studies between ISFs and medically important flaviviruses can provide a unique perspective as to why some flaviviruses possess the ability to infect and cause devastating disease in humans while others do not. ISFs have been isolated exclusively from mosquitoes in nature but the detection of ISF-like sequences in sandflies and chironomids indicates that they may also infect other dipterans. ISFs can be divided into two distinct phylogenetic groups. The first group currently consists of approximately 12 viruses and includes cell fusing agent virus, Kamiti River virus and Culex flavivirus. These viruses are phylogenetically distinct from all other known flaviviruses. The second group, which is apparently not monophyletic, currently consists of nine viruses and includes Chaoyang virus, Nounan\u00E9 virus and Lammi virus. These viruses phylogenetically affiliate with mosquito/vertebrate flaviviruses despite their apparent insect-restricted phenotype. This article provides a review of the discovery, host range, mode of transmission, superinfection exclusion ability and genomic organization of ISFs. This article also attempts to clarify the ISF nomenclature because some of these viruses have been assigned more than one name due to their simultaneous discoveries by independent research groups.","publish_time":"2015-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blitvich, Bradley J.; Firth, Andrew E.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4271774baf0182630ce43862b9e0b151eda34e8c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4411683.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4411683/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQ5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ISF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["important flaviviruses","vertebrate flaviviruses","specific flaviviruses","known flaviviruses","agent virus","Nounan\u00E9 virus","Lammi virus","Chaoyang virus","genomic organization of ISFs","Kamiti River virus","vertebrate cells","article","distinct phylogenetic groups","number of insect","co-infected mosquito cells","detection of ISF","ISF nomenclature","superinfection exclusion ability","independent research groups","apparent insect-restricted phenotype","mode of transmission","host range","discovery","Culex flavivirus","sequences","simultaneous discoveries","review","unique perspective","comparative studies","sandflies","devastating disease","nature","dramatic increase","inability","recent years","mosquitoes","replication","humans","viewpoint","chironomids","decade","dipterans"],"language":"en"},

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the ability of CSFV to induce viral persistence upon early postnatal infection. Two litters of 10 piglets each were infected intranasally on the day of birth with low and moderate virulence CSFV isolates, respectively. During six weeks after postnatal infection, most of the piglets remained clinically healthy, despite persistent high virus titres in the serum. Importantly, these animals were unable to mount any detectable humoral and cellular immune response. At necropsy, the most prominent gross pathological lesion was a severe thymus atrophy. Four weeks after infection, PBMCs from the persistently infected seronegative piglets were unresponsive to both, specific CSFV and non-specific PHA stimulation in terms of IFN-\u03B3-producing cells. These results suggested the development of a state of immunosuppression in these postnatally persistently infected pigs. However, IL-10 was undetectable in the sera of the persistently infected animals. Interestingly, CSFV-stimulated PBMCs from the persistently infected piglets produced IL-10. Nevertheless, despite the addition of the anti-IL-10 antibody in the PBMC culture from persistently infected piglets, the response of the IFN-\u03B3 producing cells was not restored. Therefore, other factors than IL-10 may be involved in the general suppression of the T-cell responses upon CSFV and mitogen activation. Interestingly, bone marrow immature granulocytes were increased and targeted by the virus in persistently infected piglets. Taken together, we provided the first data demonstrating the feasibility of CSFV in generating a postnatal persistent disease, which has not been shown for other members of the Pestivirus genus yet. Since serological methods are routinely used in CSFV surveillance, persistently infected pigs might go unnoticed. In addition to the epidemiological and economic significance of persistent CSFV infection, this model could be useful for understanding the mechanisms of viral persistence.","publish_time":"2015-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mu\u00F1oz-Gonz\u00E1lez, Sara; Ruggli, Nicolas; Rosell, Rosa; P\u00E9rez, Lester Josu\u00E9; Fr\u00EDas-Leuporeau, Maria Teresa; Fraile, Lorenzo; Montoya, Maria; Cordoba, Lorena; Domingo, Mariano; Ehrensperger, Felix; Summerfield, Artur; Ganges, Llilianne","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/87620b2fa94ff9b59a3a84382dceae62f83259a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4418595.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4418595/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzUwMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CSFV","PHA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected piglets","infected pigs","infected animals","infected seronegative piglets","specific CSFV","ability of CSFV","CSFV surveillance","feasibility of CSFV","infected offspring","CSFV-stimulated PBMCs","economic significance of persistent CSFV infection","moderate virulence CSFV isolates","early postnatal infection","anti-IL","postnatal persistent disease","persistent high virus titres","IFN-\u03B3","addition","cells","weeks","mechanisms of viral persistence","terms of IFN","cellular immune response","trans-placental transmission of classical swine fever virus","non-specific PHA stimulation","prominent gross pathological lesion","T-cell responses","severe thymus atrophy","mid-gestation","PBMC culture","day of birth","antibody","mitogen activation","serum","model","general suppression","state of immunosuppression","bone marrow immature granulocytes","development","present study","necropsy","sera","serological methods","members","Pestivirus genus","results","aim","data","factors","litters"],"language":"en"},

The manner in which they regulate the replication of their genome is not well-understood. This is partly due to the absence of a highly sensitive assay to measure individual species of arenavirus replicative RNAs. To overcome this obstacle, we designed a quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay for selective quantitation of each of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) genomic or antigenomic RNAs. During the course of assay design, we identified a nonspecific priming phenomenon whereby, in the absence of an RT primer, cDNAs complementary to each of the LCMV replicative RNA species are generated during RT. We successfully circumvented this nonspecific priming event through the use of biotinylated primers in the RT reaction, which permitted affinity purification of primer-specific cDNAs using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. As proof of principle, we used the assay to map the dynamics of LCMV replication at acute and persistent time points and to determine the quantities of genomic and antigenomic RNAs that are incorporated into LCMV particles. This assay can be adapted to measure total S or L segment-derived viral RNAs and therefore represents a highly sensitive diagnostic platform to screen for LCMV infection in rodent and human tissue samples and can also be used to quantify virus-cell attachment.","publish_time":"2015-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haist, Kelsey; Ziegler, Christopher; Botten, Jason","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a7e072c8c70ce3f42148a4a4bbbc8800b2a03f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4433285.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4433285/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzUyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RT","LCMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sensitive assay","LCMV infection","LCMV particles","antigenomic RNAs","PCR assay","LCMV replicative RNA species","dynamics of LCMV replication","RT primer","course of assay design","RT reaction","individual species of arenavirus replicative RNAs","absence","segment-derived viral RNAs","nonspecific priming event","nonspecific priming phenomenon","specific cDNAs","cDNAs complementary","quantities of genomic","affinity purification of primer","significant human disease","human tissue samples","lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus","sensitive diagnostic platform","virus-cell attachment","single-stranded RNA viruses","use of biotinylated primers","persistent time points","streptavidin","selective quantitation","rodent","quantitative reverse transcription","total S","magnetic beads","genome","Arenaviruses","obstacle","proof of principle","manner"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we selected a panel of twelve peptides using the software DNASTAR 7.1 and screened high affinity and immunogenicity epitopes in vitro and in vivo assays. Furthermore, we optimized four B cell epitopes to design a novel DKK1 multiepitope DNA vaccine and evaluated its bone protective effects in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a mouse model of RA. High level expression of the designed vaccine was measured in supernatant of COS7 cells. In addition, intramuscular immunization of BALB/c mice with this vaccine was also highly expressed and sufficient to induce the production of long-term IgG, which neutralized natural DKK1 in vivo. Importantly, this vaccine significantly attenuated bone erosion in CIA mice compared with positive control mice.

In this paper we demonstrate that the RNA interference technique can be used to efficiently down-regulate IL-8 protein expression in airway epithelial cells. We used a helper-dependent adenoviral vector to express a small hairpin (sh)RNA targeting human IL-8 in cultured airway epithelial cells (IB3-1, Cftr(\u2212/\u2212); C38, Cftr-corrected) stimulated with TNF-\u03B1, IL-1\u03B2 or heat-inactivated Burkholderia cenocepacia.

A total of 27 novel CRESS-DNA genomes, with Reps that share less than 60.1% identity with previously reported viruses, were recovered from 21 invertebrate species, mainly crustaceans. Phylogenetic analysis based on the Rep revealed a novel clade of CRESS-DNA viruses that included approximately one third of the marine invertebrate associated viruses identified here and whose members may represent a novel family. Investigation of putative capsid proteins (Cap) encoded within the eukaryotic CRESS-DNA viral genomes from this study and those in GenBank demonstrated conserved patterns of predicted intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which can be used to complement similarity-based searches to identify divergent structural proteins within novel genomes.

RESULTS: Heliox limited the increase in driving pressures needed to achieve preset tidal volumes, with a concomitant decrease in loss of compliance. Heliox did neither allow for reduced minute volume ventilation in this model nor improve gas exchange. Also, heliox did not reduce lung injury. CONCLUSIONS: Heliox modestly improved respiratory mechanics but did not improve lung injury in this rat model of acute respiratory distress syndrome.","publish_time":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beurskens, Charlotte J; Aslami, Hamid; de Beer, Friso M; Roelofs, Joris JTH; Vroom, Margreeth B; Juffermans, Nicole P","journal":"Intensive Care Med Exp","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3a75a57d895e69896c77e7a887e26211501c816.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4513042.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4513042/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzU4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["heliox ventilation","acute lung injury","markers of lung injury","oxygen","embedded lung sections","reduced minute volume ventilation","animal model","adequate gas exchange","air","rat model of acute respiratory distress syndrome","preset tidal volumes","gas mixture of helium","inspiratory pressures","driving pressures","improved respiratory mechanics","lower density","reduction","concomitant decrease","higher diffusion capacity","increase","CONCLUSIONS","Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","METHODS","intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide","loss of compliance","ARDSnet recommendations","BACKGROUND","adult rats","RESULTS","pneumotachometer"],"language":"en"},

Influenza A viruses are unique in many ways. Firstly, they are unique in the diversity of host species that they infect.

Secondly, they are unique in their capacity to evolve and adapt, following crossing the species barrier, in order to replicate and spread to other individuals within the new species. Finally, they are unique in the frequency of inter-species transmission events that occur. Indeed, the consequences of novel influenza virus strain in an immunologically na\u00EFve population can be devastating. The problems that influenza A viruses present for human and animal health are numerous. For example, influenza A viruses in humans represent a major economic and disease burden, whilst the poultry industry has suffered colossal damage due to repeated outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses.

This meta-analysis evaluated the ability of PPIs to promote weight gain and food intake in weanling animals, primarily piglets, after oral challenge with various enteric pathogens or bacterial toxins. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed were searched from 1980 through August 2012 for specified terms and keywords.

However, the extent to which critically ill children identified by consensus criteria reflect physician diagnosis of severe sepsis, which underlies external validity for pediatric sepsis research, is not known. We sought to determine the agreement between physician diagnosis and consensus criteria to identify pediatric patients with severe sepsis across a network of international pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). METHODS: We conducted a point prevalence study involving 128 PICUs in 26 countries across 6 continents. Over the course of 5 study days, 6925 PICU patients \u003C18 years of age were screened, and 706 with severe sepsis defined either by physician diagnosis or on the basis of 2005 International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference consensus criteria were enrolled. The primary endpoint was agreement of pediatric severe sepsis between physician diagnosis and consensus criteria as measured using Cohen\u2019s \u03BA. Secondary endpoints included characteristics and clinical outcomes for patients identified using physician diagnosis versus consensus criteria. RESULTS: Of the 706 patients, 301 (42.6 %) met both definitions. The inter-rater agreement (\u03BA \u00B1 SE) between physician diagnosis and consensus criteria was 0.57 \u00B1 0.02. Of the 438 patients with a physician\u2019s diagnosis of severe sepsis, only 69 % (301 of 438) would have been eligible to participate in a clinical trial of pediatric severe sepsis that enrolled patients based on consensus criteria. Patients with physician-diagnosed severe sepsis who did not meet consensus criteria were younger and had lower severity of illness and lower PICU mortality than those meeting consensus criteria or both definitions. After controlling for age, severity of illness, number of comorbid conditions, and treatment in developed versus resource-limited regions, patients identified with severe sepsis by physician diagnosis alone or by consensus criteria alone did not have PICU mortality significantly different from that of patients identified by both physician diagnosis and consensus criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Physician diagnosis of pediatric severe sepsis achieved only moderate agreement with consensus criteria, with physicians diagnosing severe sepsis more broadly. Consequently, the results of a research study based on consensus criteria may have limited generalizability to nearly one-third of PICU patients diagnosed with severe sepsis.

Methods: We conducted a semi-systematic review of articles published between January 2012 and September 2014 where information and communications technologies (ICT) was a primary subject of the study or a main component of the study methodology. Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to filter PHI and GHI articles from the larger biomedical informatics domain. Articles were identified using MEDLINE as well as personal bibliographies from members of the American Medical Informatics Association PHI and GHI working groups. Results: A total of 85 PHI articles and 282 GHI articles were identified. While systems in PHI continue to support surveillance activities, we identified a shift towards support for prevention, environmental health, and public health care services. Furthermore, articles from the U.S. reveal a shift towards PHI applications at state and local levels. GHI articles focused on telemedicine, mHealth and eHealth applications. The development of adequate infrastructure to support ICT remains a challenge, although we identified a small but growing set of articles that measure the impact of ICT on clinical outcomes. Discussion: There is evidence of growth with respect to both implementation of information systems within the public health enterprise as well as a widening of scope within each informatics discipline. Yet the articles also illuminate the need for more primary research studies on what works and what does not as both searches yielded small numbers of primary, empirical articles. Conclusion: While the body of knowledge around PHI and GHI continues to mature, additional studies of higher quality are needed to generate the robust evidence base needed to support continued investment in ICT by governmental health agencies.","publish_time":"2015-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dixon, Brian E.; Pina, Jamie; Kharrazi, Hadi; Gharghabi, Fardad; Richards, Janise","journal":"Online J Public Health Inform","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/41148756482815041a85c11c6b01cb832bf1de9b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4576440.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4576440/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzY0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PHI","GHI","American Medical Informatics Association PHI","ICT"],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["PHI articles","GHI articles","empirical articles","public health informatics","PHI applications","global health informatics","growing set of articles","support","environmental health","public health enterprise","semi-systematic review of articles","American Medical Informatics Association PHI","informatics discipline","public health care services","governmental health agencies","impact of ICT","larger biomedical informatics domain","shift","small numbers of primary","primary subject","primary research studies","implementation of information systems","evidence of growth","eHealth applications","additional studies of higher quality","study methodology","Additional inclusion","robust evidence base","continued investment","members","respect","state","telemedicine","mHealth","prevention","personal bibliographies","main component","widening of scope","exclusion criteria","local levels","body of knowledge","need","literature","groups","communications technologies","surveillance activities","development of adequate infrastructure","clinical outcomes","searches","MEDLINE","challenge","total","Methods","Conclusion","Discussion","Results","Objective"],"language":"en"},

Thus, it is urgent for governments to draw up emergency plans against Ebola. However, it is hard to predict the possible epidemic situations in practice. Luckily, in recent years, computational experiments based on artificial society appeared, providing a new approach to study the propagation of EVD and analyze the corresponding interventions. Therefore, the rationality of artificial society is the key to the accuracy and reliability of experiment results. Individuals\u0027 behaviors along with travel mode directly affect the propagation among individuals. Firstly, artificial Beijing is reconstructed based on geodemographics and machine learning is involved to optimize individuals\u0027 behaviors. Meanwhile, Ebola course model and propagation model are built, according to the parameters in West Africa. Subsequently, propagation mechanism of EVD is analyzed, epidemic scenario is predicted, and corresponding interventions are presented. Finally, by simulating the emergency responses of Chinese government, the conclusion is finally drawn that Ebola is impossible to outbreak in large scale in the city of Beijing.","publish_time":"2015-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Peng; Chen, Bin; Ma, Liang; Li, Zhen; Song, Zhichao; Duan, Wei; Qiu, Xiaogang","journal":"Comput Intell Neurosci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b973a418c19776904cffc71357c7119485bf2b3a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4592709.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4592709/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzY2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EVD"],"locations":["West Africa","Beijing"],"keyphrases":["propagation of EVD","propagation model","propagation mechanism of EVD","artificial Beijing","Ebola course model","rationality of artificial society","Ebola virus disease","Individuals\u0027 behaviors","corresponding interventions","epidemic scenario","emergency plans","city of Beijing","possible epidemic situations","emergency responses of Chinese government","accuracy","feature","key","computational experiments","large scale","travel mode","conclusion","geodemographics","new approach","high infectivity","recent years","machine learning","reliability of experiment results","mortality","governments","practice","parameters","West Africa"],"language":"en"},

Infants, pregnant women, and breastfeeding mothers are highly susceptible to severe respiratory disease following influenza virus infection but the mechanisms of disease severity in the mother-infant dyad are poorly understood. Here we investigated 2009 H1N1 influenza virus infection and transmission in breastfeeding mothers and infants utilizing our developed infant-mother ferret influenza model. Infants acquired severe disease and mortality following infection. Transmission of the virus from infants to mother ferrets led to infection in the lungs and mother mortality. Live virus was also found in mammary gland tissue and expressed milk of the mothers which eventually led to milk cessation. Histopathology showed destruction of acini glandular architecture with the absence of milk. The virus was localized in mammary epithelial cells of positive glands. To understand the molecular mechanisms of mammary gland infection, we performed global transcript analysis which showed downregulation of milk production genes such as Prolactin and increased breast involution pathways indicated by a STAT5 to STAT3 signaling shift. Genes associated with cancer development were also significantly increased including JUN, FOS and M2 macrophage markers. Immune responses within the mammary gland were characterized by decreased lymphocyte-associated genes CD3e, IL2Ra, CD4 with IL1\u03B2 upregulation. Direct inoculation of H1N1 into the mammary gland led to infant respiratory infection and infant mortality suggesting the influenza virus was able to replicate in mammary tissue and transmission is possible through breastfeeding. In vitro infection studies with human breast cells showed susceptibility to H1N1 virus infection. Together, we have shown that the host-pathogen interactions of influenza virus infection in the mother-infant dyad initiate immunological and oncogenic signaling cascades within the mammary gland. These findings suggest the mammary gland may have a greater role in infection and immunity than previously thought.","publish_time":"2015-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paquette, St\u00E9phane G.; Banner, David; Huang, Stephen S.

Different immune-based assays have been reported for the detection and quantification of Ebola virus (EBOV) proteins. In particular, several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been described that bind the capsid glycoprotein (GP) of EBOV GP. However, the currently available platforms for the design and production of full-length mAbs are cumbersome and costly. The use of antibody fragments, rather than full-length antibodies, might represent a cost-effective alternative for the development of diagnostic and possibly even therapeutic alternatives for EBOV. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We report the design and expression of three recombinant anti-GP mAb fragments in Escherichia coli cultures. These fragments contained the heavy and light variable portions of the three well-studied anti-GP full-length mAbs 13C6, 13F6, and KZ52, and are consequently named scFv-13C6, scFv-13F6, and Fab-KZ52, respectively. All three fragments exhibited specific anti-GP binding activity in ELISA experiments comparable to that of full-length anti-GP antibodies (i.e., the same order of magnitude) and they are easily and economically produced in bacterial cultures.

In this study, we aimed to develop a duplex ultrasensitive nanoparticle DNA probe-based PCR assay (duplex UNDP-PCR) that was able to simultaneously detect DNA and RNA viruses in the same reaction system. PCV2 and TGEV are selected as representatives of the two different types of viruses. PCV2 DNA and TGEV RNA were simultaneously released from the serum sample by boiling with lysis buffer, then magnetic beads and gold nanoparticles coated with single and/or duplex specific probes for TGEV and PCV2 were added to form a sandwich-like complex with nucleic acids released from viruses. After magnetic separation, DNA barcodes specific for PCV2 and TGEV were eluted using DTT and characterized by specific PCR assay for specific DNA barcodes subsequently. The duplex UNDP-PCR showed similar sensitivity as that of single UNDP-PCR and was able to detect 20 copies each of PCV2 and TGEV in the serum, showing approximately 250-fold more sensitivity than conventional duplex PCR/RT-PCR assays. No cross-reaction was observed with other viruses. The positive detection rate of single MMPs- and duplex MMPs-based duplex UNDP-PCR was identical, with 29.6% for PCV2, 9.3% for TGEV and 3.7% for PCV2 and TGEV mixed infection. This duplex UNDP-PCR assay could detect TGEV (RNA virus) and PCV2 (DNA virus) from large-scale serum samples simultaneously without the need for DNA/RNA extraction, purification and reverse transcription of RNA, and showed a significantly increased positive detection rate for PCV2 (29%) and TGEV (11.7%) preclinical infection than conventional duplex PCR/RT-PCR. Therefore, the established duplex UNDP-PCR is a rapid and economical detection method, exhibiting high sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility.","publish_time":"2015-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Yong; Xing, Na; Wang, Zengguo; Zhang, Xiujuan; Zhao, Xiaomin; Du, Qian; Chang, Lingling; Tong, Dewen","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/696ae2cd59982a2cb456ed723adb98586ebdf7f7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4636378.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4636378/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzcxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV","DTT","PCR/RT-PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCV2 DNA","conventional duplex PCR","duplex UNDP-PCR assay","TGEV RNA","established duplex UNDP-PCR","single UNDP-PCR","specific PCR assay","duplex MMPs","RNA viruses","DNA virus","RT-PCR assays","duplex ultrasensitive nanoparticle DNA probe-based PCR assay","DNA barcodes specific","specific DNA barcodes","TGEV mixed infection","RNA extraction","Mixed infection of multiple viruses","reverse transcription of RNA","different types of viruses","specific probes","preclinical infection","positive detection rate of single MMPs","high sensitivity","similar sensitivity","reaction system","economical detection method","large-scale serum samples","magnetic beads","magnetic separation","preclinical level","need","purification","lysis buffer","modern intensive pig rearing","DTT","gold nanoparticles","specificity","complex","nucleic acids","sandwich","representatives","methods available","reproducibility","copies","cross-reaction","study"],"language":"en"},

This systematic review sought to identify studies defining and describing ward closure in outbreak control and to determine impact of ward closure as an intervention on outbreak containment. METHODS: We searched these databases with no language restrictions: MEDLINE, 1946 to 7 July 2014; EMBASE, 1974 to 7 July 2014; CINAHL, 1937 to 8 July 2014; and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 2005 to May 2014. We also searched the following: IndMED; LILACS; reference lists from retrieved articles; conference proceedings; and websites of the CDCP, the ICID, and the WHO. We included studies of patients hospitalized in acute care facilities; used ward closure as a control measure; used other control measures; and discussed control of the outbreak(s) under investigation. A component approach was used to assess study quality. RESULTS: We included 97 English and non-English observational studies. None included a controlled comparison between ward closure and other interventions. We found that ward closure was often used as part of a bundle of interventions but could not determine its direct impact separate from all the other interventions whether used in parallel or in sequence with other interventions. We also found no universal definition of ward closure which was widely accepted. CONCLUSIONS: With no published controlled studies identified, ward closure for control of outbreaks remains an intervention that is not evidence based and healthcare personnel will need to continue to balance the competing risks associated with its use, taking into consideration the nature of the outbreak, the type of pathogen and its virulence, mode of transmission, and the setting in which it occurs.

A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) can cause shedding of ACE2 from the cell membrane. The aim of our studies was to determine whether ADAM17 depletes ACE2 levels in pancreatic islets and \u03B2-cells. Dynamics of ADAM17-mediated ACE2 shedding were investigated in 832/13 insulinoma cells. Within a wide range of ACE2 expression levels, including the level observed in mouse pancreatic islets, overexpression of ADAM17 increases shed ACE2 and decreases cellular ACE2 levels. We provide a mathematical description of shed and cellular ACE2 activities as a function of the ADAM17 activity. The effect of ADAM17 on the cellular ACE2 content was relatively modest with an absolute control strength value less than 0.25 and approaching 0 at low ADAM17 activities. Although we found that ADAM17 and ACE2 are both expressed in pancreatic islets, the \u03B2-cell is not the major cell type expressing ACE2 in islets. During diabetes progression in 8-, 12-, and 15-week-old db/db mice, ACE2 mRNA and ACE2 activity levels in pancreatic islets were not decreased over time nor significantly decreased compared with nondiabetic db/m mice. Levels of ADAM17 mRNA and ADAM17 activity were also not significantly changed. Inhibiting basal ADAM17 activity in mouse islets failed to affect ACE2 levels. We conclude that whereas ADAM17 has the ability to shed ACE2, ADAM17 does not deplete ACE2 from pancreatic islets in diabetic db/db mice.","publish_time":"2015-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pedersen, Kim Brint; Chodavarapu, Harshita; Porretta, Constance; Robinson, Leonie K.; Lazartigues, Eric","journal":"Endocrinology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37b7e6763e75ccd26ac1153104a4fcac2ae93805.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4655210.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/endo/article-pdf/156/12/4411/8985997/endo4411.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzczOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["shed ACE2","ACE2 mRNA","shedding of ACE2","ACE2 activity levels","cellular ACE2 levels","cellular ACE2 activities","cellular ACE2 content","Levels of ADAM17 mRNA","overexpression of ADAM17","Dynamics of ADAM17","effect of ADAM17","mediated ACE2 shedding","counteracting pancreatic ACE2 depletion","db mice","basal ADAM17 activity","mouse pancreatic islets","low ADAM17 activities","wide range of ACE2 expression levels","mouse islets","week-old db","nondiabetic db","infused mice","diabetic mouse models","cell membrane","\u03B2-cells","Angiotensin","major cell type","mathematical description of shed","insulinoma cells","glucose regulation","gene therapy","function","absolute control strength value","enzyme","time","ability","studies","disintegrin","metalloproteinase","diabetes progression","aim"],"language":"en"},

The microbiome of the young chick is easily prone to alteration in its composition by both exogenous and endogenous factors, especially during the early posthatch period. The genetic background of the host and exposure to pathogens can impact the diversity of the microbial profile that consequently contributes to the disease progression in the host. The objective of this study was to profile the composition and structure of the gut microbiota in young chickens from two genetically distinct highly inbred lines. Furthermore, the effect of the Salmonella Enteritidis infection on altering the composition makeup of the chicken microbiome was evaluated through the 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. One-day-old layer chicks were challenged with S. Enteritidis and the host cecal microbiota profile as well as the degree of susceptibility to Salmonella infection was examined at 2 and 7 days post infection. Our result indicated that host genotype had a limited effect on resistance to S. Enteritidis infection. Alpha diversity, beta diversity, and overall microbiota composition were analyzed for four factors: host genotype, age, treatment, and postinfection time points. S. Enteritidis infection in young chicks was found to significantly reduce the overall diversity of the microbiota population with expansion of Enterobacteriaceae family. These changes indicated that Salmonella colonization in the GI tract of the chickens has a direct effect on altering the natural development of the GI microbiota. The impact of S. Enteritidis infection on microbial communities was also more substantial in the late stage of infection. Significant inverse correlation between Enterobacteriaceae and Lachnospiraceae family in both non-infected and infected groups, suggested possible antagonistic interaction between members of these two taxa, which could potentially influences the overall microbial population in the gut. Our results also revealed that genetic difference between two lines had minimal effect on the establishment of microbiota population. Overall, this study provided preliminary insights into the contributing role of S. Enteritidis in influencing the overall makeup of chicken\u2019s gut microbiota.","publish_time":"2015-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mon, Khin K.

Aside from spatial-temporal characteristics, the most adaptive meteorological conditions for the occurrence of human infections by these two viral subtypes were different.

To investigate this, the present study collected lymph node and blood specimens from 52 HIV-infected patients to measure the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS by immunohistochemistry and fluoresence-based flow cytometry. Compared with control subjects without HIV infection, the patients with HIV had significantly higher expression levels of Arg I in the lymph nodes and higher frequencies of Arg I(\u002B) CD4(\u002B) T cells and CD8(\u002B) T cells in the blood and lymph nodes, and these results were contrary the those of iNOS in the corresponding compartments.

Here, we report the genomic reconstruction of GalN/GalNAc utilization pathway in Streptococci and the diversified aga regulons. We delineated two new paralogous AgaR regulators for the GalN/GalNAc catabolism pathway. The electrophoretic mobility shift assays experiment demonstrated that AgaR2 (AgaR1) binds the predicted palindromes, and the combined in vivo data from reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and RNA\u2010seq suggested that AgaR2 (not AgaR1) can effectively repress the transcription of the target genes.

The L(o) phase of cellular membranes can be isolated from disordered lipids (L(d) phase) after treatment with 1 % Triton X-100 at 4 \u00B0C in which the L(o) phase forms the detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) fraction. The lipid composition of DRM derived from Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, McArdle cells and porcine sperm is compared with that of the whole cell. Remarkably, the unsaturation and chain length degree of aliphatic chains attached to phospholipids is virtually the same between DRM and whole cells. Cholesterol and sphingomyelin were enriched in DRMs but to a cell-specific molar ratio. Sulfatides (sphingolipids from MDCK cells) were enriched in the DRM while a seminolipid (an alkylacylglycerolipid from sperm) was depleted from the DRM. Treatment with \u003C5 mM methyl-\u00DF-cyclodextrin (MBCD) caused cholesterol removal from the DRM without affecting the composition and amount of the phospholipid while higher levels disrupted the DRM. The substantial amount of (poly)unsaturated phospholipids in DRMs as well as a low stoichiometric amount of cholesterol suggest that lipid rafts in biological membranes are more fluid and dynamic than previously anticipated. Using negative staining, ultrastructural features of DRM were monitored and in all three cell types the DRMs appeared as multi-lamellar vesicular structures with a similar morphology. The detergent resistance is a result of protein\u2013cholesterol and sphingolipid interactions allowing a relatively passive attraction of phospholipids to maintain the L(o) phase.

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that abdominal muscle activity during mechanically ventilation increases lung injury in severe ARDS. METHODS: Eighteen male Beagles were studied under mechanical ventilation with anesthesia. Severe ARDS was induced by repetitive oleic acid infusion. After lung injury, Beagles were randomly assigned into spontaneous breathing group (BIPAP(SB)) and abdominal muscle paralysis group (BIPAP(AP)). All groups were ventilated with BIPAP model for 8h, and the high pressure titrated to reached a tidal volume of 6ml/kg, the low pressure was set at 10 cmH(2)O, with I:E ratio 1:1, and respiratory rate adjusted to a PaCO(2) of 35\u201360 mmHg. Six Beagles without ventilator support comprised the control group. Respiratory variables, end-expiratory volume (EELV) and gas exchange were assessed during mechanical ventilation. The levels of Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 in lung tissue and plasma were measured by qRT-PCR and ELISA respectively. Lung injury scores were determined at end of the experiment. RESULTS: For the comparable ventilator setting, as compared with BIPAP(SB) group, the BIPAP(AP) group presented higher EELV (427\u00B147 vs. 366\u00B138 ml) and oxygenation index (293\u00B136 vs. 226\u00B131 mmHg), lower levels of IL-6(216.6\u00B148.0 vs. 297.5\u00B171.2 pg/ml) and IL-8(246.8\u00B178.2 vs. 357.5\u00B169.3 pg/ml) in plasma, and lower express levels of IL-6 mRNA (15.0\u00B13.8 vs. 21.2\u00B13.7) and IL-8 mRNA (18.9\u00B16.8 vs. 29.5\u00B17.9) in lung tissues.

The clinical picture comprises variable manifestations which involve mainly but not exclusively the musculoskeletal system, and evolve over the person\u2019s lifetime. CASE PRESENTATION: Describing the case of a 20-year-old female with generalized arthro-myalgias, persistent fatigue and troublesome visceral pain, we illustrate how a frequently ignored clinical sign such as joint hypermobility can be the keystone to clarify different simultaneous symptoms. All of the patient\u2019s physical complaints had been investigated separately during her previous medical examinations, and several tests repeatedly gave negative results. The patient received different diagnoses that describe only part of her problems, such as irritable bowel syndrome for visceral pain, fibromyalgia for arthralgias or depression for fatigue. These approaches gave rise to pharmacological or physical treatments which did not improve her quality of life in any way and in some instances worsened the situation. Pronounced joint hypermobility which led the patient to flex her joints excessively, causing subluxations in several districts, was the only sign overlooked. CONCLUSION: Exploring the patient\u2019s articular features in her clinical context led us to diagnose joint hypermobility syndrome, a complex and often ignored condition. The case highlights the utility of a multidisciplinary approach and coordinated interventions to define and manage this clinical entity.","publish_time":"2016-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Folci, Marco; Capsoni, Franco","journal":"BMC Musculoskelet Disord","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dfd609de85f5c2574a264f4387557a727cadd1b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4743317.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4743317/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzgxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Joint hypermobility syndrome","generalized joint hypermobility substrate","clinical sign","musculoskeletal pain","clinical context","clinical picture","clinical entity","troublesome visceral pain","CASE PRESENTATION","irritable bowel syndrome","patient\u2019s physical complaints","persistent fatigue","physical treatments","musculoskeletal system","different diagnoses","generalized arthro-myalgias","patient\u2019s articular features","different simultaneous symptoms","fibromyalgia","tests","year-old female","arthralgias","keystone","disorder","multidisciplinary approach","coordinated interventions","rise","utility","depression","way","previous medical examinations","approaches","CONCLUSION","problems","variable manifestations","BACKGROUND","quality of life","instances","subluxations","negative results","districts","joints","person\u2019s lifetime","situation","condition"],"language":"en"},

We show that neither the PPXY late domain encoded within the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) matrix protein nor a functional endosomal sorting complex transport (ESCRT) pathway is absolutely required for the generation of standard infectious virus particles. In contrast, DI particle release critically requires the PPXY late domain and is ESCRT-dependent.

In this study, Norovirus P particle containing SwIV M2e (extracellular domain of the matrix protein 2) chimera and highly conserved two each of H1N1 peptides of pandemic 2009 and classical human influenza viruses were entrapped in PLGA-NPs. Influenza antibody-free pigs were vaccinated with PLGA-NPs peptides cocktail vaccine twice with or without an adjuvant, Mycobacterium vaccae whole cell lysate, intranasally as mist. Vaccinated pigs were challenged with a virulent heterologous zoonotic SwIV H1N1, and one week later euthanized and the lung samples were analyzed for the specific immune response and viral load. Clinically, pigs vaccinated with PLGA-NP peptides vaccine had no fever and flu symptoms, and the replicating challenged SwIV was undetectable in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Immunologically, PLGA-NP peptides vaccination (without adjuvant) significantly increased the frequency of antigen-specific IFN\u03B3 secreting CD4 and CD8 T cells response in the lung lymphocytes, despite not boosting the antibody response both at pre- and post-challenge.

The IAV RdRp is an important antiviral target, but its structural mechanism has remained largely elusive to date. By applying a polyprotein strategy, we produced RdRp complexes and define a minimal human IAV RdRp core complex.

Ethical issues related to prevention and containment include the appropriateness and scope of quarantine and isolation within and outside affected countries. The possibility of infection in health care workers impelled consideration of whether there is an obligation to provide health services where personal protection equipment is inadequate, alongside the issue of whether the health care workforce should have special access to experimental treatment and care interventions under development. In clinical care, ethical issues include the standards of care owed to people who comply with quarantine and isolation restrictions. Ethical issues in research include appropriate study design related to experimental vaccines and treatment interventions, and the sharing of data and biospecimens between research groups. The compassionate use of experimental drugs intersects both with research ethics and clinical care. The role of developed countries also came under scrutiny, and we concluded that developed countries have an obligation to contribute to the containment of EVD infection by contributing to the strengthening of local health care systems and infrastructure in an effort to provide fair benefits to communities engaged in research, ensuring that affected countries have ready and affordable access to any therapeutic or preventative interventions developed, and supporting affected countries on their way to recovery from the impact of EVD on their social and economic lives.","publish_time":"2016-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Folayan, Morenike O; Haire, Bridget G; Brown, Brandon","journal":"Risk Manag Healthc Policy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03d3f764353cecb297c318e55b88be1d5664bf5c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4869630.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4869630/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzkzMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["West Africa"],"keyphrases":["care interventions","clinical care","health care workforce","health care workers","standards of care","affected countries","Ethical issues","strengthening of local health care systems","health services","research design","health crisis","role of developed countries","research ethics","containment of EVD infection","research groups","experimental treatment","treatment interventions","impact of EVD","experimental vaccines","preventative interventions","disease outbreak","prevention","number of important ethical debates","obligation","special access","affordable access","compassionate use of experimental drugs","possibility of infection","scope of quarantine","isolation restrictions","appropriate study design","Ebola virus disease","effort","fore","infrastructure","personal protection equipment","overarching moral problem of severe transnational disadvantage","ability of citizens","appropriateness","recovery","consideration","management","fair benefits","West Africa","specific impacts","communities","sharing of data","way","people","development","devastation","economic lives","scrutiny"],"language":"en"},

However, relatively little is known about whether resveratrol modulates the ion channels in cortical neurons. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (BK(Ca)) and voltage-gated sodium channels were expressed in cortical neurons and play important roles in regulation of neuronal excitability. The present study aimed to determine the effects of resveratrol on BK(Ca) currents and voltage-gated sodium currents in cortical neurons. RESULTS: Resveratrol concentration-dependently increased the current amplitude and the opening activity of BK(Ca) channels, but suppressed the amplitude of voltage-gated sodium currents. Similar to the BK(Ca) channel opener NS1619, resveratrol decreased the firing rate of action potentials. In addition, the enhancing effects of BK(Ca) channel blockers tetraethylammonium (TEA) and paxilline on action potential firing were sensitive to resveratrol. Our results indicated that the attenuation of action potential firing rate by resveratrol might be mediated through opening the BK(Ca) channels and closing the voltage-gated sodium channels. CONCLUSIONS: As BK(Ca) channels and sodium channels are critical molecular determinants for seizure generation, our findings suggest that regulation of these two channels in cortical neurons probably makes a considerable contribution to the antiseizure activity of resveratrol.","publish_time":"2016-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Ya-Jean; Chan, Ming-Huan; Chen, Linyi; Wu, Sheng-Nan; Chen, Hwei-Hisen","journal":"J Biomed Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c8655ffbfd16f13266b635a0a9f907579f0969d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4875746.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4875746/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozk0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["voltage-gated sodium channels","ion channels","effects of resveratrol","Resveratrol concentration","voltage-gated sodium currents","cortical neurons","opening activity of BK","antiseizure activity of resveratrol","enhancing effects of BK","amplitude of voltage","large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels","firing rate of action potentials","attenuation of action potential firing rate","RESULTS","current amplitude","channel opener NS1619","channel blockers tetraethylammonium","regulation of neuronal excitability","paxilline","TEA","critical molecular determinants","red wine","seizure generation","important roles","considerable contribution","phytoalexin","grapes","diverse pharmacological activities","findings","addition","present study","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

It is commonly believed that adaptive immunity drives clearance of viral infections and, thus, dysfunction or viral evasion of adaptive immunity is required for a virus to persist. Type I interferons (IFNs) play pleiotropic roles in the antiviral response, including through innate control of viral replication. Murine norovirus (MNoV) replicates in dendritic cells (DCs) and type I IFN signaling in DCs is important for early control of MNoV replication. We show here that the non-persistent MNoV strain CW3 persists systemically when CD11c positive DCs are unable to respond to type I IFN. Persistence in this setting is associated with increased early viral titers, maintenance of DC numbers, increased expression of DC activation markers and an increase in CD8 T cell and antibody responses. Furthermore, CD8 T cell function is maintained during the persistent phase of infection and adaptive immune cells from persistently infected mice are functional when transferred to Rag1 (-/-) recipients. Finally, increased early replication and persistence are also observed in mixed bone marrow chimeras where only half of the CD11c positive DCs are unable to respond to type I IFN. These findings demonstrate that increased early viral replication due to a cell-intrinsic innate immune deficiency is sufficient for persistence and a functional adaptive immune response is not sufficient for viral clearance.","publish_time":"2016-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nice, Timothy J.; Osborne, Lisa C.; Tomov, Vesselin T.; Artis, David; Wherry, E.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can induce fibroblast proliferation and differentiation through activation of phosphoinositide3-Kinase (PI3-K) pathway. However, the detail mechanism by which LPS contributes to the development of lung fibrosis is not clearly understood. To investigate the role of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a PI3-K pathway suppressor, on LPS-induced lung fibroblast proliferation, differentiation, collagen secretion and activation of PI3-K, we transfected PTEN overexpression lentivirus into cultured mouse lung fibroblasts with or without LPS treatment to evaluate proliferation by MTT and Flow cytometry assays. Expression of PTEN, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3beta) and phosphorylation of Akt were determined by Western-blot or real-time RT-PCR assays. The PTEN phosphorylation activity was measured by a malachite green-based assay. The content of C-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP) in cell culture supernatants was examined by ELISA. RESULTS: We found that overexpression of PTEN effectively increased expression and phosphatase activity of PTEN, and concomitantly inhibited LPS-induced fibroblast proliferation, differentiation and collagen secretion. Phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3beta protein expression levels in the LPS-induced PTEN overexpression transfected cells were significantly lower than those in the LPS-induced non-transfected cells, which can be reversed by the PTEN inhibitor, bpV(phen). CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our results show that overexpression and induced phosphatase activity of PTEN inhibits LPS-induced lung fibroblast proliferation, differentiation and collagen secretion through inactivation of PI3-K-Akt-GSK3beta signaling pathways, which can be abrogated by a selective PTEN inhibitor. Thus, expression and phosphatase activity of PTEN could be a potential therapeutic target for LPS-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Compared with PTEN expression level, phosphatase activity of PTEN is more crucial in affecting lung fibroblast proliferation, differentiation and collagen secretion.","publish_time":"2014-01-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Zhengyu; Deng, Yuxiao; Li, Wen; Chen, Yongming; Xing, Shunpeng; Zhao, Xianyuan; Ding, Jia; Gao, Yuan; Wang, Xiangrui","journal":"Cell Biosci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62f5dc6a3bf7eaffcf4a955b6358e27dd13d0fa5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3892003.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3892003/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzE10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PTEN","ELISA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["overexpression of PTEN","induced phosphatase activity of PTEN","PTEN phosphorylation activity","LPS-induced lung fibroblast proliferation","PTEN expression level","LPS-induced PTEN overexpression transfected cells","PTEN overexpression lentivirus","inhibited LPS-induced fibroblast proliferation","selective PTEN inhibitor","differentiation","LPS treatment","uncontrolled proliferation of lung fibroblasts","collagen secretion","development of lung fibrosis","increased expression","Akt-GSK3beta","role of phosphatase","phosphorylation of Akt","cultured mouse lung fibroblasts","GSK3beta protein expression levels","inactivation of PI3","pulmonary fibrosis","non-transfected cells","RESULTS","alpha-SMA","activation of phosphoinositide3","pathway suppressor","glycogen synthase kinase","Flow cytometry assays","alpha-smooth muscle actin","real-time RT-PCR assays","PICP","procollagen","MTT","Western-blot","terminal propeptide of type","potential therapeutic target","cell culture supernatants","tensin homolog","malachite green-based assay","content of C","ELISA","BACKGROUND","bpV","phen","pathways","Lipopolysaccharide","CONCLUSIONS","mechanism"],"language":"en"},

Because interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03B3) plays an important role in inflammation, this work assessed IFN-\u03B3 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) that may be associated with sepsis. METHODS: A total of 196 patients with pneumonia-induced sepsis and 213 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers participated in our study from July 2012 to July 2013 in Guangzhou, China. Patient clinical information was collected. Clinical pathology was assessed in subgroups defined based on clinical criteria, APACHE II (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) and SOFA (sepsis-related organ failure assessment) scores and discharge rate. Four functional SNPs, \u22121616T/C (rs2069705), \u2212764G/C (rs2069707), \u002B874A/T (rs2430561) and \u002B3234C/T (rs2069718), were genotyped by Snapshot in both sepsis patients and healthy controls. Pearson\u2019s chi-square test or Fisher\u2019s exact test were used to analyze the distribution of the SNPs, and the probability values (P values), odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: No mutations in the IFN-\u03B3 \u2212764G/C SNP were detected among the participants in our study. The \u002B874A/T and \u002B3234C/T SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r(2) = 0.894).

Fifty-nine days after the last administration of sporozoites and 32 days after the last dose of chloroquine the volunteer underwent controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) by the bites of five P. falciparum-infected mosquitoes. Eleven days post-CHMI a thick blood smear was positive (6 P. falciparum/\u03BCL blood) and treatment was initiated with atovaquone/proguanil (Malarone\u00AE). On the second day of treatment, day 12 post-CHMI, troponin T, a marker for cardiac tissue damage, began to rise above normal, and reached a maximum of 1,115 ng/L (upper range of normal = 14 ng/L) on day 16 post-CHMI. The volunteer had one ~20 minute episode of retrosternal chest pain and heavy feeling in his left arm on day 14 post-CHMI. ECG at the time revealed minor repolarization disturbances, and cardiac MRI demonstrated focal areas of subepicardial and midwall delayed enhancement of the left ventricle with some oedema and hypokinesia. A diagnosis of myocarditis was made. Troponin T levels were normal within 16 days and the volunteer recovered without clinical sequelae. Follow-up cardiac MRI at almost five months showed normal function of both ventricles and disappearance of oedema. Delayed enhancement of subepicardial and midwall regions decreased, but was still present. With the exception of a throat swab that was positive for rhinovirus on day 14 post-CHMI, no other tests for potential aetiologies of the myocarditis were positive. A number of possible aetiological factors may explain or have contributed to this case of myocarditis including, i) P. falciparum infection, ii) rhinovirus infection, iii) unidentified pathogens, iv) hyper-immunization (the volunteer received six travel vaccines between the last immunization and the CHMI), v) atovaquone/proguanil treatment, or vi) a combination of these factors.

Overlapping genes are of particular interest because they encode proteins originated de novo, some of which have unknown structural folds, challenging the notion that nature utilizes only a limited, well-mapped area of fold space. The C proteins cluster in three groups, comprising measles, Nipah, and Sendai virus. We predicted that all C proteins have a similar organization: a variable, disordered N-terminus and a conserved, \u03B1-helical C-terminus. We confirmed this predicted organization by biophysically characterizing recombinant C proteins from Tupaia paramyxovirus (measles group) and human parainfluenza virus 1 (Sendai group). We also found that the C of the measles and Nipah groups have statistically significant sequence similarity, indicating a common origin. Although the C of the Sendai group lack sequence similarity with them, we speculate that they also have a common origin, given their similar genomic location and structural organization. Since C is dispensable for viral replication, unlike PNT, we hypothesize that C may have originated de novo by overprinting PNT in the ancestor of Paramyxovirinae. Intriguingly, in measles virus and Nipah virus, PNT encodes STAT1-binding sites that overlap different regions of the C-terminus of C, indicating they have probably originated independently. This arrangement, in which the same genetic region encodes simultaneously a crucial functional motif (a STAT1-binding site) and a highly constrained region (the C-terminus of C), seems paradoxical, since it should severely reduce the ability of the virus to adapt. The fact that it originated twice suggests that it must be balanced by an evolutionary advantage, perhaps from reducing the size of the genetic region vulnerable to mutations.","publish_time":"2014-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lo, Michael K.; S\u00F8gaard, Teit Max; Karlin, David G.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/540ccda8bb32d2b9192782b878cc2759da109212.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3934983.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3934983/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzU10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Sendai"],"keyphrases":["recombinant C proteins","C proteins cluster","\u03B1-helical C-terminus","measles virus","Nipah virus","Sendai virus","measles group","common N-terminus","overprinting PNT","disordered N-terminus","Nipah groups","similar organization","structural organization","common origin","predicted organization","human parainfluenza virus","Sendai group lack sequence similarity","constrained region","genetic region vulnerable","novo","STAT1-binding sites","significant sequence similarity","ancestor of Paramyxovirinae","overlapping frames","similar genomic location","unknown structural folds","Tupaia paramyxovirus","crucial functional motif","different regions","well-mapped area of fold space","notion","variable","nature","size","viral replication","mutations","phosphoprotein","evolutionary advantage","genes","arrangement","ability","fact"],"language":"en"},

The characteristic symptom of CPV 2 disease is intestinal hemorrhage with severe bloody diarrhea. Soon after CPV was first recognized in the late 1970s, the original virus, CPV 2, was replaced in the canine population by strains carrying minor antigenic variants (termed 2a, 2b, and 2c) of the VP2 gene that could be distinguished using monoclonal antibodies and molecular analyses. Here, we provide an updated molecular characterization of the CPV 2 circulating in Taiwan. METHODS: In this study, 28 isolates of CPV 2 from 144 dogs with suspected CPV infection were obtained from northern, central, and southern Taiwan from 2008 to 2012 and screened by PCR. The 28 isolates were sequenced, and a phylogenetic analysis of the VP2 gene was performed. RESULTS: Of the 28 Taiwanese CPV 2 isolates, 15 were identified as new CPV 2a, and 13 were identified as new CPV 2b. Compared to the reference CPV 2a, all 15 of the CPV 2a sequences collected in this study contain an Ile324 mutation caused by a TAT to ATT mutation at nucleotides 970\u2013972 of the VP2 gene. CONCLUSION: Our VP2 sequence data revealed that both types are currently prevalent CPV 2 field strains circulating in Taiwan, and a unique Ile324 VP2 mutation was found in our Taiwanese CPV 2a isolates and recent Asian isolates.

In response, we would like to review the accumulated evidence from several independent laboratories that adult tissues, including BM, harbor a population of very rare stem cells that may cross germ layers in their differentiation potential. Thus, the BM stem cell compartment hierarchy needs to be revisited. These dormant, early-development cells that our group described as very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) most likely overlap with similar populations of stem cells that have been identified in adult tissues by other investigators as the result of various experimental strategies and have been given various names. As reported, murine VSELs have some pluripotent stem cell characteristics. Moreover, they display several epiblast/germline markers that suggest their embryonic origin and developmental deposition in adult BM. Moreover, at the molecular level, changes in expression of parentally imprinted genes (for example, Igf2\u2013H19) and resistance to insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) regulates their quiescent state in adult tissues. In several emergency situations related to organ damage, VSELs can be activated and mobilized into peripheral blood, and in appropriate animal models they contribute to tissue organ/regeneration. Interestingly, their number correlates with lifespan in mice, and they may also be involved in some malignancies.

The status of the heart failure patients were checked before and after CRT. Biochemical (ACE and sACE2 activity, ACE concentration) and echocardiographic parameters (EF, left ventricular end-diastolic (EDD) and end-systolic diameter (ESD) and dP/dt) were measured. sACE2 activity negatively correlated with EF and positively with ESD and EDD in all patient\u0027s populations, while it was independent in the healthy cohort. sACE2 activity was already increased in the hypertensive group, where signs for imminent heart failure (slightly decreased EF and barely increased NT-proBNP levels) were detected. sACE2 activities further increased in patients with definitive heart failure (EF\u003C50%), while sACE2 activities decreased with the improvement of the heart failure after CRT (reverse remodeling).

Retrotransposon insertions are associated with a diverse range of sporadic diseases, including cancer. Thus, it is not a surprise that multiple host defense mechanisms suppress retrotransposition. The 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase (OAS)-RNase L system is a mechanism for restricting viral infections during the interferon antiviral response. Here, we investigated a potential role for the OAS-RNase L system in the restriction of retrotransposons. Expression of wild type (WT) and a constitutively active form of RNase L (N\u0394385), but not a catalytically inactive RNase L mutant (R667A), impaired the mobility of engineered human LINE-1 (L1) and mouse intracisternal A-type particle retrotransposons in cultured human cells. Furthermore, WT RNase L, but not an inactive RNase L mutant (R667A), reduced L1 RNA levels and subsequent expression of the L1-encoded proteins (ORF1p and ORF2p). Consistently, confocal immunofluorescent microscopy demonstrated that WT RNase L, but not RNase L R667A, prevented formation of L1 cytoplasmic foci. Finally, siRNA-mediated depletion of endogenous RNase L in a human ovarian cancer cell line (Hey1b) increased the levels of L1 retrotransposition by \u223C2-fold. Together, these data suggest that RNase L might function as a suppressor of structurally distinct retrotransposons.","publish_time":"2013-12-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Ao; Dong, Beihua; Doucet, Aur\u00E9lien J.; Moldovan, John B.; Moran, John V.; Silverman, Robert H.","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/45b4b6a49cc3373b0f67b014910073336dbca667.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3973342.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3973342/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozky0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["WT RNase","OAS-RNase","inactive RNase","active form of RNase","levels of L1 retrotransposition","R667A","siRNA-mediated depletion of endogenous RNase","restriction of retrotransposons","distinct retrotransposons","L1-encoded proteins","type particle retrotransposons","reduced L1 RNA levels","mobility of engineered human LINE","formation of L1 cytoplasmic foci","system","mutant","human ovarian cancer cell line","cultured human cells","Expression of wild type","subsequent expression","Hey1b","viral infections","multiple host defense mechanisms","mouse intracisternal","diverse range of sporadic diseases","interferon antiviral response","surprise","ORF1p","mobile genetic elements","confocal immunofluorescent microscopy","ORF2p","N\u0394385","potential role","suppressor","Retrotransposon insertions","genomic instability","fold","synthetase","data","oligoadenylate"],"language":"en"},

The aim of the study was to evaluate prevalence, characteristics, risk factors and impact on mortality of hospitalized patients with CAP according to the presence of ARF and SS on admission. METHODS: This was a multicenter, observational, prospective study of consecutive CAP patients admitted to three hospitals in Italy, Spain, and Scotland between 2008 and 2010. Three groups of patients were identified: those with neither ARF nor SS (Group A), those with only ARF (Group B) and those with both ARF and SS (Group C) on admission. RESULTS: Among the 2,145 patients enrolled, 45% belonged to Group A, 36% to Group B and 20% to Group C. Patients in Group C were more severe than patients in Group B. Isolated ARF was correlated with age (p \u003C 0.001), COPD (p \u003C 0.001) and multilobar infiltrates (p \u003C 0.001). The contemporary occurrence of ARF and SS was associated with age (p = 0.002), residency in nursing home (p = 0.007), COPD (p \u003C 0.001), multilobar involvement (p \u003C 0.001) and renal disease (p \u003C 0.001). 4.2% of patients in Group A died, 9.3% in Group B and 26% in Group C, p \u003C 0.001. After adjustment, the presence of only ARF had an OR for in-hospital mortality of 1.85 (p = 0.011) and the presence of both ARF and SS had an OR of 6.32 (p \u003C 0.001).

Its most prominent pathologic features are lesions involving the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) the Bruch\u0027s membrane, the degeneration of photoreceptors, and, in the most aggressive cases, choroidal neovascularization. Genetic associations between the risk of developing AMD and polymorphism within components of the complement system, as well as chemokine receptors expressed on microglial cells and macrophages, have linked retinal degeneration and choroidal neovascularization to innate immunity (inflammation). In addition to inflammation, players of the adaptive immunity including cytokines, chemokines, antibodies, and T cells have been detected in animal models of AMD and in patients suffering from this pathology. These observations suggest that adaptive immunity might play a role in different processes associated with AMD such as RPE atrophy, neovascularization, and retinal degeneration. To this date however, the exact roles (if any) of autoantibodies and T cells in AMD remain unknown.

DESIGN: HIV-1 pol sequence data were analyzed to infer the local transmission network. METHODS: We analyzed HIV-1 pol sequence data to infer a partial local transmission network among 478 recently HIV-1 infected persons and 170 of their sexual and social contacts in San Diego, California. A transmission network score (TNS) was developed to estimate the risk of HIV transmission from a newly diagnosed individual to a new partner and target prevention interventions. RESULTS: HIV-1 pol sequences from 339 individuals (52.3%) were highly similar to sequences from at least one other participant (i.e., clustered). A high TNS (top 25%) was significantly correlated with baseline risk behaviors (number of unique sexual partners and insertive unprotected anal intercourse (p = 0.014 and p = 0.0455, respectively) and predicted risk of transmission (p\u003C0.0001). Retrospective analysis of antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, and simulations of ART targeted to individuals with the highest TNS, showed significantly reduced network level HIV transmission (p\u003C0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Sequence data from an HIV-1 screening program focused on recently infected persons and their social and sexual contacts enabled the characterization of a highly connected transmission network.

Increased temperatures due to projected climate change increased R(0) by factors (2\u20135 times in Canada and 1.5\u20132 times in the United States), comparable to observed ranges of R(0) for pathogens and parasites due to variations in strains, geographic locations, epidemics, host and vector densities, and control efforts. Conclusions: Climate warming may have co-driven the emergence of Lyme disease in northeastern North America, and in the future may drive substantial disease spread into new geographic regions and increase tick-borne disease risk where climate is currently suitable. Our findings highlight the potential for climate change to have profound effects on vectors and vector-borne diseases, and the need to refocus efforts to understand these effects.

Specific antiviral therapy has not been developed against most respiratory viruses thought to cause URTIs. The pharmacologic action of glycyrrhizin has been shown to produce anti-inflammatory activity, modulation of the immune system, inhibition of virus growth, and inactivation of viruses. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the tolerability, efficacy, and cost of glycyrrhizin in improving the severity and duration of signs and symptoms of URTIs. The primary end point was tolerability, and the secondary and points included improvement in signs and symptoms of URTI and cost. Methods: Members of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (SDF) treated for URTIs from January 2002 to May 2002 in the SDF Etajima Hospital (Hiroshima, Japan) were eligible for this prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel-group, alternate-day treatment assignment study. All patients in this study fulfilled the following enrollment criteria: admitted to the hospital on the first arrival day as an outpatient; fever (body temperature \u003C38.0\u00B0C) with signs and symptoms of URTI (headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, pharyngitis); and had not received antibiotics or oseltamivir phosphate for 4 weeks before the study. Patients who were admitted on an even day received an IV drip infusion of 40 mL of glycyrrhizin (0.2%) and 500 mL of lactated Ringer\u0027s solution daily during hospitalization (glycyrrhizin group). Patients who were admitted on an odd day received an IV drip infusion of 500 mL/d of lactated Ringer\u0027s solution only (control group). Adverse effects were assessed by the physicians during hospitalization, using patient interview and laboratory analysis. Results: Forty-one consecutive patients entered the study; 15 patients (15 men, 0 women; mean [SD] age, 25.2 [1.5] years) were assigned to the glycyrrhizin group and 269 patients (24 men, 2 women; mean [SD] age, 22.6 [0.9] years) were assigned to the control group. The 2 groups were similar in terms of baseline characteristics. The mean duration of hospitalization was shorter (P = 0.01), the mean maximum body temperature 24 to 48 hours after admission was less (P = 0.05), and the cost of therapy (P = 0.03) was less in the glycyrrhizin group than the control group. No AEs were reported. Conclusions: In this study of hospitalized patients with URTIs, glycyrrhizin therapy was associated with a shorter hospitalization, lower-grade fever, and lower cost of therapy compared with controls, showing that it may be beneficial to patients with URTIs without acute bacterial infections.","publish_time":"2004-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yanagawa, Youichi; Ogura, Masatsune; Fujimoto, Eita; Shono, Satoshi; Okuda, Eriya","journal":"Current Therapeutic Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f607d3e67d8edba24b0738877bde41868b35841.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4052969?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzE3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["URTI","Maritime Self-Defense Force","SDF","SDF Etajima Hospital"],"locations":["Hiroshima","Japan"],"keyphrases":["glycyrrhizin group","cost of glycyrrhizin","glycyrrhizin therapy","study of hospitalized patients","control group","symptoms of URTIs","consecutive patients","parallel-group","lower cost of therapy","mean duration of hospitalization","shorter hospitalization","pharmacologic action of glycyrrhizin","alternate-day treatment assignment study","duration of signs","odd day","arrival day","mean maximum body temperature","IV drip infusion","tolerability","women","respiratory viruses","age","Specific antiviral therapy","years","d of lactated Ringer\u0027s solution","lower-grade fever","acute bacterial infections","SDF Etajima Hospital","Upper respiratory tract infections","acute illnesses","inactivation of viruses","immune system","inhibition of virus growth","headache","account","Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force","sore throat","modulation","Members","physicians","patient interview","Hiroshima","hours","points","improvement","outpatient","severity","rhinorrhea","anti-inflammatory activity","Background","weeks","half","following enrollment criteria","terms of baseline characteristics","laboratory analysis","oseltamivir phosphate","primary end point","groups","antibiotics","pharyngitis","Methods","admission","controls","efficacy","Adverse effects","Objective","aim","Conclusions","Results","AEs"],"language":"en"},

It is not clear which enzyme subtypes are secreted and what the relationships are between enzyme activity, biophysical and biochemical parameters, and clinical outcomes. We aimed to measure the enzyme and identify its subtypes and to study its biochemical and biophysical effect. The secondary aim was to correlate enzyme activity with clinical outcome. METHODS: Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in 24 infants with ARDS and 14 controls with no lung disease. Samples were assayed for secretory phospholipase A2 and molecules related to its activity and expression. Western blotting and captive bubble surfactometry were also performed. Clinical data were real time downloaded. RESULTS: Tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 (814 (506-2,499) vs. 287 (111-1,315) pg/mL; P = 0.04), enzyme activity (430 (253-600) vs. 149 (61-387) IU/mL; P = 0.01), free fatty acids (4.3 (2.8-8.6) vs. 2 (0.8-4.6) mM; P = 0.026), and minimum surface tension (25.6 \u00B1 6.1 vs. 18 \u00B1 1.8 mN/m; P = 0.006) were higher in ARDS than in controls. Phospholipids are lower in ARDS than in controls (76.5 (54-100) vs. 1,094 (536-2,907) \u03BCg/mL; P = 0.0001). Three enzyme subtypes were identified (-IIA, -V, -X), although in lower quantities in controls; another subtype (-IB) was mainly detected in ARDS. Significant correlations exist between enzyme activity, free fatty acids (\u03C1 = 0.823; P \u003C 0.001), and surface tension (\u03C1 = 0.55; P \u003C 0.028). Correlations also exist with intensive care stay (\u03C1 = 0.54; P = 0.001), PRISM-III(24 )(\u03C1 = 0.79; P\u003C 0.001), duration of ventilation (\u03C1 = 0.53; P = 0.002), and oxygen therapy (\u03C1 = 0.54; P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Secretory phospholipase A2 activity is raised in pediatric ARDS and constituted of four subtypes. Enzyme correlates with some inflammatory mediators, surface tension, and major clinical outcomes. Secretory phospholipase A2 may be a clinically relevant target in pediatric ARDS.","publish_time":"2013-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Luca, Daniele; Lopez-Rodriguez, Elena; Minucci, Angelo; Vendittelli, Francesca; Gentile, Leonarda; Stival, Eleonora; Conti, Giorgio; Piastra, Marco; Antonelli, Massimo; Echaide, Mercedes; Perez-Gil, Jesus; Capoluongo, Ettore D","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dd30d7971d2ab4ee8d5631bbfc2e3b75cc828209.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4057254.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4057254/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzE4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["enzyme activity","enzyme subtypes","pediatric ARDS","Secretory phospholipase A2 activity","Enzyme correlates","controls","Clinical data","major clinical outcomes","minimum surface tension","free fatty acids","acute lung injury","pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome","biochemical parameters","lower quantities","lung disease","biophysical effect","Significant correlations","inflammatory mediators","relationships","molecules","relevant target","intensive care stay","Western blotting","captive bubble surfactometry","RESULTS","Tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","role","infants","IIA","CONCLUSIONS","Bronchoalveolar lavage","real time","IB","secondary aim","duration of ventilation","oxygen therapy","INTRODUCTION","Samples","METHODS","expression","Phospholipids","pg","IU","mN","\u03BCg","PRISM"],"language":"en"},

Although apparently disadvantaged by their dependence on the host biosynthetic processes, an immensely faster rate of evolution provides viruses with an edge in this conflict. In this review, I have discussed the potential anti-virus activity of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), a well characterized effector of the cellular homeostatic response to an overloading of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein-folding capacity. IRE1, an ER-membrane-resident ribonuclease (RNase), upon activation catalyses regulated cleavage of select protein-coding and non-coding host RNAs, using an RNase domain which is homologous to that of the known anti-viral effector RNaseL. The latter operates as part of the Oligoadenylate synthetase OAS/RNaseL system of anti-viral defense mechanism. Protein-coding RNA substrates are differentially treated by the IRE1 RNase to either augment, through cytoplasmic splicing of an intron in the Xbp1 transcript, or suppress gene expression. This referred suppression of gene expression is mediated through degradative cleavage of a select cohort of cellular RNA transcripts, initiating the regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) pathway. The review first discusses the anti-viral mechanism of the OAS/RNaseL system and evasion tactics employed by different viruses. This is followed by a review of the RIDD pathway and its potential effect on the stability of viral RNAs. I conclude with a comparison of the enzymatic activity of the two RNases followed by deliberations on the physiological consequences of their activation.","publish_time":"2014-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bhattacharyya, Sankar","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef58c6e2790539f30df14acc260ae2af4b5f3d1f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4061530.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4061530/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzE5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OAS","RNA","RIDD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-viral mechanism","IRE1 RNase","known anti-viral effector RNaseL","review","RNaseL system of anti-viral defense mechanism","stability of viral RNAs","invasive viral pathogen","Protein-coding RNA substrates","non-coding host RNAs","potential anti-virus activity of inositol","RNase domain","regulated IRE1-dependent decay","RIDD pathway","protein-folding capacity","suppression of gene expression","potential effect","ER-membrane","cohort of cellular RNA transcripts","characterized effector","degradative cleavage","different viruses","enzymatic activity","activation catalyses","Oligoadenylate synthetase OAS","cellular homeostatic response","host biosynthetic processes","overloading","evasion tactics","faster rate of evolution","life cycle","endoplasmic reticulum","Xbp1 transcript","resident ribonuclease","intron","cytoplasmic splicing","RNases","enzyme","augment","physiological consequences","deliberations","progression","edge","dependence","battery of mechanisms","conflict","comparison","mammalian genome"],"language":"en"},

Gastrointestinal failure in critically ill patients has a poor prognosis, so early assessment of mucosal barrier injury in shock patients is clinically relevant. Unfortunately, there is no serum marker that can accurately assess intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess if serum diamine oxidase levels can reflect intestinal mucosal injury subsequent to prolonged hemorrhagic shock. METHODS: Thirty New Zealand white rabbits were divided into three groups: a control group, a medium blood pressure (BP) group (exsanguinated to a shock BP of 50 to 41 mm Hg), and a low BP group (exsanguinated to a shock blood pressure of 40 to 31 mm Hg), in which the shock BP was sustained for 180 min prior to fluid resuscitation. RESULTS: The severity of hemorrhagic shock in the low BP group was significantly greater than that of the medium BP group according to the post-resuscitation BP, serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1, and arterial lactate. Intestinal damage was significantly more severe in the low BP group according to Chiu\u2019s scoring, claudin-1, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, and myeloperoxidase expression. Serum diamine oxidase was significantly increased in the low BP group compared to the medium BP and control groups and was negatively correlated with shock BP. CONCLUSION: Serum diamine oxidase can be used as a serological marker in evaluating intestinal injury and shows promise as an indicator of hemorrhagic shock severity.","publish_time":"2014-08-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Liang; Luo, Lin; Jia, Weikun; Xiao, Juan; Huang, Gang; Tian, Geng; Li, Jingwei; Xiao, Yingbin","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1913c3e3106846c33b96d7276edc1d2a62b1a1e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4140717.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4140717/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzI0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Chiu"],"organizations":["BP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["shock BP","low BP group","medium BP group","shock patients","prolonged hemorrhagic shock","severity of hemorrhagic shock","shock blood pressure","intestinal injury","post-resuscitation BP","indicator of hemorrhagic shock severity","intestinal mucosal injury subsequent","Intestinal damage","serum marker","serum diamine oxidase levels","intestinal mucosal blood perfusion lead","intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury","mucosal barrier damage","medium blood pressure","early assessment of mucosal barrier injury","serum tumor necrosis factor","control groups","Hg","ill patients","fluid resuscitation","serological marker","reductions","TNF","claudin","poor prognosis","Chiu\u2019s scoring","promise","New Zealand white rabbits","intercellular adhesion molecule","systemic inflammation","ICAM","METHODS","study","CONCLUSION","Gastrointestinal failure","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","arterial lactate","OBJECTIVE","aim","myeloperoxidase expression"],"language":"en"},

Increasing and substantial evidence of viral persistence in humans, which includes the isolation of RNA by RT-PCR and infectious virus by culture, continues to be reported. Viral persistence can also be established in vitro in various human, animal, arachnid and insect cell lines in culture. Although some research has focused on the potential roles of defective virus particles, evasion of the immune response through the manipulation of autophagy and/or apoptosis, the precise mechanism of flavivirus persistence is still not well understood. We propose additional research for further understanding of how viral persistence is established in different systems. Avenues for additional studies include determining if the multifunctional flavivirus protein NS5 has a role in viral persistence, the development of relevant animal models of viral persistence as well as investigating the host responses that allow vector borne flavivirus replication without detrimental effects on infected cells.

Here we describe the development of 11 novel polymorphic microsatellite loci to facilitate the investigation of genetic structure. FINDINGS: We selected 20 microsatellite sequences identified from high throughput sequence reads and PCR amplified these for 38 individuals, yielding 11 consistently amplifying and scorable loci. The number of alleles per locus ranged from two to 12, and observed heterozygosities from 0.00 to 0.865. No evidence of linkage disequilibrium was observed, and nine of the markers showed no departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. We demonstrate successful amplification in two closely related species and two divergent lineages of the H. caffer species complex.

Adaptive management (AM), long-used in natural resource management, is a structured decision-making approach to solving dynamic problems that accounts for the value of resolving uncertainty via real-time evaluation of alternative models. We propose an AM approach to design and evaluate intervention strategies in epidemiology, using real-time surveillance to resolve model uncertainty as management proceeds, with foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) culling and measles vaccination as case studies. We use simulations of alternative intervention strategies under competing models to quantify the effect of model uncertainty on decision making, in terms of the value of information, and quantify the benefit of adaptive versus static intervention strategies. Culling decisions during the 2001 UK FMD outbreak were contentious due to uncertainty about the spatial scale of transmission. The expected benefit of resolving this uncertainty prior to a new outbreak on a UK-like landscape would be \u00A345\u2013\u00A360 million relative to the strategy that minimizes livestock losses averaged over alternate transmission models. AM during the outbreak would be expected to recover up to \u00A320.1 million of this expected benefit. AM would also recommend a more conservative initial approach (culling of infected premises and dangerous contact farms) than would a fixed strategy (which would additionally require culling of contiguous premises). For optimal targeting of measles vaccination, based on an outbreak in Malawi in 2010, AM allows better distribution of resources across the affected region; its utility depends on uncertainty about both the at-risk population and logistical capacity. When daily vaccination rates are highly constrained, the optimal initial strategy is to conduct a small, quick campaign; a reduction in expected burden of approximately 10,000 cases could result if campaign targets can be updated on the basis of the true susceptible population. Formal incorporation of a policy to update future management actions in response to information gained in the course of an outbreak can change the optimal initial response and result in significant cost savings. AM provides a framework for using multiple models to facilitate public-health decision making and an objective basis for updating management actions in response to improved scientific understanding.","publish_time":"2014-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shea, Katriona; Tildesley, Michael J.; Runge, Michael C.; Fonnesbeck, Christopher J.; Ferrari, Matthew J.","journal":"PLoS Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4bddec0b339a9f5ea397a7390327d12c72159a2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4204804.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4204804/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzI5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Adaptive"],"locations":["Malawi"],"keyphrases":["Optimal intervention","Adaptive management","expected benefit","effect of model uncertainty","optimal initial response","severe scientific uncertainty","optimal initial strategy","management proceeds","UK FMD outbreak","new outbreak","future management actions","static intervention strategies","competing models","multiple models","simulations of alternative intervention strategies","optimal targeting of measles vaccination","Culling decisions","benefit of adaptive","expected burden","conservative initial approach","alternate transmission models","culling of infected premises","natural resource management","culling of contiguous premises","real-time evaluation of alternative models","value of information","decision making","fixed strategy","result","structured decision-making approach","daily vaccination rates","real-time surveillance","objective basis","disease outbreaks","quick campaign","at-risk population","mouth disease","campaign targets","scientific understanding","public-health decision","spatial scale of transmission","true susceptible population","dangerous contact farms","livestock losses","affected region","dynamic problems","reduction","policy","significant cost savings","epidemiology","foot","terms","better distribution of resources","cases","design","logistical capacity","utility","case studies","course","Formal incorporation","framework","Malawi","landscape"],"language":"en"},

Key challenges include mounting dissemination of multiple resistances to antibiotics, the easy transmission and the growing mortality rates of hospital-acquired bacterial diseases. Thus, new ways to rapidly detect these infections are vital. Consequently, researchers around the globe pursue innovative approaches for point-of-care devices. In many cases the specific interaction of an antigen and a corresponding antibody is pivotal. However, the knowledge about suitable antigens is lacking. The aim of this study was to identify novel antigens as specific diagnostic markers. Additionally, these proteins might be aptly used for the generation of vaccines to improve current treatment options. Hence, a cDNA-based expression library was constructed and screened via microarrays to detect novel antigens of Klebsiella pneumoniae, a prominent agent of nosocomial infections well-known for its extensive antibiotics resistance, especially by extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). After screening 1536 clones, 14 previously unknown immunogenic proteins were identified. Subsequently, each protein was expressed in full-length and its immunodominant character examined by ELISA and microarray analyses. Consequently, six proteins were selected for epitope mapping and three thereof possessed linear epitopes. After specificity analysis, homology survey and 3d structural modelling, one epitope sequence GAVVALSTTFA of KPN_00363, an ion channel protein, was identified harboring specificity for K. pneumoniae. The remaining epitopes showed ambiguous results regarding the specificity for K. pneumoniae. The approach adopted herein has been successfully utilized to discover novel antigens of Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella enterica antigens before. Now, we have transferred this knowledge to the key nosocomial agent, K. pneumoniae. By identifying several novel antigens and their linear epitope sites, we have paved the way for crucial future research and applications including the design of point-of-care devices, vaccine development and serological screenings for a highly relevant nosocomial pathogen.","publish_time":"2014-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoppe, Sebastian; Bier, Frank F.; von Nickisch-Rosenegk, Markus","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba2f1457928b26ae7f4ad64983bac74a4e383378.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4205017.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4205017/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzI5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["K. pneumoniae","Salmonella"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel antigens of Klebsiella pneumoniae","suitable antigens","novel antigens of Campylobacter jejuni","key nosocomial agent","Salmonella enterica antigens","continuous expansion of nosocomial infections","prominent agent of nosocomial infections well-known","globe","relevant nosocomial pathogen","care devices","epitope mapping","linear epitope sites","harboring specificity","specificity analysis","linear epitopes","knowledge","unknown immunogenic proteins","epitope sequence GAVVALSTTFA of KPN","design of point","Key challenges","specific interaction","remaining epitopes","extensive antibiotics resistance","specific diagnostic markers","ion channel protein","d structural modelling","serological screenings","easy transmission","mounting dissemination of multiple resistances","applications","homology survey","growing mortality rates of hospital","vaccine development","crucial future research","immunodominant character","innovative approaches","ambiguous results","ELISA","clones","microarrays","current treatment options","generation of vaccines","microarray analyses","corresponding antibody","bacterial diseases","spectrum beta-lactamases","cDNA-based expression library","ESBL","cases","researchers","study","precarious situation","new ways","aim"],"language":"en"},

Here, through quantitive PCR, immunofluorescence (IFC) and immunocytohistochemistry (ICC), we revealed that ST (swine testicles epithelial) cells have a prominent advantage in CSFV proliferation as compared to EC (swine umbilical vein endothelial cell), IEC (swine intestinal epithelial cell) and PK (porcine kidney epithelial) cells.

Nascent glycoprotein production undergoes two proteolytic cleavage events: first within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to cleave SSP from the remaining precursor GP1/2 (glycoprotein complex [GPC]) glycoprotein and second within the Golgi stacks by the cellular SKI-1/S1P for GP1/2 processing to yield GP1 and GP2 subunits. Cleaved SSP is not degraded but retained as an essential glycoprotein subunit. Here, we defined functions of the 58-amino-acid lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) SSP in regard to glycoprotein complex processing and maturation. Using molecular biology techniques, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry, we detected SSP at the plasma membrane of transfected cells. Further, we identified a sorting signal (FLLL) near the carboxyl terminus of SSP that is required for glycoprotein maturation and trafficking. In the absence of SSP, the glycoprotein accumulated within the ER and was unable to undergo processing by SKI-1/S1P. Mutation of this highly conserved FLLL motif showed impaired glycoprotein processing and secretory pathway trafficking, as well as defective surface expression and pH-dependent membrane fusion. Immunoprecipitation of SSP confirmed an interaction between the signal peptide and the GP2 subunit; however, mutations within this FLLL motif disrupted the association of the GP1 subunit with the remaining glycoprotein complex.","publish_time":"2014-10-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bederka, Lydia H.; Bonhomme, Cyrille J.; Ling, Emily L.; Buchmeier, Michael J.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab312eb3286e189488707ea7ac8551401a178940.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4217180.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4217180/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzMwOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FLLL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["glycoprotein complex processing","glycoprotein maturation","remaining glycoprotein complex","trimeric glycoprotein complex","impaired glycoprotein processing","essential glycoprotein subunit","Immunoprecipitation of SSP","absence of SSP","Cleaved SSP","rodent arenavirus glycoprotein complex","Nascent glycoprotein production","GP1 subunit","carboxyl terminus of SSP","remaining precursor GP1","GP2 subunits","conserved FLLL motif","stable signal peptide","surface of virions","sorting signal","S1P","cellular SKI","essential structural component of mature virions","defective surface expression","secretory pathway trafficking","initiate arenavirus infectivity","pH-dependent membrane fusion","plasma membrane of transfected cells","LCMV","regard","confocal microscopy","amino-acid lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus","proteolytic cleavage events","flow cytometry","molecular biology techniques","endoplasmic reticulum","Golgi stacks","interaction","mutations","association","GPC","functions"],"language":"en"},

The autocrine and paracrine functions of the NPs are primarily mediated through the cellular membrane bound guanylyl cyclase-linked receptors GC-A (NPR-A) and GC-B (NPR-B). As the ligands and receptors each contain disulfide bonds, a regulatory role for the cell surface protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) was investigated. OBJECTIVE: We utilized complementary in vitro and in vivo models to determine the potential role of PDI in regulating the ability of the NPs to generate its second messenger, cyclic guanosine monophosphate. METHODS AND RESULTS: Inhibition of PDI attenuated the ability of ANP, BNP and CNP to generate cGMP in human mesangial cells (HMCs), human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs), each of which were shown to express PDI. In LLC-PK1 cells, where PDI expression was undetectable by immunoblotting, PDI inhibition had a minimal effect on cGMP generation. Addition of PDI to cultured LLC-PK1 cells increased intracellular cGMP generation mediated by ANP. Inhibition of PDI in vivo attenuated NP-mediated generation of cGMP by ANP. Surface Plasmon Resonance demonstrated modest and differential binding of the natriuretic peptides with immobilized PDI in a cell free system. However, PDI was shown to co-localize on the surface of cells with GC-A and GC-B by co-immunoprecpitation and immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate for the first time that cell surface PDI expression and function regulate the capacity of natriuretic peptides to generate cGMP through interaction with their receptors.","publish_time":"2014-11-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pan, Shuchong; Chen, Horng H.; Correia, Cristina; Dai, Haiming; Witt, Tyra A.; Kleppe, Laurel S.; Burnett, John C.; Simari, Robert D.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b47882ebbc8d2e9d217dcc10b2328eff5bf8b46.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4242536.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4242536/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzMzOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PDI","ANP","BNP","CNP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Inhibition of PDI","PDI inhibition","immobilized PDI","Addition of PDI","express PDI","surface of cells","cell surface PDI expression","potential role of PDI","GC-B","B-type natriuretic peptide","human mesangial cells","capacity of natriuretic peptides","LLC-PK1 cells","family of natriuretic peptides","atrial natriuretic peptide","intracellular cGMP generation","C-type natriuretic peptide","NPR-B","NPs","ability of ANP","attenuated NP-mediated generation of cGMP","human umbilical vein endothelial cells","human aortic smooth muscle cells","cell surface protein disulfide isomerase","CNP","Surface Plasmon Resonance","BNP","guanylyl cyclase-linked receptors GC","cell free system","regulatory role","disulfide bonds","co-immunoprecpitation","HUVECs","HMCs","differential binding","immunoblotting","diverse actions","minimal effect","cellular membrane","HASMCs","time","renal homeostasis","messenger","interaction","cyclic guanosine monophosphate","models","paracrine functions","ligands","immunohistochemistry","RATIONALE","METHODS","RESULTS","data","OBJECTIVE","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

The tests were based on ITS sequences and developed for Falciformispora senegalensis, F. tompkinsii, Madurella fahalii, M. mycetomatis, M. pseudomycetomatis, M. tropicana, Medicopsis romeroi, and Trematosphaeria grisea. With the isothermal RCA assay, 62 isolates were successfully identified with 100% specificity and no cross reactivity or false results.

Many of these viruses are highly pathogenic to humans however bats remain asymptomatic. The mechanism by which bats control viral replication is unknown. Here we utilize an integrated approach of proteomics informed by transcriptomics to compare the response of immortalized bat and human cells following infection with the highly pathogenic bat-borne Hendra virus (HeV). RESULTS: The host response between the cell lines was significantly different at both the mRNA and protein levels. Human cells demonstrated minimal response eight hours post infection, followed by a global suppression of mRNA and protein abundance. Bat cells demonstrated a robust immune response eight hours post infection, which led to the up-regulation of apoptosis pathways, mediated through the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL). HeV sensitized bat cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, by up-regulating death receptor transcripts. At 48 and 72 hours post infection, bat cells demonstrated a significant increase in apoptotic cell death. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to comprehensively compare the response of bat and human cells to a highly pathogenic zoonotic virus. An early induction of innate immune processes followed by apoptosis of virally infected bat cells highlights the possible involvement of programmed cell death in the host response. Our study shows for the first time a side-by-side high-throughput analysis of a dangerous zoonotic virus in cell lines derived from humans and the natural bat host. This enables a way to search for divergent mechanisms at a molecular level that may influence host pathogenesis.

As is usual with reservoir hosts, these viruses apparently cause little or no pathology in bats. Despite the importance of bats as reservoir hosts of zoonotic and potentially zoonotic agents, virtually nothing is known about the host/virus relationships; principally because few colonies of bats are available for experimental infections, a lack of reagents, methods and expertise for studying bat antiviral responses and immunology, and the difficulty of conducting meaningful field work. These challenges can be addressed, in part, with new technologies that are species-independent that can provide insight into the interactions of bats and viruses, which should clarify how the viruses persist in nature, and what risk factors might facilitate transmission to humans and livestock.","publish_time":"2014-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schountz, Tony","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b875918f93152038d3a87f24e51abc1fd99a348.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4276934.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4276934/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzM2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reservoir hosts of zoonotic","colonies of bats","interactions of bats","importance of bats","Nipah virus","intermediate hosts","Marburg virus","rabies virus","virus relationships","high-impact viruses","humans","zoonotic agents","significant human diseases","expertise","lack of reagents","experimental infections","difficulty","bat antiviral responses","methods","SARS","spillover","species-independent","immunology","transmission","risk factors","insight","MERS coronaviruses","meaningful field work","new technologies","nature","pathology","livestock","challenges"],"language":"en"},

It is recognised that low health literacy levels, different worldviews and English as a second language all contribute to the difficulties health workers often have in explaining biomedical health concepts, relevant to hepatitis B infection, to patients. The aim of this research project was to explore the knowledge, perceptions and experiences of remote dwelling Indigenous adults and their health care providers relating to hepatitis B infection with a view to using this as the evidence base to develop a culturally appropriate educational tool. METHODS: The impetus for this project came from health clinic staff at a remote community in Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory, in partnership with a visiting specialist liver clinic from the Royal Darwin Hospital. Participants were clinic patients with hepatitis B (n = 12), community members (n = 9) and key informants (n = 13); 25 were Indigenous individuals. A participatory action research project design was used with purposive sampling to identify participants. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken to explore: current understanding of hepatitis B, desire for knowledge, and perspectives on how people could acquire the information needed. All individuals were offered the use of an interpreter. The data were examined using deductive and inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Low levels of biomedical knowledge about Hepatitis B, negative perceptions of Hepatitis B, communication (particularly language) and culture were the major themes that emerged from the data. Accurate concepts grounded in Indigenous culture such as \u201Conly your blood can tell the story\u201D were present but accompanied by a feeling of disempowerment due to perceived lack of \u201Cmedical\u201D understanding, and informed partnerships between caregiver and patient. Culturally appropriate discussions in a patient\u2019s first language using visual aids were identified as vital to improving communication. CONCLUSIONS: Having an educational tool in Indigenous patient\u2019s first language is crucial in developing treatment partnerships for Indigenous patients with hepatitis B. Using a culturally appropriate worldview as the foundation for development should help to reduce disempowerment and improve health literacy.","publish_time":"2014-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Davies, Jane; Bukulatjpi, Sarah; Sharma, Suresh; Davis, Joshua; Johnston, Vanessa","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a25c5744c71d6921dd9c9f2b8760e90ec5ef21ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4289355.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4289355/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzM3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hepatitis"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Arnhem Land"],"keyphrases":["hepatitis B infection","negative perceptions of Hepatitis B","current understanding of hepatitis B","Indigenous patients","language","Indigenous patient\u2019s","Indigenous culture","Indigenous individuals","Indigenous communities","health clinic staff","biomedical health concepts","low health literacy levels","clinic patients","health care providers","difficulties health workers","appropriate educational tool","Low levels of biomedical knowledge","experiences of remote dwelling Indigenous adults","remote community","appropriate worldview","communication","appropriate discussions","Participants","data","visiting specialist liver clinic","Northern Territory of Australia","participatory action research project design","informed partnerships","community members","Accurate concepts","feeling of disempowerment","developing treatment partnerships","liver-related morbidity","different worldviews","desire","Arnhem Land","perceived lack","Royal Darwin Hospital","English","purposive sampling","caregiver","development","visual aids","RESULTS","major themes","inductive thematic analysis","mortality","people","foundation","perspectives","key informants","impetus","BACKGROUND","Semi-structured interviews","story","use","blood","METHODS","evidence","CONCLUSIONS","aim","interpreter","information"],"language":"en"},

This study has shown IgG protein fraction stability in bovine fresh frozen plasma collected for transfusion; therefore, bovine fresh frozen plasma seems to be suitable for the treatment of hypogammaglobulinemia (failure of passive transfer) in calves when stored for 12 months at \u221220\u00B0C.","publish_time":"2015-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Proverbio, D.; Spada, E.; Baggiani, L.; Bagnagatti De Giorgi, G.; Roggero, N.; Belloli, A.; Pravettoni, D.; Perego, R.","journal":"ScientificWorldJournal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c7ef724d9e2d25e32eceb1ed8a9fe417fe32309.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4342078.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4342078/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["months","fresh plasma","bovine frozen plasma","bovine fresh frozen plasma","fresh frozen bovine plasma units","median concentration of total protein","total gamma globulin concentration","globulin fractions","IgG protein fraction stability","transfusion","TP","mean concentration","study","beta","different concentrations","failure of passive transfer","treatment of hypogammaglobulinemia","effects of storage conditions","calves","blood collection","Significant differences","albumin","prestorage"],"language":"en"},

Adult human peripheral normal lung tissues of oncologic patients undergoing lung resection were collected. The AEII cells were isolated and identified by the expression of pro-surfactant protein (SP)C, epithelial sodium channel (\u03B1ENaC) and cytokeratin (CK)-8, the lamellar bodies specific for AEII cells, and confirmed by the histology using electron microscopy. The phenotype of AEII cells was characterized by the expression of surfactant proteins (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, SP-D), CK-8, KL-6, \u03B1ENaC, and aquaporin (AQP)-3, which was maintained over 20 days. The biological activity of the primary human AEII cells producing SP-C, cytokines, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 was vigorous in response to stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1.

The desired traits of the solid phase are (1) high capacity for binding immunoreactants (high surface/volume ratio), (2) the possibility of immobilization of many different immunoreactants, (3) minimal dissociation, (4) negligible denaturation of immobilized molecule, and (5) the orientation of immobilized antibody with binding sites toward the solution and the crystalline orientation function (Fc) to the solid phase. Thus, the chapter discusses the immobilization of immunoreactants on solid phases. It also describes the use of plastics as solid phases. The covalent attachment of antibodies or antigens to plastic is also highlighted. While covalent coupling is obligatory for the coating of solid phases other than plastics, it may also be advantageous for plastics. Some of the methods for the covalent linkage of proteins are quite undemanding and convenient for the large-scale preparation of immunoreactant-coated solid phases. Such methods are also necessary for the attachment of antigens that are poorly adsorbed on plastic, such as native DNA, small oligopeptides, and haptens.","publish_time":"2008-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148814/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs5OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["plastic solid phase","coating of solid phases","binding immunoreactants","immobilization of immunoreactants","orientation of immobilized antibody","different immunoreactants","attachment of antigens","covalent attachment of antibodies","covalent coupling","use of plastics","methods","covalent linkage of proteins","high surface","high capacity","free antibody","binding sites","possibility of immobilization","negligible denaturation of immobilized molecule","crystalline orientation function","rapid increase","immune complexes","solution","large-scale preparation of immunoreactant","popularity of enzyme immunoassay techniques","important reason","Fc","native DNA","volume ratio","minimal dissociation","small oligopeptides","simple manipulations","desired traits","chapter"],"language":"en"},

This review summarizes recent literature on fomite contamination and microbial survival in the built environment, transmission between fomites and humans, and implications for human health. RECENT FINDINGS: Applications of molecular sequencing techniques to analyze microbial samples have increased our understanding of the microbial diversity that exists in the built environment. This growing body of research has established that microbial communities on surfaces include substantial diversity, with considerable dynamics. While many microbial taxa likely die or lay dormant, some organisms survive, including those that are potentially beneficial, benign, or pathogenic. Surface characteristics also influence microbial survival and rates of transfer to and from humans. Recent research has combined experimental data, mechanistic modeling, and epidemiological approaches to shed light on the likely contributors to microbial exchange between fomites and humans and their contributions to adverse (and even potentially beneficial) human health outcomes. SUMMARY: In addition to concerns for fomite transmission of potential pathogens, new analytical tools have uncovered other microbial matters that can be transmitted indirectly via fomites, including entire microbial communities and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Mathematical models and epidemiological approaches can provide insight on human health implications. However, both are subject to limitations associated with study design, and there is a need to better understand appropriate input model parameters. Fomites remain an important mechanism of transmission of many microbes, along with direct contact and short- and long-range aerosols.","publish_time":"2019-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stephens, Brent; Azimi, Parham; Thoemmes, Megan S.; Heidarinejad, Mohammad; Allen, Joseph G.; Gilbert, Jack A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51ef605da93429c3489f0a4b0a4eb6fd227b28b1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149182/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjsxODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["microbial survival","microbial diversity","microbial samples","microbial exchange","microbial matters","microbial taxa","Fomites","entire microbial communities","humans","human health implications","Recent research","human health outcomes","fomite transmission of potential pathogens","epidemiological approaches","microbes","recent literature","important mechanism of transmission","RECENT FINDINGS","built environment","fomite contamination","substantial diversity","potential intermediaries","likely contributors","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","growing body of research","new analytical tools","Applications of molecular sequencing techniques","mechanistic modeling","concerns","shed light","insight","experimental data","inanimate objects","surfaces","antibiotic-resistant bacteria","direct contact","rates of transfer","need","addition","appropriate input model parameters","understanding","study design","long-range aerosols","considerable dynamics","Mathematical models","Surface characteristics","limitations","contributions","SUMMARY","organisms"],"language":"en"},

Our objective was to evaluate the association of TNF-\u03B1 gene \u2212308 G\u003EA polymorphism with susceptibility to, and severity of, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). RESULTS: This was a cross-sectional study including 45 Egyptian children hospitalized for CAP in addition to 45 healthy children who served as a control group. Pneumonia severity was assessed on admission by the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines; Pediatric Respiratory Severity Score (PRESS) score; Predisposition, Infection, Response and Organ failure (PIROm) score; and Respiratory Index of Severity in Children (RISC) score. Genotyping of TNF-\u03B1 polymorphism was performed to all individuals by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Patients were monitored till hospital discharge. Frequency of AG genotype was lower among patients compared with control [odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.13 (0.03\u20130.63); p = 0.012]. Prevalence of genotypes AA\u002BAG was lower among patients compared with controls [OR and 95% CI = 0.34 (0.12\u20130.99); p = 0,048]. The \u201CA\u201D allele prevalence was higher among controls, but no significant association was found with CAP [OR and 95% CI = 0.58 (0.25\u20131.35); p = 0.21]. When PRESS score was used to classify patients into \u201Csevere pneumonia\u201D and \u201Cnon-severe pneumonia,\u201D no significant association of any of the alleles or genotypes with CAP severity was found. CONCLUSION: TNF-\u03B1 \u2212308 G\u003EA polymorphism confers protection from pediatric CAP but is not associated with indicators of CAP severity. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings in pediatric patients from different ethnicities.","publish_time":"2020-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"El Gendy, Fady M.; El-Mekkawy, Muhammad Said; El-Naidany, Sherin Sobhy; El-torgoman, Shimaa Tarek","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d3706edc11b88f9fff269eaadf5e20abc935c86.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149214/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjsyMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAP","World Health Organization","Pediatric Respiratory Severity Score","AG","AA AG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u03B1 polymorphism","Pneumonia severity","pediatric CAP","indicators of CAP severity","Pediatric Respiratory Severity Score","association of TNF","pediatric patients","PRESS score","proinflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03B1","\u03B1 gene","promoter polymorphism","Genotyping of TNF","Respiratory Index of Severity","significant association","non-severe pneumonia","restriction fragment length polymorphism","Egyptian children","healthy children","controls","Prevalence of genotypes AA","allele prevalence","control group","modulating host response","Frequency of AG genotype","guidelines","polymerase chain reaction","PIROm","individuals","Predisposition","Tumor necrosis factor alpha","Organ failure","excessive production","findings","admission","addition","alleles","pulmonary infections","PCR-RFLP","World Health Organization","BACKGROUND","cross-sectional study","different ethnicities","RISC","protection","odds ratio","susceptibility","community","RESULTS","confidence interval","hospital discharge","CONCLUSION","Larger studies","objective"],"language":"en"},

It presents examples illustrating the pathogenesis of four basic kinds of acute viral infection: respiratory, intestinal, generalized, and neurological. As the immune system plays a key role in protection against infections, viral damage to its components can exacerbate the severity of disease or predispose to superinfection with other viral or nonviral agents. Both specific acquired immunodeficiency and generalized immunosuppression can occur in viral infections. The immune response to viral infection may itself frequently contribute to the pathology of the disease. Inflammation with accompanying cellular infiltration is a regular feature of viral infection. Such common signs as erythema, edema, and enlargement of lymph nodes have an immunological basis. There are viral diseases in which the cardinal manifestations are caused by the body\u0027s immune response. Immunopathological (hypersensitivity) reactions are traditionally classified into types 1, 2, 3, and 4. For most viral infections, it is not known whether immunopathological effects make a significant contribution to disease and if so then as to which of the four classical hypersensitivity reactions is implicated. It is instructive to speculate about the possible involvement of different kinds of hypersensitivity reactions in viral diseases.","publish_time":"2014-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"FENNER, FRANK; BACHMANN, PETER A.; GIBBS, E.

In spite of the policy implications for outbreak response, the \u201Ccapacity\u201D and \u201Cwill\u201D explanations have not been systematically examined.

These tests are often performed by non-laboratory trained staff. At the present time there are no external quality assessment (EQA) providers in the UK offering proficiency testing schemes for HIV point of care testing. The aim of this study is to develop such an EQA scheme. Firstly, a selection of the most widely used POCTs was selected and their performance assessed using existing HIV-positive serology EQA specimens. All assays produced the correct results however intensity of results observed for the same specimen differed greatly between POCT devices. In addition the effect of various sub-groups of HIV-1 serum samples on the HIV POCT assays was investigated and no difference between the results on the POCTs was observed. Ultimately four serum specimens, two HIV-1 and one HIV-2 positive, one HIV negative, were chosen and sent to NHS laboratories and sexual health clinics for testing as part of a pilot EQA scheme for HIV POCT. Results were excellent with 97% of participants reporting correct results (n= 20). The study highlighted a lack of awareness of EQA particularly in non-laboratory settings, although recommendations (ISO 22870:2006) are in place for the users of such devices. In conclusion, the need for EQA for providers of point of care testing is an integral part of ensuring reliability of results and quality of care for the patient.","publish_time":"2011-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abdul-Khaliq, Catherine","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9cba862dff2144ac822546806e52f5cc71cbb4ea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149475.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149475/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjszMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","EQA","POCT","HIV POCT","NHS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HIV point of care testing","HIV negative","HIV POCT assays","correct results","use of HIV point of care tests","existing HIV-positive serology EQA specimens","reliability of results","intensity of results","quality of care","pilot EQA scheme","POCTs","effect of various sub-groups of HIV","providers of point","POCT devices","non-laboratory settings","proficiency testing schemes","serum specimens","study","non-laboratory trained staff","serum samples","external quality assessment","UK","sexual health clinics","NHS laboratories","addition","participants","recommendations","lack of awareness","need","performance","difference","present time","ISO","place","users","conclusion","patient","aim","selection"],"language":"en"},

Poxviruses cause several important diseases in domestic and wild mammals and birds. Infection with poxviruses usually results in relatively mild disease involving the skin of the infected animals, however, generalized and often fatal disease may also occur, for example, in myxomatosis in rabbits. Close antigenic relationships exist among many poxviruses derived from different animal species. In spite of close antigenic relationships, the poxviruses of rabbits that produce distinct disease syndromes are discussed as separate entities. Virus of the genus Papillomavirus cause papillomas in various animal species and includes two rabbit viruses, the cottontail rabbit papillomavirus and the rabbit oral papillomavirus. The genus Polyomavirus contains one virus of rabbits, the rabbit kidney vacuolating virus. Papillomatosis of wild cottontail rabbits is characterized by the presence of horny warts, usually on the neck, shoulders, or abdomen. The warts begin as red raised areas at the site of infection, grow to become typical papillomas with rough rounded surfaces, and may later develop into large, keratinized horny growths. The rabbit kidney vacuolating virus was isolated in primary rabbit kidney cell cultures from papillomas of cottontail rabbits collected in Kansas. This virus causes vacuolar cytopathic effects in cell cultures. The virus resembles the cottontail rabbit (Shope) papil lomavirus but is a distinct virus. It does not produce papillomas when inoculated into rabbits and does not immunize rabbits against rabbit papillomavirus.","publish_time":"2013-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"DiGiacomo, Ronald F.; John Mar\u00E9, C.","journal":"The Biology of the Laboratory Rabbit","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149740.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149740/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjszODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Kansas"],"keyphrases":["virus of rabbits","poxviruses of rabbits","cottontail rabbit papillomavirus","papillomas of cottontail rabbits","rabbit kidney vacuolating virus","rabbit viruses","distinct virus","rabbit oral papillomavirus","Papillomatosis of wild cottontail rabbits","viral diseases of rabbits","primary rabbit kidney cell cultures","genus Papillomavirus cause papillomas","typical papillomas","distinct disease syndromes","mild disease","fatal disease","spite of close antigenic relationships","various animal species","different animal species","presence of horny warts","wild mammals","important diseases","genus Polyomavirus","site of infection","horny growths","papil lomavirus","vacuolar cytopathic effects","Shope","red raised areas","skin","neck","rough rounded surfaces","separate entities","birds","example","Kansas","infected animals","shoulders","abdomen","myxomatosis","chapter"],"language":"en"},

Diet has a marked influence on gastrointestinal tract function and the manipulation of dietary composition provides clinicians with a powerful therapeutic tool. During acute gastroenteritis, a short period of fasting is recommended. \u2018Feeding through\u2019 diarrhoea (without a period of fasting) is recommended in human infants but has limited applicability in dogs and cats, primarily because different types of diarrhoea are commonly treated by veterinary surgeons compared to physicians. Following the fast, a change from the animal\u0027s regular food to a diet containing novel protein sources is advisable. This minimises the likelihood of acquired food allergies to staple proteins. Allergy avoidance may require special techniques such as rotation diets or protein hydrolysates. Dietary fat is usually kept to a minimum during gastrointestinal dysfunction as malabsorbed fatty acids and bile acids promote secretory diarrhoea in the large bowel. Recommendations to feed high fat rather than high carbohydrate diets to cats with diarrhoea need to be objectively examined. The type of fat fed may also prove to be an important consideration. Incorporation of omega\u20103 fatty acids into the diet has been shown to have anti\u2010inflammatory effects on the gastrointestinal mucosa. In diseases of the small bowel, it is traditional to use low fibre diets. This recommendation needs re\u2010examination because the binding and gelling properties of fibre are of potential benefit in the treatment of small bowel diarrhoea. High fibre diets are useful in most large bowel diseases. Soluble (fermentable) fibres (eg, psyllium, oat bran and fibrim) rather than insoluble (non\u2010fermentable) fibres (eg, wheat bran) give better results in treating colitis. The benefits from soluble fibre probably relates to the binding of irritant bile acids and the generation of volatile fatty acids, such as butyrate, that nourish the colonic epithelium and encourage growth of normal bacterial flora.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guilford, W.

In the UK, vaccination is routinely carried out for feline panleucopenia, feline viral rhino\u2010tracheitis (FVR), and feline calicivirus infection, and in quarantine, cats are also vaccinated against rabies. In the USA and some other countries, vaccination is also carried out against feline leukaemia virus infection, feline Chlamydia psit\u2010taci infection and routinely against rabies. Attempts are also being made to develop vaccines for feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), although there are a number of problems associated with the development of a successful FIP vaccine which will be referred to later. Factors important in prevention and control of the three diseases feline panleucopenia, FVR, and feline calicivirus infection for which vaccination in the UK is commonly practised will be discussed. For each disease, some background information on the virus and the epizootiology of the disease is given, which it is hoped will lead to greater understanding of the principles involved in prevention and control. A few points will then be made about vaccination in some of those diseases where vaccines are being developed or where it is carried out in other countries.","publish_time":"2008-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gaskell, R.

In this study, we have examined the requirement for different TLR adaptor molecules in virus\u2010induced chemokine expression and are currently trying to identify the TLR involved. We have found that both a herpesvirus [herpes simplex virus (HSV)] and a paramyxovirus (Sendai virus) require a functional genome to induce expression or proinflammatory chemokines in human and murine monocytic cell lines. For both viruses, this is independent of the TLR adaptor molecules TRIF and Mal.

MBL levels and MBL\u2010induced complement activity were determined in 19 patients of bronchial asthma with allergic rhinitis and 20 unrelated, age\u2010matched controls of Indian origin.

Association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in exon 1 and intron 1 of the MBL with the disease, clinical markers, MBL levels and MBL\u2010induced complement activity was analysed using standard statistical tools. Significantly higher MBL levels and activity were observed in patients of bronchial asthma with allergic rhinitis as compared to the controls.

The activation of complement proceeds through three different pathways that converge in the generation of C3\u2010activating enzyme complexes. Complement activation via the lectin pathway is initiated when recognition molecules, mannan\u2010binding lectin (MBL) or ficolin, bind to carbohydrate structures characteristic for microbial surfaces. In the circulation, MBL and ficolins are found in association with three structurally related MBL\u2010associated serine proteases (MASP)\u20101, \u20102 and \u20103 and a small, nonenzymatic component, MAp19. MASP\u20102 has been shown to elicit complement activation through the sequential proteolytic cleavage of C4 and C2 upon binding of MBL/MASP\u20102 complexes to microbial surfaces. We have recently uncovered a polymorphism in the MASP\u20102/MAp19 gene in a patient shown to be deficient in the lectin pathway of complement activation. The polymorphism results in a single amino acid substitution in the N\u2010terminal part of the MASP\u20102 protein. Recombinant wildtype MASP\u20102 and MASP\u20102 containing the amino acid substitution in question was produced, and the ability to activate complement was studied. The mutation had a profound impact on MASP\u20102 function, resulting in the lack of complement activation through the lectin pathway. ELISA\u2010based experiments showed that the mutation leads to the impairment of complement activation through influencing the binding of MASP\u20102 to MBL or ficolins. Deficiencies in the lectin pathway of complement activation have so far been accounted for only by lack of functional MBL. The mutation described above is the first defect described affecting both activation through MBL and the ficolins.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"S\u00F8rensen, R.; Gadjeva, M.; Thiel, S.; Jensenius, J.

Evidence indicates that lactic acid bacteria (LAB), e.g. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, have beneficial effects on the host. Established health effects include increased gut maturation, antagonisms towards pathogens and immune modulation. The objective of this study is to evaluate the immunomodulating properties of a range of LAB of human origin. As dendritic cells (DCs) play a pivotal role in the balance between tolerance and immunity to commensal microorganisms, in vitro\u2010generated immature DCs serve as a suitable model for studying the immunomodulating effects of lab. Human immature DCs were generated in vitro from monocytes and exposed to lethally UV\u2010irradiated LAB. The effect of various species of LAB on DCs in direct contact was evaluated. Furthermore, the maturation pattern of DCs separated from the bacteria by an epithelial cell layer (CaCo\u20102 cells), which should mimic the intestinal environment, was studied. Cytokine secretion (IL\u201012, IL\u201010 and TNF\u2010\u03B1) and upregulation of maturation surface markers on DCs (CD83 and CD86) was measured. Different LAB induced diverse cytokine responses. Some strains were strong IL\u201012 and TNF\u2010\u03B1 inducers and others weak. All strains induced IL\u201010. Different LAB also differentially modulated expression of CD83 and CD86 on DCs. Although some variation in the response to LAB of DCs generated from different blood donors was observed, general differences in the effect of the various LAB was revealed. Experiments with the DC CaCo\u20102 coculture system are ongoing. Different species of LAB differentially affect DC maturation; this suggets that the gut flora plays a pivotal role in polarization of the immune response.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hjerrild, L.; Christensen, H.

The hypothesis examined in this study is that the transcription factor BCL\u20106 is critically important not only for regulating B\u2010cell growth and development but also for mammary epithelial apoptosis. Methodology: Twenty breast cancer cases and 31 healthy controls were used to investigate whether BCL\u20106 protein in involved in breast cancer (grade III). Full length BCL\u20106 cDNA was retrovirally transduced into EpH\u20104 cell line. We then used flow cytometry of BrdUrd\u2010stained cells to investigate the cell\u2010cycle duration of the control and transduced cell lines. TUNEL was used as a marker of apoptosis to find out differences in the frequencies of apoptotic cells in the control and transduced cell lines. Finally, immunohistochemistry staining was performed to detect BCL\u20106 in breast cancer (III). Results: Restoration of BCL\u20106 into EpH\u20104 cells not only inhibits apoptosis but also prolongs the cell cycle and results in increased cell size and protein content. The results also indicated that the cell\u2010cycle time of BCL\u20106\u2010transduced EpH\u20104 cells is prolonged by about 3 h, presumably as a result of the action of BCL\u20106 at the BCL\u20106 at the G1/S transition. We found differences in the frequencies of viable and apoptotic cells in cultures of the parent EpH\u20104 cells, control\u2010transduced EpH\u20104 cells and BCL\u20106\u2010transduced EpH\u20104 cells. Consistently, we demonstrated that BCL\u20106 is expressed in 90% of high grade of breast carcinoma, which is considered as the most aggressive of tumours. Conclusion: Together, these results suggest that BCL\u20106 is likely to be involved in mammary gland development and carcinogenesis.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alenzi, F. Q.

Control over the HBV infection is achieved mainly by vaccination with Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). HBsAg contains N\u2010linked glycosylation side and is recognized by both MBL\u2010A and MBL\u2010C in a Ca\u2010dependent manner. HbsAg\u2013MBL complexes activate complement and may thus affect humoural immunity. To investigate the role of MBL in humoural responses to HBsAg, we immununized mice that lack both MBL\u2010A and MBL\u2010C proteins with soluble HBsAg. It has been shown that deficiencies in other complement components like C1q, C4 and C3 result in decreased antibody responses. However, MBL double KO animals mounted dramatically increased humoural responses. After priming, MBL double KOs mounted HbsAg\u2010specific IgM responses, which were threefold higher than WT controls. After boosting the HBsAg, total IgG was 10\u2010fold higher in MBL KO than in WT control animals. Similar to the response to HbsAg, other glycosylated soluble antigens (e.g. invertase) induced better humoural responses in MBL double KO animals, suggesting that MBL plays an important role in a negative feedback regulation of adaptive immunity. Reconstitution experiments with rMBL partially rescued the KO phenotype. We propose that the clearance of glycoprotein antigens in MBL KO is handled differently from the WT, resulting in better stimulation of humoural responses. Alternatively, glycoprotein\u2010Ag\u2010MBL\u2010rich complexes inhibit B\u2010cell responsiveness via putative MBL receptors.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ruseva, M.; Gajdeva, M.; Takahashi, K.; Ezekowitz, A.; Thiel, S.; Jensenius, J.

Adenosine acts via four adenosine receptors of which the A2a receptor is the predominant form in T cells.

Instead, the role of anti\u2010inflammatory mechanisms of adenosine on T cells in asthma is unclear. Aim: To study the A2a receptor expression in peripheral blood CD4(\u002B) T cells in asthmatic and healthy individuals using flow cytometric and quantitative real\u2010time PCR methods. Results: Unstimulated CD4(\u002B) cells of asthmatic patients expressed significantly lower levels (P \u003C 0.001) of A2a receptor in protein level (mean percentage of cells positive \u00B1 SEM: 76.8 \u00B1 1.2, n = 6) compared to healthy individuals (90.4% \u00B1 1.9, n = 4). Double staining for CD69 expression showed that stimulation of CD4(\u002B) cells decreased A2a expression in both groups but indicated that the detected lower levels of A2a in unstimulated cells of asthmatics was not due to preactivation in these patients. Surprisingly, A2a mRNA expression in unstimulated CD4(\u002B) cells was significantly higher (P \u003C 0.05) in asthmatics (n = 28) compared to healthy controls (n = 7). The expression did not correlate with serum total IgE levels. Conclusions: Asthmatic individuals express less A2a adenosine receptor on their peripheral CD4(\u002B) T cells.

An exact virological diagnosis is necessary for studies of the epidemiology of viral infections and for the control of epidemics and nosocomial infections. Most known viruses causing disease in man can be demonstrated by use of cell cultures or experimental animals. The virus infection is indicated by the more or less characteristic changes that the virus causes in cell cultures or by the appearance of disease in experimental animals. The cells of different origin and age may have a markedly varying susceptibility to different viruses. For diagnostic purposes a virus laboratory must therefore have access to a battery of cell lines from animals and man. It is pointed out that demonstration, by use of laboratory techniques; of a virus infection in a patient does not necessarily imply that this infection is the cause of the patient\u0027s disease.

Fingerprinting is a technique by which oligonucleotides, produced by cleavage of RNA molecules with specific ribonucleases, are separated in two dimensions. It is a definitive method of identifying RNA viruses according to their genotypes. It is not subject to the problems of antigenic drift or antigenic convergence that complicate serological identification. Furthermore, it provides a semiquantitative means of following the evolution of viral genomes in nature. Because all regions of the genome are represented by the large diagnostic oligonucleotides, a survey of the total genomic changes can be monitored. Fingerprinting has two limitations as a diagnostic tool. First, although highly definitive, fingerprinting is not as rapid or inexpensive as serological techniques and cannot be as easily scaled up for routine identification of a large number of samples. Second, the evolutionary range of fingerprinting is short and relationships may not be evident for isolates of rapidly evolving viruses obtained over long intervals. However, these limitations are not large, compared to the full benefits offered to the virologist by the fingerprinting method.","publish_time":"2014-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kew, Olen M.; Nottay, Baldev K.; Obijeski, John F.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173596/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs2NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fingerprinting method","identification of viruses","applications of oligonucleotide fingerprinting","evolutionary range of fingerprinting","RNA viruses","serological identification","large diagnostic oligonucleotides","evolving viruses","routine identification","definitive method","limitations","large number of samples","antigenic convergence","serological techniques","diagnostic tool","problems of antigenic drift","cleavage of RNA molecules","survey","relationships","specific ribonucleases","isolates","evolution of viral genomes","total genomic changes","nature","long intervals","chapter","virologist","benefits","genotypes","regions","semiquantitative","dimensions"],"language":"en"},

The microbial causes of human disease include viruses, chlamydiae, rickettsiae, mycoplasmas, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. Viruses differ greatly from all the other microbes as they consist essentially of only nucleic acid surrounded by a protein coat and contain only one instead of two types of nucleic acid. Once inside human cells, the viruses remove the normal nuclear control of the cells to take over cellular metabolism for the synthesis of new virions. Chlamydiae and rickettsiae are also obligate intracellular parasites, have both DNA and RNA, and multiply by binary fission. Mycoplasmas, bacteria, and fungi can be cultured in cell-free media. Bacterial causes of disease are mainly lower bacteria that are unicellular. Multiplication is predominantly by asexual binary fission, although biological variation is facilitated in some species by sex, especially with Gram-negative species such as Escherichia coli. Only a few higher bacteria cause disease in man, such as Actinomycetes israelit, which are filamentous Gram-positive bacilli.","publish_time":"2014-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shanson, D.C.","journal":"Microbiology in Clinical Practice","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173597.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173597/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs2NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viruses","lower bacteria","higher bacteria cause disease","rickettsiae","Bacterial causes of disease","microbial causes of human disease","chlamydiae","human cells","fungi","mycoplasmas","asexual binary fission","types of nucleic acid","Gram-negative species","pathogenicity of microbes","Actinomycetes israelit","biological variation","cellular metabolism","normal nuclear control","intracellular parasites","RNA","synthesis of new virions","filamentous Gram-positive bacilli","DNA","classification","Escherichia coli","protein coat","Multiplication","cell-free media","chapter","protozoa"],"language":"en"},

It has also been grown experimentally in the United States. Ancient historical manuscripts from China, India and Greece mention its use for symptoms of viral respiratory tract infections and hepatitis. The plant has also been described by Theophrastus. Licorice from Egypt has been described to be the best, followed by from Iraq and Syria; the root should be decorticated before use. It concocts viscid humours in diseases of liver, bladder and lungs, and expectorates them. It has been used in Iranian herbal medicine for skin eruptions, including dermatitis, eczema, pruritus and cysts, and for treatment of stomach disorders including peptic ulcers. The herb extract inhibits gastric motility in vivo, which is regarded to be an important aspect for its antiulcer activity. Licorice possesses both anti-inflammatory and antiulcer activities; whereas most anti-inflammatory agents are ulcerogenic. Former German Commission E believed it to be effective in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Licorice root has been used for years to regulate gastrointestinal function in TCM, has been used for generations as an antidote, demulcent, and elixir in folk medicine of China, and is the most commonly used crude drug in Kampo Medicines, the Japanese form of modified TCM, for the treatment of peptic ulcer. Roots contain glycyrrhizin, the main water-soluble constituent that is 50\u00D7 sweeter than sugar, 2-\u03B2-glucuronosyl glucuronic acid, and isoliquiritigenin-4-glucoside. Glycyrrhizin is a nonhemolytic saponin with foaming property, and one of the most potent hydroxyl radical scavengers. No significant effect of deglycyrrhizinised liquorice was observed on gastric ulcer in an RCT of British patients. Treatment of healthy men with licorice for one-week decreased salivary testosterone values by 26% but no significant decrease in free testosterone, and nine healthy women treated with licorice daily for two cycles, had their mean total serum testosterone decreased by 37% at the end of 2nd month. This property could be useful as an adjunct therapy of hirsutism and PCOS.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Akbar, Shahid","journal":"Handbook of 200 Medicinal Plants","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba5e05246415355197be084c510ef1ba2a8bbb35.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173723.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173723/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs2OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TCM","PCOS"],"locations":["India","southern Europe","Belgium","France","Germany","Spain","Greece","Turkey","Russia","South Africa","Syria","United States","China","Iraq","England"],"keyphrases":["Licorice root","treatment of peptic ulcer","treatment of atopic dermatitis","Treatment of healthy men","Greece","treatment of stomach disorders","free testosterone","gastric ulcer","use","Iraq","Syria","Egypt","folk medicine of China","salivary testosterone values","native of India","antiulcer activities","herb extract","mean total serum testosterone","gastric motility","antiulcer activity","significant effect of deglycyrrhizinised liquorice","anti-inflammatory agents","peptic ulcers","healthy women","significant decrease","foaming property","temperate-zone herb","Iranian herbal medicine","Japanese form of modified TCM","Germany","Spain","Italy","Turkey","skin eruptions","subshrub","Russia","South Africa","symptoms of viral respiratory tract infections","Kampo Medicines","diseases of liver","England","France","demulcent","eczema","Pakistan","elixir","cysts","week","years","\u03B2-glucuronosyl glucuronic acid","southern Europe","adjunct therapy of hirsutism","main water-soluble constituent","Ancient historical manuscripts","isoliquiritigenin","bladder","Belgium","hepatitis","nonhemolytic saponin","perennial","cycles","pruritus","RCT of British patients","viscid humours","crude drug","potent hydroxyl radical scavengers","PCOS","lungs","sugar","antidote","important aspect","Roots","generations","gastrointestinal function","German Commission E","ulcerogenic","United States","plant","Theophrastus","end","month","glucoside","best"],"language":"en"},

The outbreak of SARS in 2002/2003 was associated with high morbidity and mortality and sparked international research efforts to develop antiviral strategies. Many of these efforts focussed on the viral surface protein spike (S), which facilitates the first indispensable step in the viral replication cycle, infectious entry into target cells. For infectious cellular entry to occur, the S protein must engage a cellular receptor, the carboxypeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The interface between ACE2 and S protein, which has been characterized at the structural level, constitutes a key target for vaccines and inhibitors, and is believed to be an important determinant of viral pathogenesis and interspecies transmission. In this chapter, we will discuss how SARS-S mediates cellular entry and we will review the implications of this process for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) transmission, disease development and antiviral intervention.","publish_time":"2009-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Glowacka, Ilona; Bertram, Stephanie; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan","journal":"Molecular Biology of the SARS-Coronavirus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2332737bbe43a1906b9fc00b480ef6cf1daaf7d6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7176234.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176234/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs3NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-S","SARS coronavirus","S protein","SARS-CoV","outbreak of SARS","infectious cellular entry","infectious entry","viral surface protein spike","cellular receptor","ACE2","viral replication cycle","disease development","interspecies transmission","key target","important determinant of viral pathogenesis","target cells","antiviral strategies","antiviral intervention","novel coronavirus","international research efforts","lung disease severe acute respiratory syndrome","causative agent","mortality","carboxypeptidase angiotensin","high morbidity","indispensable step","implications","process","enzyme","structural level","vaccines","inhibitors","interface","chapter"],"language":"en"},

Disinfection is invariably a logarithmic process, as is microbial growth. The disinfection rate of the microorganisms varies widely and is subject to many complexities, including shoulder effects, second stage decay, relative humidity effects, and photoreactivation. Not all these processes need be considered for every design application, but a familiarity with these effects is essential for understanding UV disinfection. Furthermore, not all of these processes can be completely and accurately modeled at present, but enough is known to adequately design reliable UV disinfection systems. All of these processes can be modeled with basic exponential equations and by using computational methods if necessary.

The availability of treatment is important for those in need of cure, but by now it is a well-shown fact that health is generally determined to a much greater extent by other factors. Genetic constitution, lifestyle choices and socio-economic environment largely explain why some of us become ill or die earlier than others who remain healthy (Mackenbach 1996; McKeown 1976; Wilkinson and Marmot 2003). While some of these factors fall under the control of an individual, the majority does not. Research increasingly indicates how remarkably sensitive our health seems to be to what has become known as the \u2018social determinants of health\u2019. These factors generally fall beyond the control of an individual, but can nonetheless be influenced on a population level. This causes a shift in the focus of health policy from the classic provision of health care to policies specifically designed to influence the causal factors of ill-health in different non-medical fields. The flipside of that evolution is a significant increase of the state\u2019s influence in the sphere of individual lives. A pertinent question remains the one that asks for the legitimate role of governments in modifying, discouraging or prohibiting behaviors that lead to ill-health. To what extent can and should we hold public policy responsible for us leading a healthy life? Most scholars will argue that governments indeed have a role to play, but that the limits will be reached when public health measures would imply large sacrifices of individual liberty.","publish_time":"2012-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luyten, Jeroen","journal":"Justice, Luck \u0026 Responsibility in Health Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/00dece4550773be4d103f53ed0750a620fa19f88.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7178843.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7178843/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs4MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Wilkinson"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["focus of health policy","public health measures","classic provision of health care","social determinants of health","causal factors of ill-health","public policy responsible","provision of medical care","sphere of individual lives","control","large sacrifices of individual liberty","legitimate role of governments","state\u2019s influence","healthy life","greater extent","different non-medical fields","lifestyle choices","policies","Genetic constitution","socio-economic environment","significant increase","McKeown","Wilkinson","evolution","Mackenbach","well-shown fact","shift","availability of treatment","need of cure","Marmot","flipside","majority","limits","population level","pertinent question","Research","scholars","behaviors"],"language":"en"},

It discusses various characteristics of the families of viruses. Viruses are defined by the sum of the distinctive traits of the virion. These distinctive traits are as follows: (1) presence of a single nucleic acid; (2) incapacity to grow and to divide; (3) reproduction from the genetic material only; (4) absence of enzymes for energy metabolism; (5) absence of ribosomes; (6) absence of information for the production of enzymes in the energy cycle; (7) absence of information for the synthesis of the ribosomal proteins; and (8) absence of information for the synthesis of ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA. The viral infectious particle presents a great diversity in composition and structure. Order could be achieved only through a classification, which is a system of order. The goal of biological classification is to group together organisms presenting certain analogies and certain affinities and, if possible, to also bring out phylogenic relationships. The conceptions relative to the methodology of taxonomy, which is the science of classification, are diverse. A virus may have evolved from a given sector of DNA within the host cell. It could also very well have derived from the corresponding RNA messenger that contains the same information, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Therefore, theoretically, different viruses could have originated from nucleic acids of different but complementary nature. The nucleic acid of viruses is either single- or double-stranded. Viruses, as is generally accepted, derive from the nucleic acid of their host. Thus, RNA viruses could possibly have their origin in the RNA messenger.","publish_time":"2014-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"LWOFF, ANDR\u00C9; TOURNIER, PAUL","journal":"Comparative Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7182114.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7182114/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs4NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA viruses","nucleic acid of viruses","absence of information","different viruses","families of viruses","absence of enzymes","synthesis of ribosomal RNA","single nucleic acid","transfer RNA","absence of ribosomes","corresponding RNA messenger","nucleic acids of different","science of classification","distinctive traits","goal of biological classification","certain affinities","certain analogies","production of enzymes","energy cycle","energy metabolism","ribosomal proteins","host cell","system of order","great diversity","organisms","phanerogram","viral infectious particle","composition","given sector of DNA","cryptogram","remarks","complementary nature","origin","methodology of taxonomy","conceptions relative","structure","various characteristics","chapter","sum","presence","genetic material","reproduction","gymnogram","virion","incapacity","phylogenic relationships"],"language":"en"},

SOURCES: A search was conducted in PubMed, Lilacs, and SciELO databases, between the years 2002 and 2013, using the following descriptors: asthma exacerbation, virus, child, and acute respiratory infection. SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS: A total of 42 original articles addressing the identification of respiratory viruses during episodes of asthma exacerbation were selected, mostly cross\u2010sectional studies. There was a wide variation in the methodology of the assessed studies, particularly in relation to the children\u0027s age and methods of collection and viral detection. The results indicate that, in up to 92.2% of exacerbations, a viral agent was potentially the main triggering factor, and human rhinovirus was the most frequently identified factor. The pattern of viral circulation may have been responsible for the seasonality of exacerbations. The association between viral infections and allergic inflammation appears to be crucial for the clinical and functional uncontrolled asthma, but few studies have evaluated other triggering factors in association with viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses are present in the majority of asthmatic children during episodes of exacerbation. The involved physiopathological mechanisms are yet to be fully established, and the synergism between allergic inflammation and viral infection appears to determine uncontrolled disease. The role of other triggering and protective agents is yet to be clearly determined.","publish_time":"2014-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Costa, Lusmaia D.C.; Costa, Paulo Sucasas; Camargos, Paulo A.M.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ced95ff43794329919b7d92e9aaed7ef1ea1c956.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7185549/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs5MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral detection","viral agent","viral infections","acute viral respiratory tract infection","acute respiratory infection","association","episodes of asthma exacerbation","pattern of viral circulation","identification of respiratory viruses","onset of asthma exacerbations","episodes of exacerbation","functional uncontrolled asthma","prevalent viruses","triggering factors","main triggering factor","allergic inflammation","detection methods","assessed studies","cross\u2010sectional studies","seasonality of exacerbations","methods of collection","uncontrolled disease","identified factor","human rhinovirus","majority of asthmatic children","relation","original articles","children\u0027s age","available literature","SciELO databases","PubMed","Lilacs","total","methodology","preventive","following descriptors","synergism","search","FINDINGS","role","protective agents","CONCLUSIONS","wide variation","involved physiopathological mechanisms","therapeutic aspects","SUMMARY","years","OBJECTIVE","SOURCES","results"],"language":"en"},

Most current and past molecular surveillance studies of animal diseases investigated spatio-temporal and evolutionary dynamics of the viruses in a disjointed analytical framework, ignoring many uncertainties and made joint conclusions from both analytical approaches. Phylodynamic methods offer a uniquely integrated platform capable of inferring complex epidemiological and evolutionary processes from the phylogeny of viruses in populations using a single Bayesian statistical framework. In this study, we reviewed and outlined basic concepts and aspects of phylodynamic methods and attempted to summarize essential components of the methodology in one analytical pipeline to facilitate the proper use of the methods by animal health researchers. Also, we challenged the robustness of the posterior evolutionary parameters, inferred by the commonly used phylodynamic models, using hemagglutinin (HA) and polymerase basic 2 (PB2) segments of the currently circulating human-like H3 swine influenza (SI) viruses isolated in the United States and multiple priors. Subsequently, we compared similarities and differences between the posterior parameters inferred from sequence data using multiple phylodynamic models. Our suggested phylodynamic approach attempts to reduce the impact of its inherent limitations to offer less biased and biologically plausible inferences about the pathogen evolutionary characteristics to properly guide intervention activities. We also pinpointed requirements and challenges for integrating phylodynamic methods in routine animal disease surveillance activities.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alkhamis, Moh A.; Li, Chong; Torremorell, Montserrat","journal":"Front Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/80fbd7407b778e7aa4b5304e62ede135d2e8e59a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7186338.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7186338/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs5NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aspects of phylodynamic methods","multiple phylodynamic models","used phylodynamic models","posterior evolutionary parameters","animal health researchers","suggested phylodynamic approach","evolutionary processes","evolutionary dynamics","endemic animal viral diseases","routine animal disease surveillance activities","past molecular surveillance studies of animal diseases","phylogeny of viruses","pathogen evolutionary characteristics","posterior parameters","disjointed analytical framework","analytical pipeline","human health","analytical approaches","polymerase basic","basic concepts","intervention activities","multiple priors","single Bayesian statistical framework","substantial impacts","spatio-temporal","populations","integrated platform capable","hemagglutinin","sequence data","proper use","plausible inferences","uncertainties","H3 swine influenza","United States","joint conclusions","methodology","segments","essential components","challenges","inherent limitations","PB2","similarities","differences","robustness","requirements","study"],"language":"en"},

We show how these custodians\u2014in our fieldsite, doctors and nurses\u2014experience and engage in institutional work to manage different levels of tension between the value of inclusion and the reality of finite resources, as well as tension between inclusion and the desire for safety.

The primary contribution of our study is to shine light on places of social inclusion as important institutions in democratic society.

To that end, inherited immunodeficiencies that manifest with susceptibility to bacterial, viral, and/or fungal infections have provided fundamental insights into the indispensable contribution of key immune pathways in host defense against various pathogens.

The worldwide economic downturn and slow growth in domestic markets are forcing companies to depend more than ever on overseas trade. SARS emerged in China in November 2002 and has spread to 26 countries. The SARS epidemic has caused the most severe economic crisis in Southeast Asia since the wave of bank failures and currency devaluations that swept the region five years ago. The SARS epidemic has prompted health officials to implement travel advisories and restrictions, in order to defer nonessential travel to regions of Asia with large numbers of SARS cases. They are enforcing quarantine and isolation measures in major cities to try and limit the spread of SARS. The President of the United States has signed an executive order adding SARS to the list of communicable diseases that can be quarantined. A major disruption in China could paralyze just\u2010in\u2010time supply chains and cause an economic crisis for retailers and other businesses worldwide. The SARS epidemic has caused many economists to drastically reduce their economic\u2010growth forecasts for Asia. New infectious diseases, such as SARS, can emerge and easily travel around the globe, infecting less\u2010resilient hosts and mutating because of the influence of viruses and bacteria in their new environment. Health officials are even more concerned about the pandemic disaster that hasn\u2019t happened, but may still. However, the SARS epidemic has created positive economic benefits for some companies.","publish_time":"2004-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Overby, John; Rayburn, Mike; Hammond, Kevin; Wyld, David C.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/68a5df3a2e23bc25c167fd1c9cbb335f73eb2b2f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7147331/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs3NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Southeast Asia","United States","China","Asia"],"keyphrases":["SARS epidemic","spread of SARS","large numbers of SARS cases","severe economic crisis","worldwide economic downturn","positive economic benefits","regions of Asia","Southeast Asia","nonessential travel","travel advisories","health officials","companies","China","New infectious diseases","executive order","slow growth","growth forecasts","major cities","new environment","major disruption","list of communicable diseases","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","wave of bank failures","currency devaluations","international business activities","threat of terrorism","domestic markets","restrictions","influence of viruses","bacteria","quarantine","isolation measures","United States","time supply chains","resilient hosts","Iraq","retailers","businesses","economists","globe","pandemic disaster","war","President","years","overseas trade","countries"],"language":"en"},

Elucidation of their plasticity and adaptability to disease states triggered early efforts to characterize microglial subsets.

Recently, an increasing number of these \u201Cmicroglial signatures\u201D have been reported in various homeostatic and disease contexts. Remarkably, many of these states show similar overlapping microglial gene expression patterns, both in homeostasis and in disease or injury. In this review, we integrate information from these studies, and we propose a unique subset, for which we introduce a core signature, based on our own research and reports from the literature. We describe that this subset is found in development and in normal aging as well as in diverse diseases.

About fifty percent of today\u0027s pharmaceutical drugs are derived from natural origin. Interest in natural products as a source of new drugs is growing due to many factors that will be discussed in this article. Viruses have been resistant to therapy or prophylaxis longer than any other form of life. Currently, there are only few drugs available for the cure of viral diseases including acyclovir which is modeled on a natural product parent. In order to combat viruses which have devastating effects on humans, animals, insects, crop plants, fungi and bacteria, many research efforts have been devoted for the discovery of new antiviral natural products. Recent analysis of the number and sources of antiviral agents reported mainly in the annual reports of medicinal chemistry from 1984 to 1995 indicated that seven out of ten synthetic agents approved by FDA between 1983-1994, are modeled on a natural product parent. It has been estimated that only 5-15% of the approximately 250,000 species of higher plants have been systematically investigated for the presence of bioactive compounds while the potential of the marine environment has barely been tapped. The aim of this review is to provide an overview on the central role of natural products in the discovery and development of new antiviral drugs by displaying 340 structures of plant, marine and microbial origin that show promising in vitro antiviral activity.","publish_time":"2007-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"El Sayed, Khalid A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae54f323e86bb0b491d39e22a31af5011ca25a5f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7147881/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs3NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["natural origin","discovery of new antiviral natural products","natural product parent","source of new drugs","development of new antiviral drugs","central role of natural products","drugs available","major source of drugs","antiviral activity","sources of antiviral agents","percent of today\u0027s pharmaceutical drugs","Viruses","microbial origin","crop plants","marine environment","synthetic agents","species of higher plants","fungi","insects","structures of plant","potential","bacteria","humans","animals","number","cure of viral diseases","effects","overview","acyclovir","annual reports of medicinal chemistry","research efforts","presence of bioactive compounds","prophylaxis","Recent analysis","therapy","ancient times","review","FDA","form of life","aim","order","factors","article"],"language":"en"},

This research project will be concerned with the reproducibility of online experiments, including real-world user feedback. In contrast to previous living lab attempts by the IR community, this project has a stronger focus on making IR systems and corresponding results reproducible.

In this work, we devise a new task of QAC applied on an image for estimating patch (one of the key components of Information Foraging Theory) probabilities for query suggestion. Our work supports query completion by extending a user query prefix (one or two characters) to a complete query utilising a foraging-based probabilistic patch selection model. We present iBERT, to fine-tune the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, which leverages combined textual-image queries for a solution to image QAC by computing probabilities of a large set of image patches. The reflected patch probabilities are used for selection while being agnostic to changing information need or contextual mechanisms. Experimental results show that query auto-completion using both natural language queries and images is more effective than using only language-level queries. Also, our fine-tuned iBERT model allows to efficiently rank patches in the image.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jaiswal, Amit Kumar; Liu, Haiming; Frommholz, Ingo","journal":"Advances in Information Retrieval","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/93f9872eeb0c2daa1e7944045f5f116cc1cb8ce5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148231.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148231/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs4OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Query"],"organizations":["QAC","Information Foraging Theory","BERT (Bidirectional Encoder"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["query completion","image QAC","query suggestion","user query prefix","Query Auto-completion","complete query","user interaction","combined textual-image queries","natural language queries","reflected patch probabilities","language-level queries","probabilistic patch selection model","large set of image patches","computing probabilities","possible automatic suggestion of queries","Existing QAC models","new task of QAC","estimating patch","user\u2019s information need","fine-tuned iBERT model","work","key components of Information Foraging Theory","explicit feature","present iBERT","solution","Transformers","Bidirectional Encoder Representations","images","search engines","characters","Experimental results","contextual mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

Extending from an experiment protocol inspired by the Stern-Gerlach experiment in Quantum Physics, we design a crowd-sourced user study to show violation of the Kolmogorovian probability axioms as a proof of the quantum-like structure, and provide a comparison between a quantum probabilistic model and a Bayesian model for predictions of relevance.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Uprety, Sagar; Tiwari, Prayag; Dehdashti, Shahram; Fell, Lauren; Song, Dawei; Bruza, Peter; Melucci, Massimo","journal":"Advances in Information Retrieval","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/beeedbbbe0237938696bdef02dac4690e3acb1b1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148250.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148250/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs5MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Quantum Cognition","Quantum Physics"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["quantum probabilistic model","Quantum Physics","underlying quantum","structure","field of Quantum Cognition","cognitive science","cognitive systems","cognitive concept","alternative probabilistic model","Bayesian model","modelling users\u2019 cognitive states","Kolmogorovian probability axioms","axioms of classical probability theory","relevance judgement","predictions of relevance","experiment protocol","probabilistic outcomes of certain human decisions","Stern-Gerlach experiment","violation","proof","crowd-sourced user study","large number of studies","information","comparison","paradoxical findings","paper","decision-making","uncertainty"],"language":"en"},

Interactional processes are brought to the centre of analysis. The Dutch Community Sport Coach programme was used as a case to illustrate the usefulness of the approach. Through a one-year organizational ethnography, the article scrutinizes the way in which members of one CSO enact the organization\u2019s service delivery relationship with a municipality. Through a multidimensional perspective on agency, the analysis shows how individual CSO members act as embedded agents that assimilate a public logic into the dominant community logic. It further shows the CSO\u2019s members efforts and struggle to maintain their community logic.

The SBS is a complex spectrum of ill health symptoms, such as mucous membrane irritation, asthma, neurotoxic effects, gastrointestinal disturbance, skin dryness, sensitivity to odours that may appear among occupants in office and public buildings, schools and hospitals. Studies on large office buildings from USA, UK, Sweden, Finland, Japan, Germany, Canada, China, India, Netherlands, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Thailand, substantiate the occurrence of SBS phenomena. The accumulated effects of a multitude of factors, such as the indoor environmental quality, building characteristics, building dampness, and activities of occupants attribute to SBS. A building occupant manifests at least one symptom of SBS, the onset of two or more symptoms at least twice, and rapid resolution of symptoms following moving away from the workstation or building may be defined as having SBS. Based on the peer-reviewed documentation, this chapter elaborates the magnitude of building-related health consequences due to measurable environmental causations, and the size of the population affected. The mechanisms and causative factors of SBS and illnesses include, for example, the oxidative stress resulting from indoor pollutants, VOCs, office work-related stressors, humidification, odours associated with moisture and bioaerosol exposure. Related regulatory standards and strategies for management of SBS and other illnesses are elaborated.","publish_time":"2018-08-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nag, Pranab Kumar","journal":"Office Buildings","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/21f38b1cf86433b4fb6a3560819b662b31418b96.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153445.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153445/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjsxMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SBS","UK"],"locations":["Sweden","Germany","Canada","China","India","Netherlands","Malaysia","Thailand"],"keyphrases":["management of SBS","symptom of SBS","building-related illnesses","magnitude of building","causative factors of SBS","occurrence of SBS phenomena","building occupant manifests","Sick building syndrome","large office buildings","related health consequences","odours","public buildings","office work-related stressors","modern high-rise buildings","Related regulatory standards","indoor environmental quality","rapid resolution of symptoms","complex spectrum of ill health symptoms","neurotoxic effects","indoor pollutants","accumulated effects","multitude of factors","measurable environmental causations","activities of occupants attribute","gastrointestinal disturbance","asthma","VOCs","UK","mucous membrane irritation","skin dryness","India","China","Canada","Germany","Japan","Finland","Sweden","humidification","Malaysia","Netherlands","dampness","sensitivity","characteristics","chapter","strategies","oxidative stress","Taiwan","moisture","size","Thailand","schools","Studies"],"language":"en"},

The following chapters were influenced by theoretical reflections, my life experience and my scientific training on three continents, at the universities of Antananarivo (Madagascar), Paris (France), Z\u00FCrich (Switzerland) and in Mexico ( CISINAH, UAM and UNAM). The influence of these three cultures with very different historical backgrounds explains my progressively broadened understanding of the global development process. The post-colonial experiences in Africa in the 1960s, the violence left behind by the former colonial powers, and the outcome of civil wars, corruption and destruction of irreplaceable ecosystems and species forced me to understand not only the physical functioning of the human body (medicine), but also its psychological behaviour that supports or obstructs a healthy human life (psychology) and avoids environmental destruction ( ecology). My understanding of the links between the human body, the mind and the environment (anthropology) resulted first in an intuitive and later an interdisciplinary approach to these four interrelated circles (body, mind, environment and human relations). Understanding the importance of these four study subjects triggered in me a commitment to responsible scientific and sustainable behaviour towards other human beings, but also to nature.","publish_time":"2020-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oswald Spring, \u00DArsula","journal":"Earth at Risk in the 21st Century: Rethinking Peace, Environment, Gender, and Human, Water, Health, Food, Energy Security, and Migration","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ba27c4d005eaf0796b27a53c7f69ac8a4e5fdb0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153461.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153461/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjsxMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UNAM"],"locations":["France","Z\u00FCrich","Switzerland","Mexico","Africa"],"keyphrases":["human body","human beings","human relations","healthy human life","mind","environmental destruction","broadened understanding","Nature","unsustainable development process","global development process","life experience","sustainable behaviour","scientific training","environmental problems","psychological behaviour","colonial powers","destruction of irreplaceable ecosystems","post-colonial experiences","corruption","commitment","interrelated circles","Mexico","peace","security","theoretical reflections","outcome of civil wars","psychology","different historical backgrounds","CISINAH","Madagascar","cultures","Paris","France","Switzerland","Z\u00FCrich","interdisciplinary approach","Africa","continents","gender","concern","decades","medicine","universities of Antananarivo","physical functioning","Holocene","study subjects","UAM","UNAM","history","following chapters","texts","Anthropocene","Crutzen","species","anthropology"],"language":"en"},

When bacteria invade tissues, they almost inevitably cause some damage, and this is also true for fungi and protozoa. Cell and tissue damage are sometimes due to the direct local action of the microorganism and microbial toxins. They either interfere with the transcription, translation, and DNA synthesis or change the permeability of the cell membrane. Some of the indirect damage brought about by these microbes is through inflammation and immune responses. Host cells are destroyed or blood vessels injured as a direct result of the action of microbes or their toxins. Inflammatory materials are liberated from necrotic cells, whatever the cause of the necrosis. Also many bacteria themselves liberate inflammatory products and certain viruses cause living infected cells to release inflammatory mediators. The expression of the immune response necessarily involves a certain amount of inflammation, cell infiltration, lymph node swelling, even tissue destruction.

The progression of these two events is partially driven by the increasing regulatory demands related to safety/toxicity assessment of novel drug development. The availability of inbred strains has led to major breakthroughs in cancer, biology, and immunology. In addition, outbred stocks continue to be utilized in a wide variety of studies but particularly in the fields of toxicology and pharmacology. The power of these models to elucidate the genetic basis of disease cannot be overemphasized. This provided complete nucleotide sequences for each genome allowing investigators to quickly develop the equivalent murine model for many of the inherited human diseases. Transgenic and knockout mice have helped clarify disease pathogenesis in virtually every area of medicine and often elucidated biochemical pathways, previously unknown, which are now subject to testing and quantification.","publish_time":"2007-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"W.

Monensin blocks the transport of secretory and membrane glycoproteins at the level of the Golgi complex, which appears dilated as an effect of the drug. Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein continues to be transported to the surface of monensin-treated cells, is cleaved into HA(1) and HA(2) and is incorporated into budding influenza virus particles. On the other hand, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein appears to accumulate in the membranes of the dilated Golgi apparatus of monensin-treated cells. This chapter discusses the effects of monensin on the kinetics of transport of viral membrane glycoproteins to the cell surface. It also discusses the effect of the ionophore on the directional transport of viral glycoproteins in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells doubly-infected with influenza virus and VSV and on the replication of viruses that are assembled at intracellular membranes.","publish_time":"2013-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alonso-Caplen, Firelli V.; Matsuoka, Yumiko; Compans, Richard W.","journal":"Segmented Negative Strand Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a1b6f9b5cc62e70d4492ded6772258f6467c7c2c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7158281.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7158281/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs0NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Influenza"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["surface of monensin","effects of monensin","viral membrane glycoproteins","directional transport of viral glycoproteins","kinetics of transport","transport of secretory","treated cells","dilated Golgi apparatus of monensin","Distinct pathways of membrane glycoprotein transport","VSV","cell surface","budding influenza virus particles","Influenza hemagglutinin","vesicular stomatitis virus","Golgi complex","sodium ionophore","intracellular membranes","Madin-Darby canine kidney cells","polarized epithelial cell monolayers","sensitivity","level","hand","replication of viruses","chapter","drug"],"language":"en"},

Studies of green energy trade under the WTO have predominantly focused on the balance between WTO obligations and domestic public policy space for green energy initiatives as a way to address environmental and climate change objectives. This chapter, however, analyses whether there is any flexibility within the current WTO rules, specifically the GATT exceptions, and the interpretations given to them, that permit trade restrictive measures that support national green energy policies with a view of ensuring energy security. Overall, this chapter demonstrates that (i) green energy development has increasingly come to be associated with energy security in the WTO jurisprudence, and (ii) there might be some room for green energy security within the defences under GATT Articles III:8(a), Article XX(a) and (j) and Article XXI. However, these defences have limited applicability and may also have undesirable outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rutherford, Angelica","journal":"Energy Security and Green Energy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7554d884422d1c5ce369501e88a05d24ff835904.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7160463.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7160463/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs2NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WTO","GATT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["green energy security","green energy initiatives","green energy disputes","green energy development","Studies of green energy trade","national green energy policies","WTO obligations","current WTO rules","WTO jurisprudence","chapter","defences","GATT exceptions","GATT Articles","trade restrictive measures","domestic public policy space","way","view","balance","debate","new perspective","flexibility","climate change objectives","applicability","room","undesirable outcomes","interpretations","analyses"],"language":"en"},

A polymerase chain reaction based molecular test is currently the most sensitive diagnostic tool for HPAIV; however, the results must be analyzed in centralized diagnosis systems by a trained individual. This requirement leads to delays in quarantine and isolation. To control the spread of HPAIV, rapid and accurate diagnostics suitable for field testing are needed, and the tests must facilitate a differential diagnosis between HPAIV and low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV), which undergo cleavage specifically by trypsin\u2010 or furin\u2010like proteases, respectively. In this study, a differential avian influenza virus rapid test kit is developed and evaluated in vitro and using clinical specimens from HPAIV H5N1\u2010infected animals. It is demonstrated that this rapid test kit provides highly sensitive and specific detection of HPAIV and LPAIV and is thus a useful field diagnostic tool for H5N1 HPAIV outbreaks and for rapid quarantine control of the disease.","publish_time":"2018-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Hyun\u2010Ouk; Na, Woonsung; Yeom, Minjoo; Choi, Jihye; Kim, Jihye; Lim, Jong\u2010Woo; Yun, Dayeon; Chun, Haejin; Park, Geunseon; Park, Chaewon; Kim, Jeong\u2010Ki; Jeong, Dae Gwin; Le, Van Phan; Lee, Kwangyeol; Lee, Jae Myun; Jeong, Hyoung Hwa; Song, Daesub; Haam, Seungjoo","journal":"Adv Funct Mater","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7161833.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161833/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs3Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HPAIV H5N1","spread of HPAIV","H5N1 HPAIV outbreaks","specific detection of HPAIV","differential avian influenza virus rapid test kit","rapid quarantine control","low pathogenic avian influenza virus","differential diagnosis","LPAIV","molecular test","sensitive diagnostic tool","useful field diagnostic tool","field testing","centralized diagnosis systems","accurate diagnostics suitable","clinical specimens","infected animals","trained individual","polymerase chain reaction","study","infections","humans","trypsin","furin","delays","cleavage","tests","results","disease","species barrier","fatalities","proteases","requirement","isolation"],"language":"en"},

The effects of financial market weakness and the disruption to daily life around the world will trigger lower consumer spending and investment on top of the disruptions to the global supply chain. We now expect global GDP growth to slow to 2.0% this year from 2.6% in 2019, before picking up to 3.0% in 2021. But a global pandemic would lead to a far bigger slowdown this year. \u2580 China seems to have made progress in containing the spread of the coronavirus, but the slow return to business as normal has prompted us to cut year\u2010on\u2010year GDP growth in Q1 from 3.8% to 2.3%, the weakest in decades. But we expect a healthy growth rebound in Q2 which will also provide Asian economies with a lift. \u2580 It is isolation policies not infection rates that determine the economic impact. Outbreaks around the world are leading authorities to announce a growing list of measures to curb the virus spread. At a global level any Q2 rebound will thus be small at best. We expect investment in the advanced economies as a whole to contract on a year\u2010on\u2010year basis in Q2 for the first time since the global financial crisis, while annual household spending growth may slow to its lowest since the eurozone crisis. \u2580 Our baseline assumes that the global economy will return to business as usual in Q3 and that some catch\u2010up will result in robust H2 GDP growth. Combined with favourable base effects in early\u20102021, this is expected to result in world GDP growth averaging about 3% in 2021. \u2580 Since January, we have cut our 2020 global GDP growth forecast by a hefty 0.5pp. But larger revisions may be required if the disruption triggered by shutdowns and other responses to coronavirus proves longer than we assume currently or if more draconian actions are needed in the event of a global pandemic. Our scenarios suggest that the latter could push the global economy into a deep recession.","publish_time":"2020-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163562/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs4MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["year GDP growth","global GDP growth forecast","global economy","global pandemic","global level","global financial crisis","world GDP growth averaging","global supply chain","robust H2 GDP growth","year basis","healthy growth rebound","annual household spending growth","Q2 rebound","slow return","business","investment","coronavirus spreads","China","effects of financial market weakness","eurozone crisis","Asian economies","supply shock","advanced economies","lower consumer spending","favourable base effects","infection rates","leading authorities","daily life","time","growing list of measures","event","disruptions","isolation policies","economic impact","Overview","Outlook","Outbreaks","shutdowns","responses","deep recession","Q1","bigger slowdown","draconian actions","lift","Q3","best","progress","baseline","larger revisions","weakest","decades","scenarios"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the rapid scoring system on admission of these patients. METHODS 138 medical records of critical ill patients with COVID-19 were included in the study. Demographic and clinical characteristics on admission used for calculating Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) and Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (REMS) and outcomes (survival or death) were collected for each case and extracted for analysis. All patients were divided into two age subgroups (\u003C65 and \u226565years). The receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were performed for overall patients and both subgroups. RESULTS The median [25%quartile, 75%quartile] of MEWS of survivors versus non-survivors were 1[1, 2] and 2[1, 3] and that of REMS were 5[2, 6] and 7[6, 10], respectively. In overall analysis, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the REMS in predicting mortality was 0.833 (95% CI: 0.737-0.928), higher than that of MEWS (0.677, 95% CI 0.541-0.813). An optimal cut-off of REMS (\u22656) had a sensitivity of 89.5%, a specificity of 69.8%, a positive predictive value of 39.5%, and a negative predictive value of 96.8%. In the analysis of subgroup of patients aged\u003C65years, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the REMS in predicting mortality was 0.863 (95% CI: 0.743-0.941), higher than that of MEWS (0.603, 95% CI 0.462-0.732). CONCLUSION To our knowledge, this study was the first exploration on rapid scoring systems for critical ill patients with COVID-19. The REMS could provide emergency clinicians with an effective adjunct risk stratification tool for critical ill patients with COVID-19, especially for the patients aged\u003C65 years. The effectiveness of REMS for screening these patients is attributed to its high negative predictive value.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Hai; Yao, Ni; Qiu, Yanru","journal":"Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/acem.13992; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32311790/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OBJECTIVES Rapid","Rapid Emergency Medicine Score","REMS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["overall patients","medical records of critical ill patients","COVID","effectiveness of REMS","receiver","MEWS of survivors","optimal cut-off of REMS","study","years","OBJECTIVES Rapid","overall analysis","rapid scoring systems","characteristic curve analyses","Rapid Emergency Medicine Score","positive predictive value","high negative predictive value","admission","area","predicting mortality","quartile","analysis of subgroup","emergency clinicians","Modified Early Warning Score","early severity","non-survivors","age subgroups","effective adjunct risk stratification tool","novel coronavirus disease","outcomes","exploration","illness assessment","METHODS","performance","clinical characteristics","death","survival","specificity","CONCLUSION","knowledge","case","sensitivity","median"],"language":"en"},

Unfortunately, there are no specific drugs available to cure this disease. Type 2 taste receptors (TAS2Rs) may play an important role in host defense mechanisms. Based on the idea of host-directed therapy (HDT), we performed a negative co-expression analysis using big data of 60 000 Affymetrix expression arrays and 5000 TCGA data sets to determine the functions of TAS2R10, which can be activated by numerous bitter substances. Excitingly, we found that the main functions of TAS2R10 involved controlling infectious diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites, suggesting that TAS2R10 is a key trigger of host defense pathways. To quickly guide the clinical treatment of 2019-nCoV, we searched currently available drugs that are agonists of TAS2Rs. We identified many cheap, available, and safe medicines, such as diphenidol, quinine, chloroquine, artemisinin, chlorpheniramine, yohimbine, and dextromethorphan, which may target the most common symptoms caused by 2019-nCoV.

Mitigation strategies include personal protective measures (e.g., handwashing, cough etiquette, and face coverings) that persons can use at home or while in community settings; social distancing (e.g., maintaining physical distance between persons in community settings and staying at home); and environmental surface cleaning at home and in community settings, such as schools or workplaces. Actions such as social distancing are especially critical when medical countermeasures such as vaccines or therapeutics are not available. Although voluntary adoption of social distancing by the public and community organizations is possible, public policy can enhance implementation. The CDC Community Mitigation Framework (1) recommends a phased approach to implementation at the community level, as evidence of community spread of disease increases or begins to decrease and according to severity.

In this review, we comprehensively investigate the various aspects of cancer care during the pandemic, taking advantage of data generated in Asia and Europe at the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic spread. Cancer wards have been subjected to several modifications to protect patients and healthcare professionals from COVID-19 infection, while attempting to maintain cancer diagnosis, therapy, and research. In this setting, the management of COVID-19 infected patients with cancer is particularly challenging.

We use an in-house numerical code to solve the governing transport equations for the velocities and flow rates in a rotating channel subjected to an applied external electric field. We show the strong effect of polyelectrolyte layer on the flow behaviour and find an increase in flow rate as we increase the size of the polyelectrolyte layer. We also show that rheology strongly influences the interplay of the Coriolis forces due to rotation and electrical body force due to the applied electric field. We show that the velocities are generally higher for shear thinning fluids as compared to shear thickening fluids. We also show that presence of polymer brushes in the polyelectrolyte layer creates a drag on the fluid which reduces velocities. We also show that the flow rates are strongly altered by the effect of rotation and that shear thickening fluids have lower flow rates than shear thinning fluids. The effect of fluid rheology on the shear stress distribution is also discussed. We believe that studying effect of fluid rheology becomes very important for designing soft channel based Lab-on-CD systems driven by electroosmotic forcing and dealing with rheologically complex bio-fluids such as blood, saliva or mucus.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patel, Maneesh; Harish Kruthiventi, S S; Kaushik, P","journal":"Colloids and surfaces.

The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between adenovirus infection and KD using a cohort study in Taiwan. METHODS We used Taiwan National Health Insurance data (from 2000 to 2008) to conduct a population-based cohort study, analyzing children that was under 18 years of age. In total, 5,280 children had adenovirus infection, and 5,280 children without adenovirus infection were matched and followed up. Subsequent KD was the major outcome event. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of developing KD associated with adenovirus infection. RESULTS There was a significantly higher cumulative incidence of KD in the adenovirus-infected cohort than that in the non-infected cohort (log-rank test, p \u003C 0.001). In the adenovirus-infected cohort, overall incidence of KD was 5.29 times higher than that of the non-infected cohort (adjusted HR 5.29, 95% CI: 2.48-11.3). Increased KD risk was associated with previous adenovirus infection in children aged 3 to 5 years, in female patients, in those with a low urbanization level, and in those with allergies.

There is no consensus on the optimal value, below which there is a higher chance of wound complications in patients undergoing free flap breast reconstruction. METHODS Patients undergoing free flap breast reconstruction from 2015 to 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who returned to the operating room for a revision of the anastomosis were excluded from analysis. Patients were divided in two groups based on the development of late complications. Those were defined as fat necrosis, wound dehiscence, or distal flap ischemia/necrosis that developed after discharge from the hospital. Mean percutaneous oximetry readings of the first 24 hours were recorded and the mean change from the initial reading was calculated. The correlation between tissue oximetry change and development of complications was explored. RESULTS A total of 120 patients were identified. The mean age was 53, while the mean body mass index was 33. A total of 38 patients developed late wound complication. History of smoking, diabetes mellitus, neoadjuvant radiation therapy, and the mean change of the tissue oximetry reading were identified as independent predictors of wound complications. The absolute number of the tissue oximetry reading did not predict late complications. A multivariate analysis revealed that patients who experienced a mean decrease \u003C 15% from the initial reading during the first 24 hours were significantly more likely to develop late flap-related wound complications. CONCLUSION In patients undergoing free tissue breast reconstruction, tissue oximetry readings do not predict late wound complications.

The risk factors for death were attributed to advanced age and co-morbidities, but haven\u0027t been accurately defined. OBJECTIVES To report the clinical features of 85 fatal cases with COVID-19 in two hospitals in Wuhan. METHOD Medical records of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19 between January 9 and February 15, 2020 were collected. Information recorded included medical history, exposure history, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory findings, CT scans and clinical management. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The median age of the patients was 65.8 years and 72.9% were male. Common symptoms were fever (78 [91.8%]), shortness of breath (50 [58.8%]), fatigue (50 [58.8%]), dyspnea (60 [70.6%]). Hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart disease were the most common comorbidities. Notably, 81.2% patients had very low eosinophil counts at admission. Complications included respiratory failure (80 [94.1%]), shock (69 [81.2%]), ARDS (63 [74.1%]), arrhythmia (51 [60%]), etc. Most patients received antibiotic (77 [90.6%]), antiviral (78 [91.8%]) and glucocorticoids (65 [76.5%]) treatments. 38 patients [44.7%] and 33 [38.8%] received intravenous immunoglobulin and interferon \u03B12b respectively. CONCLUSIONS In this depictive study of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19, most cases were male aged over 50 years old with noncommunicable chronic diseases. The majority of the patients died of multiple organ failure. Early onset of shortness of breath may be used as an observational symptom for COVID-19 exacerbations. Eosinophilopenia may indicate a poor prognosis. The combination of anti-microbial drugs did not offer considerable benefit to the outcome of this group of patients.

In addition to well-known tandem duplication, duplication can occur such that a duplicated DNA fragment is inserted at another location in the genome. Here, we report several genomic regions in the human genome that could be best explained by two types of insertion-based duplication mechanisms, where a duplicated DNA fragment was modified structurally and then inserted into the genome. In one process, the DNA fragment is turned into an extrachromosomal circular DNA, cut somewhere in the circle, and reintegrated into another location in the genome. And in the other, the DNA fragment forms a \u0022lariat structure\u0022 with a \u0022knot\u0022, the strand is swapped at the knot, and is then reintegrated into the genome. Our results suggest that insertion-based duplication may not be a simple process; it may involve a complicated procedures such as structural modification before reintegration.

Since then, COVID-19 has become a global concern and health problem. METHODS We present four patients in this study, selected from among patients who presented with pneumonia symptoms and were suspicious for COVID-19. They were referred to the intended centers for COVID-19 diagnosis and management of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in southern Iran. Two nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal throat swab samples were collected from each patient and tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using real-time reverse-transcriptase- polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR). The samples were also tested for influenza viruses and the complete respiratory panel. RESULTS In the present report, four patients were diagnosed in the starting days of COVID-19 disease in our center in southern Iran with co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus. CONCLUSION This co-infection of COVID-19 and influenza A highlights the importance of considering SARS-CoV-2 PCR assay regardless of other positive findings for other pathogens in the primary test during the epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khodamoradi, Zohre; Moghadami, Mohsen; Lotfi, Mehrzad","journal":"Archives of Iranian medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.34172/aim.2020.04; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32271596/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsyODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Shiraz University of Medical Sciences"],"locations":["China","southern Iran"],"keyphrases":["co-infection of COVID","SARS-CoV","patients","starting days of COVID","co-infection of SARS","southern Iran","coronavirus disease","influenza viruses","PCR assay","RT-PCR","viral pneumonia","pneumonia symptoms","present report","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","complete respiratory panel","oropharyngeal throat swab samples","management of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences","polymerase-chain","diagnosis","reaction","real-time reverse-transcriptase","positive findings","pathogens","primary test","global concern","health problem","intended centers","CONCLUSION","importance","epidemic","RESULTS","study","BACKGROUND","METHODS","China","world"],"language":"en"},

This study determined whether combining bevacizumab (Bmab) with TAS-102 improves clinical outcomes in refractory mCRC. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed data from Japanese patients with refractory mCRC who received TAS-102 (35 mg/m2 , twice a day) with (T-B group) or without Bmab (TAS-102 monotherapy; T group) between July 2014 and December 2018. The primary endpoint was median overall survival (OS), and secondary endpoints were median time to treatment failure, overall response rate, and the incidence of adverse events. Clinical outcomes were compared using propensity score matched analysis. RESULTS Data from 57 patients were analyzed (T-B group: 21 patients, T group: 36 patients). Median OS was significantly longer in the T-B group than the T group (14.4 months vs. 4.5 months, p \u003C .001). Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that combination therapy with Bmab was significantly correlated with OS. Propensity score matched analysis confirmed that the median OS was significantly longer in the T-B group than the T group (14.4 months vs. 6.1 months, p = .006) and that there was a significant correlation between Bmab and OS. The incidence of hypertension (grade \u22652) as an adverse event was significantly higher in the T-B group than the T group (23.8% vs. 0.0%, p = .005), whereas other adverse events were comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSION Treatment with Bmab in combination with TAS-102 is significantly associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with mCRC refractory to standard therapies. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Combining bevacizumab (Bmab) with TAS-102 significantly improved overall survival and several prognostic indicators in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) refractory to standard therapies, with manageable toxicities. Treatment with Bmab in combination with TAS-102 is significantly associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with mCRC.","publish_time":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fujii, Hironori; Matsuhashi, Nobuhisa; Kitahora, Mika; Takahashi, Takao; Hirose, Chiemi; Iihara, Hirotoshi; Yamada, Yunami; Watanabe, Daichi; Ishihara, Takuma; Suzuki, Akio; Yoshida, Kazuhiro","journal":"The oncologist","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1634/theoncologist.2019-0541; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32162797/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjszMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T group","T-B group","Bmab","refractory mCRC","mCRC refractory","Japanese patients","Median OS","months","OBJECTIVE TAS","improved clinical outcomes","median overall survival","median time","matched analysis","incidence of adverse events","metastatic colorectal cancer","treatment failure","standard therapies","CONCLUSION Treatment","combination therapy","bevacizumab","propensity","overall response rate","Cox proportional hazard analysis","RESULTS Data","incidence of hypertension","prognostic indicators","secondary endpoints","primary endpoint","monotherapy","manageable toxicities","grade","IMPLICATIONS","PRACTICE","METHODS","significant correlation","day","groups","study","m2"],"language":"en"},

Exposure to dromedary camels (Camelus dromedaries) has been consistently considered the main source of primary human infection. Although Saudi Arabia reports the highest rate of human MERS-CoV infection and has one of the largest populations of dromedary camels worldwide, their spatial association has not yet been investigated. Thus, this study aimed to examine the correlation between the spatial distribution of primary MERS-CoV cases with or without a history of camel exposure reported between 2012 and 2019 and dromedary camels at the provincial level in Saudi Arabia. In most provinces, a high proportion of older men develop infections after exposure to camels. Primary human infections during spring and winter were highest in provinces characterized by seasonal breeding and calving, increased camel mobilization and camel-human interactions. A strong and significant association was found between the total number of dromedary camels and the numbers of primary camel-exposed and non-exposed MERS-CoV cases. Furthermore, spatial correlations between MERS-CoV cases and camel sex, age and dairy status were significant. Via a cluster analysis, we identified Riyadh, Makkah and Eastern provinces as having the most primary MERS-CoV cases and the highest number of camels. Transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to humans occurs in most primary cases, but there is still a high proportion of primary infections with an ambiguous link to camels. The results from this study include significant correlations between primary MERS-CoV cases and camel populations in all provinces, regardless of camel exposure history. This supports the hypothesis of the role of an asymptomatic human carrier or, less likely, an unknown animal host that has direct contact with both infected camels and humans. In this study, we performed a preliminary risk assessment of prioritization measures to control the transmission of infection from camels to humans.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Ahmadi, Khalid; Alahmadi, Mohammed; Al-Zahrani, Ali","journal":"Zoonoses and public health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/zph.12697; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32112508/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjszMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["primary cases","spatial distribution of primary MERS-CoV cases","infected camels","numbers of primary camel","Primary human infections","non-exposed MERS-CoV cases","Transmission of MERS","highest number of camels","highest rate of human MERS-CoV infection","camel populations","camel-human interactions","history of camel exposure","camel exposure history","total number of dromedary camels","largest populations of dromedary camels","camel sex","high proportion of primary infections","main source of primary human infection","increased camel mobilization","humans","study","Eastern provinces","significant correlations","spatial correlations","transmission of infection","significant association","spatial association","asymptomatic human carrier","Saudi Arabia","high proportion of older men","calving","age","direct contact","seasonal breeding","spring","winter","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","unknown animal host","preliminary risk assessment of prioritization measures","Riyadh","dairy status","provincial level","ambiguous link","Makkah","role","Camelus dromedaries","emerging zoonotic disease","results","cluster analysis","hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

METHODS The H/R injury involved hypoxia for 3 h and then reperfusion for 2 h. Cardiomyocytes recruited from neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) were randomly divided into control, H/R, H/R\u002Bcompound C (C.C), H/R\u002BPQS, and H/R\u002BC. C\u002BPQS groups. BrdU assay, lactase dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage and early apoptosis rate were evaluated to assess cell damages. Contents of high energy phosphate compounds were conducted to detect the energy production. Protein expression levels of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase a (AMPK\u03B1), glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), phosphate fructose kinase 2 (PFK2), fatty acid translocase/cluster of differentiation 36 (FAT/CD36), and acetyl CoA carboxylase 2 (ACC2) in the regulatory pathways were measured by Western blotting. Immunofluorescence staining of GLUT4 and FAT/CD36 was used to observe the mobilization of metabolic transporters. RESULTS PQS (50 mg/L) pretreatment significantly alleviated H/R-induced inhibition of NRVMs viability, up-regulation of LDH leakage, acceleration of early apoptosis, and reduction of energy production (P\u003C0.05). Compared with the H/R group, up-regulated expression of AMPK\u03B1, GLUT4, PFK2, FAT/CD36 and ACC2 were observed, and more GLUT4 and FAT/CD36 expressions were detected on the membrane in the H/R\u002BPQS group (P\u003C0.05).

CONCLUSION PQS has prominent advantages in protecting NRVMs from H/R-induced cell damages and energy metabolic disorders, by activation of AMPK\u03B1-mediated GLUT4-PFK2 and FAT/CD36-ACC2 pathways.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Yong-Hui; Zhang, Pei; Wang, Cheng-Long; Liu, Jian-Gang; Li, Peng; Zhang, Da-Wu","journal":"Chinese journal of integrative medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11655-020-3194-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418176/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjszNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["h.

Since the research under the public health emergency is different from that carried out in familiar situations to design and implementation, the strategy for a satisfactory ERC response should balance the duty of protecting individual participants as well as the special public needs derived from the disease control. It is suggested that the ethical review-related regulations need to be updated, and a unified supervision system to the overall ERC is required. ERC collaboration, capacity-improving and efficiency-improving measures need to be taken. With respect to the reviewing guidelines, it is suggested that the international norms should be explained with more consideration of the local condition and the exceptional circumstances in this public health emergency.

Morbidity and mortality caused by this virus are alarming for the possible increased threat to human health. A Suitable diagnostic test is the prerequisite for designing and developing control measures. But, the tests being employed at present possess one or the other drawback for this disease diagnosis. During the dengue virus infections, NS2B is essential for the stability and catalytic activity of the NS3 protease. N-terminal 185 amino acids of NS3 protease domain along with hydrophilic portion of NS2B (NS2BNS3pro) is being used to screen dengue inhibitors but not for diagnosis until now. In the present study, we have used purified NS2BNS3pro as an antigen to trap anti-NS2BNS3pro antibodies of the clinical samples. Antibodies were detected successfully in both western blotting and ELISA tests. In ELISA, antibodies were detected in both primary and secondary infections of all serotypes. Interestingly, 17 samples declared as other febrile infections by NS1 and IgM/IgG tests were found to be positive in present test, which were further confirmed by RT-PCR. In silico studies suggested the absence of conserved epitopes between NS2BNS3pro and the counterpart in JEV, Zika, and CHIKV, indicating less possibility of crossreaction, which was in turn confirmed by using synthetic peptides representing the above epitopes. Statistical analysis with 76% specificity, 87% sensitivity, and 95% concordance also supported the present test as a suitable test for large scale diagnosis of dengue virus infections.

Severe bilateral pneumonia is the main feature of severe COVID-19, and adequate ventilatory support is crucial for patient survival. Although our knowledge of the disease is still rapidly increasing, this review summarizes current guidance on the best provision of ventilatory support, with a focus on resource-limited settings. Key messages include that supplemental oxygen is a first essential step for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients with hypoxemia and should be a primary focus in resource-limited settings where capacity for invasive ventilation is limited. Oxygen delivery can be increased by using a non-rebreathing mask and prone positioning. The presence of only hypoxemia should in general not trigger intubation because hypoxemia is often remarkably well tolerated. Patients with fatigue and at risk for exhaustion, because of respiratory distress, will require invasive ventilation. In these patients, lung protective ventilation is essential. Severe pneumonia in COVID-19 differs in some important aspects from other causes of severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, and limiting the positive end-expiratory pressure level on the ventilator may be important. This ventilation strategy might reduce the currently very high case fatality rate of more than 50% in invasively ventilated COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dondorp, Arjen M; Hayat, Muhammad; Aryal, Diptesh; Beane, Abi; Schultz, Marcus J","journal":"The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-0283; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32319424/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs0MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","treatment of severe COVID","causes of severe pneumonia","Severe bilateral pneumonia","main feature of severe COVID","resource-limited settings","ventilated COVID","hypoxemia","invasive ventilation","ventilation strategy","resource-limited health facilities","lung protective ventilation","adequate ventilatory support","acute respiratory distress syndrome","best provision of ventilatory support","essential step","primary focus","supplemental oxygen","important aspects","Oxygen delivery","ongoing novel coronavirus disease","countries","positive end-expiratory pressure level","pandemic","risk","capacity","current guidance","patient survival","global human population","non-rebreathing mask","prone positioning","exhaustion","high case fatality rate","review","Key messages","fatigue","intubation","presence","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

We assessed whether an ultrasound-assisted technique could reduce the number of needle passes required for block success compared with the landmark-guided technique in patients with abnormal spinal anatomy. METHODS Forty-four patients with abnormal spinal anatomy including documented lumbar scoliosis and previous spinal surgery were randomized to receive either surface landmark-guided or preprocedural ultrasound-assisted spinal anesthesia. All spinal procedures were performed by 1 of 3 experienced anesthesiologists. The primary outcome was the number of needle passes required for successful dural puncture. Secondary outcomes included the success rate on the first pass, total procedure time, periprocedural pain scores, and the incidences of radicular pain, paresthesia, and bloody tap during the neuraxial procedure. Intergroup difference in the primary outcome was assessed for significance using Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS The median (interquartile range [IQR; range]) number of needle passes was significantly lower in the ultrasound group than in the landmark group (ultrasound 1.5 [1-3 {1-5}]; landmark 6 [2-9.3 {1-15}]; P \u003C .001). First-pass success was achieved in 11 (50.0%) and 2 (9.1%) patients in the ultrasound and landmark groups, respectively (P = .007). The total procedure time, defined as the sum of the time for identifying landmarks and performing spinal anesthesia, did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (ultrasound 141 seconds [115-181 seconds {101-336 seconds}]; landmark 146 seconds [90-295 seconds {53-404 seconds}]; P = .888). The ultrasound group showed lower periprocedural pain scores compared with the landmark group (ultrasound 3.5 [1-5 {0-7}]; landmark 5.5 [3-8 {0-9}]; P = .012). The incidences of complications during the procedure showed no significant differences between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS For anesthesiologists with experience in neuraxial ultrasonography, the use of ultrasound significantly reduces the technical difficulties of spinal anesthesia in patients with abnormal spinal anatomy compared with the landmark-guided technique. Our results can lead to practical suggestions that encourage the use of neuraxial ultrasonography for spinal anesthesia in such patients.","publish_time":"2019-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Sun-Kyung; Bae, Jinyoung; Yoo, Seokha; Kim, Won Ho; Lim, Young-Jin; Bahk, Jae-Hyon; Kim, Jin-Tae","journal":"Anesthesia and analgesia","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000004600; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31880632/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs0MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ultrasound group","landmark groups","patients","seconds","spinal procedures","use of ultrasound","abnormal spinal anatomy","BACKGROUND Spinal anesthesia","surface landmark-guided technique","preprocedural ultrasound","technical difficulties of spinal anesthesia","previous spinal surgery","neuraxial procedure","number of needle passes","total procedure time","use of neuraxial ultrasonography","lower periprocedural pain scores","incidences of radicular pain","primary outcome","success rate","block success","results","lumbar spine","interquartile range","incidences of complications","experienced anesthesiologists","documented lumbar scoliosis","significance","bloody tap","paresthesia","IQR","Mann-Whitney U test","successful dural puncture","anatomical alterations","sum","landmarks","METHODS","practical suggestions","significant differences","median","Secondary outcomes","Intergroup difference","CONCLUSIONS","populations"],"language":"en"},

Its impact on pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine profiles, bacterial/viral infections, and the modulation of associated pro-inflammatory transcriptional and signaling pathways is discussed. Moreover, GSK3 contributes to the resolution of inflammation on multiple levels, e.g., via the regulation of pro-resolving mediators, the clearance of apoptotic immune cells, and tissue repair processes. The influence of GSK3 on the development of different forms of stimulation tolerance is also addressed.

The aim of the present study was to monitor perfusion in a Hewes flap during reconstruction, which to the best of our knowledge, has not previously been done. Methods A Hewes tarsoconjunctival eyelid flap was raised and the effects on blood perfusion of rotating the flaps by 90\u00B0 and 180\u00B0, stretching the flaps with a force of 5 or 10 N, and repeated diathermic coagulation was monitored with laser speckle contrast imaging. Results Rotating the flaps by 90\u00B0 did not significantly affect perfusion, while further rotation to 180\u00B0 reduced blood perfusion to 75% of the baseline value. When the tarsoconjunctival flaps were both rotated 90\u00B0 and stretched with 5 N, the perfusion was reduced even further, to 63%. A further reduction in perfusion, to 36%, was seen when the higher force of 10 N was applied. Diathermy decreased blood perfusion to 56% after being applied once. Successive applications led to further decreases: 43%, 31%, and 15%, after the second, third and fourth applications. Conclusions Perfusion in Hewes tarsoconjunctival flaps is affected by both rotation and stretching, but some perfusion is maintained despite these manipulations. Diathermy, however, has detrimental effects and should be avoided.","publish_time":"2018-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ansson, Cu Dinh; Sheikh, Rafi; Dahlstrand, Ulf; Hult, Jenny; Lindstedt, Sandra; Malmsj\u00F6, Malin","journal":"JPRAS open","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpra.2018.07.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32158843/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs0NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Conclusions Perfusion","reduced blood perfusion","Hewes tarsoconjunctival flaps","Hewes tarsoconjunctival eyelid flap","Background Hewes flap","lower eyelid","rotation","Diathermy","lateral defects","detrimental effects","higher force","Successive applications","lateral canthal tendon","repeated diathermic coagulation","laser speckle contrast imaging","following tumor surgery","reconstruction","Methods","present study","best","aim","decreases","baseline value","knowledge","Results","reduction","manipulations"],"language":"en"},

Diagnosis was confirmed either by DENV-specific real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), or non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antigen or enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests; a case fatality rate of 0.4% (10/3994) was observed. The prevalence rate of dengue fever (DF) varied from 27.5 to 453.9 cases per 100,000 population among febrile patients who sought medical attention annually. DF cases occurred throughout the year with low level of transmission observed during the dry season (December to June), then increased transmission during rainy season (July to November) peaking in October. Three major dengue epidemics occurred in Barbados during 2010, 2013 and possibly 2016 with an emerging three-year interval. DF prevalence rate among febrile patients who sought medical attention overall was highest among the 10-19 years old age group. The highest DF hospitalisation prevalence rate was observed in 2013. Multiple serotypes circulated during the study period and Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) was the most prevalent serotype during 2010, whilst DENV-1 was the most prevalent serotype in 2013. Two DENV-1 strains from the 2013 DENV epidemic were genetically more closely related to South East Asian strains, than Caribbean or South American strains, and represent the first ever sequencing of DENV strains in Barbados. However, the small sample size (n = 2) limits any meaningful conclusions. DF prevalence rates were not significantly different between females and males. Public health planning should consider DENV inter-epidemic periodicity, the current COVID-19 pandemic and similar clinical symptomology between DF and COVID-19.

Obese patients routinely undergo preoperative esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) before bariatric procedures. We aimed to assess the prevalence of BE in this patient population. METHODS We conducted a comprehensive literature search ending in March 2019. Search results were imported into covidence.org and screened by two independent reviewers. Heterogeneity was assessed using I 2 and Q statistics and publication bias using funnel plots and the Orwin fail-safe test. Random-effects modeling was used in all analyses. RESULTS : Of 4087 citations, 77 were reviewed in full text and 29 were included in the final analysis based on our predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. A total of 13 434 patients underwent pre-bariatric surgery EGD. The pooled prevalence of BE using random-effects modeling was 0.9 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.7 % - 1.3 %); P \u003C 0.001; I 2 = 58 %, Q = 67). In meta-regression analyses, controlling for sex and GERD, we found a positive association between mean body mass index (BMI) and the prevalence of BE (\u03B2 = 0.15 [95 %CI 0.02 - 0.28]; P = 0.03). A linear relationship between the prevalence of BE and the prevalence of GERD was also noted (\u03B2 = 3.9 [95 %CI 0.4 - 7.5]; P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS : Obesity has been postulated as a major risk factor for BE, yet we found that the prevalence of BE in morbidly obese patients undergoing preoperative EGD was very low. Therefore, obesity alone may not be a major risk factor for BE.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qumseya, Bashar; Gendy, Sheri; Wallace, Alexander; Yang, Dennis; Estores, Davis; Ayzengart, Alexander; Draganov, Peter V","journal":"Endoscopy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1145-3500; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32325514/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Barrett"],"organizations":["INTRODUCTION Obesity","covidence.org","GERD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prevalence of GERD","pooled prevalence","major risk factor","preoperative EGD","Obese patients","known risk factor","Random-effects modeling","INTRODUCTION Obesity","Search results","pre-bariatric surgery EGD","preoperative esophagogastroduodenoscopy","bariatric procedures","Q statistics","meta-regression analyses","comprehensive literature search","funnel plots","gastroesophageal reflux disease","mean body mass index","positive association","publication bias","predetermined inclusion","BMI","Orwin fail-safe test","Barrett\u0027s esophagus","sex","final analysis","exclusion criteria","METHODS","total","esophageal adenocarcinoma","EAC","confidence interval","patient population","linear relationship","independent reviewers","citations","CONCLUSIONS","Heterogeneity","text"],"language":"en"},

Digital transformation is occurring in hospital practice and it is essential to implement effective, evidence-based strategies for these medications in an electronic medical record (EMR). OBJECTIVE To systematically appraise the literature to determine which EMR interventions have improved the safety and quality of therapeutic anticoagulation in an inpatient hospital setting. METHODS PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and the International Pharmaceutical Database were searched for suitable publications. Articles that met eligibility criteria up to September 2018 were included. The review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018104899). The web-based software platform Covidence\u00AE was used for screening and data extraction. Studies were grouped according to the type of intervention and the outcomes measured. Where relevant, a bias assessment was performed. RESULTS We found 2624 candidate articles and 27 met inclusion criteria. They included 3 randomised controlled trials, 4 cohort studies and 20 pre/post observational studies. There were four major interventions; computerised physician order entry (CPOE) (n = 4 studies), clinical decision support system (CDSS) methods (n = 21), dashboard utilisation (n = 1) and EMR implementation in general (n = 1). Seven outcomes were used to summarise the study results. Most research focused on prescribing or documentation compliance (n = 18). The remaining study outcome measures were: medication errors (n = 9), adverse drug events (n = 5), patient outcomes (morbidity/mortality/length of hospital stay/re-hospitalisation) (n = 5), quality use of anticoagulant (n = 4), end-user acceptance (n = 4), cost effectiveness (n = 1). CONCLUSION Despite the research cited, limited benefits have been demonstrated to date. It appears healthcare organisations are yet to determine optimal, evidence-based-methods to improve EMR utilisation. Further evaluation, collaboration and work are necessary to measure and leverage the potential benefits of digital health systems. Most research evaluating therapeutic anticoagulation management within an EMR focused on prescribing or documentation compliance, with less focus on clinical impact to the patient or cost effectiveness. Evidence suggests that CPOE in conjunction with CDSS is needed to effectively manage therapeutic anticoagulation. Targets for robust research include the integration of \u0027stealth\u0027 alerts, nomograms into digital systems and the use of dashboards within clinical practice.","publish_time":"2019-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Austin, Jodie; Barras, Michael; Sullivan, Clair","journal":"International journal of medical informatics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2019.104066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31923817/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Digital","EMR","International Pharmaceutical Database","CPOE","CDSS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EMR interventions","EMR utilisation","EMR implementation","patient outcomes","quality of therapeutic anticoagulation","digital systems","clinical practice","cohort studies","hospital practice","observational studies","robust research","therapeutic anticoagulation management","evidence-based strategies","length of hospital","clinical impact","CPOE","CDSS","potential benefits of digital health systems","documentation compliance","Digital transformation","prescribing","METHODS PubMed","cost effectiveness","study results","significant patient harm","inpatient hospital setting","quality use of anticoagulant","clinical decision support system","high-risk medications","use of dashboards","major interventions","limited benefits","candidate articles","inclusion criteria","dashboard utilisation","eligibility criteria","web-based software platform Covidence","remaining study outcome measures","computerised physician order entry","CINAHL","medication errors","International Pharmaceutical Database","integration","alerts","stealth","nomograms","morbidity","mortality","focus","safety","electronic medical record","screening","Embase","randomised controlled trials","re-hospitalisation","suitable publications","adverse drug events","IMPORTANCE Anticoagulants","evaluation","collaboration","work","death","Targets","literature","conjunction","end-user acceptance","type of intervention","bias assessment","review","PROSPERO","CRD42018104899","data extraction","healthcare organisations","CONCLUSION","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

Among these, the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) system is the most effective. However, the precise mechanism of GAD induction is unknown. We previously reported that a tolC mutant lacking the TolC outer membrane channel was defective in GAD induction. Here, we show that indole, a substrate of TolC-dependent efflux pumps and produced by the tryptophanase encoded by the tnaA gene, negatively regulates GAD expression. GAD expression was restored by deleting tnaA in the tolC mutant; in wild-type E. coli, it was suppressed by adding indole to the growth medium. RNA-sequencing revealed that tnaA mRNA levels drastically decreased upon exposure to moderately acidic conditions (pH 5.5). This decrease was suppressed by RNase E deficiency. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the RNase E-dependent degradation of tnaA mRNA is accelerated upon acid exposure, which decreases intracellular indole concentrations and triggers GAD induction.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kanda, Takeshi; Abiko, Genta; Kanesaki, Yu; Yoshikawa, Hirofumi; Iwai, Noritaka; Wachi, Masaaki","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63981-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346014/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["GAD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GAD expression","triggers GAD induction","tolC mutant","precise mechanism of GAD induction","acid exposure","substrate of TolC","tnaA gene","tnaA mRNA levels","RNase E-dependent degradation of tnaA mRNA","TolC outer membrane channel","intracellular indole concentrations","Acid-resistance systems","RNase E deficiency","glutamic acid decarboxylase","acidic environment","dependent efflux pumps","pathogenic Escherichia coli","moderately acidic conditions","human stomach","tryptophanase","wild-type","RNA-sequencing","decrease","growth medium","results"],"language":"en"},

Because of global concern for potential intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from pregnant women to their infants, this report analyzes the effects on pregnancy of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory RNA viruses, and examines the frequency of maternal-fetal transmission with SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza (HPIV) and metapneumovirus (hMPV). There have been no confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission reported with COVID-19 or any other coronavirus infections. Influenza virus, despite causing approximately one billion annual infections globally, has only a few cases of confirmed or suspected intrauterine fetal infections reported. RSV is in an unusual cause of illness among pregnant women, and with the exception of one premature infant with congenital pneumonia, no other cases of maternal-fetal infection are described. Parainfluenza virus and human metapneumovirus can produce symptomatic maternal infections but do not cause intrauterine fetal infection. In summary, it appears that the absence thus far of maternal-fetal transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the COVID-19 pandemic is similar to other coronaviruses, and is also consistent with the extreme rarity of suggested or confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission of other respiratory RNA viruses. This observation has important consequences for pregnant women as it appears that if intrauterine transmission of SARSCoV-2 does eventually occur, it will be a rare event.

Our experience suggests concern about adverse outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery who might be infected with COVID-19. Clearly, additional investigations and experience are needed.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rescigno, Giuseppe; Firstenberg, Michael; Rudez, Igor; Uddin, Mauin; Nagarajan, Kumar; Nikolaidis, Nicholas","journal":"The heart surgery forum","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1532/hsf.3011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32364920/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsxMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["management of COVID","patients","natural history of COVID","experience","concern","coronary artery bypass surgery","multivessel coronary artery disease","cardiac surgery","medical problems","medical community","urgent therapeutic interventions","unstable angina","adverse outcomes","impact","associated complex presentations","additional investigations","focus","respiratory complications","case"],"language":"en"},

In spite of this IANS proposed its guidelines for the use of HRA in anal cancer and its precursors. Considering the costs to deal with COVID-19, the deficiency of healthcare professionals and the lack of worldwide evidence consensus on HRA, this examination cannot be considered mandatory during the COVID-19 pandemic. DARE with biopsy of suspicious palpable lesions in symptomatic patients could be considered enough during this period. Probably a latency of 6-12 months is reasonable for these patients without affecting the natural history of AIN. In conclusion, the current Covid-19 pandemic has been the most discussed topic in the media and scientific journals. However a deluge of scientific publications results in worldwide uncertainty.

The bifactor S - 1 model is also useful for examining the latent structure of psychopathology, especially in contexts with clear theoretical predictions. Joint use of correlated first-order syndrome-specific model and bifactor S - 1 model provides leverage for explaining psychopathology, and both models can also guide individual clinical assessment.

Originally, trastuzumab had to be administered intravenously (IV) over 30 min every 3 weeks for 1 year. Since 2012, a formulation for the subcutaneous (SC) administration of trastuzumab has been available, which has not yet been approved in the USA. Advocates claim that the SC formulation saves time and money, despite higher costs. The purpose of this study is to review existing literature concerning the comparative efficacy and risk of harms of trastuzumab IV and SC concerning patient-relevant health outcomes. METHODS We conducted searches in the Cochrane Library and MEDLINE for articles published through May 2018 in English or German. In addition, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov to identify unpublished studies. We dually reviewed the abstracts and full-text articles based on a priori defined inclusion criteria, rated the risk of bias of included studies, and assessed the strength of the evidence for each outcome of interest. Because data was insufficient for quantitative synthesis, we summarized results narratively. RESULTS We identified three RCTs (randomized controlled trials) meeting our eligibility criteria, which included data on 1003 patients. We found moderate evidence for similar event rates (20.05% vs. 18%, HR (hazard ratio) 0.88, CI 95% = 0.62-1.27), and mortality rates (10% vs. 8%, HR 0.76, CI 95% = 0.44-1.32) after 1.7 years for patients receiving trastuzumab IV and for patients receiving SC. Results remained similar after 3.3 years, though evidence lacked strength due to a high dropout rate. All trials reported more adverse events among the SC group than in the IV group. Evidence for these findings was of moderate strength. Nevertheless, more than 85% of the patients preferred trastuzumab SC over IV. Results concerning serious adverse events appeared to be heterogeneous. CONCLUSION Results of studies indicate similar efficacy between the two routes of administration. The higher rates of adverse events for SC administration were mainly attributable to injection site-related events. The clinical decision of whether to administer trastuzumab SC or IV requires the consideration of several factors and should be determined individually.","publish_time":"2019-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Van den Nest, Miriam; Glechner, Anna; Gold, Maria; Gartlehner, Gerald","journal":"Systematic reviews","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-019-1235-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31829250/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsyNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BACKGROUND Trastuzumab","ClinicalTrials.gov","SC"],"locations":["Cochrane Library"],"keyphrases":["trastuzumab SC","SC administration","administration of trastuzumab","patients","SC group","SC formulation","BACKGROUND Trastuzumab","IV group","higher rates of adverse events","moderate evidence","CONCLUSION Results of studies","serious adverse events","similar efficacy","moderate strength","included studies","mortality rates","similar event rates","routes of administration","data","years","unpublished studies","injection site-related events","comparative efficacy","risk of harms","risk of bias","eligibility criteria","text articles","higher costs","defined inclusion criteria","randomized controlled trials","HER2","human epidermal growth factor receptor","monoclonal antibody","time","money","Cochrane Library","existing literature","positive breast cancer","patient-relevant health outcomes","searches","MEDLINE","quantitative synthesis","consideration","high dropout rate","study","RCTs","hazard ratio","findings","regular treatment","clinical decision","METHODS","English","abstracts","factors","Advocates","weeks","German","purpose","USA","addition"],"language":"en"},

It was declared by the WHO as a public health emergency. The most susceptible populations, needing mechanical ventilation, are the elderly and people with associated comorbidities. There is an important risk of contagion for anesthetists, dentists, head and neck surgeons, maxillofacial surgeons, ophthalmologists and otolaryngologists. Health workers represent between 3.8% to 20% of the infected population; some 15% will develop severe complaints and among them, many will lose their lives. A large number of patients do not have overt signs and symptoms (fever/respiratory), yet pose a real risk to surgeons (who should know this fact and must therefore apply respiratory protective strategies for all patients they encounter). All interventions that have the potential to aerosolize aerodigestive secretions should be avoided or used only when mandatory. Health workers who are: pregnant, over 55-65 years of age, with a history of chronic diseases (uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and all clinical scenarios where immunosuppression is feasible, including that induced to treat chronic inflammatory conditions and organ transplants) should avoid the clinical attention of a potentially infected patient. Healthcare facilities should prioritize urgent and emergency visits and procedures until the present condition stabilizes; truly elective care should cease and discussed on a case-by-case basis for cancer patients. For those who are working with COVID-19 infected patients\u0027 isolation is compulsory in the following settings: a) unprotected close contact with COVID-19 pneumonia patients: b) onset of fever, cough, shortness of breath and other symptoms (gastrointestinal complaints, anosmia and dysgeusia have been reported in a minority of cases). For any care or intervention in the upper aerodigestive tract region, irrespective of the setting and a confirmed diagnosis (eg, ; rhinoscopy or flexible laryngoscopy in the outpatient setting and tracheostomy or rigid endoscopy under anesthesia) it is strongly recommended that all healthcare personnel wear personal protective equipment (PPE) such as N95, gown, cap, eye protection and gloves. The procedures described are essential in trying to maintain safety of healthcare workers during COVID-19 pandemic.

Emerging reports suggest that susceptibility and mortality rates are higher in patients with certain comorbidities when compared to the average population. Cardiovascular diseases and diabetes are important risk factors for a lethal outcome of COVID-19. Extensive research ensuing the outbreak of coronavirus-related severe acute respiratory syndrome in the year 2003, and COVID-19 recently revealed a role of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components in the entry of coronavirus wherein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) had garnered the significant attention. This raises the question whether the use of RAS inhibitors, the backbone of treatment of cardiovascular, neurovascular, and kidney diseases could increase the susceptibility for coronavirus infection or unfortunate outcomes of COVID-19. Thus, currently, there is a lack of consensus regarding the effects of RAS inhibitors in such patients. Moreover, expert bodies like American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and so on have now released official statements that RAS inhibitors must be continued, unless suggested otherwise by a physician. In this brief review, we will elaborate on the role of RAS and ACE2 in pathogenesis of COVID-19. Moreover, we will discuss the potential effect of the use and disuse of RAS inhibitors in patients having COVID-19 with cardiometabolic comorbidities.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sankrityayan, Himanshu; Kale, Ajinath; Sharma, Nisha; Anders, Hans-Joachim; Gaikwad, Anil Bhanudas","journal":"Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology and therapeutics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1074248420921720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32351121/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsyODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","RAS","American Heart Association"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["role of RAS","disuse of RAS inhibitors","effects of RAS inhibitors","pathogenesis of COVID","patients","lethal outcome of COVID","unfortunate outcomes of COVID","outbreak of coronavirus","coronavirus infection","entry of coronavirus","Coronavirus disease","susceptibility","Cardiovascular diseases","ACE2","kidney diseases","angiotensin system","certain comorbidities","role of renin","cardiometabolic comorbidities","American Heart Association","American College of Cardiology","important risk factors","related severe acute respiratory syndrome","mortality rates","number of infected","exponential rise","backbone of treatment","diabetes","year","components","World Health Organization","expert bodies","deceased persons","Emerging reports","globe","pandemic","potential effect","Extensive research","lack of consensus","enzyme","official statements","question","average population","significant attention","Wuhan","brief review","China","physician"],"language":"en"},

Dependence on amphetamines (AMPH) or methamphetamine (MA) is a growing global concern. Yet, there is no established pharmacotherapy for AMPH/MA dependence. A comprehensive assessment of the research literature on pharmacotherapy for AMPH/MA dependence may inform treatment guidelines and future research directions. METHODS We systematically reviewed the peer-reviewed literature via the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and SCOPUS for randomised controlled trials reported in the English language examining a pharmacological treatment for AMPH/MA dependence or use disorder. We included all studies published to 19 June 2019. The selected studies were evaluated for design; methodology; inclusion and exclusion criteria; sample size; pharmacological and (if included) psychosocial interventions; length of follow-up and follow-up schedules; outcome variables and measures; results; overall conclusions and risk of bias. Outcome measures were any reported impact of treatment related to AMPH/MA use. RESULTS Our search returned 43 studies that met our criteria, collectively enrolling 4065 participants and reporting on 23 individual pharmacotherapies, alone or in combination. Disparate outcomes and measures (n = 55 for the primary outcomes) across studies did not allow for meta-analyses. Some studies demonstrated mixed or weak positive signals (often in defined populations, e.g. men who have sex with men), with some variation in efficacy signals dependent on baseline frequency of AMPH/MA use. The most consistent positive findings have been demonstrated with stimulant agonist treatment (dexamphetamine and methylphenidate), naltrexone and topiramate. Less consistent benefits have been shown with the antidepressants bupropion and mirtazapine, the glutamatergic agent riluzole and the corticotropin releasing factor (CRF-1) antagonist pexacerfont; whilst in general, antidepressant medications (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs], tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs]) have not been effective in reducing AMPH/MA use. CONCLUSIONS No pharmacotherapy yielded convincing results for the treatment of AMPH/MA dependence; mostly studies were underpowered and had low treatment completion rates. However, there were positive signals from several agents that warrant further investigation in larger scale studies; agonist therapies show promise. Common outcome measures should include change in use days. Future research must address the heterogeneity of AMPH/MA dependence (e.g. coexisting conditions, severity of disorder, differences between MA and AMPH dependence) and the role of psychosocial intervention.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Siefried, Krista J; Acheson, Liam S; Lintzeris, Nicholas; Ezard, Nadine","journal":"CNS drugs","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40263-020-00711-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32185696/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjszMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AMPH/MA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AMPH dependence","MA dependence","treatment of AMPH","MA use","heterogeneity of AMPH","pharmacological treatment","baseline frequency of AMPH","selected studies","treatment guidelines","stimulant agonist treatment","reported impact of treatment","larger scale studies","use days","Common outcome measures","research literature","weak positive signals","low treatment completion rates","outcome variables","established pharmacotherapy","convincing results","future research directions","consistent positive findings","efficacy signals dependent","peer-reviewed literature","follow-up schedules","length of follow-up","agonist therapies","exclusion criteria","severity of disorder","overall conclusions","tricyclic antidepressants","antidepressants bupropion","psychosocial interventions","Disparate outcomes","primary outcomes","consistent benefits","BACKGROUND Stimulant drugs","role of psychosocial intervention","CINAHL","SSRIs","selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors","electronic databases PubMed","antidepressant medications","SCOPUS","randomised controlled trials","EMBASE","inclusion","methylphenidate","English language","glutamatergic agent riluzole","coexisting conditions","differences","accounting","factor","corticotropin","mirtazapine","sample size","design","variation","methodology","investigation","defined populations","dexamphetamine","change","individual pharmacotherapies","CRF","antagonist pexacerfont","participants","TCAs","agents","promise","methamphetamine","risk of bias","comprehensive assessment","class of illicit drug","growing global concern","reporting","naltrexone","cannabis","sex","amphetamines","past-year consumers","combination","topiramate","meta-analyses","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

However, its injudicious abstraction and rapidly increasing contamination are posing a severe threat for sustainable water supply worldwide. Geographical Information System (GIS)-based groundwater quality evaluation using Groundwater Quality Index (GQI) has been proved to be a cost-effective tool for assessing groundwater quality and its variability at a larger scale. However, the conventional GQI approach is unable to deal with uncertainties involved in the assessment of environmental problems. To overcome this limitation, a novel hybrid framework integrating Fuzzy Logic with the GIS-based GQI is proposed in this study for assessing groundwater quality and its spatial variability. The proposed hybrid framework is demonstrated through a case study in a hard-rock terrain of Southern India using ten prominent groundwater-quality parameters measured during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Two conventional GIS-based GQI models GQI-10 (using all the ten groundwater-quality parameters) and GQI-7 (using seven \u0027concerned/critical\u0027 groundwater-quality parameters) as well as hybrid Fuzzy-GIS-based GQI (FGQI) models (using seven critical parameters) were developed for the two seasons and the results were compared. The Trapezoidal membership functions classified the model input parameters into \u0027desirable\u0027, \u0027acceptable\u0027 and \u0027unacceptable\u0027 classes based on the experts\u0027 knowledge and water quality standards for drinking purposes. The concentrations of Ca2\u002B, Mg2\u002B, and SO42- in groundwater were found within the WHO desirable limits for drinking water throughout the year, while the concentrations of seven parameters (TDS, NO3--N, Na\u002B, Cl-, K\u002B, F- and Hardness) exceed their permissible limits during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. A comparative evaluation of GQI models revealed that the FGQI model predicts groundwater quality better than the conventional GQI-10 and GQI-7 models. GQI modeling results suggest that the groundwater of most of eastern and southern parts (\u223C60% in pre-monsoon season; \u223C90% in post-monsoon season) of the study area is unsuitable for drinking. Further, the groundwater quality deteriorates during post-monsoon seasons compared to pre-monsoon seasons, which indicates an increased influx of contaminants from different industries, mining areas, waste disposal sites and agricultural fields during monsoon seasons. This finding calls for the strict enforcement of regulations for proper handling of effluents from various contamination sources in the study area. It is concluded that the fuzzy logic-based decision-making approach (FGQI) is more reliable and pragmatic for groundwater-quality assessment and analysis at a larger scale. It can serve as a useful tool for the water planners and decision makers in efficiently monitoring and managing groundwater quality at watershed or basin scales.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jha, Madan Kumar; Shekhar, Ankit; Jenifer, M Annie","journal":"Water research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.115867; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408184/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjszOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Geographical Information System","GQI","Trapezoidal","FGQI"],"locations":["Southern India"],"keyphrases":["groundwater-quality assessment","Groundwater Quality Index","based groundwater quality evaluation","prominent groundwater-quality parameters","conventional GIS-based GQI models GQI","pre-monsoon seasons","post-monsoon seasons","water quality standards","conventional GQI approach","GQI modeling results","comparative evaluation of GQI models","critical parameters","drinking water","hybrid Fuzzy-GIS","study area","model input parameters","FGQI model","water planners","Fuzzy Logic","case study","proposed hybrid framework","novel hybrid framework","sustainable water supply","desirable limits","drinking purposes","larger scale","increasing contamination","permissible limits","decision-making approach","southern parts","useful tool","cost-effective tool","spatial variability","concentrations of Ca2","various contamination sources","assessment of environmental problems","hard-rock terrain of Southern India","waste disposal sites","different industries","mining areas","proper handling of effluents","agricultural fields","severe threat","experts\u0027 knowledge","increased influx of contaminants","pragmatic","analysis","Trapezoidal membership functions","vital source of freshwater","strict enforcement of regulations","rural regions","classes","uncertainties","NO3","TDS","decision makers","Geographical Information System","year","watershed","basin scales","world","Mg2","injudicious abstraction","Hardness","limitation","SO42"],"language":"en"},

In order to improve the traceability of their trade, we developed 20 polymorphic microsatellite loci for the white-bellied pangolin (Phataginus tricuspis), the species most frequently found on African bushmeat markets. We genotyped 24 white-bellied pangolins from the Douala market, Cameroon, originating from the Ebo forest c. 75 km north-east of Douala. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 4 to 12 (mean = 6.95), and mean observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.592 (0.208-0.875) and 0.671 (0.469-0.836), respectively. Genetic diversity was higher than that cross-estimated from microsatellite loci developed for other species of pangolins. Two loci deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and two loci showed linkage disequilibrium. Genetic variance (PCoA) was increased with the addition of 13 pangolins of unknown origin, possibly suggesting that the Douala market is fed from differentiated source populations of white-bellied pangolins. Each of the 37 individuals had a unique multilocus genotype. The unbiased probability of identity (uPI) and the probability of identity among siblings (PIsibs) were both very low (uPI = 8.443 e-21; PIsibs = 1.011 e-07). Only five microsatellite loci were needed to reach the conservative value of PIsibs \u003C 0.01, overall indicating a powerful discriminating power of our combined loci. These 20 newly developed microsatellite loci might prove useful in tracing the local-to-global trade of the white-bellied pangolin, and will hopefully contribute to the DNA-assisted implementation of future conservation strategies at reasonable costs.","publish_time":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aguillon, Samantha; Din Dipita, Alain; Lecompte, Emilie; Missoup, Alain Didier; Tindo, Maurice; Gaubert, Philippe","journal":"Molecular biology reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-05511-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32419053/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjszOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Douala"],"keyphrases":["developed microsatellite loci","white-bellied pangolins","combined loci","polymorphic microsatellite loci","species of pangolins","pangolins of unknown origin","Douala market","north-east of Douala","uPI","mean","differentiated source populations of white","unbiased probability of identity","conservative value of PIsibs","global trade","Genetic diversity","Genetic variance","implementation of future conservation strategies","corollary","Cameroon","Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium","cross","Phataginus tricuspis","reasonable costs","potential intermediate hosts","powerful discriminating power","addition","Ebo forest","linkage disequilibrium","individuals","unique multilocus genotype","DNA","PCoA","COVID","siblings","African bushmeat markets","number of alleles","traded mammals","traceability","pandemic","scaly anteaters","expected heterozygosities","order"],"language":"en"},

International guidance suggests direct droplet transmission is likely and airborne transmission occurs only with aerosol generating procedures. Recommendations determining infection control measures to ensure healthcare worker safety follow these presumptions. Three mechanisms have been described for the production of smaller sized respiratory particles (\u0027aerosols\u0027) that, if inhaled, can deposit in the distal airways. All require the surface tension of the respiratory tract lining fluid to be overcome by shear forces. These include: laryngeal activity such as talking and coughing; high velocity gas flow; and cyclical opening and closure of terminal airways. Sneezing and coughing are effective aerosol generators, but all forms of expiration produce particles across a range of sizes. The 5 \u03BCm diameter threshold used to differentiate droplet from airborne is an over-simplification of multiple complex, poorly understood biological and physical variables. The evidence defining aerosol-generating procedures comes largely from low-quality case and cohort studies where the exact mode of transmission is unknown as aerosol production was never quantified. We propose that transmission is associated with time in proximity to SARS-CoV-1 patients with respiratory symptoms, rather than the procedures per-se. There is no proven relation between any aerosol-generating procedure with airborne viral content with the exception of bronchoscopy and suctioning. The mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 transmission is unknown but the evidence suggestive of airborne spread is growing. We speculate that infected patients who cough, have high work of breathing, increased closing capacity and altered respiratory tract lining fluid will be significant producers of pathogenic aerosols. We suggest several \u0027aerosol-generating procedures\u0027 may in fact result in less pathogen aerosolisation than a dyspnoeic and coughing patient. Healthcare workers should appraise the current evidence regarding transmission and apply this to the local infection prevalence. Measures to mitigate airborne transmission should be employed at times of risk. However, the mechanisms and risk factors for transmission are largely unconfirmed. Whilst awaiting robust evidence, a precautionary approach should be considered to assure healthcare worker safety.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilson, N M; Norton, A; Young, F P; Collins, D W","journal":"Anaesthesia","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.15093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32311771/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs0MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["airborne transmission","aerosol production","direct droplet transmission","SARS-CoV","exact mode of transmission","respiratory symptoms","risk of infection","Healthcare workers","respiratory tract lining fluid","evidence suggestive of airborne spread","healthcare worker safety","effective aerosol generators","current evidence","robust evidence","airborne viral content","production of smaller sized respiratory particles","severe acute respiratory syndrome","infection control measures","coughing patient","risk factors","times of risk","mechanisms","local infection prevalence","infected patients","distal airways","high work of breathing","closure of terminal airways","high velocity gas flow","increased closing capacity","cyclical opening","coronavirus","cohort studies","over-simplification of multiple complex","significant producers of pathogenic aerosols","exception of bronchoscopy","pathogen aerosolisation","low-quality case","forms of expiration","International guidance","surface tension","aerosols\u0027","proximity","precautionary approach","\u03BCm diameter threshold","Recommendations","presumptions","physical variables","range of sizes","shear forces","proven relation","suctioning","laryngeal activity","procedures\u0027","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

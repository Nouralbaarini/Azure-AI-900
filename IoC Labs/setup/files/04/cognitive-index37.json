Symptoms of CHIKV include fever and persistent, severe arthritis. In recent years, several antiviral drugs have been evaluated in clinical trials; however, no registered antivirals have been approved for clinical therapy. In this study, we established a high-throughput screening (HTS) system based on CHIKV 26S mediated insect cell fusion inhibition assay. Our screening system was able to search potential anti-CHIKV drugs in vitro. Using this system, four compounds (niclosamide, nitazoxanide, niflumic acid, tolfenamic acid) were identified. These compounds were then further analyzed using a microneutralization assay. We determined that niclosamide and nitazoxanide exhibit ability to against CHIKV-induced CPE. The anti-CHIKV abilities of these compounds were further confirmed by RT-qPCR and IFA. Moreover, niclosamide and nitazoxanide were found to (1) limit virus entry, (2) inhibit both viral release and cell-to-cell transmission, and (3) possess broad anti-alphavius activities, including against two clinical CHIKV isolates and two alphaviruses: Sindbis virus (SINV) and Semliki forest virus (SFV). In conclusion, our findings suggested that niclosamide and nitazoxanide were able to inhibit CHIKV entry and transmission, which might provide a basis for the development of novel human drug therapies against CHIKV and other alphavirus infections.","publish_time":"2016-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yu-Ming; Lu, Jeng-Wei; Lin, Chang-Chi; Chin, Yuan-Fan; Wu, Tzong-Yuan; Lin, Liang-In; Lai, Zheng-Zong; Kuo, Szu-Cheng; Ho, Yi-Jung","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/56c1859cbfa5868daf09586933a4882da9a760c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126800.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2016.10.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354216303242; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354216303242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27742486/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs2Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CHIKV entry","Symptoms of CHIKV","clinical CHIKV isolates","anti-CHIKV abilities","niclosamide","potential anti-CHIKV drugs","CHIKV-induced CPE","chikungunya virus","compounds","Sindbis virus","cell transmission","screening system","limit virus entry","Semliki forest virus","nitazoxanide exhibit ability","clinical trials","clinical therapy","niflumic acid","antiviral drugs","tolfenamic acid","broad anti-alphavius activities","microneutralization assay","S mediated insect cell fusion inhibition assay","high-throughput screening","Abstract Chikungunya disease results","development of novel human drug therapies","SINV","alphaviruses","fever","HTS","arbovirus","basis","registered antivirals","severe arthritis","alphavirus infections","recent years","SFV","findings","RT-qPCR","viral release","IFA","conclusion","study"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Between May 2009 and October 2012, 7733 FRI patients and controls in the Singapore military had clinical data and nasal wash samples collected prospectively and sent for PCR testing. Patients with one pathogen detected (mono-pathogen) were compared with those with two pathogens (dual pathogen) for differences in basic demographics and clinical presentation. RESULTS: In total, 45.8% had one pathogen detected, 20.2% had two pathogens detected, 30.9% had no pathogens detected, and 3.1% had more than two pathogens. Multiple pathogens were associated with recruits, those with asthma and non-smokers. Influenza A (80.0%), influenza B (73.0%) and mycoplasma (70.6%) were most commonly associated with mono-infections, while adenovirus was most commonly associated with dual infections (62.9%). Influenza A paired with S. pneumoniae had higher proportions of chills and rigors than their respective mono-pathogens (P = 0.03, P = 0.009). H. influenzae paired with either enterovirus or parainfluenzae had higher proportions of cough with phlegm than their respective mono-pathogens. Although there were observed differences in mean proportions of body temperature, nasal symptoms, sore throat, body aches and joint pains between viral and bacterial mono-pathogens, there were few differences between distinct dual-pathogen pairs and their respective mono-pathogen counterparts. CONCLUSION: A substantial number of FRI patients have multiple pathogens detected. Observed clinical differences between patients of dual pathogen and mono-pathogen indicate the likely presence of complex microbial interactions between the various pathogens.","publish_time":"2015-06-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ho, Zheng Jie Marc; Zhao, Xiahong; Cook, Alex R; Loh, Jin Phang; Ng, Sock Hoon; Tan, Boon Huan; Lee, Vernon J","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bfbee300d5a290a823a6a06f268e8a02a7e47455.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4474496.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12312; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25827870/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs2OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":["Singapore"],"keyphrases":["respective mono-pathogens","Multiple pathogens","bacterial mono-pathogens","various pathogens","patients of dual pathogen","multiple respiratory pathogens","respective mono-pathogen counterparts","mono-infections","clinical differences","distinct dual-pathogen pairs","dual infections","clinical data","clinical presentation","clinical disease","higher proportions of cough","higher proportions of chills","influenza B","mean proportions of body temperature","body aches","nasal symptoms","nasal wash samples","febrile respiratory illnesses","sore throat","joint pains","Singapore military","likely presence of complex microbial interactions","phlegm","rigors","basic demographics","impact","parainfluenzae","pneumoniae","population-level studies","substantial number","enterovirus","controls","recruits","adenovirus","asthma","non-smokers","CONCLUSION","total","PCR testing","mycoplasma","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

We systematically designed RNAs with various structures and observed dsRNA formation during replication using an RNA replicase (Q\u03B2 replicase). From the results, we extracted a simple rule regarding ssRNA genome replication with less dsRNA formation (less GC number in loops) and then designed an artificial RNA that encodes a domain of the \u03B2-galactosidase gene based on this rule. We also obtained evidence that this rule governs the natural genomes of all bacterial and most fungal viruses presently known.

Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain this including issues of genetics, physiology, nutrition and management, and these factors have been investigated at the animal, organ and cellular level at critical time points of the productive life of dairy cows. This paper reviews the physiological events and their causes and consequences affecting fertility in dairy cows and summarises these in a downloadable poster. We consider the following points to have the greatest negative impact on fertility and that they need to be prioritised in efforts to ameliorate the problem (others have been included in the review). Firstly, minimise negative energy balance and resolve any infection of the post partum uterus. Secondly, expression and detection of oestrus followed by insemination with high quality semen (day 0). Thirdly, ovulation and fertilisation of a high quality oocyte (day 1). Fourthly, an early increase in progesterone secretion from the corpus luteum (days 3\u20137). Fifthly, the uterine endometrium must produce an early and appropriate environment to stimulate embryo development (days 6\u201313). This leads to sixthly, a large embryo producing adequate quantities of interferon tau (days 14\u201318) that alters uterine prostaglandin secretion and signals maternal recognition of pregnancy (days 16\u201318). Future strategies to improve dairy cow fertility are needed for the benefit of the dairy industry and for cow welfare and should be based upon an integrative approach of these events.","publish_time":"2011-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walsh, S.

In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic has been harder to contain, partly because of its wide spectrum of symptoms in infectious hosts. Current evidence suggests that individuals can transmit the novel coronavirus while displaying few symptoms. Here, we show that the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms at the start of an outbreak can, in combination with the basic reproduction number, indicate whether or not interventions targeting symptomatic hosts are likely to be effective. However, as an outbreak continues, the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms changes in response to control measures. A high proportion of infections from hosts with few symptoms after the initial stages of an outbreak is only problematic if the rate of new infections remains high. Otherwise, it can simply indicate that symptomatic transmissions are being prevented successfully. This should be considered when interpreting estimates of the extent of transmission from hosts with few COVID-19 symptoms.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thompson, Robin N; Lovell-Read, Francesca A; Obolski, Uri","journal":"Journal of clinical medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9051297; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32369975/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs3NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["symptomatic hosts","infectious hosts","symptoms changes","high proportion of infections","outbreak","wide spectrum of symptoms","rate of new infections","Interventions","COVID","symptomatic transmissions","control measures","SARS pandemic","response","individuals","combination","contacts","initial stages","extent of transmission","basic reproduction number","novel coronavirus","start","Current evidence","estimates","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Methods A comprehensive search up to 1 July 2017 was conducted on Medline and Embase for studies that utilized FilmArray, Verigene RV\u002B and Prodesse for diagnosis of viral respiratory infections. A summary of diagnostic accuracies for the following five viruses were calculated: influenza A virus (FluA), influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus. Hierarchical summary receiver operating curves were used for estimating the viral detection performance per assay. Results Twenty studies of 5510 patient samples were eligible for analysis. Multiplex PCRs demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) equal to or more than 0.98 for all the above viruses except for adenovirus (AUROC 0.89). FilmArray, Verigene RV\u002B and ProFlu\u002B (the only Prodesse assay with enough data) demonstrated a summary sensitivity for FluA of 0.911 (95% confidence interval, 0.848\u20130.949), 0.949 (95% confidence interval, 0.882\u20130.979) and 0.954 (95% confidence interval, 0.871\u20130.985), respectively. The three mPCRs were comparable in terms of detection of FluA. Conclusions Point estimates calculated from eligible studies showed that the three mPCRs (FilmArray, Verigene RV\u002B and ProFlu\u002B) are highly accurate and may provide important diagnostic information for early identification of respiratory virus infections. In patients with low pretest probability for FluA, these three mPCRs can predict a low possibility of infection and may justify withholding empirical antiviral treatments.","publish_time":"2018-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, H.-S.; Tsai, C.-L.; Chang, J.; Hsu, T.-C.; Lin, S.; Lee, C.-C.","journal":"Clinical Microbiology and Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ed5c595aa5d503ef3250c066ef037926de1b2e64.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128951.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2017.11.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29208560/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X17306493; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X17306493","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs3OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Nanosphere Verigene RV","Verigene RV","Multiplex"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mPCRs","FluA","Nanosphere Verigene RV","summary of diagnostic accuracies","detection of viral respiratory infections","respiratory syncytial virus","confidence interval","diagnosis of viral respiratory infections","early identification of respiratory virus infections","eligible studies","summary of evidence","summary sensitivity","influenza B virus","BioFire FilmArray RP","viral detection performance","Hierarchical summary receiver","important diagnostic information","high diagnostic accuracy","ProFlu","terms of detection","viruses","AUROC","adenovirus","Multiplex PCRs","Hologic Gen-Probe Prodesse assays","multiplex PCR systems","low possibility of infection","low pretest probability","area","human metapneumovirus","characteristic curve","patient samples","withholding empirical antiviral treatments","patients","curves","data","analysis","Results","Conclusions","estimates","Embase","Abstract Objectives","Methods","comprehensive search","Medline"],"language":"en"},

In LMIC, three types of public health training have been tried: the university-based model; streamed training for specialised workers; and field-based programs. The first has low rates of production and teaching may not always be based on the needs and priorities of the host country. The second model is efficient, but does not accord the workers sufficient status to enable them to impact on policy. The third has the most potential as a capacity development measure for LMIC, but in practice faces challenges which may limit its ability to promote capacity development. DISCUSSION: We describe Australia\u0027s first Master of Applied Epidemiology (MAE) model (established in 1991), which uses field-based training to strengthen the control of communicable diseases. A central attribute of this model is the way it partners and complements health department initiatives to enhance workforce skills, health system performance and the evidence-base for policies, programs and practice. SUMMARY: The MAE experience throws light on ways Australia could collaborate in regional capacity development initiatives. Key needs are a shared vision for a regional approach to integrate training with initiatives that strengthen service and research, and the pooling of human, financial and technical resources. We focus on communicable diseases, but our findings and recommendations are generalisable to other areas of public health.","publish_time":"2009-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patel, Mahomed S; Phillips, Christine B","journal":"Aust New Zealand Health Policy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cf0dd4d9f9f906626d5bc4a01e1f1eb21806291c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2672090.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19358710/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-8462-6-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Applied Epidemiology"],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["field-based training","regional capacity development initiatives","types of public health training","capacity development measure","LMIC","university-based model","control of communicable diseases","areas of public health","field-based programs","streamed training","complements health department initiatives","health system performance","International Health Regulations","communicable disease control","practice","rich countries","specialised workers","regional approach","MAE experience","global spread of infectious diseases","Key needs","medium income countries","low rates of production","workers sufficient status","workforce skills","ways Australia","evidence-base","pooling of human","light","emergence","shared vision","Master of Applied Epidemiology","re-assessment","Australia\u0027s","recommendations","research","policies","findings","service","technical resources","priorities","host country","teaching","SUMMARY","BACKGROUND","challenges","ability","central attribute","DISCUSSION","policy"],"language":"en"},

In all these cases, the reported mechanism of antiviral inhibition indicates that the pool of IFITM proteins present in target cells blocks incoming viral particles in endosomal vesicles where they are subsequently degraded. RESULTS: In this study, we describe an additional mechanism through which IFITMs block HIV-1. In virus-producing cells, IFITMs coalesce with forming virions and are incorporated into viral particles. Expression of IFITMs during virion assembly leads to the production of virion particles of decreased infectivity that are mostly affected during entry in target cells. This mechanism of inhibition is exerted against different retroviruses and does not seem to be dependent on the type of Envelope present on retroviral particles. CONCLUSIONS: The results described here identify a novel mechanism through which IFITMs affect HIV-1 infectivity during the late phases of the viral life cycle. Put in the context of data obtained by other laboratories, these results indicate that IFITMs can target HIV at two distinct moments of its life cycle, in target cells as well as in virus-producing cells. These results raise the possibility that IFITMs could similarly affect distinct steps of the life cycle of a number of other viruses.

The neonatal immune system is generally held to be deficient in most compartments; responses to innate stimuli are weak, antigen-presenting cells have poor immunostimulatory activity and adaptive lymphocyte responses are limited, leading to poor immune memory and ineffective vaccine responses. For mucosal surfaces such as the lung, which is continuously exposed to airborne antigen and to potential pathogenic invasion, the ability to discriminate between harmless and potentially dangerous antigens is essential, to prevent inflammation that could lead to loss of gaseous exchange and damage to the developing lung tissue. We have only recently begun to define the differences in respiratory immunity in early life and its environmental and developmental influences. The innate immune system may be of relatively greater importance than the adaptive immune system in the neonatal and infant period than later in life, as it does not require specific antigenic experience. A better understanding of what constitutes protective innate immunity in the respiratory tract in this age group and the factors that influence its development should allow us to predict why certain infants are vulnerable to severe respiratory infections, design treatments to accelerate the development of protective immunity, and design age specific adjuvants to better boost immunity to infection in the lung.","publish_time":"2017-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lambert, Laura; Culley, Fiona J.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a89a80a592e5af122545d57ff70bc683d28831e8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5694434.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.01570; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29184555/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory immunity","innate immune system","protective innate immunity","adaptive immune system","neonatal immune system","severe respiratory infections","development of protective immunity","respiratory tract","Early life","better boost immunity","poor immune memory","adaptive lymphocyte responses","design age specific adjuvants","ineffective vaccine responses","developing lung tissue","design treatments","age group","infant period","better understanding","airborne antigen","certain infants","poor immunostimulatory activity","period of particular susceptibility","specific antigenic experience","damage","cells","symptoms","greater importance","potential pathogenic invasion","loss of gaseous exchange","ability","stimuli","differences","dangerous antigens","developmental influences","inflammation","compartments","factors","mucosal surfaces","adults"],"language":"en"},

Although bats have a long history of association with rabies, the emergence and re\u2010emergence of a number of viruses from bats that impact human and animal health has resulted in a resurgence of interest in bat immunology. Understanding how bats coexist with viruses in the absence of disease is essential if we are to begin to develop therapeutics to target viruses in humans and susceptible livestock and companion animals. Here, we review the current status of knowledge in the field of bat antiviral immunology including both adaptive and innate mechanisms of immune defence and highlight the need for further investigations in this area. Because data in this field are so limited, our discussion is based on both scientific discoveries and theoretical predictions. It is hoped that by provoking original, speculative or even controversial ideas or theories, this review may stimulate further research in this important field. Efforts to understand the immune systems of bats have been greatly facilitated in recent years by the availability of partial genome sequences from two species of bats, a megabat, Pteropus vampyrus, and a microbat, Myotis lucifugus, allowing the rapid identification of immune genes. Although bats appear to share most features of the immune system with other mammals, several studies have reported qualitative and quantitative differences in the immune responses of bats. These observations warrant further investigation to determine whether such differences are associated with the asymptomatic nature of viral infections in bats.","publish_time":"2012-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baker, M.

Current methods for pathogen detection and surveillance are usually dependent on prior knowledge of the etiologic agents involved. Hence, efficient approaches are required for screening wild mosquito populations to detect known and unknown pathogens. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we explored the use of Next Generation Sequencing to identify viral agents in wild-caught mosquitoes. We extracted total RNA from different mosquito species from South China. Small 18\u201330 bp length RNA molecules were purified, reverse-transcribed into cDNA and sequenced using Illumina GAIIx instrumentation. Bioinformatic analyses to identify putative viral agents were conducted and the results confirmed by PCR. We identified a non-enveloped single-stranded DNA densovirus in the wild-caught Culex pipiens molestus mosquitoes. The majority of the viral transcripts (.\u003E80% of the region) were covered by the small viral RNAs, with a few peaks of very high coverage obtained. The \u002B/\u2212 strand sequence ratio of the small RNAs was approximately 7\u22361, indicating that the molecules were mainly derived from the viral RNA transcripts. The small viral RNAs overlapped, enabling contig assembly of the viral genome sequence. We identified some small RNAs in the reverse repeat regions of the viral 5\u2032- and 3\u2032 -untranslated regions where no transcripts were expected. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate for the first time that high throughput sequencing of small RNA is feasible for identifying viral agents in wild-caught mosquitoes. Our results show that it is possible to detect DNA viruses by sequencing the small RNAs obtained from insects, although the underlying mechanism of small viral RNA biogenesis is unclear. Our data and those of other researchers show that high throughput small RNA sequencing can be used for pathogen surveillance in wild mosquito vectors.","publish_time":"2011-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Maijuan; Huang, Yong; Gong, Zhengda; Zhuang, Lu; Li, Cun; Yang, Hong; Tong, Yigang; Liu, Wei; Cao, Wuchun","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c82e4a717a9242e0462b24a8759f98f0c83d677.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3176773.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21949749/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0024758","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Next Generation Sequencing","RNA","Illumina","PCR"],"locations":["South China"],"keyphrases":["small viral RNAs","small RNAs","viral transcripts","viral RNA transcripts","putative viral agents","high throughput sequencing of small RNA","high throughput small RNA sequencing","underlying mechanism of small viral RNA biogenesis","viral genome sequence","total RNA","wild mosquito vectors","results","screening wild mosquito populations","bp length RNA molecules","etiologic agents","Generation Sequencing","pathogen surveillance","different mosquito species","high coverage","molestus mosquitoes","reverse repeat regions","pathogen detection","DNA viruses","untranslated regions","strand sequence ratio","non-enveloped single-stranded DNA densovirus","contig assembly","severe threat","infectious diseases","public health","prior knowledge","researchers","time","peaks","South China","areas","cDNA","Current methods","Culex","Bioinformatic analyses","insects","efficient approaches","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","study","Illumina GAIIx instrumentation","BACKGROUND","unknown pathogens","METHODOLOGY","world","CONCLUSIONS","SIGNIFICANCE","majority","data","PCR"],"language":"en"},

Knowledge about such contacts is essential for contingency planning. Preventive measures, risk-based surveillance and contact tracing may be facilitated if the frequency and type of between-farm contacts can be assessed for different types of farms. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and types of visitors on farms with cloven-hoofed animals in Sweden and to analyse whether there were differences in the number of visitors attributable to region, season, and type of herd. Data were collected from Swedish farmers through contact-logs covering two-week periods during four different seasons. RESULTS: In total, 482 (32%) farmers filled in the contact log for at least one period and the data represent 18,416 days. The average number of professional and non-professional visitors per day was 0.3 and 0.8, respectively. Whereas the number of professional visitors seemed to increase with increasing herd size, this relation was not seen for non-professional visits. The mean numbers of visitors per day were highest in the summer and in the farm category \u2018small mixed farm\u2019. Reports of the visitors\u2019 degree of contact with the animals showed that veterinarians, AI-technicians, animal transporters and neighbours were often in direct contact with the animals or entered the stables and 8.8% of the repairmen were also in direct contact with animals, which was unexpected. In a multivariable analysis, species, herd size and season were significantly associated with the number of professional visitors as well as the number of visitors in direct contact with the animals. CONCLUSION: In conclusion there was a large variation between farms in the number and type of contacts. The number of visitors that may be more likely to spread diseases between farms was associated with animal species and herd size.","publish_time":"2013-09-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"N\u00F6remark, Maria; Fr\u00F6ssling, Jenny; Lewerin, Susanna Sternberg","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0480084eefee6333df832a821af8945ea7ab379a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3848732.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-9-184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24040830/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Sweden"],"keyphrases":["number of professional visitors","number of visitors attributable","non-professional visitors","types of visitors","direct contact","contact-logs","contact tracing","contact log","farm contacts","mean numbers of visitors","average number of professional","type of herd","type of contacts","visitors\u2019 degree of contact","cloven-hoofed animals","different types of farms","increasing herd size","farm category","animal species","animal transporters","small mixed farm","frequency","spread of contagious animal diseases","Data","CONCLUSION","different seasons","Swedish farmers","non-professional visits","risk-based surveillance","two-week periods","AI-technicians","relation","neighbours","veterinarians","region","livestock movements","Preventive measures","summer","multivariable analysis","large variation","BACKGROUND","addition","contingency planning","Reports","repairmen","Sweden","differences","study","days","Knowledge","stables","RESULTS","total","aim"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this study was to generate mortality estimates among SARI patients that include deaths occurring shortly after hospital discharge and identify risk factors for mortality. METHODS: Patients admitted to two sentinel hospitals between 2010 and 2014 who met the SARI case definition were enrolled. Demographic data were used to link SARI patients to Arizona death certificates. Mortality within 30 days after the date of admission was calculated and risk factors were identified using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Among 258 SARI patients, 47% were females, 51% were white, non-Hispanic and 39% were Hispanic. The median age was 63 years (range, 19 to 97 years) and 80% had one or more pre-existing health condition; 9% died in hospital.

An efficient vaccine for the prophylaxis of humans in hotspots of the infection (e.g., Saudi Arabia) is necessary but no commercial vaccines are yet approved. In this study, a chimeric DNA construct was designed to encode an influenza A/H1N1 NA protein which is flanking immunogenic amino acids (aa) 736\u2013761 of MERS-CoV spike protein. Using the generated chimeric construct, a novel recombinant vaccine strain against pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1pdm09) and MERS-CoV was generated (chimeric bivalent 5 \u002B 3). The chimeric bivalent 5 \u002B 3 vaccine strain comprises a recombinant PR8-based vaccine, expressing the PB1, HA, and chimeric NA of pandemic 2009 H1N1. Interestingly, an increase in replication efficiency of the generated vaccine strain was observed when compared to the PR8-based 5 \u002B 3 H1N1pdm09 vaccine strain that lacks the MERS-CoV spike peptide insert. In BALB/c mice, the inactivated chimeric bivalent vaccine induced potent and specific neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV and H1N1pdm09.

This report details several design changes made to a Hepatitis B virus core antigen (HBcAg)-based recombinant vaccine strategy, and their effect in vivo. Initially, several multi-antigen vaccine candidates were able to elicit antibodies specific to three out of four B-cell epitopes inserted into the chimeric proteins. However, a lack of virus neutralization led to a redesign of the vaccines. The focus of the newly redesigned vaccines was to elicit a strong immune response to the YSNIGVCK amino acid motif from PEDV. Genetically modified new vaccine candidates were able to elicit a strong antibody (Ab) response to the YSNIGVCK epitope, which correlated with an increased ability to neutralize the CO strain of PEDV. Additionally, the location of the inserted PEDV epitopes within the vector protein was shown to affect the immune recognition toward the native HBcAg during vaccination.","publish_time":"2018-07-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gillam, Frank; Zhang, Chenming","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40b0d0a814b137b7925799d7dd8053e8567f36da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172244.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X18308314; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X18308314; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29914846/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.06.015","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["strain of PEDV","inserted PEDV epitopes","universal vaccine","multi-antigen vaccine candidates","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","strong immune response","modified new vaccine candidates","recombinant vaccine strategy","Hepatitis B virus core antigen","B-cell epitopes","lack of virus neutralization","causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea","native HBcAg","strong antibody","immune recognition","YSNIGVCK epitope","redesigned vaccines","YSNIGVCK amino acid motif","disease","design changes","vector protein","Alphacoronaviridae genus","antibodies specific","member","development","severe economic loss","Coronaviridae family","mortality rates","chimeric proteins","vaccination","effect","location","increased ability","existence","suckling piglets","report","focus","decades","panzootic"],"language":"en"},

The second objective was to investigate the impact of BRD incidence and treatment frequency on performance and carcass traits. Bovine respiratory disease is the biggest and most costly health challenge facing the cattle industry. The 2 populations used consisted of 1,519 preweaned calves and 3,277 head of feedlot cattle. The incidence rate of BRD in preweaned calves was 11.39%, and among treated cattle, 82.1% were treated once, 13.9% were treated twice, and 4.0% were treated 3 times or more. The incidence of BRD (P = 0.35) and the number of treatments (P = 0.77) had no significant effect on weaning BW. Heritability estimates of the entire preweaned population for BRD resistance and number of treatments were 0.11 \u00B1 0.06 and 0.08 \u00B1 0.05, respectively. The genetic correlation estimates for BRD incidence with weaning BW and birth BW were low (\u22120.02 \u00B1 0.32 and 0.07 \u00B1 0.27, respectively). The same estimate for the number of BRD treatments with weaning BW and birth BW was 0.25 \u00B1 0.35 and 0.30 \u00B1 0.27, respectively. The observed BRD incidence rate for feedlot cattle was observed at 9.43%. Incidence of BRD significantly (P \u003C 0.01) decreased overall and acclimation ADG by 0.06 \u00B1 0.01 kg/d and 0.28 \u00B1 0.03 kg/d, respectively. Carcass traits were also significantly (P \u003C 0.05) affected by BRD incidence; untreated cattle had a 9.1 \u00B1 1.7-kg heavier HCW. Results were similar in the analysis of treatment frequency. The heritability estimate of BRD incidence and the number of treatments were 0.07 \u00B1 0.04 and 0.02 \u00B1 0.03, respectively. Estimates of genetic correlations of BRD incidence with production traits were \u22120.63 \u00B1 0.22 for acclimation ADG, \u22120.04 \u00B1 0.23 for on-test ADG, \u22120.31 \u00B1 0.21 for overall ADG, \u22120.39 \u00B1 0.21 for final BW, \u22120.22 \u00B1 0.22 for HCW, \u22120.03 \u00B1 0.22 for LM area, 0.24 \u00B1 0.25 for fat, and \u22120.43 \u00B1 0.20 for marbling score.

Various types of RNA\u2013RNA crossovers were described including crosses between the same or different viral RNAs or between viral and cellular RNAs. Likewise, a variety of molecular mechanisms are known to support RNA recombination, such as replicative events (based on internal or end-to-end replicase switchings) along with non-replicative joining among RNA fragments of viral and/or cellular origin. Such mechanisms as RNA decay or RNA interference are responsible for RNA fragmentation and trans-esterification reactions which are likely accountable for ligation of RNA fragments. Numerous host factors were found to affect the profiles of viral RNA recombinants and significant differences in recombination frequency were observed among various RNA viruses. Comparative analyses of viral sequences allowed for the development of evolutionary models in order to explain adaptive phenotypic changes and co-evolving sites. Many questions remain to be answered by forthcoming RNA recombination research. (1) How various factors modulate the ability of viral replicase to switch templates, (2) What is the intracellular location of RNA\u2013RNA template switchings, (3) Mechanisms and factors responsible for non-replicative RNA recombination, (4) Mechanisms of integration of RNA viral sequences with cellular genomic DNA, and (5) What is the role of RNA splicing and ribozyme activity. From an evolutionary stand point, it is not known how RNA viruses parasitize new host species via recombination, nor is it obvious what the contribution of RNA recombination is among other RNA modification pathways.

Respiratory pathogen carriage including seven viruses and four bacteria was assessed by quantitative PCR. Results The homeless population was characterized by a majority of individuals of North African origin (300/479, 62.6%) with a relatively high prevalence of chronic homelessness (175/465, 37.6%). We found a high prevalence of respiratory symptoms and signs (168/476, 35.3%), a very high prevalence of bacterial carriage (313/477, 65.6%), especially Haemophilus influenzae (280/477, 58.7%), and a lower prevalence of virus carriage (51/473, 10.8%) with human rhinovirus being the most frequent (25/473, 5.3%).

Identification of epitopes on the PEDV M protein will be helpful in the elucidation of the antigenic properties of this protein. RESULTS: One hybridoma cell line secreting anti-M protein monoclonal antibody (McAb) was generated and designated 4D4. To map the epitopes on the PEDV M protein, a total of 17 partially overlapping fragments covering the C-terminus of M protein were expressed as fusion proteins with a 6\u00D7His tag or a GST tag. A linear motif, (193)TGWAFYVR(200), was identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot (WB) analysis using McAb 4D4. The motif (195)WAFYVR(200) was the minimal requirement for reactivity, as demonstrated by removing amino acids individually from both ends of the motif (193)TGWAFYVR(200). The result of WB analysis showed that the 4D4-defined epitope could be recognized by PEDV-positive serum, but not transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)-positive serum. Furthermore, this epitope was highly conserved among different PEDV strains, as shown by alignment and comparison of sequences. CONCLUSION: A McAb, 4D4, directed against the M protein of PEDV, was obtained, and the 4D4-defined minimal epitope sequence was (195)WAFYVR(200). The McAb could serve as a candidate for development of a McAb-based antigen capture ELISA for detection of PEDV. The epitope identified provides a basis for the development of epitope-based differential diagnostic techniques and may be useful in the design of epitope-based vaccines.","publish_time":"2012-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Zhibang; Chen, Jianfei; Shi, Hongyan; Chen, Xiaojin; Shi, Da; Feng, Li; Yang, Bin","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f911fcc63f431561d8dc09ed831ce558ca2d773.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3519612.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-225; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23025700/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsxMDAx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GST","WB","PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein of PEDV","McAb 4D4","4D4-defined epitope","detection of PEDV","development of epitope","protein monoclonal antibody","PEDV-positive serum","design of epitope","major structural protein of coronaviruses","different PEDV strains","minimal epitope sequence","designated 4D4","protein of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","McAb-based antigen capture ELISA","based vaccines","linear motif","TGWAFYVR","result of WB analysis","minimal requirement","GST tag","Identification of epitopes","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","hybridoma cell line secreting anti-","western blot","little information","TGEV","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","differential diagnostic techniques","formation of protective antibodies","overlapping fragments","RESULTS","alignment","C-terminus","elucidation","total","membrane","antigenic properties","reactivity","ends","BACKGROUND","candidate","basis","amino acids","fusion proteins","comparison of sequences","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

In order to control the spread of an epidemic, the effective management of rapidly increased medical waste through establishing a temporary reverse logistics system is of vital importance. However, no research has been conducted with the focus on the design of an epidemic reverse logistics network for dealing with medical waste during epidemic outbreaks, which, if improperly treated, may accelerate disease spread and pose a significant risk for both medical staffs and patients. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel multi-objective multi-period mixed integer program for reverse logistics network design in epidemic outbreaks, which aims at determining the best locations of temporary facilities and the transportation strategies for effective management of the exponentially increased medical waste within a very short period. The application of the model is illustrated with a case study based on the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. Even though the uncertainty of the future COVID-19 spread tendency is very high at the time of this research, several general policy recommendations can still be obtained based on computational experiments and quantitative analyses. Among other insights, the results suggest installing temporary incinerators may be an effective solution for managing the tremendous increase of medical waste during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, but the location selection of these temporary incinerators is of significant importance. Due to the limitation on available data and knowledge at present stage, more real-world information are needed to assess the effectiveness of the current solution.","publish_time":"2020-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Hao; Sun, Xu; Solvang, Wei Deng; Zhao, Xu","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7084373.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32182811/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17051770","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["epidemic disease","increased medical waste","epidemic outbreaks","epidemic reverse logistics network","temporary incinerators","medical staffs","temporary reverse logistics system","tremendous increase of medical waste","reverse logistics network design","effective management","effective solution","significant importance","significant treats","significant risk","future COVID","coronavirus disease","research","spread tendency","Wuhan","best locations of temporary facilities","short period","vital importance","current solution","novel multi-objective multi-period mixed integer program","knowledge","present stage","transportation strategies","available data","location selection","real-world information","time","paper","human beings","general policy recommendations","model","computational experiments","quantitative analyses","limitation","effectiveness","case study","patients","results","focus","uncertainty","insights","global crisis","application","China","order"],"language":"en"},

This feature has previously relegated HRVs to being considered passengers in acute respiratory infections. HRVs remain poorly characterized and are seldom included as a target in diagnostic panels despite their pathogenic potential, infection-associated healthcare expenditure and relatively unmoderated elicitation of an antiviral state. Objectives To test the hypothesis that respiratory viruses are proportionately more or less likely to co-occur, particularly the HRVs. Study design Retrospective PCR-based analyses of 1247 specimens for 17 viruses, including HRV strains, identified 131 specimens containing two or more targets. We investigated the proportions of co-detections and compared the proportion of upper vs. lower respiratory tract presentations in the HRV positive group. Both univariate contingency table and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify trends of association among the viruses present in co-detections. Results Many of the co-detections occurred in patterns. In particular, HRV detection was associated with a reduced probability of detecting human adenoviruses, coronaviruses, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, influenza A virus, and the polyomaviruses KIPyV and WUPyV (p \u22640.05). No single HRV species nor cluster of particular strains predominated. Conclusions HRVs were proportionately under-represented among viral co-detections.

The added laboratory testing capacity provided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention LRN assets helps protect persons who reside in South Korea, US military personnel and civilians in South Korea, and those who reside in the continental United States.","publish_time":"2017-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parker, J.

Diabetes-related factors of glycemic control, medication pharmacodynamics, social distancing, and insulin access can impact the severity of COVID-19 infection. In this commentary, we explore how digital health can support the diabetes community through the pandemic. For those living with diabetes, digital health presents the opportunity to access care with greater convenience while not having to expose themselves to infection in an in-person clinic. Digital diabetes applications can increase agency in self-care and produce clinically significant improvement in glycemic control through facilitating the capture of diabetes device data. However, the ability to share these data back to the clinic to inform virtual care and enhance diabetes coaching and guidance remains a challenge. In the end, it requires an unnecessarily high level of technical sophistication on the clinic\u0027s part and on those living with diabetes to routinely use their diabetes device data in clinic visits, virtual or otherwise. As the world comes together to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, close collaboration among the global diabetes community is critical to understand and manage the sustained impact of the pandemic on people living with diabetes.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gamble, Anissa; Pham, Quynh; Goyal, Shivani; Cafazzo, Joseph A","journal":"JMIR diabetes","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/19581; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32392473/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Digital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diabetes coaching","global diabetes community","Digital diabetes applications","capture of diabetes device data","living","Diabetes-related factors of glycemic control","global pandemic","digital health","virtual care","severity of COVID","clinic visits","people","person clinic","infection","insulin access","sustained impact","medication pharmacodynamics","social distancing","opportunity","close collaboration","self-care","agency","significant improvement","high level of technical sophistication","clinic\u0027s","guidance","greater convenience","coronavirus disease","challenge","commentary","end","world","ability"],"language":"en"},

The recent outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in South Korea and the continuing reports of MERS-CoV cases from Saudi Arabia highlight the need for active surveillance for MERS-CoV in returning pilgrims or travellers from the Middle East. Public Health England Birmingham Laboratory (PHEBL) is one of a few selected UK public health laboratories responsible for MERS-CoV screening in travellers returning to the UK from the Middle East who present to hospital with severe respiratory symptoms. The results of the PHEBL MERS-CoV screening and surveillance over the past 3 years is presented. Methods UK travellers/pilgrims who returned from the Middle East and presented to a hospital with respiratory symptoms were studied over the period February 1, 2013 to December 31, 2015. Patients with respiratory symptoms, who satisfied the Public Health England MERS-CoV case algorithm, were tested for MERS-CoV and other respiratory tract viruses on admission to hospital. Results Two hundred and two patients suspected of having MERS-CoV were tested. None of them had a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection. A viral aetiology was detected in half (50.3%) of the cases, with rhinoviruses, influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), and influenza B being most frequent. Peak testing occurred following the annual Hajj season and in other periods of raised national awareness. Conclusions Respiratory tract infections in travellers/pilgrims returning to the UK from the Middle East are mainly due to rhinoviruses, influenza A, and influenza B. Whilst MERS-CoV was not detected in the 202 patients studied, heightened awareness of the possibility of MERS-CoV and continuous proactive surveillance are essential to rapidly identify cases of MERS-CoV and other seasonal respiratory tract viruses such as avian influenza, in patients presenting to hospital. Early identification and isolation may prevent outbreaks in nosocomial settings.","publish_time":"2016-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Atabani, Sowsan F.; Wilson, Steven; Overton-Lewis, Clare; Workman, Judith; Kidd, I.

Currently, there is no specific therapy or vaccine with proven effectiveness for MERS-CoV infections. Methods A combination of ribavirin and interferon therapy was used for the treatment of five MERS-CoV-positive patients. We reviewed the therapeutic schedule and the outcome of these patients. Results All patients were critically ill with acute respiratory distress syndrome treated with adjunctive corticosteroids and were on mechanical ventilation at the time of initiation of therapy. The median time from admission to therapy with ribavirin and interferon was 19 (range 10\u201322) days. None of the patients responded to the supportive or therapeutic interventions and all died of their illness. Conclusions While ribavirin and interferon may be effective in some patients, our practical experience suggests that critically ill patients with multiple comorbidities who are diagnosed late in the course of their illness may not benefit from combination antiviral therapy as preclinical data suggest. There is clearly an urgent need for a novel effective antiviral therapy for this emerging global threat.","publish_time":"2014-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A.; Momattin, Hisham; Dib, Jean; Memish, Ziad A.","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8186586de026807b862de876abfeef625a9a78cb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110882.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2013.12.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971213003767; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971213003767; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24406736/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsxMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["interferon therapy","ill patients","specific therapy","positive patients","combination antiviral therapy","novel effective antiviral therapy","combination of ribavirin","MERS-CoV infections","illness","acute respiratory distress syndrome","time of initiation","median time","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","therapeutic interventions","therapeutic schedule","proven effectiveness","adjunctive corticosteroids","Summary Background","mechanical ventilation","vaccine","emerging global threat","urgent need","practical experience","admission","preclinical data","treatment","high case-fatality rate","range","outcome","multiple comorbidities","Methods","Conclusions","days","course"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Network centrality metrics were used to characterize hospital-acquired Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (HA-MERS) outbreaks in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia between 2012 and 2016. Covariate-adjusted multivariable logistic regression models were applied to assess the effect of individual level risk factors and network level metrics associated with increase in length of hospital stay and risk of deaths from MERS. RESULTS: About 27% of MERS cases were hospital acquired during the study period. The median age of healthcare workers and hospitalized patients were 35 years and 63 years, respectively, Although HA-MERS were more connected, we found no significant difference in degree centrality metrics between HA-MERS and non-HA-MERS cases. Pre-existing medical conditions (adjusted Odds ratio (aOR) = 2.43, 95% confidence interval: (CI) [1.11\u20135.33]) and hospitalized patients (aOR = 29.99, 95% CI [1.80\u201348.65]) were the strongest risk predictors of death from MERS. The risk of death associated with 1-day increased length of stay was significantly higher for patients with comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Our investigation also revealed that patients with an HA-MERS infection experienced a significantly longer hospital stay and were more likely to die from the disease. Healthcare worker should be reminded of their potential role as hubs for pathogens because of their proximity to and regular interaction with infected patients. On the other hand, this study has shown that while healthcare workers acted as epidemic attenuators, hospitalized patients played the role of an epidemic amplifier.","publish_time":"2018-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adegboye, Oyelola; Saffary, Timor; Adegboye, Majeed; Elfaki, Faiz","journal":"J Infect Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a18d8c68591f272a53e17dc1be216e0cab1749d0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102844.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034118303186; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034118303186; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2018.12.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30578142/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsxODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["HA-MERS infection","hospitalized patients","non-HA-MERS cases","infected patients","length of hospital","longer hospital","risk of deaths","network level metrics","Network centrality metrics","degree centrality metrics","aOR","strongest risk predictors of death","years","CI","effect of individual level risk factors","median age of healthcare workers","day increased length of stay","epidemic attenuators","potential role","epidemic amplifier","study period","outbreaks of infectious diseases","adjusted Odds ratio","networks of infected individuals","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","significant difference","Pre-existing medical conditions","proximity","pathogens","transmission","regular interaction","multivariable logistic regression models","Covariate","hubs","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","BACKGROUND","confidence interval","METHODS","investigation","comorbidities","CONCLUSION","hand","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Human conjunctiva and primary pterygium tissues were collected from pterygium patients who underwent surgery. The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes was determined in human primary conjunctival and pterygium cells, human ocular and other tissue cell lines, mesenchymal stem cells as well as mouse ocular and other tissues by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and SYBR green PCR. RESULTS: RT-PCR analysis showed consistent expression by 2 ACE2 gene primers in 2 out of 3 human conjunctival cells and pterygium cell lines. Expression by 2 TMPRSS2 gene primers could only be found in 1 out of 3 pterygium cell lines, but not in any conjunctival cells. Compared with the lung A549 cells, similar expression was noted in conjunctival and pterygium cells. In addition, mouse cornea had comparable expression of Tmprss2 gene and lower but prominent Ace2 gene expression compared with the lung tissue. CONCLUSION: Considering the necessity of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for SARS-CoV-2 infection, our results suggest that conjunctiva would be less likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2, whereas pterygium possesses some possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection. With high and consistent expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 in cornea, cornea rather than conjunctiva has higher potential to be infected by SARS-CoV-2. Precaution is necessary to prevent possible SARS-CoV-2 infection through ocular surface in clinical practice.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Di; Chen, Chong-Bo; Jhanji, Vishal; Xu, Ciyan; Yuan, Xiang-Ling; Liang, Jia-Jian; Huang, Yuqiang; Cen, Ling-Ping; Ng, Tsz Kin","journal":"Eye (Lond)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/facd05644e94ee245bc951bf5ce827f3d4992c12.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7205026.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41433-020-0939-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32382146/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsyMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SYBR","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pterygium cells","human conjunctival cells","tissue cells","consistent expression of Ace2","mouse ocular cells","human ocular","comparable expression of Tmprss2 gene","prominent Ace2 gene expression","pterygium cell lines","possible SARS-CoV","TMPRSS2 genes","similar expression","TMPRSS2 gene primers","ACE2 gene primers","pterygium patients","human primary conjunctival","primary pterygium tissues","lung A549 cells","expressions of SARS","possibility of SARS","mesenchymal stem cells","mouse cornea","tissue cell lines","infection","ocular surface","lung tissue","RT-PCR analysis","RESULTS","SYBR green PCR","reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","type","transmembrane serine protease","comparison","receptor angiotensin","enzyme","clinical practice","higher potential","addition","METHODS","Precaution","necessity","surgery","PURPOSE","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Over the past years, hand hygiene guidelines have been developed by different agencies at international, national and subnational levels. A comparison of these documents could help in understanding recommendations in different parts of the world and the methods used for their development. Guidelines were identified through search engines, electronic libraries, and personal contacts, and their content was analysed using an adapted version of a tool from the European DG XII-funded HARMONY project. Twenty-two guidelines were retrieved and 21 were evaluated. Documents varied in scope, approach, content and terminology. Some were primarily advisory directives, whereas others focused on the technical issues of why, when, and how to perform hand hygiene. The extent to which evidence was collected and assessed varied considerably and details were provided only in very few. Grading systems and definitions to indicate the strength of evidence and recommendations also differed. The intended outcome was to improve hand hygiene practices in healthcare, thus leading to a reduction of healthcare-associated infections and/or antimicrobial resistance. Although overall agreement on indications and procedures was noted, the range and depth of recommendations on best practices and implementation varied. Essential aspects such as compliance measurement and audits to assess guideline effectiveness were neglected in most documents. In conclusion, there is a need for a more consistent approach leading to recommendations based on a thorough evaluation of evidence and applicable worldwide. Aspects related to implementation and impact monitoring deserve greater attention.","publish_time":"2009-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cookson, B.; Mathai, E.; Allegranzi, B.; Pessoa-Silva, C.

Smith is an endemic species in China, which has been proved to be an important Chinese herbal medicine. However, chemical composition and bioactivity of essential oil (EO) of C. fortumei (J.)

In present study, we isolated EO from the plant by supercritical carbon dioxide extraction assay (SFE-CO(2)), and investigated on cancer cells MGC-803, MCF-7, BGC-823, Bcap-37, A375, and A549 in vitro by MTT assay. 26 compounds were identified by GC\u2013MS analysis, and the EO showed significant antitumor activities against MGC-803, Bcap-37, and A549 cancer cell lines (IC(50) values ranging from 0.15 to 0.24 mg/mL), and the activities of its main component were also studied. Subsequent fluorescence staining and flow cytometry analysis indicated that the EO could induce apoptosis in MGC-803, Bcap-37, and A549 cell lines, and the apoptosis ratios reached 26.44 % after 48 h of treatment at 0.15 mg/mL in MGC-803 cells.

To inform CBP policies for threatened terrestrial vertebrates, we evaluated the number and representation of threatened vertebrate species on the IUCN Red List held in the ISIS zoo network and estimated the complexity of their management as metapopulations. Our results show that 695 of the 3,955 (23%) terrestrial vertebrate species in ISIS zoos are threatened. Only two of the 59 taxonomic orders show a higher proportion of threatened species in ISIS zoos than would be expected if species were selected at random. In addition, for most taxa, the management of a zoo metapopulation of more than 250 individuals will require the coordination of a cluster of 11 to 24 ISIS zoos within a radius of 2,000 km. Thus, in the zoo network, the representation of species that may require CBPs is currently low and the spatial distribution of these zoo populations makes management difficult. Although the zoo community may have the will and the logistical potential to contribute to conservation actions, including CBPs, to do so will require greater collaboration between zoos and other institutions, alongside the development of international agreements that facilitate cross-border movement of zoo animals. To maximize the effectiveness of integrated conservation actions that include CBPs, it is fundamental that the non-zoo conservation community acknowledges and integrates the expertise and facilities of zoos where it can be helpful.","publish_time":"2013-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Conde, Dalia A.; Colchero, Fernando; Gusset, Markus; Pearce-Kelly, Paul; Byers, Onnie; Flesness, Nate; Browne, Robert K.; Jones, Owen R.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4e99c8b861f4457b4a0518860bc9e52f5348e87.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3859473.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24348999/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0080311","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsyMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CBP","IUCN Red List","ISIS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ISIS zoos","zoo community","ISIS zoo network","number of species","representation of species","zoo populations","CBPs","zoo metapopulation","representation of threatened vertebrate species","non-zoo conservation community","terrestrial vertebrate species","higher proportion of threatened species","facilities of zoos","cross-border movement of zoo animals","conservation breeding programs","effectiveness of integrated conservation actions","management difficult","terrestrial vertebrates","IUCN Red List","institutions","spatial distribution","complexity","development of international agreements","expertise","current extinction trends","taxonomic orders","CBP policies","greater collaboration","individuals","logistical potential","taxa","cluster","coordination","metapopulations","radius","addition","results"],"language":"en"},

Coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein trimers promote entry into cells and are the main target of the humoral immune response. We show here that SARS-CoV-2 S mediates entry in VeroE6 cells and in BHK cells transiently transfected with human ACE2, establishing ACE2 as a functional receptor for this novel coronavirus. We further demonstrate that the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S bind with similar affinities to human ACE2, which correlates with the efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 among humans. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S1/S2 subunits, which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from SARS-CoV and other SARS-related CoVs. We determined a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer, demonstrating spontaneous opening of the receptor-binding domain, and providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry. Finally, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV S murine polyclonal sera potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated entry into target cells, thereby indicating that cross-neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved S epitopes can be elicited upon vaccination.","publish_time":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walls, Alexandra C.; Park, Young-Jun; Tortorici, M.

Objectives We determined the etiology of respiratory viral infections in palivizumab recipients, and monitored the clinical outcome and HRSV genotype in HRSV-infected infants. Study design Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected from children receiving palivizumab who consulted or were hospitalized for acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) during the 2004\u20132005 season. Viral cultures and multiplex RT-PCR for influenza A/B, HRSV and human metapneumovirus were performed. The fusion (F) gene of HRSV amplicons was also sequenced. Results Among 116 enrolled patients, 51 (44%) had \u22651 episode of ARTI for a total of 93 visits. At least one virus was identified in 33 (36%) of the 93 NPA samples; HRSV accounted for 11 (33%) of confirmed viral etiologies. Compared to subjects who had other viral ARTI, HRSV-positive subjects had less fever (p =0.01) and tended to have more bronchiolitis (p =0.07). Ten subjects (11 visits) developed HRSV infection, although only one was hospitalized. HRSV was detected after a median of 5.5 palivizumab doses and a median of 14 days after the last dose. One of the 11 HRSV strains tested had a F mutation located in the palivizumab-binding site. Conclusion HRSV is still a major cause of ARTI in children receiving palivizumab, although the outcome of infected children appears mild.","publish_time":"2008-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boivin, Guy; Caouette, Georges; Frenette, Line; Carbonneau, Julie; Ouakki, Manale; De Serres, Gaston","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/82b54872490f48eb7da195d7934d347f4ba21692.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172843.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18164233/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653207004325; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2007.11.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653207004325","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsyMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRSV","ARTI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HRSV infection","HRSV genotype","Conclusion HRSV","HRSV strains","HRSV-positive subjects","HRSV-infected infants","gene of HRSV amplicons","viral ARTI","palivizumab recipients","palivizumab doses","Abstract Background Palivizumab","palivizumab-binding site","etiology of respiratory viral infections","Viral cultures","episode of ARTI","viral etiologies","outcome of infected children","major cause of ARTI","median","visits","severe human respiratory syncytial virus","acute respiratory tract infection","clinical outcome","human metapneumovirus","F mutation","humanized monoclonal antibody","multiplex RT-PCR","NPAs","influenza","Study design Nasopharyngeal aspirates","fever","days","total","fusion","Results","enrolled patients","Objectives","NPA samples","bronchiolitis","season"],"language":"en"},

This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of Cryptosporidia, Eimeria, Giardia, and Strongyloides in calves on smallholder dairy farms (SDF) in Mukurwe-ini District, Nyeri County, Kenya. These infections have been associated with economic losses by decreased growth rates, decreased productivity, and increased susceptibility to other diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational study was conducted on 109 farms in Mukurwe-ini District, Nyeri County, Kenya, where 220 calf fecal samples (each calf at 4 and 6 weeks of age) from 110 calves (1 set of twins) were collected and analyzed for Cryptosporidia, Eimeria, Giardia, and helminth parasites. RESULTS: Eimeria oocysts, Cryptosporidia oocysts, and Strongyloides eggs were detected in the fecal samples examined, but no Giardia cysts were found. The overall period prevalence of Eimeria, Cryptosporidia, and Strongyloides was 42.7% (47/110), 13.6% (15/110), and 5.4% (6/110), respectively. The prevalence at 4 weeks of age for Eimeria, Cryptosporidia, and Strongyloides was 30.0% (33/110), 8.2% (9/110), and 3.7% (4/109), respectively, while the prevalence at 6 weeks of age was 20.2% (22/109), 6.5% (7/107), and 2.7% (3/110), respectively. There was, however, no significant difference in the prevalence at 4 and 6 weeks (p\u003E0.05).

The most common human rhinoviruses (HRVs) have been detected in middle ear effusions (MEE), but there is only limited data available about the closely related human enteroviruses (HEVs). The newly discovered human bocavirus (HBoV) has not, however, been identified in MEE of OME children. Objectives The aim of our study was to determine the presence of HBoV and HRV/HEV and the rate of coinfection in a set of MEE samples collected from OME children. Study design Seventy-five MEE samples from 54 children with no acute respiratory symptoms were studied with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of HRV/HEV and quantitative PCR for detection of HBoV. Results Twenty-six (35%) of 75 MEE samples were positive for viral nucleic acid, 22 (29%) for HEV, 10 (13%) for HRV and 2 (3%) for HBoV. There was no statistically significant difference between mucoid and serous effusions in the rate of virus detection. Forty-three percent of bilateral cases showed a contra-lateral difference in viral finding.

One of the main aims of systems biology is to couple these together to produce integrated models across multiple spatial scales and physical processes. In this review, we formulate a definition of multi-scale in terms of levels of biological organisation and describe the types of model that are found at each level. Key issues that arise in trying to formulate and solve multi-scale and multi-physics models are considered and examples of how these issues have been addressed are given for two of the more mature fields in computational biology: the molecular dynamics of ion channels and cardiac modelling. As even more complex models are developed over the coming few years, it will be necessary to develop new methods to model them (in particular in coupling across the interface between stochastic and deterministic processes) and new techniques will be required to compute their solutions efficiently on massively parallel computers. We outline how we envisage these developments occurring.","publish_time":"2008-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Southern, James; Pitt-Francis, Joe; Whiteley, Jonathan; Stokeley, Daniel; Kobashi, Hiromichi; Nobes, Ross; Kadooka, Yoshimasa; Gavaghan, David","journal":"Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f691cfe206f42b89d2f7099524fdf9fd663f44b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112301.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079610707000673; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0079610707000673","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjszMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["complex models","multi-physics models","levels of biology","integrated models","computational biology","definition of multi-scale","deterministic processes","physical processes","terms of levels","main aims of systems biology","new methods","new techniques","powerful computers","parallel computers","types of model","Key issues","molecular dynamics of ion channels","multiple spatial scales","availability","interface","biological organisation","cardiac modelling","biotechnology","formulation","examples","Abstract Recent advances","mature fields","coupling","solutions","years","review","developments"],"language":"en"},

The continuous spread and great pandemic potential of MERS-CoV make it necessarily important to develop effective vaccines. We previously demonstrated that the application of Gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM) particles as a bacterial vector displaying the MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) is a very promising MERS vaccine candidate that is capable of producing potential neutralization antibodies. We have also used the rabies virus (RV) as a viral vector to design a recombinant vaccine by expressing the MERS-CoV S1 (spike) protein on the surface of the RV. In this study, we compared the immunological efficacy of the vaccine candidates in BALB/c mice in terms of the levels of humoral and cellular immune responses. The results show that the rabies virus vector-based vaccine can induce remarkably earlier antibody response and higher levels of cellular immunity than the GEM particles vector. However, the GEM particles vector-based vaccine candidate can induce remarkably higher antibody response, even at a very low dose of 1 \u00B5g. These results indicate that vaccines constructed using different vaccine vector platforms for the same pathogen have different rates and trends in humoral and cellular immune responses in the same animal model. This discovery not only provides more alternative vaccine development platforms for MERS-CoV vaccine development, but also provides a theoretical basis for our future selection of vaccine vector platforms for other specific pathogens.","publish_time":"2020-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Entao; Yan, Feihu; Huang, Pei; Chi, Hang; Xu, Shengnan; Li, Guohua; Liu, Chuanyu; Feng, Na; Wang, Hualei; Zhao, Yongkun; Yang, Songtao; Xia, Xianzhu","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e63f49d69364214383bb4bd983e941816b11b8da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7019946.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v12010125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31968702/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjszMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV vaccine development","different vaccine vector platforms","vaccine candidates","promising MERS vaccine candidate","recombinant vaccine","MERS-CoV S1","rabies virus vector-based vaccine","GEM particles vector-based vaccine candidate","future selection of vaccine vector platforms","viral vector","bacterial vector","alternative vaccine development platforms","emerging MERS coronavirus","MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain","great pandemic potential of MERS","cellular immune responses","levels of humoral","higher levels of cellular immunity","higher antibody response","results","earlier antibody response","severe respiratory diseases","different rates","effective vaccines","severe infectious disease","potential neutralization antibodies","Middle East respiratory syndrome","trends","BALB","c mice","RBD","high-mortality","terms","spike","application of Gram-positive enhancer matrix","continuous spread","immunological efficacy","theoretical basis","protein","RV","specific pathogens","animal model","study","surface","low dose","\u00B5g","discovery"],"language":"en"},

The life cycle of the parasite is complex, involving a polychaete and a salmonid host. Infection dynamics are greatly influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature and water velocity. If we are to control the disease it is important to predict the impact of environmental scenarios on spore concentration and infection prevalence. Here, we introduce a model based on partial differential equations to study the spore concentration in the river and the infection prevalence of returning salmon. The analysis of the model shows that for current climate conditions, additional dam release can reduce the actinospore concentration up to 48% and the prevalence up to 40% thus providing a potential disease management option. However, the infection risk is likely to increase for future climate conditions by 10\u201354% and this will lead to an infection level comparable to that of a recent high-disease year. Our simulations show that dam removal cannot be assumed to mitigate the effect of climate change or to have influence on infection prevalence. We show that our detailed model system can be reduced to a simpler exponential dose-response function, which predicts infection levels based on transmission rates, travel time and mean spore concentration, quantities that can be measured in-situ or given empirically. The dose-response function may therefore be a useful tool in disease management.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schakau, Vanessa; Hilker, Frank M.; Lewis, Mark A.","journal":"Ecological Complexity","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/372b5ab8e95678ecb55a283d2786ff899d044cec.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f297ff6ac7a5dfde238e171ef3fff9a2c6e7877f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1476945X19300364; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1476945X19300364","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs0MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection prevalence","infection levels","infection risk","Infection dynamics","infection level comparable","mean spore concentration","actinospore concentration","current climate conditions","future climate conditions","potential disease management option","recent high-disease year","effect of climate change","detailed model system","simpler exponential dose-response function","environmental factors","Klamath River","dam removal","additional dam release","impact of environmental scenarios","myxozoan parasite Ceratomyxa shasta","travel time","transmission rates","partial differential equations","useful tool","polychaete","temperature","main contributor of mortality","quantities","influence","life cycle","California","water velocity","salmonid host","simulations","analysis","situ"],"language":"en"},

The virus infects the intestinal epithelium and causes villous atrophy, resulting in diarrhea and dehydration. Interaction of the viral spike (S) surface glycoprotein \u2212 through its S1 subunit \u2212 with the host cell receptor is the first step in infection and the main determinant for virus tropism. As for several other alphacoronaviruses including the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), the aminopeptidase N (APN) protein was reported to be a functional receptor for PEDV. In this study we examined the role of APN as a receptor. We show that overexpression of porcine APN renders MDCK cells susceptible to TGEV, but not to PEDV. Consistently, unlike TGEV-S1, PEDV-S1 exhibited no binding to cell-surface expressed APN or to a soluble version of APN. Moreover, preincubation of these viruses with soluble APN or pretreatment of APN expressing ST cells with soluble TGEV-S1 blocked TGEV infection, but had no effect on infection by PEDV. The combined observations indicated that APN is not required for PEDV infection. To definitively prove this conclusion, we applied CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering to knock out APN expression in PEDV-susceptible porcine (ST) and human cell lines (Huh7 and HeLa). As a consequence these cells no longer bound TGEV-S1 and HCoV-229E-S1 at their surface and were resistant to infection by the corresponding viruses. However, genetic ablation of APN expression had no effect on their infectability by PEDV, demonstrating that APN is not essential for PEDV cell entry.","publish_time":"2017-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Wentao; Luo, Rui; He, Qigai; van Kuppeveld, Frank J.M.; Rottier, Peter J.M.; Bosch, Berend-Jan","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75a14c9f86596159e4e716f48ee49137bd558e0d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114539.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170217301375; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2017.03.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170217301375; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28363778/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs0MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","APN","MDCK","ST"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV-S1","soluble APN","PEDV infection","pretreatment of APN","role of APN","overexpression of porcine APN","soluble version of APN","PEDV-susceptible porcine","cell-surface expressed APN","PEDV cell entry","soluble TGEV-S1 blocked TGEV infection","E-S1","bound TGEV-S1","genetic ablation of APN expression","S1 subunit","host cell receptor","ST cells","porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus","virus tropism","Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","human cell lines","MDCK cells susceptible","human coronavirus","surface glycoprotein","HCoV","effect","functional receptor","corresponding viruses","emerging pathogenic coronavirus","significant economic burden","step","binding","viral spike","Cas9 genome engineering","main determinant","villous atrophy","CRISPR","swine industry","intestinal epithelium","Huh7","HeLa","alphacoronaviruses","aminopeptidase N","infectability","Interaction","consequence","preincubation","conclusion","dehydration","combined observations","study"],"language":"en"},

This process is also involved in the antiviral response at multiple levels, including the direct elimination of intruding viruses (virophagy), the presentation of viral antigens, the fitness of immune cells, and the inhibition of excessive inflammatory reactions. In line with its central role in immunity, viruses have evolved mechanisms to interfere with or to evade the autophagic process, and in some cases, even to harness autophagy or constituents of the autophagic machinery for their replication. Given the devastating consequences of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the question arises whether manipulating autophagy might be an expedient approach to fight the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

Four HIV patients (two males and two females) were interviewed in depth by an experienced medical social worker. Findings revealed that even as the illness trajectory of HIV has shifted from a terminal condition to a chronic one, living with HIV continues to be fraught with difficulty as society, especially in the Asian context, perceives HIV with much fear and disapproval. The participants had an overwhelming sense of shame when they were initially diagnosed with HIV and they had to reconstruct a liveable identity by containing the shroud of shame, reinforcing their normative identities and constructing new ones. These strategies help them to keep their shame at bay.

The empirical evidence is generally positive but mixed, and almost exclusively focuses on U.S. data. Using several distinct commodity indexes over the period 1993\u20132019, we investigate the case of an investor in Canada, a commodity-currency country where equities are already exposed to commodity beta. We use spanning tests and several out-of-sample performance measures for both risk-averse and disappointment-averse investors. Overall, we find that while the diversification potential of commodities was limited in Canada before and during financialization, the post-financialization period offers new opportunities. The evidence suggests that portfolio performance is significantly improved using some, but not all, commodity indexes. Thus, the choice of a relevant commodity index matters as a vehicle for diversification. Finally, compounding an international component to the sectorial diversification of the portfolio can significantly improve its performance.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gagnon, Marie-H\u00E9l\u00E8ne; Manseau, Guillaume; Power, Gabriel J.","journal":"International Review of Financial Analysis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b131e698d65510860ad8fe50c7f1d6bc2fc3b09.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521920301599?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1057521920301599; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.irfa.2020.101515","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["U.S.","Canada"],"keyphrases":["portfolio diversification","commodity beta","portfolio performance","distinct commodity indexes","sectorial diversification","commodity-currency country","diversification potential of commodities","relevant commodity index matters","Canada","post-financialization period","sample performance measures","risk-averse","empirical evidence","disappointment-averse investors","vehicle","equities","alternative assets","new opportunities","choice","Abstract","international component","case","spanning tests","data"],"language":"en"},

Its transmission mainly occurs by the bite of an infected tick. However, consuming milk products from infected livestock animals caused TBEV cases. To better understand TBEV transmission via the alimentary route, we studied viral infection of human intestinal epithelial cells. Caco-2 cells were used to investigate pathological effects of TBEV infection. TBEV-infected Caco-2 monolayers showed morphological changes including cytoskeleton rearrangements and cytoplasmic vacuolization. Ultrastructural analysis revealed dilatation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and further enlargement to TBEV containing caverns. Caco-2 monolayers maintained an intact epithelial barrier with stable transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) during early stage of infection. Concomitantly, viruses were detected in the basolateral medium, implying a transcytosis pathway. When Caco-2 cells were pre-treated with inhibitors of cellular pathways of endocytosis TBEV cell entry was efficiently blocked, suggesting that actin filaments (Cytochalasin) and microtubules (Nocodazole) are important for PI3K-dependent (LY294002) virus endocytosis. Moreover, experimental fluid uptake assay showed increased intracellular accumulation of FITC-dextran containing vesicles. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed co-localization of TBEV with early endosome antigen-1 (EEA1) as well as with sorting nexin-5 (SNX5), pointing to macropinocytosis as trafficking mechanism. In the late phase of infection, further evidence was found for translocation of virus via the paracellular pathway. Five days after infection TER was slightly decreased. Epithelial barrier integrity was impaired due to increased epithelial apoptosis, leading to passive viral translocation. These findings illuminate pathomechanisms in TBEV infection of human intestinal epithelial cells and viral transmission via the alimentary route.","publish_time":"2014-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Chao; Achazi, Katharina; M\u00F6ller, Lars; Schulzke, Joerg D.; Niedrig, Matthias; B\u00FCcker, Roland","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ead974b5b07697c36ad42b5f58d9a75c6e2fe75.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4018392.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24820351/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0096957","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TBEV"],"locations":["Europe","Asia"],"keyphrases":["TBEV transmission","TBEV-infected Caco","TBEV cases","TBEV infection of human intestinal epithelial cells","pathological effects of TBEV infection","infection TER","viral infection of human intestinal epithelial cells","co-localization of TBEV","epithelial apoptosis","viral transmission","early stage of infection","intact epithelial barrier","Epithelial barrier integrity","late phase of infection","virus endocytosis","translocation of virus","inhibitors of cellular pathways of endocytosis TBEV cell entry","monolayers","passive viral translocation","alimentary route","infected tick","viruses","infected livestock animals","Tick-borne encephalitis virus","important vector","transcytosis pathway","paracellular pathway","early endosome antigen","increased intracellular accumulation of FITC","stable transepithelial electrical resistance","morphological changes","experimental fluid uptake assay","cytoskeleton rearrangements","rough endoplasmic reticulum","consuming milk products","dilatation","microtubules","dextran","enlargement","PI3K-dependent","LY294002","evidence","pathomechanisms","cytoplasmic vacuolization","Cytochalasin","Nocodazole","EEA1","Europe","basolateral medium","Immunofluorescence microscopy","Ultrastructural analysis","macropinocytosis","SNX5","actin filaments","vesicles","bite","findings","sorting nexin","trafficking mechanism","Asia","caverns","days"],"language":"en"},

EV71 has become an increasingly important neurotropic enterovirus in the post-poliomyelitis eradication era. Effective antiviral agents and vaccines against this virus are currently still under development. We reviewed publications on the development of EV71 vaccines in order to provide an overview of the field. Methods Fifty-five articles on EV71 vaccine development, published from 1974 to 2009, were collected from Sun Yat-sen University library and reviewed. Results Various types of vaccine have been developed for EV71. In results published to date, all vaccines for EV71 under development appear to elicit an immune response in rodents or in monkeys. According to the established regulatory standards, it may be relatively easy to acquire a license to use the inactivated virus in order to meet the immediate demands for EV71 control . With regard to the attenuated vaccine, it is critical to increase the genetic stability before clinical use, due to the risk of virulent revertants. The virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine, not only conserving the conformational epitopes, but also having no risk of virulent revertants, is another promising vaccine candidate for EV71, but needs further development. The VP1 capsid protein is the backbone antigen protein for developing subunit vaccine and epitope vaccine; these remain viable potential vaccine strategies worthy of further study and development. Conclusions The conservation of the three-dimensional structure is important for the EV71 inactivated vaccine and VLP vaccine to induce a strong immune response. To develop EV71 vaccines with a high protection efficacy, strategies such as the use of adjuvant, strong promoters, tissue-specific promoters, and addition of mucosal immune adjuvant should be considered.","publish_time":"2010-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Dingmei; Lu, Jiayuan; Lu, Jiahai","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2b7fa2b89a714a2f919546c37dbe56a7e4203ac0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110504.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971210023131; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971210023131; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2009.12.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20400350/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HFMD","Sun Yat-sen University"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EV71 vaccine development","EV71 inactivated vaccine","development of EV71 vaccines","VLP vaccine","epitope vaccine","subunit vaccine","attenuated vaccine","EV71 control","promising vaccine candidate","Various types of vaccine","viable potential vaccine strategies worthy","inactivated virus","use of adjuvant","strong immune response","strong promoters","important neurotropic enterovirus","Enterovirus genus","risk of virulent revertants","clinical use","results","addition of mucosal immune adjuvant","Summary Background Enterovirus","HFMD patients","backbone antigen protein","tissue-specific promoters","VP1 capsid protein","three-dimensional structure","post-poliomyelitis eradication era","high protection efficacy","foot","study","common etiological agent","immediate demands","conservation","genetic stability","causative pathogens of hand","Methods","articles","Effective antiviral agents","mouth disease","Picornaviridae family","Yat-sen University library","Conclusions","neurological disorders","license","rodents","monkeys","overview","member","particle","publications","established regulatory standards","conformational epitopes","regard","field"],"language":"en"},

To detect RVF virus (RVFV) infection, indirect immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) which utilize recombinant RVFV nucleocapsid (RVFV-N) protein as assay antigen, have reportedly been used, however, there is still a need to develop more sensitive and specific methods of detection. METHODS: RVFV-N protein was expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and purified by histidine-tag based affinity chromatography. This recombinant RVFV-N (rRVFV-N) protein was then used as antigen to develop an IgG sandwich ELISA and IgM capture ELISAs for human sera. Ninety six serum samples collected from healthy volunteers during the RVF surveillance programme in Kenya in 2013, and 93 serum samples collected from RVF-suspected patients during the 2006\u20132007 RVF outbreak in Kenya were used respectively, to evaluate the newly established rRVFV-N protein-based IgG sandwich ELISA and IgM capture ELISA systems in comparison with the inactivated virus-based ELISA systems. RESULTS: rRVFV-N protein-based-IgG sandwich ELISA and IgM capture ELISA for human sera were established. Both the new ELISA systems were in 100% concordance with the inactivated virus-based ELISA systems, with a sensitivity and specificity of 100%.

Our rRVFV-N-based ELISA systems are safe and reliable tools for diagnosis of RVFV infection in humans and especially useful in large-scale epidemiological investigation and for application in developing countries.","publish_time":"2018-11-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Fuxun; Adungo, Ferdinard; Konongoi, Samson Limbaso; Inoue, Shingo; Sang, Rosemary; Ashur, Salame; Kwallah, Allan ole; Uchida, Leo; Buerano, Corazon C; Mwau, Matilu; Zha, Yan; Nie, Yingjie; Morita, Kouichi","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0401a5bebe76fc07dde0f103a248118ce30facda.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6249750.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-018-1071-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30466469/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rift Valley Fever","RVFV","RVF"],"locations":["Kenya"],"keyphrases":["recombinant RVFV-N","IgM capture ELISA systems","established rRVFV-N protein-based IgG sandwich ELISA","new ELISA systems","inactivated virus-based ELISA systems","RVF virus","RVF diagnosis","diagnosis of RVFV infection","recombinant RVFV nucleocapsid","RVF outbreak","IgM capture ELISAs","RVF surveillance programme","RVF-suspected patients","human sera","affordable antigen","assay antigen","serum samples","Kenya","Escherichia coli","indirect immunoglobulin G","specific methods of detection","reliable tools","comparison","healthy volunteers","humans","large-scale epidemiological investigation","application","enzyme","concordance","immunosorbent assays","Rift Valley Fever","mosquito","BACKGROUND","sensitivity","developing countries","histidine-tag","affinity chromatography","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","viral zoonosis","need","specificity"],"language":"en"},

The G cistron is 2045 nucleotides (nt) long and the G protein mRNA open reading frame (ORF), as determined from the cDNA sequence, contains 1896 nt and encodes a protein of 632 amino acids. Immunoblots with antibodies elicited against the purified glycoprotein from virus particles reacted with a fusion protein produced in Escherichia coli, indicating that the cloned ORF encodes the G protein. The 5\u2032 end of the G protein mRNA corresponds to nt 5111, relative to the 3\u2032 end of the viral (minus sense) genome, as determined by primer extension from mRNA isolated from infected plants, and extends to nt position 7155 on the genomic RNA. A 34-nt untranslated 5\u2032 leader sequence and a 115-nt untranslated 3\u2032 end flank the ORF on the mRNA. The gene junctions on either side of the G gene on the genomic RNA are identical to those previously described for other SYNV genes and are similar to sequences separating genes of animal rhabdoviruses. The predicted molecular weight of the G protein is 70,215 Da, a value less than the 77,000 Da estimated for the glycosylated G protein from virus particles. The deduced amino acid sequence of the SYNV G protein shares little direct relatedness with the G proteins of other rhabdoviruses, but appears to contain a similar signal sequence, a transmembrane anchor domain, and glycosylation signals. In addition, the SYNV G protein contains a putative nuclear targeting site near the carboxy terminus, which may be involved in transit to the nuclear membrane prior to morphogenesis.","publish_time":"1991-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goldberg, Karen-Beth; Modrell, Brett; Hillman, Bradley I.; Heaton, Louis A.; Choi, Tae-Jin; Jackson, A.

The pathogenesis of diseases involves complex interactions of viruses, which differ in neurovirulence potential, and a number of host factors, which govern susceptibility to infection and the capacity to mount effective antiviral immune responses both in the periphery and within the CNS. This chapter summarizes progress in the field of flavivirus neuropathogenesis. Mosquito-borne and tickborne viruses are considered together. Flavivirus neuropathogenesis involves both neuroinvasiveness (capacity to enter the CNS) and neurovirulence (replication within the CNS), both of which can be manipulated experimentally. Neuronal injury as a result of bystander effects may be a factor during flavivirus neuropathogenesis given that microglial activation and elaboration of inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03B2 and TNF-\u03B1, occur in the CNS during these infections and may accompany the production of nitric oxide and peroxynitrite, which can cause neurotoxicity.","publish_time":"2003-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chambers, Thomas J; Diamond, Michael S","journal":"Advances in Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c34b477e3970a40951080fdd2826512ae3474cd5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202458.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065352703600084; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065352703600084","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsxMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CNS","field of flavivirus neuropathogenesis","flavivirus family","capacity","tickborne viruses","tick-borne encephalitis virus","Japanese encephalitis virus","complex interactions of viruses","natural infections","neurovirulence potential","serogroup","microglial activation","JEV","elaboration of inflammatory mediators","central nervous system","effective antiviral immune responses","members","result of bystander effects","peroxynitrite","number of host factors","susceptibility","periphery","TBEV","serocomplex","progress","neuroinvasiveness","Neuronal injury","pathogenesis of diseases","Publisher Summary","production of nitric oxide","TNF-\u03B1","replication","chapter","Mosquito","neurotoxicity"],"language":"en"},

To implement prevention strategies it is important to gain information on management and to point out risk factors. The objective of this internet based survey was to describe calf management practices on registered dairy breeding farms in Austria and to estimate differences in calf disease incidences depending on farm structure and management practices. RESULTS: A total of 1287 questionnaires were finally analysed (response rate 12.2 %). Herd characteristics and regional distribution of farms indicated that this survey gives a good overview on calf management practices on registered dairy farms in Austria. The median number of cows per farm was 20 (interquartile range 13\u201330). Significant differences regarding farm characteristics and calf management between small and large farms (\u226420 vs \u003E20 cows) were present. Only 2.8 % of farmers tested first colostrum quality by use of a hydrometer. Storing frozen colostrum was more prevalent on large farms (80.8 vs 64.2 %). On 85.1 % of the farms, whole milk, including waste milk, was fed to the calves. Milk replacer and waste milk were more often used on large farms. In accordance with similar studies from other countries, calf diarrhoea was indicated as the most prevalent disease. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that herd size was associated with calf diarrhoea and calf respiratory tract disease, with higher risk of disease on large farms. Furthermore, feeding waste milk to the calves was associated with increasing calf diarrhoea incidence on farm. In the final model with calf respiratory tract disease as outcome, respondents from organic farms reported less often a respiratory tract disease incidence of over 10 % compared with conventional farms [odds ratio (OR) 0.40, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.21\u20130.75] and farmers that housed calves individually or in groups after birth significantly reported more often to have an incidence of respiratory tract disease \u003E10 % compared with farms where all calves were housed individually (OR 2.28, 95 % CI 1.16\u20134.48). CONCLUSION: The results obtained in this study provide an overview on calf management on dairy breeding farms in Austria and may help to further point out areas to be improved on farm.

A group of closely related novel rhinoviruses have recently been discovered. Based on their unique phylogenetic position and distinct genomic features, they are classified as a separate species, HRV-C. After their discovery, HRV-C viruses have been detected in patients worldwide, with a reported prevalence of 1.4\u201330.9% among tested specimens. This suggests that the species contribute to a significant proportion of RTIs that were unrecognized in the past. HRV-C is also the predominant HRV species, often with a higher detection rate than that of the two previously known species, HRV-A and HRV-B. HRV-C infections appear to peak in fall or winter in most temperate or subtropical countries, but may predominate in the rainy season in the tropics. In children, HRV-C is often associated with upper RTIs, with asthma exacerbation and wheezing episodes being common complications. The virus has also been detected in children with bronchitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, otitis media, sinusitis and systemic infections complicated by pericarditis. As for adults, HRV-C has been associated with more severe disease such as pneumonia and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, larger clinical studies with asymptomatic controls are required to better define the significance of HRV-C infection in the adult population. On the basis of VP4 sequence analysis, a potential distinct subgroup within HRV-C has also been identified, although more complete genome sequences are needed to better define the genetic diversity of HRV-C.","publish_time":"2010-10-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"LauLau, S K P, SK; YipYip, C C Y, CC; WooWoo, P C Y, PC; Yuen, K-Y","journal":"Emerg Health Threats J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0789cc30e0766ccdea9e216da799f9cb41f853d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3167658.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3134/ehtj.10.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22460392/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsxOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HRV-C infections","HRV-C viruses","significance of HRV","predominant HRV species","genetic diversity of HRV","separate species","known species","pneumonia","systemic infections","upper RTIs","children","significant proportion of RTIs","asthma exacerbation","severe disease","novel rhinoviruses","human rhinoviruses","exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","frequent causes of respiratory tract infections","potential distinct subgroup","distinct genomic features","otitis media","sinusitis","wheezing episodes","basis of VP4 sequence analysis","unique phylogenetic position","bronchiolitis","common complications","winter","larger clinical studies","asymptomatic controls","HRVs","bronchitis","patients","fall","discovery","adult population","subtropical countries","pericarditis","higher detection rate","rainy season","tropics","complete genome sequences","reported prevalence","past","adults","tested specimens"],"language":"en"},

CONCLUSION: We can conclude from our study that Immumax is helpful in reducing the duration and severity of common cold symptoms.","publish_time":"2011-01-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yakoot, Mostafa; Salem, Amel","journal":"Int J Gen Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e88710cd7b238794bd75f21d308bc5442ad9713f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3048339.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2147/ijgm.s16266; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21403792/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsyMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Immumax group","placebo group","days","severity of common cold symptoms","placebo treatment groups","treatment of patients","total symptom severity scores","controlled study design","duration","eligible patients","resolution profiles","one-way ANOVA","Resolution rates","log-rank test","baseline","RESULTS","mean percentage change","mean percentage reduction","one-way analysis of variance","Echinacea extract","Meier analysis","outpatient setting","Panax ginseng extract","natural multiherbal formula","vitamin C","garlic powder","tolerability","interquartile range","time","Kaplan","Nigella sativa oil","potential efficacy","median","elemental zinc","METHODS","maximum","OBJECTIVE","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

The recombinant S protein was sufficiently flexible to retain the ability to self-assemble into VLPs. The size and morphology of the VLPs were similar to authentic IBV particles. In addition, the immunogenicity of IBV VLPs had been investigated. The results demonstrated that the efficiency of the newly generated VLPs was comparable to that of the inactivated M41 viruses in eliciting IBV-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies in chickens via subcutaneous inoculation.

METHODS: A dataset of 29 publically available high-resolution crystal structures of Fab-antigen complexes was collected. Contribution of APRs towards the surface areas of the Fabs buried by the cognate antigens was computed. Propensities of amino acids to occur in APRs and to be involved in antigen binding were compared. Coincidence between APRs and individual CDR loops was examined. RESULTS: All Fabs in the dataset contain at least one APR in CDR loops and adjacent framework \u03B2-strands. The average contribution of APRs towards buried surface area of Fabs is 16.0 \u00B1 10.7%. Aggregation and antigen recognition may be coupled via aromatic residues (Tyr, Trp), which occur with high propensities in both APRs and antigen binding sites. APRs are infrequent in the heavy chain CDR 3 (H3) loops (7%), but are frequent in H2 loops (45%). CONCLUSIONS: Co-incidence of APRs with antigen recognition sites can potentially lead to the loss of function upon aggregation.

In this study, the phylogenetic characterization of nine EV\u2010D68 strains identified in patients in the 2010\u20132012 period and 12 additional EV\u2010D68 Italian strains previously identified in 2008 in Italy was described. From January 2010 to December 2012, a total of 889 respiratory specimens from 588 patients stayed or visited at the Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo were positive for HRV or HEV. Extracted nucleic acids were amplified by one\u2010step RT\u2010PCR with primer specific for VP1 region of EV\u2010D68 and purified positive PCR products were directly sequenced. Overall, 9/3736 (0.24%) patients were EV\u2010D68 positive. Of these, 7/9 (77.8%) were pediatric and two (22.2%) were adults. Five out of seven (71.4%) pediatric patients had lower respiratory tract infection with oxygen saturation \u003C94%. Four cases were detected from August through October 2010, while five other cases from September through December 2012. The Italian EV\u2010D68 strains in 2008 belonged to clade A (n = 5) and clade C (n = 7). In 2010 all the Italian strains belonged to clade A (n = 4) and in 2012, four Italian strains belonged to clade B and one to clade A. In conclusion, we provide additional evidence supporting a role of EV\u2010D68 in severe respiratory infection in pediatric patients.

RNA viruses have extremely high mutation rates and thus represent a significant source of these infectious diseases. In the present study, we showed that a plant-pathogenic RNA virus, tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV), could replicate and produce virions in honeybees, Apis mellifera, resulting in infections that were found throughout the entire body. Additionally, we showed that TRSV-infected individuals were continually present in some monitored colonies. While intracellular life cycle, species-level genetic variation, and pathogenesis of the virus in honeybee hosts remain to be determined, the increasing prevalence of TRSV in conjunction with other bee viruses from spring toward winter in infected colonies was associated with gradual decline of host populations and winter colony collapse, suggesting the negative impact of the virus on colony survival. Furthermore, we showed that TRSV was also found in ectoparasitic Varroa mites that feed on bee hemolymph, but in those instances the virus was restricted to the gastric cecum of Varroa mites, suggesting that Varroa mites may facilitate the spread of TRSV in bees but do not experience systemic invasion. Finally, our phylogenetic analysis revealed that TRSV isolates from bees, bee pollen, and Varroa mites clustered together, forming a monophyletic clade.

Approximately 5% of our hospital beds are used as isolation facilities. Aim To study the impact of an MRSA control bundle that was implemented via gradual geographic extension across hospital wards. Methods The bundle included active surveillance on admission and transfer/discharge to identify ward-based acquisition of MRSA, isolation and cohorting of MRSA-infected patients, enhanced hand hygiene initiatives, and publicly displayed feedback of MRSA acquisition and hand hygiene compliance rates. Implementation was between October 2006 and June 2010 in order to provide lead-time for the incremental development of infrastructural capacity, and to develop an ethic of infection prevention among staff. Results were analysed via interrupted time-series analysis. Findings MRSA infections fell midway through the implementation, with MRSA bacteraemia declining from 0.26 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.18\u20130.34] cases per 1000 inpatient-days in the first quarter of 2004 to 0.11 (95% CI: 0.07\u20130.19) cases per 1000 inpatient-days in the first quarter of 2012. MRSA acquisition rates fell a year after the programme had been fully implemented, whereas hand hygiene compliance rose significantly from 47% (95% CI: 44\u201349) in the first quarter of 2009 to 69% (95% CI: 68\u201371) in the first quarter of 2012.

To determine whether sympatric carnivores are reservoirs of pathogens posing a disease risk for the lynx, evidence of exposure to 17 viral, bacterial and protozoan agents was investigated in 176 carnivores comprising 26 free-living lynx, 53 domestic cats, 28 dogs, 33 red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), 24 Egyptian mongooses (Herpestes ichneumon), 10 common genets (Genetta genetta) and 2 Eurasian badgers (Meles meles) in the areas inhabited by the last two populations of Iberian lynx, both in Andalusia (South-Western Spain). The results indicated that the lynx had low rates of contact with viral pathogens, with one seropositive finding each for feline leukemia virus, parvovirus and canine adenovirus-1, whereas contact with bacteria and protozoa appeared more frequent. Active infections with parvovirus, Ehrlichia spp., Mycobacterium bovis, Leptospira interrogans and Cytauxzoon spp. were confirmed. In contrast, 53% of the domestic cats were exposed to some infectious agent (prevalence range 4.5\u201311.4%). Antibodies to canine distemper virus and parvovirus were frequently found in dogs (32% and 42%, respectively) and foxes (30% and 12%). Past or present infections with parvovirus, Ehrlichia spp., Chlamydophila spp., M. bovis, Salmonella enterica, L. interrogans, Toxoplasma gondii, and Neospora caninum were also detected in these and other species surveyed. Questionnaires to owners revealed that 14% of the dogs but none of the cats had been vaccinated, and no cat had been neutered. Based on the apparent absence of acquired immunity of the lynx against infectious agents, the frequent detection of agents among sympatric carnivores, and the reported lack of immunocompetence of the Iberian lynx, a disease outbreak among the local abundant carnivores may pose a serious disease risk for lynx conservation.","publish_time":"2009-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mill\u00E1n, Javier; Candela, M\u00F3nica G.; Palomares, Francisco; Cubero, Mar\u00EDa Jos\u00E9; Rodr\u00EDguez, Alejandro; Barral, Marta; de la Fuente, Jos\u00E9; Almer\u00EDa, Sonia; Le\u00F3n-Vizca\u00EDno, Luis","journal":"The Veterinary Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/77297675ab24199a1924ed2d14046ed3e4dfa8e8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129241.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18555712/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023308001548; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2008.04.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023308001548","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lynx conservation","Lynx pardinus","free-living lynx","populations of Iberian lynx","parvovirus","sympatric carnivores","dogs","infectious agents","domestic cats","disease outbreak","serious disease risk","Vulpes vulpes","viral pathogens","local abundant carnivores","Genetta genetta","Ehrlichia","frequent detection of agents","protozoan agents","Meles meles","canine distemper virus","Mycobacterium bovis","reservoirs of pathogens","Leptospira interrogans","canine adenovirus","present infections","Active infections","red foxes","feline leukemia virus","low rates of contact","seropositive finding","Toxoplasma gondii","Herpestes ichneumon","common genets","Salmonella enterica","Egyptian mongooses","Eurasian badgers","immunity","reported lack of immunocompetence","evidence of exposure","Cytauxzoon","Chlamydophila","Antibodies","Andalusia","Neospora caninum","prevalence range","areas","bacteria","endangered felid","South-Western Spain","apparent absence","world","results","Questionnaires","owners","contrast","species"],"language":"en"},

In early to mid-March, there were no clear guidelines or recommendations available from neurodiagnostic-related organizations or hospitals on how to adapt procedure workflow to those with COVID-19. When caring for COVID-19 patients, as when caring for any patient with an infectious disease, it is hospital protocol to follow contact, droplet/airborne precautions by wearing appropriate PPE. However, because we knew very little about the coronavirus, this case was different. In this article, we discuss our experience with our EEG workflow and concerns for staff exposure. We then discuss our adaptations and modifications to our standard procedures and protocols. A time analysis comparing our standard EEG protocol with our modified COVID-19 protocol revealed a significant decrease in technologist exposure time (99 minutes versus 51 minutes), which theoretically would reduce the chance of virus transmission to our technologist. At this critical moment in time, we hope such modifications will allow us to continue delivering high quality patient care while optimizing resource utilization and above all keeping our technologists safe.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haines, Seline; Caccamo, Amy; Chan, Fonda; Galaso, German; Catinchi, Alexis; Gupta, Puneet K.","journal":"Neurodiagn J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d049cc13cfc0854eef6913f1c11eece8792b89fc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/21646821.2020.1756132","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EEG","PPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["modified COVID","cause of COVID","standard EEG protocol","hospital protocol","EEG workflow","technologist exposure time","time analysis","coronavirus disease","minutes","modifications","case","standard procedures","appropriate PPE","staff exposure","high quality patient care","hospital resources","procedure workflow","infectious disease","chance of virus transmission","recommendations available","droplet","neurodiagnostic-related organizations","significant decrease","worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment","hospitals","airborne precautions","resource utilization","contact","concerns","clear guidelines","increased stress","anxiety","experience","SARS-COV","frontline healthcare workers","News reports","information","adaptations","protocols","spike","spell","critical moment","seizure","technologists safe","article","patients"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we aimed to identify if surfaces near hospitalized patients with respiratory infections were contaminated with respiratory pathogens and to identify which surfaces were most commonly contaminated. Between September-November 2013, we collected respiratory (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) swabs from patients hospitalized with respiratory illness in adult medicine and paediatric medicine wards at two public tertiary care hospitals in Bangladesh. We collected surface swabs from up to five surfaces near each case-patient including: the wall, bed rail, bed sheet, clinical file, and multipurpose towel used for care giving purposes. We tested swabs using real-time multiplex PCR for 19 viral and 12 bacterial pathogens. Case-patients with at least one pathogen detected had corresponding surface swabs tested for those same pathogens. Of 104 patients tested, 79 had a laboratory-confirmed respiratory pathogen. Of the 287 swabs collected from surfaces near these patients, 133 (46%) had evidence of contamination with at least one pathogen. The most commonly contaminated surfaces were the bed sheet and the towel. Sixty-two percent of patients with a laboratory-confirmed respiratory pathgen (49/79) had detectable viral or bacterial nucleic acid on at least one surface. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequently detected pathogen on both respiratory swabs (32%, 33/104) and on surfaces near patients positive for this organism (97%, 32/33). Surfaces near patients hospitalized with respiratory infections were frequently contaminated by pathogens, with Klebsiella pneumoniae being most common, highlighting the potential for transmission of respiratory pathogens via surfaces. Efforts to introduce routine cleaning in wards may be a feasible strategy to improve infection control, given that severe space constraints prohibit cohorting patients with respiratory illness.","publish_time":"2019-10-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hassan, Md.

The aim of the present work was to study if maternal IgG1 antibodies (Abs) to BCoV acquired by colostrum intake modulate the development of BCoV infection in calves reared in a dairy farm in Argentina. Thirty Holstein calves were monitored during their first 60 days of age. Animals were classified into two groups depending on their initial BCoV IgG1 Ab titers. The \u201Cfailure of passive transfer\u201D (FPT) group had significantly lower IgG1 Abs to BCoV than the \u201Cacceptable passive transfer\u201D (APT) group of calves (log10 1.98 vs. 3.38 respectively) (p \u003C0.0001). These differences were also observed when the total protein levels in both groups were compared (p =0.0081). Moreover, 71% (5/7) of calves from the FPT group showed IgG1 seroconversion to BCoV compared to 29.4% (5/17) of animals from the APT group. Regarding viral circulation, BCoV was detected in 10% (3/30) of all calves and BCoV IgG1 Ab seroconversion was detected in 42% of the total animals showing that almost half of the calves were infected with BCoV. In conclusion, calves with high titers of specific BCoV IgG1 (\u22651024) were mostly protected against viral infection, while animals with low titers of IgG1 (\u003C1024) were mostly infected with BCoV. IgG1 Abs from colostrum origin are critical for prevention of BCoV infection.","publish_time":"2018-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bok, Marina; Alassia, Mart\u00EDn; Frank, Flavia; Vega, Celina G.; Wigdorovitz, Andr\u00E9s; Parre\u00F1o, Viviana","journal":"Revista Argentina de Microbiolog\u00EDa","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d67d91d537d9127d01950d6f7eb05a8b7d9c5d18.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116951.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0325754117300913; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0325754117300913; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ram.2017.03.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28893529/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs0MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Holstein"],"organizations":["FPT"],"locations":["Argentina"],"keyphrases":["BCoV IgG1 Ab seroconversion","group of calves","prevention of BCoV infection","development of BCoV infection","initial BCoV IgG1 Ab titers","high titers of specific BCoV IgG1","IgG1 seroconversion","lower IgG1 Abs","low titers of IgG1","Holstein calves","maternal IgG1 antibodies","FPT group","APT group","viral infection","total animals","groups","viral circulation","Argentina","acceptable passive transfer","viral enteric pathogen","failure of passive transfer","colostrum origin","colostrum intake","dairy farm","total protein levels","dairy husbandry systems","calf diarrhea","present work","Abstract Bovine coronavirus","conclusion","half","log10","aim","days of age","differences"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: The introduction and expression of the EBOV GP gene did not increase the virulence of the NDV vector in poultry or mice. EBOV GP was incorporated into the particle of the vector virus and the recombinant virus rLa-EBOVGP infected cells and spread within them independently of exogenous trypsin. rLa-EBOVGP is more resistant to NDV antiserum than the vector NDV and is moderately sensitive to EBOV GP antiserum. More importantly, infection with rLa-EBOVGP was markedly inhibited by IPA3, indicating that rLa-EBOVGP uses macropinocytosis as the major internalization pathway for cell entry. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that EBOV GP in recombinant NDV particles functions independently to mediate the viral infection of the host cells and alters the cell-entry pathway.","publish_time":"2013-11-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wen, Zhiyuan; Zhao, Bolin; Song, Kun; Hu, Xule; Chen, Weiye; Kong, Dongni; Ge, Jinying; Bu, Zhigao","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c08002cc1b2282d646514bf4f2abde54ac144994.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3826533.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24209904/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs0MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBOV","EBOV GP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NDV vector","vector NDV","EBOV GP antiserum","EBOV GP gene","designated rLa-EBOVGP","vector virus","NDV antiserum","recombinant virus rLa-EBOVGP infected cells","Ebola virus","recombinant NDV particles functions","cell entry","cell-entry pathway","RESULTS","recombinant low-pathogenic LaSota strain Newcastle disease virus","host cells","viral infection","major internalization pathway","expression","macropinocytosis","virulence","glycoprotein","poultry","introduction","reverse genetics","mice","IPA3","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","exogenous trypsin"],"language":"en"},

In comparison with patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation, patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation are at a much higher risk of infection even after hematopoietic reconstitution, due to the delayed recovery of T and B cell functions. The rate at which immune function recovers after hematopoietic reconstitution greatly influences the incidence and type of post-transplant infectious complications.

Our results demonstrate that TrV capsids preserve their genome inside, conserving their height after exposure to dehydrating conditions, which is in stark contrast with other viruses that expel their genome when desiccated. Moreover, empty capsids (without genome) resulted in collapsed particles after desiccation. We also explored the role of structural ions in the dehydration process of the virions (capsid containing genome) by chelating the accessible cations from the external solvent milieu. We observed that ion suppression helps to keep the virus height upon desiccation.

In this study, we use three mutation schemes with different degrees of locality to mutate the genomes of phage MS2 and Brome Mosaic virus in order to understand the observed sensitivity of the global compactness of their folds. We find that mutating local stretches of their genomes\u2019 sequence or structure is less disruptive to their compactness compared to inducing randomly-distributed mutations. Our findings are indicative of a mechanism for the conservation of compactness acting on a global scale of the genomes, and have several implications for understanding the interplay between local and global architecture of viral RNA genomes.","publish_time":"2018-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lo\u0161dorfer Bo\u017Ei\u010D, An\u017Ee; Micheletti, Cristian; Podgornik, Rudolf; Tubiana, Luca","journal":"J Phys Condens Matter","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/988fda0345e21eff13cd4bc081664f7b9f3c103b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104904.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104904/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzU3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Brome Mosaic"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["global compactness","Genomes of single","conservation of compactness","spatial compactness","global architecture of viral RNA genomes","genomes of phage MS2","global scale","local stretches","distributed mutations","genomic folds","stranded RNA viruses","random synonymous mutations","order","Brome Mosaic virus","mutation schemes","genomes\u2019 sequence","different degrees of locality","structure","observed sensitivity","precise structural elements","specific positions","disruption","mechanism","interplay","implications","findings","study","genome encapsidation","concurrent properties"],"language":"en"},

While viral RNAs are found to be compact and highly branched because of long distance base-pairing between nucleotides, recent experiments reveal that in a head-to-head competition between an ssRNA with no secondary or higher order structure and a viral RNA, the capsid proteins preferentially encapsulate the linear polymer! In this paper, we study the impact of genome stiffness on the encapsidation free energy of the complex of RNA and capsid proteins. We show that an increase in effective chain stiffness because of base-pairing could be the reason why under certain conditions linear chains have an advantage over branched chains when it comes to encapsidation efficiency. While branching makes the genome more compact, RNA base-pairing increases the effective Kuhn length of the RNA molecule, which could result in an increase of the free energy of RNA confinement, that is, the work required to encapsidate RNA, and thus less efficient packaging.","publish_time":"2018-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Siyu; Erdemci-Tandogan, Gonca; van der Schoot, Paul; Zandi, Roya","journal":"J Phys Condens Matter","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f09d65d7fc82e82d915b28a6abaf3ac21f1a37e6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104906.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104906/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzU3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA base-pairing","complex of RNA","RNA molecule","free energy of RNA confinement","capsid proteins","branched chains","encapsidation free energy","increase","certain conditions linear chains","effective chain stiffness","long distance base","impact of genome stiffness","linear polymer","encapsidation efficiency","viral RNAs","effective Kuhn length","advantage","reason","higher order structure","ssRNA","nucleotides","head-to-head competition","recent experiments","small viruses","protein shell","efficient packaging","work","paper"],"language":"en"},

Laboratory-reared flies were experimentally exposed to NDV (Roakin strain) by allowing flies to imbibe an inoculum consisting of chicken embryo-propagated virus. NDV was detected in dissected crops and intestinal tissues from exposed flies for up to 96 and 24 h postexposure, respectively; no virus was detected in crops and intestines of sham-exposed flies. The potential of the house fly to directly transmit NDV to live chickens was examined by placing 14-d-old chickens in contact with NDV-exposed house flies 2 h after flies consumed NDV inoculum. NDV-exposed house flies contained \u224810(4) 50% infectious doses (ID(50)) per fly, but no transmission of NDV was observed in chickens placed in contact with exposed flies at densities as high as 25 flies per bird. Subsequent dose\u2013response studies demonstrated that oral exposure, the most likely route for fly-to-chicken transmission, required an NDV (Roakin) dose \u226510(6) ID(50).

Here, we present an example of viral targeting for immune evasion through spatial isolation of TBK1/IKK\u03B5 from mitochondrial antiviral platform, which was employed by severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), a deadly bunyavirus emerging recently. We showed that SFTSV nonstructural protein NSs functions as the interferon (IFN) antagonist, mainly via suppressing TBK1/IKK\u03B5\u2013IRF3 signaling. NSs mediates the formation of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (IBs), and the blockage of IB formation impairs IFN-inhibiting activity of NSs. We next demonstrate that IBs are utilized to compartmentalize TBK1/IKK\u03B5. The compartmentalization results in spatial isolation of the kinases from mitochondria, and deprived TBK1/IKK\u03B5 may participate in antiviral complex assembly, leading to the blockage of IFN induction. This study proposes a new role of viral IBs as virus-built \u2018jail\u2019 for imprisoning cellular factors and presents a novel and likely common mechanism of viral immune evasion through spatial isolation of critical signaling molecules from the mitochondrial antiviral platform.","publish_time":"2014-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ning, Yun-Jia; Wang, Manli; Deng, Maping; Shen, Shu; Liu, Wei; Cao, Wu-Chun; Deng, Fei; Wang, Yan-Yi; Hu, Zhihong; Wang, Hualin","journal":"J Mol Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb14cf418a25327b21b3033cce20ec862f622e65.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107466.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107466/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzY2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IB","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IKK\u03B5","spatial isolation of TBK1","mitochondrial antiviral platform","deprived TBK1","mitochondrial platform","spatial isolation of critical","antiviral complex assembly","new role of viral IBs","activity of NSs","establishment of host antiviral state","blockage of IFN induction","likely common mechanism of viral immune evasion","example of viral targeting","blockage of IB formation","SFTSV nonstructural protein NSs functions","downstream molecules","thrombocytopenia syndrome virus","recruitment of cytosolic RLRs","formation of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies","novel","interferon","kinases","retinoic acid-inducible gene","severe fever","central event","RIG","jail","cellular factors","compartmentalization results","receptors","study","antagonist","deadly bunyavirus","IRF3"],"language":"en"},

Respiratory illness continues to exert a burden on hajj pilgrims in Makkah. The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of respiratory illness and its associated factors among Malaysian hajj pilgrims in 2013 and to describe its preventive measures. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Makkah and Malaysia during the 2013 hajj season. A self-administered proforma on social demographics, previous experience of hajj or umrah, smoking habits, co-morbid illness and practices of preventive measures against respiratory illness were obtained. Results. A total of 468 proforma were analysed. The prevalence of the respiratory illness was 93.4% with a subset of 78.2% fulfilled the criteria for influenza-like illness (ILI). Most of them (77.8%) had a respiratory illness of \u003C2 weeks duration. Approximately 61.8% were administered antibiotics but only 2.1% of them had been hospitalized. Most of them acquired the infection after a brief stay at Arafat (81.2%). Vaccination coverages for influenza virus and pneumococcal disease were quite high, 65.2% and 59.4%, respectively. For other preventive measures practices, only 31.8% of them practiced good hand hygiene, \u223C82.9% of pilgrims used surgical face masks, N95 face masks, dry towels, wet towels or veils as their face masks. Nearly one-half of the respondents (44.4%) took vitamins as their food supplement.

Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), a new group 2 coronavirus, was first characterized in 2005 from 2 adults with pneumonia in Hong Kong, China. To the best of our knowledge, there is no other report to date about the detection of this new virus. We report a molecular method allowing for the detection of HCoV-HKU1 and also report the clinical presentation of 6 infected patients. Methods. We screened 141 specimens (135 nasal samples and 6 stool samples) received in February and March 2005 in our laboratory and obtained from 135 hospitalized patients (61.5% of whom were \u003C5 years old and 34.1% of whom were \u003E20 years old) for HCoV-HKU1. Results. HCoV-HKU1 was detected in 6 (4.4%) of the 135 nasal specimens and in 2 (33.3%) of the 6 stool samples; the positive samples were obtained from 6 patients (5 children and 1 adult). The clinical presentation of these 6 patients was as follows: 3 were admitted to the hospital for acute enteric disease resulting in severe dehydration associated with upper respiratory symptoms; 1 had fever, otitis, and febrile seizure; 1 had a sample obtained to investigate failure to thrive; and 1 had a sample obtained for exploration of X-linked agammaglobulinemia and hyperleucocytosis. Conclusion. HCoV-HKU1 can be detected in respiratory and stool samples from children and adults in a part of the world other than Hong Kong. Our results suggest that HCoV-HKU1 could be associated with respiratory and enteric diseases, and its detection can be related to a persistent asymptomatic infection in patients with poor underlying conditions.","publish_time":"2006-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vabret, Astrid; Dina, Julia; Gouarin, St\u00E9phanie; Petitjean, Jo\u00EBlle; Corbet, Sandrine; Freymuth, Fran\u00E7ois","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e6f3895ea68fbbcf74338327306216d4353a8f98.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107802.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107802/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzcxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong","China"],"keyphrases":["HCoV-HKU1","detection of HCoV","stool samples","nasal samples","Human coronavirus HKU1","positive samples","infected patients","hospitalized patients","report","adults","Hong Kong","children","clinical presentation","nasal specimens","years old","Results","upper respiratory symptoms","enteric diseases","new group","new virus","acute enteric disease","severe dehydration","fever","persistent asymptomatic infection","poor underlying conditions","exploration of X","linked agammaglobulinemia","otitis","febrile seizure","pneumonia","hyperleucocytosis","China","world","date","molecular method","knowledge","laboratory","best","failure","Background","Methods","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

We examined circulating ACE2 activity in CKD patients at stages 3\u20135 (CKD3-5) and in dialysis (CKD5D) without any history of CV disease. METHODS: Circulating ACE2 activity was measured in human ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA)-plasma samples from the NEFRONA study (n = 2572): control group (CONT) (n = 568), CKD3-5 (n = 1458) and CKD5D (n = 546). Different clinical and analytical variables such as gender; age; history of diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia and hypertension; glycaemic, renal, lipid and anaemia profiles; vitamin D analogues treatment and antihypertensive treatments (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blockade) were analysed. Circulating ACE2 and ACE activities were measured using modified fluorimetric assay for EDTA-plasma samples, where zinc chloride was added to recover enzymatic activity. RESULTS: In CKD3-5 and CKD5D, significant decrease in circulating ACE2 activity was observed when compared with CONT, but no differences were found between CKD3-5 and CKD5 when performing paired case-control studies. By multivariate linear regression analysis, male gender and advanced age were identified as independent predictors of ACE2 activity in all groups. Diabetes was identified as independent predictor of ACE2 activity in CKD3-5. Significant increase in the activity of circulating ACE was found in CKD3-5 and CKD5D when compared with CONT and in CKD5D when compared with CKD3-5. By multiple regression analysis, female gender and younger age were identified as independent predictors of ACE activity in CONT and CKD3-5. Diabetes was also identified as an independent predictor of ACE activity in CKD3-5 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating ACE2 and ACE activities can be measured in human EDTA-plasma samples with zinc added to recover enzymatic activity. In a CKD population without previous history of CV disease, ACE2 activity from human EDTA-plasma samples directly correlated with the classical CV risk factors namely older age, diabetes and male gender. Our data suggest that circulating ACE2 is altered in CKD patients at risk for CV event.","publish_time":"2015-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anguiano, Lidia; Riera, Marta; Pascual, Julio; Valdivielso, Jos\u00E9 Manuel; Barrios, Clara; Betriu, Angels; Mojal, Sergi; Fern\u00E1ndez, Elvira; Soler, Mar\u00EDa Jos\u00E9; Castro, Eva; Mar\u00EDa, Virtudes; Mol\u00ED, Teresa; Soria, Meritxell; Regidor, Aladr\u00E9n; Jos\u00E9, M\u00AA; Jaume, Almirall; Esther, Ponz; Coloma, Arteaga; Rubio, Bajo; Rodr\u00EDguez, Belart; Sara, Bielsa-Garc\u00EDa; Jordi, Bover Sanjuan; Josep, Bronsoms Artero; Romero, Cabezuelo; Juan, B; Salom\u00E9, Muray Cases; Jes\u00FAs, Calvi\u00F1o Varela; Pilar, Caro Acevedo; Jordi, Carreras Bassa; Aleix, Cases Amen\u00F3s; Elisabet, Mass\u00F3 Jim\u00E9nez; Jes\u00FAs, Castilla P\u00E9rez; Secundino, Cigarr\u00E1n Guldris; Saray, L\u00F3pez Prieto; Lourdes, Comas Mongay; Isabel, Comerma; M\u00AA Teresa, Compte Jov\u00E9; Marta, Cuberes Izquierdo; Fernando, de \u00C1lvaro; Covadonga, Hevia Ojanguren; Gabriel, de Arriba de la Fuente; M\u00AA Dolores, del Pino y Pino; Rafael, Diaz-Tejeiro Izquierdo; Marta, Dotori; Ver\u00F3nica, Duarte; Sara, Estupi\u00F1an Torres; M\u00AA Jos\u00E9, Fern\u00E1ndez Reyes; M\u00AA Loreto, Fern\u00E1ndez Rodr\u00EDguez; Guillermina, Fern\u00E1ndez; Antonio, Gal\u00E1n Serrano; Cesar, Garc\u00EDa Cant\u00F3n; Herrera, Garc\u00EDa; Antonio, L; Mercedes, Garc\u00EDa Mena; Luis, Gil Sacaluga; Maria, Aguilar; Luis, G\u00F3rriz Jos\u00E9; Emma, Huarte Loza; Luis, Lerma Jos\u00E9; Antonio, Liebana Ca\u00F1ada; \u00C1lvarez, Mar\u00EDn; Pedro, Jes\u00FAs; N\u00E0dia, Mart\u00EDn Alemany; Jes\u00FAs, Mart\u00EDn Garc\u00EDa; Alberto, Mart\u00EDnez Castelao; Mar\u00EDa, Mart\u00EDnez Villaescusa; Isabel, Mart\u00EDnez; I\u00F1igo, Moina Eguren; Silvia, Moreno Los Huertos; Ricardo, Mouzo Mirco; Antonia, Munar Vila; Ana Beatriz, Mu\u00F1oz D\u00EDaz; Gonz\u00E1lez, Navarro; Juan, F; Javier, Nieto; Agust\u00EDn, Carre\u00F1o; Enrique, Novoa Fern\u00E1ndez; Alberto, Ortiz; Beatriz, Fernandez; Vicente, Para\u00EDso; Miguel, P\u00E9rez Font\u00E1n; Ana, Peris Domingo; Celestino, Pi\u00F1era Haces; M\u00AA Dolores, Prados Garrido; Mario, Prieto Velasco; Carmina, Puig Mar\u00ED; Maite, Rivera Gorr\u00EDn; Esther, Rubio; Pilar, Ruiz; Mercedes, Salgueira Lazo; Puerto, Mart\u00EDnez; Isabel, Ana; Tomero, S\u00E1nchez; Antonio, Jos\u00E9; Emilio, S\u00E1nchez Jos\u00E9; Ramon, Sans Lorman; Ramon, Saracho; Maria, Sarrias; Oreto, Prat; Fernando, Sousa; Daniel, Toran; Fernando, Tornero Molina; Carrasco, Us\u00F3n; Javier, Jos\u00E9; Ildefonso, Valera Cortes; M\u00AA Merce, Vilaprinyo del Perugia; Ruiz, Virto; Rafael, C.","journal":"Nephrol Dial Transplant","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce9acda036d58398866dfc8c3eadaf70e45ed786.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107869.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107869/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzczOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ACE","CONT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["circulating ACE2 activity","CKD3","activity of circulating ACE","independent predictors of ACE2 activity","independent predictor of ACE2 activity","enzymatic activity","independent predictors of ACE activity","independent predictor of ACE activity","CKD5D","CKD patients","previous history of CV disease","increased circulating angiotensin","human EDTA-plasma samples","CV event","ACE activities","history of diabetes mellitus","older age","younger age","advanced age","female gender","classical CV risk factors","CKD population","chronic kidney disease","multiple regression analysis","angiotensin receptor blockade","enzyme inhibitor","human ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid","multivariate linear regression analysis","zinc chloride","significant decrease","Significant increase","control group","paired case-control studies","vitamin D analogues treatment","anaemia profiles","antihypertensive treatments","modified fluorimetric assay","changes","dyslipidemia","analytical variables","stages","little information","hypertension","NEFRONA study","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","dialysis","groups","differences","METHODS","RESULTS","data"],"language":"en"},

A high initial or peak severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2014associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) load in nasopharyngeal specimens was shown to be associated with a high mortality rate. Because all infected individuals were devoid of preeexisting protective immunity against SARS-CoV, the biological basis for the variable virus burdens in different patients remains elusive. Methods. The nationwide SARS database in Taiwan was analyzed, and genotyping of 281 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 65 genes was performed for 94 patients with SARS, to identify SNPs for which distribution between patients with or without detectable nasopharyngeal shedding of SARS-CoV was biased. Results. Titers of SARS-CoV shed in nasopharyngeal specimens varied widely, ranging from nondetectable to 10(8) SARS-CoV RNA copies/mL, and they were correlated positively with a high mortality rate (P \u003C .0001, by trend test) and with early death (i.e., death occurring within 2 weeks of the onset of illness) (P = .0015, by trend test). Virus shedding was found to be higher among male patients (P = .0014, by multivariate logistic regression) and among older patients (P = .015, by multivariate logistic regression). Detectable nasopharyngeal shedding of SARS-CoV was associated with polymorphic alleles of interleukins 18 (P = .014) and 1A (P = .031) and a member of NF\u03BAB complex (reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog B [RelB]) (P = .034), all of which are proinflammatory in nature, as well as the procoagulation molecule fibrinogen-like protein 2 (P = .008). Conclusion. The SARS-CoV load is a determinant of clinical outcomes of SARS, and it is associated with polymorphisms of genes involved in innate immunity, which might be regulated in an age- and sex-dependent manner. The findings of the present study provided leads to genes involved in the host response to SARS-CoV infection; if substantiated with functional studies, these findings may be applicable to other newly emerged respiratory viruses (e.g., the influenza pandemic strain).","publish_time":"2006-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Wei-Ju; Yang, Jyh-Yuan; Lin, Jih-Hui; Fann, Cathy S.

In this study, we analyzed the integrity, sources, and stability of salivary RNA. Methods: We measured the integrity of salivary RNA with reverse transcription followed by PCR (RT-PCR) or RT-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). To study RNA entry sites into the oral cavity, we used RT-PCR analysis of salivary RNA from the 3 major salivary glands, gingival crevice fluid, and desquamated oral epithelial cells. We measured stability of the salivary \u03B2-actin mRNA by RT-qPCR of salivary RNA incubated at room temperature for different periods of time. We measured RNA association with other macromolecules by filtering saliva through pores of different sizes before performing RT-qPCR. To assess RNA\u2013macromolecule interaction, we incubated saliva with Triton X-100 for different periods of time before performing RT-qPCR. Results: In most cases, we detected partial- to full-length salivary mRNAs and smaller amounts of middle and 3\u2032 gene amplicons compared with the 5\u2032. RNA was present in all oral fluids examined. Endogenous salivary \u03B2-actin mRNA degraded more slowly than exogenous \u03B2-actin mRNA, with half-lives of 12.2 and 0.4 min, respectively (P \u003C0.001). Salivary RNA could not pass through 0.22 or 0.45 \u03BCm pores. Incubation of saliva with Triton X-100 accelerated degradation of salivary RNA. Conclusions: Saliva harbors both full-length and partially degraded forms of mRNA. RNA enters the oral cavity from different sources, and association with macromolecules may protect salivary RNA from degradation.","publish_time":"2006-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Noh Jin; Li, Yang; Yu, Tianwei; Brinkman, Brigitta MN; Wong, David T","journal":"Clin Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e38cefc7dd71b2291dd6fffae0476278853be75e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108156.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108156/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzgxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["integrity of salivary RNA","stability of salivary RNA","RT-PCR analysis of salivary RNA","RNA association","accelerated degradation of salivary RNA","RT-qPCR","full-length salivary mRNAs","Endogenous salivary \u03B2-actin mRNA","major salivary glands","RT-quantitative PCR","study RNA entry sites","oral cavity","different sources","filtering saliva","Saliva harbors","Incubation of saliva","oral fluids","exogenous \u03B2-actin mRNA","different periods of time","pores of different sizes","degraded forms of mRNA","biomarkers of oral cancer","macromolecules","Triton X","desquamated oral epithelial cells","human mRNAs","\u03BCm pores","gingival crevice fluid","room temperature","reverse transcription","smaller amounts of middle","macromolecule interaction","Conclusions","half-lives","gene amplicons","cases","Results","Methods","Background"],"language":"en"},

In some countries, monitoring of antiretroviral therapy is now more expensive than treatment itself. In addition, some commercial assays have shown shortcomings in quantifying rare genotypes. Methods: We evaluated real-time reverse transcription-PCR with internal control targeting the conserved long terminal repeat (LTR) domain of HIV-1 on reference panels and patient samples from Brazil (n = 1186), South Africa (n = 130), India (n = 44), and Germany (n = 127). Results: The detection limit was 31.9 IU of HIV-1 RNA/mL of plasma (\u003E95% probability of detection, Probit analysis). The internal control showed inhibition in 3.7% of samples (95% confidence interval, 2.32%\u20135.9%; n = 454; 40 different runs). Comparative qualitative testing yielded the following: Roche Amplicor vs LTR assay (n = 431 samples), 51.7% vs 65% positives; Amplicor Ultrasensitive vs LTR (n = 133), 81.2% vs 82.7%; BioMerieux NucliSens HIV-1 QT (n = 453), 60.5% vs 65.1%; Bayer Versant 3.0 (n = 433), 57.7% vs 55.4%; total (n = 1450), 59.0% vs 63.8% positives.

Periodically they can also become a problem for laboratory rodent colonies, particularly when building construction or renovations disturb colonies of commensal (building) rodents that had been acting as hosts. Mesostigmatid mites infest both rats and mice and, unlike the more common rodent fur mites (Myobia, Myocoptes, and Radfordia sp.), can survive for long periods in the environment and travel considerable distances in search of new hosts. They easily penetrate barrier caging systems, including individually ventilated cages, thus circumventing the usual precautions to protect rodents from infection. The two mites reported in laboratory rodent colonies, Ornithonyssus bacoti and Laelaps echidnina, also bite humans and have the potential to transmit zoonotic diseases. Once the mites gain access to a colony, eradication requires elimination of commensal rodent reservoirs in addition to insecticide treatment of both the laboratory rodents and the environment. In view of the undesirability of insecticide use in the animal facility, it is advisable to investigate the effectiveness of preventive treatments, such as environmental application of insect growth regulators or silica-based products. This article summarizes available information on mesostigmatid mites and their laboratory incursions, and provides suggestions for diagnosis, treatment, and control based on the author\u2019s experience with several outbreaks at a large academic institution.","publish_time":"2008-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Watson, Julie","journal":"ILAR J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c2d0ec8f950dd4675a131af8fdfdab657c4148e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108606.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108606/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozg5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Mesostigmatid mites","laboratory rodent colonies","parasitic mites","common rodent fur mites","laboratory rodents","colonies of commensal","laboratory incursions","wild rodent populations","elimination of commensal rodent reservoirs","insecticide treatment","building","undesirability of insecticide use","silica-based products","search of new hosts","environmental application of insect growth regulators","eradication","Myobia","addition","Ornithonyssus bacoti","considerable distances","Laelaps echidnina","outbreaks","colony","Myocoptes","construction","animal facility","usual precautions","available information","ventilated cages","effectiveness of preventive treatments","control","diagnosis","suggestions","renovations","mice","article","blood","author\u2019s experience","large academic institution","potential","systems","humans","view","infection","access","rats","problem","long periods","zoonotic diseases"],"language":"en"},

While there are subtle cell type differences in Golgi enzyme subcompartmentation, in general, glycosylation enzymes are localized within the Golgi cisternae in the same sequence in which they act to modify oligosaccharide substrates. The possibility that this enzyme subcompartmentation may control the types of oligosaccharides expressed by a cell has led to an interest in the signals and mechanisms directing enzyme localization in the Golgi cisternae. All glycosidases and glycosyltransferases characterized thus far have very little sequence homology that might suggest a common Golgi retention signal, but they do share a similar domain structure. They are all type II transmembrane proteins consisting of an amino terminal cytoplasmic tail, a signal anchor transmembrane domain, a stem region, and a large luminal catalytic domain. Their lack of sequence homology suggests that these proteins\u0027 Golgi retention signals are not linear amino acid sequences, but most likely involve general characteristics or conformations of larger protein domains. The peptide sequences required for Golgi retention of the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GlcNAcTI), (\u03B21,4-galactosyltrans- ferase (GalT) and \u03B12,6-sialyltransferase (ST) have been extensively studied. To do this, researchers created mutant and chimeric proteins, expressed these in tissue culture cells, and localized these proteins using immunofluorescence microscopy or immunoelectron microscopy. The cell surface expression of deletion mutants suggested that the deleted sequences were necessary for Golgi retention. Then, if these sequences were fused to a non-Golgi reporter protein and this chimeric or hybrid protein was retained in the Golgi, then these sequences were also sufficient for Golgi retention. Due to differences in reporter proteins used to construct these chimeric proteins, different cell types used for protein expression, different levels of protein expression, and different methods of cell surface protein detection, these experiments have led to somewhat confusing results. However, in general, it appears that the GalT relies primarily on its transmembrane domain for Golgi retention, while the GlcNAcTI and ST have requirements for their transmembrane regions, sequences flanking these regions, and luminal stem sequences. Based on these results, two potential Golgi retention mechanisms have been proposed and are now being tested. The observation that glycosyltransferase transmembrane domains are frequently sufficient for Golgi retention has led to the first of these models, the bilayer thickness model. This model proposes that the shorter transmembrane domains of Golgi proteins prevent them from entering cholesterol-rich transport vesicles destined for the plasma membrane,.and that this leads to Golgi retention. The second of these models is supported by the role of multiple protein domains in the Golgi retention of some proteins. This model, the oligomerization/kin recognition model of Golgi retention, proposes that the formation of insoluble protein homo-oligomers or very large hetero-oligomers prevents protein movement into transport vesicles destined for later compartments. Initial work suggests that the bilayer thickness mechanism may play a role in the retention of some Golgi retained proteins; however, it is not the sole retention mechanism. Other evidence suggests that an oligomerization/kin recognition mechanism may be more common, but definitive proof for its general use in Golgi protein retention is lacking. More research is required to further elucidate the sequences and particularly the mechanisms of Golgi retention. In the future, we hope to be able to explain the cell type differences in glycosylation enzyme Golgi subcompartmentation, the different sequence requirements for the Golgi retention of the same enzyme in various cell types, and whether differences in glycosylation enzyme Golgi subcompartmentation change the types of oligosaccharides made by a cell.","publish_time":"1997-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Colley, Karen J.","journal":"Glycobiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc7cfd177fbe1f12d3dd08c44f44fa8f0f5963c9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108620/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozg5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ST"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Golgi protein retention","mechanisms of Golgi retention","Golgi cisternae","Golgi glycosidases","common Golgi retention signal","potential Golgi retention mechanisms","proteins\u0027 Golgi retention signals","kin recognition model of Golgi retention","Golgi enzyme subcompartmentation","non-Golgi reporter protein","shorter transmembrane domains of Golgi proteins","transmembrane proteins","sole retention mechanism","protein movement","hybrid protein","chimeric proteins","reporter proteins","deleted sequences","peptide sequences","different levels of protein expression","role of multiple protein domains","conformations of larger protein domains","transmembrane regions","luminal stem sequences","different methods of cell surface protein detection","glycosyltransferase transmembrane domains","different cell types","signal anchor transmembrane domain","formation of insoluble protein homo-oligomers","linear amino acid sequences","bilayer thickness model","general use","subtle cell type differences","general characteristics","cell surface expression of deletion mutants","kin recognition mechanism","bilayer thickness mechanism","large luminal catalytic domain","enzyme localization","oligomerization","types of oligosaccharides","GlcNAcTI","little sequence homology","lack of sequence homology","similar domain structure","GalT","glycosyltransferases","models","large hetero-oligomers","stem region","cholesterol-rich transport vesicles","immunofluorescence microscopy","immunoelectron microscopy","confusing results","structures of cellular oligosaccharides","amino terminal cytoplasmic tail","experiments","glycosylation enzymes","requirements","series of processing reactions","definitive proof","\u03B12","N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase","tissue culture cells","galactosyltrans- ferase","plasma membrane","later compartments","Initial work","\u03B21","researchers","observation","sialyltransferase","evidence","possibility","oligosaccharide substrates","glycosylation enzyme Golgi subcompartmentation","Golgi retention","cell type differences","various cell types","different sequence requirements","future"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, knockdown of USP15 rescues the mitophagy defect of PD patient fibroblasts with PARK2 mutations and decreased Parkin levels. USP15 does not affect the ubiquitination status of Parkin or Parkin translocation to mitochondria, but counteracts Parkin-mediated mitochondrial ubiquitination. Knockdown of the DUB CG8334, the closest homolog of USP15 in Drosophila, largely rescues the mitochondrial and behavioral defects of parkin RNAi flies.

Much of that progress has culminated from detailed scientific studies conducted in nontraditional laboratory settings, frequently at collaborating zoological parks but also under more primitive conditions, including in the field. A mobile laboratory approach is described, which incorporates a diverse array of disciplines and research techniques. This approach has been extremely useful, especially for conducting gamete characterization and function studies as well as reproductive surveys, and for facilitating the development of assisted reproductive technology. With continuing advances in assisted reproduction in rare felids, more procedures are being conducted primarily as service-related activities, targeted to increase effectiveness of species propagation and population management. It can be a challenge for both investigators and institutional animal care and use committees (IACUCs) to differentiate these service-based procedures from traditional research studies (that require IACUC oversight). For research with rare cat species, multi-institutional collaboration frequently is necessary to gain access to scientifically meaningful numbers of study subjects. Similarly, for service-based efforts, the ability to perform reproductive procedures across institutions under nonstandard laboratory conditions is critical to applying reproductive sciences for managing and preserving threatened cat populations. Reproductive sciences can most effectively assist population management programs (e.g., Species Survival Plans) in addressing conservation priorities if these research and service-related procedures can be conducted \u0022on the road\u0022 at distant national and international locales.

Non-specific immune responses were analyzed over a period of 12 weeks post-infection (PI). In addition, the capacity of PRRSV-infected pigs to develop an efficient immune response against pseudorabies virus (PRV) glycoproteins and to resist to a subsequent virulent challenge was investigated. Our results demonstrate that PRRSV produced minor effects on the immune system of pigs. The skin delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) in response to phytohemagglutinine injection was slightly diminished one week after challenge, but was restored thereafter. However, three weeks after the infection, the total white blood cell count, and the number of CD2\u002B, CD8\u002B and IgM\u002B cells were enhanced. The increase in numbers of CD8\u002B cells persisted for three consecutive weeks. Serum immunoglobulins in infected pigs also increased by week 3 PI and up to 8 weeks PI. These results show that PRRSV may have stimulating effects on the pig immune system during the phase of long-lasting infection. After immunization with PRV glycoproteins, the production of anti-PRV antibodies and skin DTH response against PRV glycoproteins were not affected. On the contrary, following a virulent PRV challenge, PRRSV-infected pigs developed a better secondary antibody response and their resistance to the infection was as effective as in control pigs. Taken together, our data do not support a systemic immunosuppressive effect of PRRSV, during the persistent phase of infection. Other mechanisms may therefore apply to explain the emergence of secondary infections in endemically infected herds.","publish_time":"1998-02-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Albina, E; Piriou, L; Hutet, E; Cariolet, R; L\u0027Hospitalier, R","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4746e7ce2553fe9dfc717f00c35cd84e6d9d5c6b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119871.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242797001347; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242797001347","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV","PI","PRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRSV-infected pigs","immune system of pigs","PRV glycoproteins","immune functions of pigs","control pigs","capacity of PRRSV","weeks PI","efficient immune response","virulent PRV challenge","weeks post-infection","infected herds","skin DTH response","pig immune system","persistent phase of infection","phase of long-lasting infection","consecutive weeks","Non-specific immune responses","systemic immunosuppressive effect of PRRSV","production of anti-PRV antibodies","better secondary antibody response","cells","subsequent virulent challenge","results","pseudorabies virus","minor effects","numbers of CD8","respiratory syndrome virus","emergence of secondary infections","skin delayed type hypersensitivity","resistance","total white blood cell count","phytohemagglutinine injection","period","number of CD2","successive experiments","increase","IgM","immunization","Serum immunoglobulins","data","Abstract","addition","mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

It first spread within Guangdong Province and then to other parts of China. Via air travelers, it quickly reached various countries around the globe, causing several major hospital outbreaks. Within weeks, the causative agent, a previously unknown coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was identified, thanks to an unprecedented international effort led by the World Health Organization (WHO). Its origin was quickly traced to wild animals traded locally for culinary purposes. Masked palm civet and some other species seem to have acted as intermediate hosts. Since then, SARS-like coronaviruses were found in different bat species in China and elsewhere, and bats are now regarded as the wildlife reservoir for SARS-CoV. Fortunately, the SARS outbreak could be contained within months. Until July 2003, it had caused 8096 cases, with 774 deaths. Once adequate measures such as isolating patients and quarantining their contacts were strictly adhered to, further transmission between human beings could be interrupted. SARS is an example of how rapidly an infectious agent can spread in the modern world. At the same time, it should serve as a showcase of how international cooperation and modern science can help to combat the spread of infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berger, A.; Preiser, W.","journal":"Encyclopedia of Environmental Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e443914ea0740c50e306a4fdacc1e9662c76cbc3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152211.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444522726006243; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780444522726006243","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","SARS"],"locations":["China","Guangdong"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","SARS outbreak","modern world","infectious agent","southern China","parts of China","spread of infectious diseases","international cooperation","causative agent","modern science","unprecedented international effort","different bat species","World Health Organization","globe","unknown coronavirus","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","isolating patients","wild animals","thanks","coronaviruses","various countries","wildlife reservoir","adequate measures","culinary purposes","major hospital outbreaks","Masked palm civet","showcase","example","air travelers","transmission","human beings","Guangdong Province","contacts","origin","weeks","bats","months","intermediate hosts","cases","deaths","time"],"language":"en"},

Abstract On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology was detected in the city of Wuhan (China). A week later, a new coronavirus was isolated in these patients, initially designated as 2019-nCoV and subsequently SARS-CoV-2. This is a new virus that is much closer genetically to the coronavirus of bats than to human SARS. The new virus infects and replicates in the lung parenchyma pneumocytes and macrophages in which the ACE-2 cell receptor resides. He has now infected many more people than his predecessors (\u003E85,000). From the clinical point of view, those infected have an average age of 55 years; the main symptoms are fever, dry cough, lymphopenia, dyspnea, and pneumonia in its severe form. The overall lethality rate is 2-3% in China and 0.1% in cases detected outside of this country. The incubation period has been set at about 3 days (0-24 days). There are no specific antivirals or vaccines.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reina, J.","journal":"Vacunas","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f16a081df602c4d7a71aae3d81dba7318cfed26.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1576988720300042; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vacun.2020.03.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1576988720300042","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ACE-2"],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["in China and","in which the ACE","the coronavirus of bats than","in the lung parenchyma","The new virus infects and","an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology was detected in the city of Wuhan","the main symptoms","The incubation period","in cases detected outside of","nuevo coronavirus","From the clinical point of view","The overall lethality rate","nCoV and subsequently SARS","and pneumonia in its severe form","new coronavirus was isolated in these patients","new virus that","nuevo virus infecta","SARS humano","those infected have an average age of","days","This","d\u00EDas","receptor celular ACE","people than","brote de neumon\u00EDa","cell receptor","ciudad de Wuhan","now infected many","years","initially designated as","much closer genetically","dyspnea","dry cough","fever","lymphopenia","been set at about","tos seca","fiebre","disnea","linfopenia","country","s\u00EDntomas principales","week later","neumocitos","predecessors","pacientes","par\u00E9nquima pulmonar","punto de vista cl\u00EDnico","There","specific antivirals or","macr\u00F3fagos","edad media","Abstract On December","etiolog\u00EDa desconocida","murci\u00E9lagos","forma grave","momentos","personas","predecesores","tasa de letalidad global","casos detectados","pa\u00EDs","antivirales espec\u00EDficos","vacuna","per\u00EDodo de incubaci\u00F3n","semana"],"language":"es"},

The subjects were eight patients diagnosed with mild or moderate pneumonia at Sotobo Children\u2019s Clinic Outpatient Department between October 2006 and June 2007. TBPM-PI was administered at the recommended clinical dose of 4 mg/kg b.i.d. to five patients and at a high dose of 6 mg/kg b.i.d. to three patients.

Real-time PCR for individual viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae identified four cases of only bacterial infection, one case of M. pneumoniae coinfection, two cases of viral coinfection, and one case of both viral and M. pneumoniae coinfection. The clinical results indicated efficacy in all patients, and causative organisms were 100% eliminated. In the four patients with only bacterial infection, the average fever of 38.9\u00B0C at the start of treatment normalized the following day, showing excellent efficacy. No clinically problematic adverse events occurred, and compliance was good.

Data are lacking on the impact of the pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on health-related quality of life among patients affected by primary antibody deficiencies (PADs). OBJECTIVE: To identify factors impacting the health-related-quality of life (HRQOL) among Italian patients affected by PADs switched to remote assistance at the time of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. METHODS: The quality of life was surveyed in 158 patients with PADs by the Common Variable Immune Deficiency Quality of Life questionnaire, a disease-specific tool, and by the 12-item General Health Questionnaire, a generic tool to assess the risk of anxiety/depression. Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic, we shifted all patients with PADs to home therapy, and activated remote visits. Questionnaires were sent by email 4 weeks later. Common Variable Immune Deficiency Quality of Life questionnaire and 12-item General Health Questionnaire data scores were compared with the same set of data from a survey done in 2017. RESULTS: Of 210 patients, 158 (75%) agreed to participate. The quality of life was worse in the group of patients who were at risk of anxiety/depression at the study time. HRQOL was similar in patients forced to shift from hospital-based to home-based immunoglobulin treatment and in patients who continued their usual home-based replacement. The risk of anxiety/depression is associated with pandemia caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and with patients\u0027 fragility, and not with related clinical conditions associated with common variable immune deficiencies. Anxiety about running out of medications is a major new issue. CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic impacted HRQOL and the risk of anxiety/depression of patients with PADs. The remote assistance program was a useful possibility to limit personal contacts without influencing the HRQOL.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pulvirenti, Federica; Cinetto, Francesco; Milito, Cinzia; Bonanni, Livia; Pesce, Anna Maria; Leodori, Giorgia; Garzi, Giulia; Miglionico, Marzia; Tabolli, Stefano; Quinti, Isabella","journal":"J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b7301b367028f3a8ff4e8bc0c0a66e96f0bf62bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7195351.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2020.04.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213219820303445; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32278865/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213219820303445","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Common Variable Immune Deficiency Quality of Life","General Health Questionnaire","HRQOL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["depression of patients","coronavirus disease","group of patients","Italian patients","PADs","health-related quality of life","risk of anxiety","new coronavirus","Common Variable Immune Deficiency Quality of Life questionnaire","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","common variable immune deficiencies","item General Health Questionnaire data scores","epidemic impacted HRQOL","disease-specific tool","remote assistance program","expanding pandemic","remote visits","set of data","related clinical conditions","generic tool","study time","primary antibody deficiencies","home-based immunoglobulin treatment","major new issue","usual home-based replacement","useful possibility","patients\u0027 fragility","home therapy","pandemia","personal contacts","medications","hospital","focus of global scientific attention","factors","beginning","CONCLUSIONS","Questionnaires","email","weeks","survey","BACKGROUND","METHODS","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Recently it has been suggested that PEDV could be transmitted to na\u00EFve pig populations through inclusion of spray-dried porcine plasma (SDPP) into the nursery diet which led to a ban of SDPP in several areas in North America and Europe. To determine the effect of spray-drying on PEDV infectivity, 3-week-old pigs were intragastrically inoculated with (1) raw porcine plasma spiked with PEDV (RAW-PEDV-CONTROL), (2) porcine plasma spiked with PEDV and then spray dried (SD-PEDV-CONTROL), (3) raw plasma from PEDV infected pigs (RAW-SICK), (4) spray-dried plasma from PEDV infected pigs (SD-SICK), or (5) spray-dried plasma from PEDV negative pigs (SD-NEG-CONTROL). For the spray-drying process, a tabletop spray-dryer with industry-like settings for inlet and outlet temperatures was used. In the RAW-PEDV-CONTROL group, PEDV RNA was present in feces at day post infection (dpi) 3 and the pigs seroconverted by dpi 14. In contrast, PEDV RNA in feces was not detected in any of the pigs in the other groups including the SD-PEDV-CONTROL group and none of the pigs had seroconverted by termination of the project at dpi 28. This work provides direct evidence that the experimental spray-drying process used in this study was effective in inactivating infectious PEDV in the plasma.

The policy led to a significant reduction in the number of HIV-positive cases among IDUs in 4 years. METHODS: This article aims to provide a critical evaluation of this harm reduction policy in Taiwan. The research leading to this article included a thorough literature review and in-depth interviews with 31 active policy participants, including people working in hospitals, the academia, non-governmental organizations, community pharmacies, the legal system, and health authorities at both the central and local levels. The collected data were analyzed on the basis of situational analysis. RESULTS: The article examines the policy success by showing how this policy was assembled and by exposing the frictions and adjustments during its formation and implementation. Inter-departmental conflicts within or without the government and the efforts to coordinate them are addressed, and the transnational dimensions of this harm reduction policy are also discussed. The article then reflects on the effects of the policy and asks where the line should be drawn between what is harm reduction and what is not. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustration reveals the complexity of understanding an assembled health policy that involves multiple participants.

Early identification of PED virus (PEDV)-infected herd through surveillance or monitoring strategies is necessary for mass control of PED. However, a common working diagnosis system involves identifying PEDV-infected animals individually, which is a costly and time-consuming approach. Given the above information, the thrusts of this study were to develop a real-time fluorescent reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RtF-RT-LAMP) assay and establish a pooled testing system using faecal sample to identify PEDV-infected herd. RESULTS: In this study, we developed an accurate, rapid, cost-effective, and simple RtF- RT-LAMP assay for detecting the PEDV genome targeting M gene. The pooled testing system using the RtF-RT-LAMP assay was optimized such that a pool of at least 15 individual faecal samples could be analysed. CONCLUSIONS: The developed RtF-RT-LAMP assay in our study could support the design and implementation of large-scaled epidemiological surveys as well as active surveillance and monitoring programs for effective control of PED.

Better understanding of the molecular basis of viral pathogenesis should contribute significantly towards the development of improved prophylactic, therapeutic and diagnostic reagents to control infections. In the present investigation, transcriptional profiles were analyzed by using RNA recovered from the lung tissue of IBV infected 18-day-old chicken embryos at 6, 24, 48 and 72h post IBV infection. This microarray analysis was completed using avian cDNA arrays comprised of fragments of 1191 unique chicken and turkey gene transcripts. These arrays were generated from normalized cDNA subtraction libraries that were derived from avian pneumovirus (APV) infected chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cultures and tissues obtained from APV infected turkeys subtracted with their respective uninfected cultures and tissues. Of the 1191 unique genes represented on the array, the expression of a total of 327 genes (27% of total) were altered by two-fold or more from 6 through 72h post-infection. A comparative analysis of IBV regulated genes with genes previously reported to change in expression following infection with other avian respiratory viruses revealed both conserved and unique changes. Real-time qRT-PCR was used to confirm the regulated expression of genes related to several functional classes including kinases, interferon induced genes, chemokines and adhesion molecules, vesicular trafficking and fusion protein genes, extracellular matrix protein genes, cell cycle, metabolism, cell physiology and development, translation, RNA binding, lysosomal, protein degradation and ubiquitination related genes. Microarray analysis served as an efficient tool in facilitating a comparative analysis of avian respiratory viral infections and provided insight into host transcriptional changes that were conserved as well as those which were unique to individual pathogens.","publish_time":"2005-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dar, Arshud; Munir, Shirin; Vishwanathan, Satya; Manuja, Anju; Griebel, Philip; Tikoo, Suresh; Townsend, Hugh; Potter, Andrew; Kapur, Vivek; Babiuk, Lorne A.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b73388cfd1c1f5cafc537b3e41d53d64b2570ce5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114260.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170205000225; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170205000225","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs3MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","APV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["unique genes","regulated expression of genes","fusion protein genes","ubiquitination related genes","interferon induced genes","extracellular matrix protein genes","unique chicken","comparative analysis of IBV","comparative analysis of avian respiratory viral infections","avian pneumovirus","avian respiratory viruses","avian cDNA arrays","microarray analysis","unique changes","h post IBV infection","h post-infection","protein degradation","infected chicken embryo fibroblast","APV infected turkeys","tissues","lung tissue of IBV","total","Abstract Avian infectious bronchitis virus","major viral respiratory diseases of chickens","day-old chicken embryos","host transcriptional changes","cell cycle","cell physiology","RNA binding","molecular basis of viral pathogenesis","transcriptional profiles","respective uninfected cultures","development of improved prophylactic","normalized cDNA subtraction libraries","chemokines","adhesion molecules","vesicular trafficking","metabolism","insight","kinases","translation","functional classes","CEF","fragments","diagnostic reagents","efficient tool","turkey gene transcripts","Better understanding","present investigation","Real-time qRT-PCR","individual pathogens","fold"],"language":"en"},

Italy is the hardest hit country after China. Considering the deleterious consequences of malnutrition, which certainly can affect patients with COVID-19, the aim of this article is to present a pragmatic protocol for early nutritional supplementation of non-critically ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19 disease. It is based on the observation that most patients present at admission with severe inflammation and anorexia leading to a drastic reduction of food intake, and that a substantial percentage develops respiratory failure requiring non-invasive ventilation or even continuous positive airway pressure. METHODS: High-calorie dense diets in a variety of different consistencies with highly digestible foods and snacks are available for all patients. Oral supplementation of whey proteins as well as intravenous infusion of multivitamin, multimineral trace elements solutions are implemented at admission. In the presence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficit, cholecalciferol is promptly supplied. If nutritional risk is detected, two to three bottles of protein-calorie oral nutritional supplements (ONS) are provided.

CONCLUSION: We are aware that our straight approach may be debatable. However, to cope with the current emergency crisis, its aim is to promptly and pragmatically implement nutritional care in patients with COVID-19, which might be overlooked despite being potentially beneficial to clinical outcomes and effective in preventing the consequences of malnutrition in this patient population.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Caccialanza, Riccardo; Laviano, Alessandro; Lobascio, Federica; Montagna, Elisabetta; Bruno, Raffaele; Ludovisi, Serena; Corsico, Angelo Guido; Di Sabatino, Antonio; Belliato, Mirko; Calvi, Monica; Iacona, Isabella; Grugnetti, Giuseppina; Bonadeo, Elisa; Muzzi, Alba; Cereda, Emanuele","journal":"Nutrition","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b9e58ba15e907ce410465be53949a0c5b2c77d70.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194616.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32280058/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0899900720301180; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899900720301180; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2020.110835","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs3MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ONS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["COVID","ill patients","nutritional care","nutritional risk","calorie oral nutritional supplements","early nutritional supplementation of non-","admission","d of ONS","China","aim","deleterious consequences of malnutrition","respiratory failure","Oral supplementation of whey proteins","respiratory conditions","bottles of protein","hydroxyvitamin D deficit","novel coronavirus disease","High-calorie dense diets","non-invasive ventilation","intravenous infusion of multivitamin","variety of different consistencies","multimineral trace elements solutions","substantial percentage","digestible foods","pragmatic protocol","continuous positive airway pressure","anorexia","snacks","drastic reduction of food intake","severe inflammation","hardest hit country","METHODS","consecutive days","clinical outcomes","total parenteral nutrition","straight approach","Italy","Wuhan","current emergency crisis","presence","cholecalciferol","article","patient population","pneumonia epidemic","observation","CONCLUSION","OBJECTIVES","world"],"language":"en"},

The limitations to high-level expression of active viral surface glycoproteins in yeast are not well understood. To identify possible bottlenecks we performed a detailed study on overexpression of recombinant mumps hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (MuHN) and measles hemagglutinin (MeH) in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, combining the analysis of recombinant proteins with a proteomic approach. RESULTS: Overexpressed recombinant MuHN and MeH proteins were present in large aggregates, were inactive and totally insoluble under native conditions. Moreover, the majority of recombinant protein was found in immature form of non-glycosylated precursors. Fractionation of yeast lysates revealed that the core of viral surface protein aggregates consists of MuHN or MeH disulfide-linked multimers involving eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) and is closely associated with small heat shock proteins (sHsps) that can be removed only under denaturing conditions. Complexes of large Hsps seem to be bound to aggregate core peripherally as they can be easily removed at high salt concentrations. Proteomic analysis revealed that the accumulation of unglycosylated viral protein precursors results in specific cytosolic unfolded protein response (UPR-Cyto) in yeast cells, characterized by different action and regulation of small Hsps versus large chaperones of Hsp70, Hsp90 and Hsp110 families. In contrast to most environmental stresses, in the response to synthesis of recombinant MuHN and MeH, only the large Hsps were upregulated whereas sHsps were not. Interestingly, the amount of eEF1A was also increased during this stress response. CONCLUSIONS: Inefficient translocation of MuHN and MeH precursors through ER membrane is a bottleneck for high-level expression in yeast. Overexpression of these recombinant proteins induces the UPR\u0027s cytosolic counterpart, the UPR-Cyto, which represent a subset of proteins involved in the heat-shock response. The involvement of eEF1A may explain the mechanism by which only large chaperones, but not small Hsps are upregulated during this stress response. Our study highlights important differences between viral surface protein expression in yeast and mammalian cells at the first stage of secretory pathway.","publish_time":"2011-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u010Ciplys, Evaldas; Samuel, Dhanraj; Juozapaitis, Mindaugas; Sasnauskas, K\u0119stutis; Slibinskas, Rimantas","journal":"Microb Cell Fact","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6fa68c5038374d5ae1b2c1e5a0929e6c1e8ea44.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3120639.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21595909/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2859-10-37","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs3ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UPR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["analysis of recombinant proteins","yeast cells","viral surface protein expression","majority of recombinant protein","synthesis of recombinant MuHN","Overexpressed recombinant MuHN","subset of proteins","large aggregates","stress response","core of viral surface protein aggregates","Complexes of large Hsps","small heat shock proteins","expression of human virus surface proteins","heat-shock response","high-level expression of active viral surface glycoproteins","specific cytosolic unfolded protein response","accumulation of unglycosylated viral protein precursors results","regulation of small Hsps","large chaperones of Hsp70","yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae","Fractionation of yeast lysates","mammalian cells","overexpression of recombinant mumps hemagglutinin-neuraminidase","Inefficient translocation of MuHN","UPR-Cyto","mammalian glycoproteins","Proteomic analysis","sHsps","involvement of eEF1A","cells of higher eukaryotes","detailed study","measles hemagglutinin","aggregate core","proteomic approach","native conditions","denaturing conditions","immature form of non-glycosylated precursors","UPR\u0027s cytosolic counterpart","disulfide-linked multimers","eukaryotic translation elongation factor","different action","important differences","ER membrane","Hsp90","mechanism","limitations","Hsp110 families","environmental stresses","possible bottlenecks","stage of secretory pathway","yeasts","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","high salt concentrations","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Immunological imprinting by CMV is not restricted to immunity against CMV itself, but can affect immunity against other viral or non-viral infectious agents and also immunopathological responses. One category is heterologous immunity based on molecular mimicry, where antigen recognition receptors specific for a CMV antigen with broad avidity distribution also bind with some avidity to unrelated antigens and exert effector functions against target structures other than those linked to CMV. Another category is induction of cytokines by CMV infection that inhibit or drive immune responses to bystander antigens unrelated to CMV, and a third category is the activation of antigen-presenting cells by CMV from which unrelated antigens profit as \u201Cstowaways\u201D. A striking example of the \u201Cstowaway\u201D category, actually one that is of medical importance, has been published recently and will be discussed here for the more general reader. Specifically, in a murine model, CMV airway infection and inhaled environmental antigen of poor intrinsic allergenic potential were found to sensitize for allergic airway disease (AAD) only when combined. As to the mechanism, viral activation of CD11b(\u002B) conventional dendritic cells (CD11b(\u002B) cDC) that localize to airway mucosa facilitates uptake and processing of inhaled antigen. Thus, CMV serves as a \u201Cdoor opener\u201D for otherwise harmless environmental antigens that have no intrinsic property to activate DC. Antigen-laden CD11b(\u002B) cDC migrate selectively to the airway draining lymph nodes, where they prime type-2 CD4(\u002B) T helper (Th-2) cells. Upon airway re-exposure to the inhaled antigen, Th-2 cells secrete interleukins (IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-25) known to induce goblet cell metaplasia, the lead histopathological manifestation of AAD that is characterized by thickening of airway epithelia and increased numbers of mucus-producing goblet cells, resulting in enhanced mucus secretion and airflow obstruction.","publish_time":"2019-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reddehase, Matthias J.","journal":"Med Microbiol Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d117ec11641d070b353712970e23ea8570c0dfeb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086984.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00430-019-00610-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076879/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs3OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AAD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CMV antigen","CMV infection","CMV airway infection","activation of antigen","category","IL","processing of inhaled antigen","Antigen-laden CD11b","goblet cells","unrelated antigens","airway mucosa","airway epithelia","bystander antigens unrelated","viral activation of CD11b","airway re-exposure","allergic airway disease","antigen recognition receptors specific","inhaled environmental antigen of poor intrinsic allergenic potential","harmless environmental antigens","conventional dendritic cells","immune responses","heterologous immunity","cDC","non-viral infectious agents","intrinsic property","immunopathological responses","enhanced mucus secretion","increased numbers of mucus","goblet cell metaplasia","broad avidity distribution","host\u2019s immune system","lead histopathological manifestation of AAD","molecular mimicry","profound impact","effector functions","uptake","door opener","murine model","airflow obstruction","target structures","induction of cytokines","interleukins","T helper","type","CD4","lymph nodes","mechanism","striking example","Immunological imprinting","stowaways","Cytomegalovirus","medical importance","general reader"],"language":"en"},

The nucleic acid amplification is a key step in DNA detection assays. It contributes to improving the assay sensitivity by enabling the detection of a limited number of target molecules. The use of microfluidic devices to miniaturize amplification protocols reduces the required sample volume and the analysis times and offers new possibilities for the process automation and integration in one single device. The vast majority of miniaturized systems for nucleic acid analysis exploit the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification method, which requires repeated cycles of three or two temperature-dependent steps during the amplification of the nucleic acid target sequence. In contrast, low temperature isothermal amplification methods have no need for thermal cycling thus requiring simplified microfluidic device features. Here, the use of miniaturized analysis systems using isothermal amplification reactions for the nucleic acid amplification will be discussed.","publish_time":"2012-12-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zanoli, Laura Maria; Spoto, Giuseppe","journal":"Biosensors (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1624c6455f4fb4a8e871403b0e27a217bcdc83b2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4263587.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/bios3010018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25587397/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nucleic acid amplification","amplification protocols","nucleic acid analysis","isothermal amplification reactions","nucleic acid target sequence","low temperature isothermal amplification methods","use of miniaturized analysis systems","analysis times","biomolecular detection","need","assay sensitivity","DNA detection assays","use of microfluidic devices","vast majority of miniaturized systems","simplified microfluidic device features","terms of sensitivity","single device","temperature-dependent steps","limited number of target molecules","polymerase chain reaction","thermal cycling","key step","selectivity","required sample volume","process automation","new possibilities","specific requirements","high-throughput","integration","PCR","contrast","order","repeated cycles","applicability","Diagnostic tools","cost"],"language":"en"},

To analyse epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of the four types of human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs), patients with acute respiratory tract illness (ARTI) were studied in Guangzhou, southern China. METHODS: Throat swabs (n=4755) were collected and tested from children and adults with ARTI over a 26-month period, and 4447 of 4755 (93.5%) patients\u2019 clinical presentations were recorded for further analysis. RESULTS: Of 4755 patients tested, 178 (3.7%) were positive for HPIV. Ninety-nine (2.1%) samples were positive for HPIV-3, 58 (1.2%) for HPIV-1, 19 (0.4%) for HPIV-2 and 8 (0.2%) for HPIV-4. 160/178 (88.9%) HPIV-positive samples were from paediatric patients younger than 5 years old, but no infant under one month of age was HPIV positive. Seasonal peaks of HPIV-3 and HPIV-1 occurred as autumn turned to winter and summer turned to autumn. HPIV-2 and HPIV-4 were detected less frequently, and their frequency of isolation increased when the frequency of HPIV-3 and HPIV-1 declined. HPIV infection led to a wide spectrum of symptoms, and more \u201Choarseness\u201D (p=0.015), \u201Cabnormal pulmonary breathing sound\u201D (p\u003C0.001), \u201Cdyspnoea\u201D (p\u003C0.001), \u201Cpneumonia\u201D (p=0.01), and \u201Cdiarrhoea\u201D (p\u003C0.001) presented in HPIV-positive patients than HPIV-negative patients. 10/10 (100%) HPIV-positive adult patients (\u226514 years old) presented with systemic influenza-like symptoms, while 90/164 (54.9%) HPIV-positive paediatric patients (\u003C14 years old) presented with these symptoms (p=0.005). The only significant difference in clinical presentation between HPIV types was \u201CExpectoration\u201D (p\u003C0.001). Co-infections were common, with 33.3%\u201363.2% of samples positive for the four HPIV types also testing positive for other respiratory pathogens. However, no significant differences were seen in clinical presentation between patients solely infected with HPIV and patients co-infected with HPIV and other respiratory pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: HPIV infection led to a wide spectrum of symptoms, and similar clinical manifestations were found in the patients with four different types of HPIVs. The study suggested pathogenic activity of HPIV in gastrointestinal illness. The clinical presentation of HPIV infection may differ by patient age.","publish_time":"2013-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Wen-Kuan; Liu, Qian; Chen, De-Hui; Liang, Huan-Xi; Chen, Xiao-Kai; Huang, Wen-Bo; Qin, Sheng; Yang, Zi-Feng; Zhou, Rong","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c58c5ce46bfa52188d231685cc1c6a440840b85.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3560251.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23343342/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-13-28","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPIV"],"locations":["Guangzhou"],"keyphrases":["HPIV positive","HPIV-positive patients","HPIV types","frequency of HPIV","HPIV-positive samples","HPIV-negative patients","HPIV-positive paediatric patients","HPIV-positive adult patients","clinical presentation of HPIV infection","pathogenic activity of HPIV","Seasonal peaks of HPIV","samples positive","patients co-infected","paediatric patients younger","respiratory pathogens","clinical characteristics","lower respiratory tract illness","acute respiratory tract illness","years old","different types of HPIVs","similar clinical manifestations","wide spectrum of symptoms","patients\u2019 clinical presentations","important causes of upper respiratory tract illness","gastrointestinal illness","types of human parainfluenza viruses","ARTI","month of age","autumn","significant differences","patient age","Co-infections","frequency of isolation","month period","URTI","abnormal pulmonary breathing sound","BACKGROUND","systemic influenza","infant","LRTI","Expectoration","METHODS","Throat swabs","Guangzhou","study","southern China","children","adults","summer","analysis","hoarseness","CONCLUSIONS","dyspnoea","pneumonia","diarrhoea","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The amino terminal half of the S glycoprotein gene including antigenic sites A, B, C and D, were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Amplified PCR products were cloned, sequenced, and compared with published sequences for non-Korean TGEV strains. Korea TGEV field strains had 98.5\u201399.5% nucleotide sequence and 97.2\u201399.0% amino acid sequence similarity with each other.

Korean TGEV strains had several specific nucleotide and amino acid sequences which were not found in foreign TGEV or PRCV strains. HKT2 strain differed by 0.89% in nucleotide and 2.03% amino acid sequences compared to original KT2 strain although the regions forming four antigenic sites were not changed. By phylogenetic tree analysis, Korean field TGEV strains were branched into different groups from non-Korean TGEV or PRCV strains. Korean TGEV field strains KT2 and 133 were branched in separate groups that were differentiated from the other Korean TGEV strains.

Virus was isolated from samples and transmission electron microscopy of the resulting isolates confirmed that the virus was morphologically consistent with a herpesvirus. Nucleotide sequencing of the PCR product from tissue samples and from the isolates revealed that the virus was in the subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae and was distinct from other known herpesviruses. The correlation between the lesions and the novel virus remains unknown. Two herpesviruses, both in the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, have previously been described in macropods and are known to cause systemic clinical disease. This is the first reported gammaherpesvirus within the order Marsupialia, and may provide valuable information regarding the evolution and phylogeny of this virus family.

To understand MERS-CoV engagement of sialylated receptors, we determined the cryo-EM structures of S in complex with 5-N-acetyl neuraminic acid, 5-N-glycolyl neuraminic acid, sialyl-Lewis(X), \u03B12,3-sialyl-N-acetyl-lactosamine and \u03B12,6-sialyl-N-acetyl-lactosamine at 2.7\u20133.0 \u00C5 resolution.

Our data illuminate MERS-CoV S sialoside specificity and suggest that selectivity for \u03B12,3-linked over \u03B12,6-linked receptors results from enhanced interactions with the former class of oligosaccharides.

In the operating room, as part of hospital outbreak response measures, anesthesiologists are required to have heightened precautions and tailor anesthetic practices to individual patients. In particular, by minimizing the many aerosol-generating procedures performed during general anesthesia, anesthesiologists can reduce exposure to patients\u2019 respiratory secretions and the risk of perioperative viral transmission to healthcare workers and other patients. To avoid any airway manipulation, regional anesthesia should be considered whenever surgery is planned for a suspect or confirmed COVID-19 patient or any patient who poses an infection risk. Regional anesthesia has benefits of preservation of respiratory function, avoidance of aerosolization and hence viral transmission. This article explores the practical considerations and recommended measures for performing regional anesthesia in this group of patients, focusing on control measures geared towards ensuring patient and staff safety, equipment protection, and infection prevention. By doing so, we hope to address an issue that may have downstream implications in the way we practice infection control in anesthesia, with particular relevance to this new era of emerging infectious diseases and novel pathogens. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is not the first, and certainly will not be the last novel virus that will lead to worldwide outbreaks. Having a well thought out regional anesthesia plan to manage these patients in this new normal will ensure the best possible outcome for both the patient and the perioperative management team.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lie, Sui An; Wong, Sook Wai; Wong, Loong Tat; Wong, Theodore Gar Ling; Chong, Shin Yuet","journal":"Can J Anaesth","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b8286410e7ee95baf2e116ffb163bbe6c0febc9d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095295.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-020-01637-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32212103/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs0OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["regional anesthesia plan","general anesthesia","control measures","individual patients","infection risk","infection control","group of patients","anesthesiologists","recommended measures","risk of perioperative viral transmission","infection prevention","patients\u2019 respiratory secretions","preservation of respiratory function","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","hospital outbreak response measures","particular relevance","novel pathogens","novel virus","Coronavirus disease","confirmed COVID","worldwide outbreaks","perioperative management team","rapid worldwide spread","new era of emerging infectious diseases","equipment protection","exposure","avoidance of aerosolization","healthcare workers","anesthetic practices","staff safety","best possible outcome","heightened precautions","practical considerations","SARS-CoV","suspect","procedures","downstream implications","pandemic","World Health Organization","article","airway manipulation","surgery","operating room","issue"],"language":"en"},

This dynamic likely poses a behavioral barrier to cross-species transmission in the wild. Recently, several host intracellular anti-viral proteins that contribute to species-specificity of primate lentiviruses have been identified revealing adaptive mechanisms that further limit spread of lentiviruses between species. Consistent with these inter-species transmission barriers, phylogenetic evidence supports the prediction that FIV transmission is an exceedingly rare event between free-ranging cat species, though it has occurred occasionally in captive settings. Recently we documented that puma and bobcats in Southern California share an FIV strain, providing an opportunity to evaluate evolution of both viral strains and host intracellular restriction proteins. These studies are facilitated by the availability of the 2X cat genome sequence annotation. In addition, concurrent viral and host genetic analyses have been used to track patterns of migration of the host species and barriers to transmission of the virus within the African lion. These studies illustrate the utility of FIV as a model to discover the variables necessary for establishment and control of lentiviral infections in new species.","publish_time":"2008-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Troyer, Jennifer L.; VandeWoude, Sue; Pecon-Slattery, Jill; McIntosh, Carl; Franklin, Sam; Antunes, Agostinho; Johnson, Warren; O\u0027Brien, Stephen J.","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd3d281925fe28252b1ee7de281244698fd494cc.json; document_parses/pdf_json/646cf3da31ec468a64e1f1710e9573e94586aae5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2442884.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.01.023; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242708000317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18299153/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242708000317; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2442884?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs1Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIV"],"locations":["Southern California"],"keyphrases":["host species","cat species","cross-species transmission","FIV transmission","new species","species-specificity","inter-species transmission barriers","host intracellular anti-viral proteins","mother-offspring transmission","host intracellular restriction proteins","viral strains","host genetic analyses","FIV strain","primate lentiviruses","utility of FIV","studies","sexual contact","direct contact","primate immunodeficiency viruses","cat genome sequence annotation","phylogenetic evidence","exceedingly rare event","FIVs","control of lentiviral infections","behavioral barrier","prediction","establishment","SIVs","Southern California","revealing adaptive mechanisms","limit","variables necessary","HIV","model","bobcats","opportunity","addition","evolution","patterns of migration","puma","availability","African lion","captive settings"],"language":"en"},

The main viruses responsible for acute respiratory infection in people include respiratory syncytial, influenza, human parainfluenza, human metapneumo-, human rhino-, corona-, and adenoviruses. Licensed vaccines are available only for influenza virus, with vaccines against the other pathogens either in clinical trials or in preclinical stages of development. The majority of studies evaluating respiratory virus vaccines measure serum antibody responses, because, although both cellular and humoral responses contribute to the clearance of a primary infection, neutralizing antibodies are known to protect against secondary infection. Humoral responses can be readily detected after vaccination with inactivated or subunit vaccines; however, fewer individuals seroconvert after vaccination with live vaccines. Alternative immune mechanisms such as mucosal antibody responses are probably responsible for protection by live attenuated vaccines, and immune correlates of protection are under investigation.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Broadbent, Andrew J.; Boonnak, Kobporn; Subbarao, Kanta","journal":"Mucosal Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f25b4e8858297fd2716bfbf5c5c5d4dc95e9fec1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149605.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124158474000598; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780124158474000598","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs1NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["live vaccines","available vaccines","subunit vaccines","Licensed vaccines","immune responses","live attenuated vaccines","humoral responses","respiratory virus vaccines measure serum antibody responses","acute respiratory infection","mucosal antibody responses","respiratory tract","human parainfluenza","influenza virus","human metapneumo","human rhino","immune correlates of protection","vaccination","primary infection","secondary infection","main viruses responsible","Alternative immune mechanisms","main viral pathogens","preclinical stages of development","people","fewer individuals","majority of studies","clinical trials","clearance","antibodies","corona","chapter","investigation","adenoviruses"],"language":"en"},

Understanding the effect of control effort is crucial to inform future control strategies. OBJECTIVES: We developed a framework to measure season-based health burden risk from 2001 to 2014. We reconstructed various intervention coverage to assess the attributable effect of dengue infection control efforts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A dengue\u2013mosquito\u2013human transmission dynamic was used to quantify the vector\u2013host interactions and to estimate the disease epidemics. We used disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to assess health burden risk. A temperature-basic reproduction number (R(0))\u2013DALYs relationship was constructed to examine the potential impacts of temperature on health burden. Finally, a health burden risk model linked a control measure model to evaluate the effect of dengue control interventions. RESULTS: We showed that R(0) and DALYs peaked at 25\u00B0C with estimates of 2.37 and 1387, respectively. Results indicated that most dengue cases occurred in fall with estimated DALYs of 323 (267\u2013379, 95% CI) at 50% risk probability. We found that repellent spray had by far the largest control effect with an effectiveness of ~71% in all seasons. Pesticide spray and container clean-up have both made important contributions to reducing prevalence/incidence. Repellent, pesticide spray, container clean-up together with Wolbachia infection suppress dengue outbreak by ~90%. CONCLUSION: Our presented modeling framework provides a useful tool to measure dengue health burden risk and to quantify the effect of dengue control on dengue infection prevalence and disease incidence in the southern region of Taiwan.","publish_time":"2018-09-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Yi-Hsien; Lin, Yi-Jun; Chen, Szu-Chieh; You, Shu-Han; Chen, Wei-Yu; Hsieh, Nan-Hung; Yang, Ying-Fei; Liao, Chung-Min","journal":"Infect Drug Resist","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f65b990d1f24de2bf3cd52d8559e8ccba9961af.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6132233.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s169820; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30233221/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs1NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["effect of dengue control interventions","dengue health burden risk","dengue cases","dengue infection prevalence","attributable effect of dengue infection control efforts","high prevalence of dengue","largest control effect","effect of control effort","control measure model","health burden risk model","current control interventions","season-based health burden risk","future control strategies","consecutive large dengue outbreaks","risk probability","estimated DALYs","Pesticide spray","repellent spray","DALYs relationship","container clean-up","Wolbachia infection","disease incidence","RESULTS","disease epidemics","presented modeling framework","southern region of Taiwan","potential impacts of temperature","temperature-basic reproduction number","useful tool","mosquito","period","important contributions","human transmission dynamic","disability-adjusted life years","fall","various intervention coverage","host interactions","vector","CONCLUSION","METHODS","BACKGROUND","effectiveness","MATERIALS","estimates","OBJECTIVES","seasons"],"language":"en"},

RIG-I like receptors (RLRs) are cytosolic RNA helicases that function as pathogen recognition receptors to detect RNA pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of virus infection. The RLRs include RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2. They function to recognize and bind to PAMP motifs within viral RNA in a process that directs the RLR to trigger downstream signaling cascades that induce innate immunity that controls viral replication and spread. Products of RLR signaling also serve to modulate the adaptive immune response to infection. Recent studies have additionally connected RLRs to signaling cascades that impart inflammatory and apoptotic responses to virus infection. Viral evasion of RLR signaling supports viral outgrowth and pathogenesis, including the onset of viral-associated cancer.","publish_time":"2015-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Errett, John S.; Gale, Michael","journal":"Virol Sin","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d38449e1a1e5fb36468240e81086d45019e5af9a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12250-015-3604-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25997992/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs1ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral RNA","viral susceptibility","viral outgrowth","onset of viral","viral replication","Viral evasion of RLR","chronic viral-associated diseases","control of virus infection","RNA pathogen","Innate immunity","associated cancer","connected RLRs","cascades","Products of RLR","RIG","pathogen recognition receptors","cytosolic RNA helicases","direct antiviral immunity","protection","molecular patterns","PAMPs","apoptotic responses","pathogenesis","process","PAMP motifs","Recent studies","adaptive immune response","MDA5","LGP2"],"language":"en"},

There are limited data on maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study to compare clinical characteristics, maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with and without COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: During January 24 to February 29, 2020, there were sixteen pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and eighteen suspected cases who were admitted to labor in the third trimester. Two had vaginal delivery and the rest took cesarean section. Few patients presented respiratory symptoms (fever and cough) on admission, but most had typical chest CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia. Compared to the controls, COVID-19 pneumonia patients had lower counts of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, C-reactive protein (CRP), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) on admission. Increased levels of WBC, neutrophils, eosinophils, and CRP were found in postpartum blood tests of pneumonia patients. There were three (18.8%) and three (16.7%) of the mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 pneumonia had preterm delivery due to maternal complications, which were significantly higher than the control group. None experienced respiratory failure during hospital stay. COVID-19 infection was not found in the newborns and none developed severe neonatal complications. CONCLUSION: Severe maternal and neonatal complications were not observed in pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia who had vaginal delivery or caesarean section. Mild respiratory symptoms of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia highlight the need of effective screening on admission.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Na; Han, Lefei; Peng, Min; Lv, Yuxia; Ouyang, Yin; Liu, Kui; Yue, Linli; Li, Qiannan; Sun, Guoqiang; Chen, Lin; Yang, Lin","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51ccc12cb13100d6e8b87392462e45360b307e67.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32249918/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa352","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["suspected COVID","confirmed COVID","neonatal outcomes of pregnant women","maternal complications","postpartum blood tests of pneumonia patients","Mild respiratory symptoms of pregnant women","severe neonatal complications","admission","typical chest CT images of COVID","vaginal delivery","neutrophils","CRP","preterm delivery","respiratory failure","suspected cases","cesarean section","caesarean section","control group","Increased levels of WBC","case-control study","lower counts of white blood cells","clinical characteristics","potential adverse effects","fever","C-reactive protein","serious concerns","ongoing epidemics of coronavirus disease","alanine aminotransferase","need of effective screening","eosinophils","rest","cough","newborns","limited data","CONCLUSION","pregnancy","BACKGROUND","labor","ALT","mothers","controls","hospital","infection","trimester","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Factors explaining the recurrences are partially known, involving demographics, biology, and complex relationships with the environment, but no comprehensive theory exists today. Here, we review some recent results obtained in modelling studies with a view to understanding better the mechanisms of perpetuation. Factors intrinsic to the interaction of pathogen and host have regained interest in this respect, especially with multiple pathogen and multiple population interactions.

As a proper way to describe the multiple connections among people in reality, multiplex network, a set of nodes interacting through multiple sets of edges, has attracted much attention. In this paper, to explore the coupled dynamical processes, a multiplex network with two layers is built. Specifically, the information spreading layer is a time varying network generated by the activity driven model, while the contagion layer is a static network. We extend the microscopic Markov chain approach to derive the epidemic threshold of the model. Compared with extensive Monte Carlo simulations, the method shows high accuracy for the prediction of the epidemic threshold. Besides, taking different spreading models of awareness into consideration, we explored the interplay between epidemic spreading with awareness spreading. The results show that the awareness spreading can not only enhance the epidemic threshold but also reduce the prevalence of epidemics. When the spreading of awareness is defined as susceptible-infected-susceptible model, there exists a critical value where the dynamical process on the awareness layer can control the onset of epidemics; while if it is a threshold model, the epidemic threshold emerges an abrupt transition with the local awareness ratio \u03B1 approximating 0.5. Moreover, we also find that temporal changes in the topology hinder the spread of awareness which directly affect the epidemic threshold, especially when the awareness layer is threshold model. Given that the threshold model is a widely used model for social contagion, this is an important and meaningful result. Our results could also lead to interesting future research about the different time-scales of structural changes in multiplex networks.","publish_time":"2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Quantong; Lei, Yanjun; Jiang, Xin; Ma, Yifang; Huo, Guanying; Zheng, Zhiming","journal":"Chaos","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7dfcb60242b1f4c2a713606e2d5b9a42add3935.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112485.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4947420; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27131489/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs3MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epidemic threshold","threshold model","spreading of awareness","epidemic spreading","awareness layer","spread of awareness","susceptible model","different spreading models of awareness","contagion layer","local awareness ratio \u03B1","static network","time varying network","multiplex networks","people","interplay","aware of epidemics","onset of epidemics","prevalence of epidemics","results","different time-scales","multiple connections","structural changes","susceptible-infected","temporal changes","social contagion","coupled dynamical processes","multiple sets of edges","method","abrupt transition","set of nodes","reality","high accuracy","interesting future research","prediction","extensive Monte Carlo simulations","human response","activity","consideration","various measures","critical value","microscopic Markov chain approach","topology","proper way","information","meaningful result","paper","layers","attention"],"language":"en"},

This study assessed the infective viral etiologies by real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction of patients hospitalized with AECOPD and asthma exacerbations. In addition, infective etiologies were assessed for association with the clinical outcome of the patients. METHODS: Adults admitted with AECOPD and asthma exacerbations between August 2016 and July 2017 were recruited. Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples were obtained from the patients within 1\u20132 days of admission and subjected to pathogen detection and human rhinovirus (HRV) typing. RESULTS: Altogether 402 patients with AECOPD, 80 stable COPD, 100 asthma exacerbation and 21 stable asthma subjects were recruited. Among those admitted for AECOPD and asthma exacerbations, 141(35.1%) and 45(45.0%) respectively had pathogens identified in the NPA specimens. The commonest virus identified was influenza A followed by HRV. HRV typing identified HRV-A and HRV-C as the more common HRV with a wide variety of genotypes. Identification of pathogens in NPA or HRV typing otherwise did not affect clinical outcomes including the hospital length of stay, readmission rates and mortality except that identification of pathogens in asthma exacerbation was associated with a lower rate of readmissions at 30 and 60 days. CONCLUSIONS: Many respiratory viruses were associated with AECOPD and asthma exacerbation. HRV-A and HRV-C were the more common HRV associated with exacerbations. Identification of pathogens in NPA was associated with less readmissions for asthma patients at 30 and 60 days. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02866357.

Progress in targeted therapeutics requires establishing effective approaches for high-throughput identification of agents specific for clinically relevant cell surface markers. Over the past decade, a number of platform strategies have been developed to screen polypeptide libraries for ligands targeting receptors selectively expressed in the context of various cell surface proteomes. Streamlined procedures for identification of ligand-receptor pairs that could serve as targets in disease diagnosis, profiling, imaging and therapy have relied on the display technologies, in which polypeptides with desired binding profiles can be serially selected, in a process called biopanning, based on their physical linkage with the encoding nucleic acid. These technologies include virus/phage display, cell display, ribosomal display, mRNA display and covalent DNA display (CDT), with phage display being by far the most utilized. The scope of this review is the recent advancements in the display technologies with a particular emphasis on molecular mapping of cell surface proteomes with peptide phage display.

Methods The data, strategies, and systems used around the world for the surveillance of infectious diseases and pathogens, along with current issues and trends, were reviewed. Results Twelve major classes of data were identified on the basis of their timing relative to infection, resources available, and type of surveillance. Two primary strategies were compared: disease-specific surveillance and syndromic surveillance. Finally, 262 systems implemented worldwide for the surveillance of infections were registered and briefly described, with a focus on those based on microbiological data from laboratories.

However, only a few protein substrates have thus far been described and the mechanisms by which cathepsins B and L regulate cell proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis are poorly understood. Combined deficiency of both cathepsins results in early-onset neurodegeneration in mice reminiscent of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses in humans. Therefore, we intended to quantify accumulated proteins in brain lysosomes of double deficient mice. A combination of subcellular fractionation and LC-MS/MS using isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ\u2122) allowed us to simultaneously assess wildtype and cathepsin B(\u2212/\u2212)L(\u2212/\u2212) cerebral lysosomes. Altogether, 19 different proteins were significantly increased in cathepsin B(\u2212/\u2212)L(\u2212/\u2212) lysosomes. Most elevated proteins had previously been localized to neuronal biosynthetic, recycling/endocytic or lysosomal compartments. A more than 10-fold increase was observed for Rab14, the Delta/Notch-like epidermal growth factor-related receptor (DNER), calcyon, and carboxypeptidase E. Intriguingly, immunohistochemistry demonstrated that Rab14 and DNER specifically stain swollen axons in double deficient brains. Since dense accumulations of expanded axons are the earliest phenotypic and pathognomonic feature of cathepsin B(\u2212/\u2212)L(\u2212/\u2212) brains, our data suggest a role for cathepsins B and L in recycling processes during axon outgrowth and synapse formation in the developing postnatal central nervous system.","publish_time":"2007-07-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stahl, Sonja; Reinders, Yvonne; Asan, Esther; Mothes, Walther; Conzelmann, Ernst; Sickmann, Albert; Felbor, Ute","journal":"Biochim Biophys Acta Proteins Proteom","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1da2f9717e210595772dd2ee8e71bb62ed2810f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105221.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1570963907001537; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570963907001537","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cathepsins"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Cathepsins B","pathognomonic feature of cathepsin B","cathepsins results","recycling processes","DNER","double deficient brains","brain lysosomes of double deficient mice","Rab14","accumulated proteins","different proteins","elevated proteins","cerebral lysosomes","LC-MS","swollen axons","onset neurodegeneration","lysosomal compartments","mice reminiscent of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses","variety of pathological processes","lysosomal cysteine proteases","dense accumulations of expanded axons","synapse formation","isobaric tagging","epidermal growth factor-related receptor","cancer","developing postnatal central nervous system","axon outgrowth","absolute quantitation","Notch","cell proliferation","tumor angiogenesis","combination of subcellular fractionation","calcyon","Delta","humans","data","role","invasion","apoptosis","iTRAQ","carboxypeptidase","Combined deficiency","immunohistochemistry","fold increase","wildtype","mechanisms","protein substrates"],"language":"en"},

Escherichia coli was detected in 94% of all the faecal samples, but isolates from only three samples from calves with diarrhoea contained the K99 antigen. Similarly, Salmonella was found only in scouring calves. Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in animals with signs of diarrhoea, while other coccidia oocysts, Strongylida and Strongyloides eggs were frequently found in animals both with and without diarrhoea.

Another calicivirus, Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus, attaches to H type 2 histo-blood group oligosaccharide present on rabbit epithelial cells. Our aim was to test if, by analogy, recombinant NV-like particles (rNV VLPs) use carbohydrates present on human gastroduodenal epithelial cells as ligands. Methods: Attachment of rNV VLPs was tested on tissue sections of the gastroduodenal junction and on saliva from individuals of known ABO, Lewis, and secretor phenotypes. It was also tested on human Caco-2 cells and on animal cell lines transfected with glycosyltransferases complementary DNA (cDNA). Competition experiments were performed with synthetic oligosaccharides and anticarbohydrate antibodies. Internalization was monitored by confocal microscopy. Results: Attachment of rNV VLPs to surface epithelial cells of the gastroduodenal junction as well as to saliva was detected, yet only from secretor donors. It was abolished by \u03B11,2fucosidase treatment, and by competition with the H types 1 and 3 trisaccharides or with anti-H type 1 and anti-H types\u00BE antibodies. Transfection of CHO and TS/A cells with an \u03B11,2fucosyltransferase cDNA allowed attachment of VLPs. These transfectants as well as differentiated Caco-2 cells expressing H type 1 structures internalized the bound particles.

The laboratory arm of surveillance must be complemented by hospital and primary care components. We also need more training at all levels: undergraduate and postgraduate medical training, specialist training, as well as continuing professional development schemes. Core training programmes for infectious disease specialists and medical microbiologists must be established. The contribution of general practitioners, infection specialists, microbiology laboratories, and public health specialists/agencies to response systems should be defined as clearly as possible and should be either empirically based or derived from scenario-guided calamity models. The success of surveillance hinges on sufficient long-term resources and dedicated coordination. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) may assume this role. However, structural and administrative constraints of the diverse healthcare systems throughout Europe may represent an impediment to a harmonised response. Also, the funding of the ECDC cannot cover the operational demands. The ECDC may well work as a small coordinating unit; however, without a laboratory-based scientific status, it remains doubtful whether the ECDC will achieve the competence and authority needed for effective leadership in healthcare. The ESCMID, together with other national and international scientific societies, should put emphasis on the fact that infectious diseases have not received the necessary degree of attention from governments in the European region. The ESCMID should strengthen its role in harmonising and supporting the highest standards of training in the infection disciplines.","publish_time":"2005-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grundmann, H.; Goossens, H.","journal":"Clinical Microbiology and Infection","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X15300239; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X15300239","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control","ECDC"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["ECDC","specialist training","surveillance systems","postgraduate medical training","infection specialists","response systems","infectious disease specialists","Core training programmes","highest standards of training","diverse healthcare systems","laboratory arm of surveillance","role","need","ESCMID","public health specialists","success of surveillance hinges","Disease Prevention","infectious diseases","medical microbiologists","infection disciplines","European Centre","European region","scientific status","harmonised response","international scientific societies","microbiology laboratories","sufficient long-term resources","emphasis","governments","administrative constraints","contribution of general practitioners","authority","Control","order","agencies","levels","necessary degree of attention","dedicated coordination","emerging threats","effective leadership","work","competence","harmonising","impediment","continuing professional development schemes","small coordinating unit","hospitals","scenario-guided calamity models","primary care components","community","fact","timely manner","operational demands","ABSTRACT","funding"],"language":"en"},

The main causes of respiratory tract infections in children are viruses and the most common types are upper respiratory tract infections: common cold, pharyngitis, otitis media and sinusitis. Pneumonia is much more serious. As well as viruses, bacteria are often involved in respiratory tract infections. Three bacterial species are most commonly isolated: Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-encapsulated Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis. The most common bacterial cause of pharyngitis is Streptococcus pyogenes. Bacteria isolated from community-acquired infection usually are sensitive to the majority of suitable drugs, but during the past two decades, significant antibiotic resistance has emerged. Resistance to penicillins has spread among H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae. The mechanism of penicillin resistance in H. influenzae is mainly by production of \u03B2-lactamases TEM-1 and ROB-1, whereas in S. pneumoniae resistance is an effect of the changes in penicillin binding proteins. Among respiratory pathogens, resistance to tetracyclines, macrolides, trimethoprim\u2013sulphamethoxazole and fluoroquinolones has also appeared. Several mechanisms depending on changes in target, active efflux and modifying enzymes are involved.","publish_time":"2001-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mlynarczyk, G; Mlynarczyk, A; Jeljaszewicz, J","journal":"Int J Antimicrob Agents","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e20e6a3d99bde2aea75bc215333524538fe17ef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173210.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857901004551; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924857901004551","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus","Moraxella","S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Respiratory infections","pneumoniae resistance","upper respiratory tract infections","respiratory pathogens","main causes of respiratory tract infections","mechanism of penicillin resistance","Streptococcus pneumoniae","significant antibiotic resistance","common types","common bacterial cause of pharyngitis","changes","viruses","non-encapsulated Haemophilus influenzae","Streptococcus pyogenes","bacterial species","penicillin binding proteins","frequent reason","Moraxella","macrolides","tetracyclines","children","primary health care consultation","target","Branhamella","trimethoprim","otitis media","effect","lactamases TEM","majority of suitable drugs","sulphamethoxazole","active efflux","production of \u03B2","decades","enzymes","fluoroquinolones","community","sinusitis","catarrhalis","ROB","mechanisms","penicillins"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES To develop a highly sensitive metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) assay capable of evaluating the pulmonary microbiome and identifying diverse pathogens in the lungs of immunocompromised children. METHODS We collected 41 lower respiratory specimens from 34 immunocompromised children undergoing evaluation for pulmonary disease at 3 children\u2019s hospitals from 2014-2016. Samples underwent mechanical homogenization, paired RNA/DNA extraction, and metagenomic sequencing. Sequencing reads were aligned to the NCBI nucleotide reference database to determine taxonomic identities. Statistical outliers were determined based on abundance within each sample and relative to other samples in the cohort. MEASUREMENTS \u0026 MAIN RESULTS We identified a rich cross-domain pulmonary microbiome containing bacteria, fungi, RNA viruses, and DNA viruses in each patient. Potentially pathogenic bacteria were ubiquitous among samples but could be distinguished as possible causes of disease by parsing for outlier organisms. Samples with bacterial outliers had significantly depressed alpha-diversity (median 0.58, IQR 0.33-0.62 vs. median 0.94, IQR 0.93-0.95, p\u003C0.001). Potential pathogens were detected in half of samples previously negative by clinical diagnostics, demonstrating increased sensitivity for missed pulmonary pathogens (p\u003C0.001). CONCLUSIONS An optimized mNGS assay for pulmonary microbes demonstrates significant inoculation of the lower airways of immunocompromised children with diverse bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Potential pathogens can be identified based on absolute and relative abundance. Ongoing investigation is needed to determine the pathogenic significance of outlier microbes in the lungs of immunocompromised children with pulmonary disease.","publish_time":"2018-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zinter, MS; Dvorak, CC; Mayday, MY; Iwanaga, K; Ly, NP; McGarry, ME; Church, GD; Faricy, LE; Rowan, CM; Hume, JR; Steiner, ME; Crawford, ED; Langelier, C; Kalantar, K; Chow, ED; Miller, S; Shimano, K; Melton, A; Yanik, GA; Sapru, A; DeRisi, JL","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d481e1491e810a6c03e498fa5bb9040888ab713a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/331a7033bb8e6d4618e4e83b74aff1aec42764a6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/291864","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NCBI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pulmonary pathogens","pulmonary disease","pulmonary microbes","lungs of immunocompromised children","diverse pathogens","Potential pathogens","lower airways of immunocompromised children","half of samples","diverse bacteria","RNA viruses","DNA viruses","pathogenic bacteria","metagenomic sequencing","rich cross-domain pulmonary microbiome","fungi","generation sequencing","Sequencing reads","relative abundance","IQR","pathogenic significance of outlier microbes","optimized mNGS assay","possible causes of disease","paired RNA","assay capable","DNA extraction","clinical diagnostics","significant inoculation","improved diagnostics","sensitive metagenomic","significant morbidity","bacterial outliers","Statistical outliers","outlier organisms","lower respiratory specimens","increased sensitivity","evaluation","NCBI nucleotide reference database","mechanical homogenization","depressed alpha-diversity","detection","taxonomic identities","MAIN RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","RATIONALE","children\u2019s hospitals","METHODS","MEASUREMENTS","mortality","OBJECTIVES","patient","cohort","Ongoing investigation"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to quantify the effects of COVID-19 on the digestive system. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for studies published between Jan 1, 2020, and April 4, 2020. The websites of WHO, CDC, and major journals were also searched. We included studies that reported the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 and the prevalence of gastrointestinal findings in infected patients, and excluded preprints, duplicate publications, reviews, editorials, single case reports, studies pertaining to other coronavirus-related illnesses, and small case series (\u003C10 cases). Extracted data included author; date; study design; country; patient demographics; number of participants in severe and non-severe disease groups; prevalence of clinical gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and belching; and digestive system comorbidities including liver disease and gastrointestinal diseases. Raw data from studies were pooled to determine effect estimates. FINDINGS: We analysed findings from 35 studies, including 6686 patients with COVID-19, that met inclusion criteria. 29 studies (n=6064) reported gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with COVID-19 at diagnosis, and the pooled prevalence of digestive system comorbidities was 4% (95% CI 2\u20135; range 0\u201315; I(2)=74%). The pooled prevalence of digestive symptoms was 15% (10\u201321; range: 2\u201357; I(2)=96%) with nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea, and loss of appetite being the three most common symptoms. The pooled prevalence of abnormal liver functions (12 studies, n=1267) was 19% (9\u201332; range 1\u201353; I(2)=96%). Subgroup analysis showed patients with severe COVID-19 had higher rates of gastrointestinal symptoms (odds ratio [OR] 1\u00B760 [95% CI 1\u00B709\u20132\u00B736]; p=0\u00B70020; I(2)=44%) and liver injury (2\u00B720 [1\u00B760\u20133\u00B702]; p\u003C0\u00B700001; I(2)=36%) compared with those with non-severe disease. Patients in Hubei province, where the initial COVID-19 outbreak occurred, were more likely to present with abnormal liver functions (p\u003C0\u00B70001) compared with those outside of Hubei. Paediatric patients with COVID-19 had a similar prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms to those of adult patients. 10% (95% CI 4\u201319; range 3\u201323; I(2)=97%) of patients presented with gastrointestinal symptoms alone without respiratory features. Patients who presented with gastrointestinal system involvement had delayed diagnosis (standardised mean difference 2\u00B785 [95% CI 0\u00B722\u20135\u00B748]; p=0\u00B7030; I(2)=73%).

Through multiple regressions, the moderating role of coping flexibility was determined. Findings showed that coping flexibility had an additional value in predicting mood states beyond BAS sensitivity and psychosocial functioning level. Specifically, perceived controllability was considerably important for the BD group, whereas fit index was crucial in the controls. In addition, a moderation analysis showed that perceived controllability alleviated the effects of BD diagnosis, BAS sensitivity, and psychosocial functioning level on mood states. Theoretically, this study helps integrate the concept of coping flexibility into the BAS dysregulation theory as it applies to BD.

In this study, we selected and analyzed the genetic evolution of 15 PEDV representative strains that were identified in fecal samples of diarrheic piglets in 10 provinces and cities during 2011\u20132017. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that all the 15 PEDV isolates clustered into G2 genotype associated with the current circulating strains. Compared with the genome of the prototype strain CV777, these strains had 103\u2013120 amino acid mutations in their S proteins, most of which were in the N terminal domain of S1 (S1-NTD). We also found 37 common mutations in all these 15 strains, although these strains shared 96.9\u201399.7% nucleotide homology and 96.3\u201399.8% amino acid homology in the S protein compared with the other original pandemic strains. Computational analysis showed that these mutations may lead to remarkable changes in the conformational structure and asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation sites of S1-NTD, which may be associated with the altered pathogenicity of these variant PEDV strains. We evaluated the pathogenicity of the PEDV strain FJzz1 in piglets through oral and intramuscular infection routes. Compared with oral infection, intramuscular infection could also cause typical clinical signs but with a slightly delayed onset, confirming that the variant PEDV isolate FJzz1 was highly pathogenic to suckling piglets. In conclusion, we analyzed the genetic variation and pathogenicity of the emerging PEDV isolates of China, indicating that G2 variant PEDV strains as the main prevalent strains that may mutate continually. This study shows the necessity of monitoring the molecular epidemiology and the etiological characteristics of the epidemic PEDV isolates, which may help better control the PED outbreaks.","publish_time":"2019-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Pengfei; Wang, Kang; Hou, Yixuan; Li, Huichun; Li, Xianbin; Yu, Lingxue; Jiang, Yifeng; Gao, Fei; Tong, Wu; Yu, Hai; Yang, Zhibiao; Tong, Guangzhi; Zhou, Yanjun","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e1bd12ced42b19abc38e8da3b9dac5e2e5d9c1b1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106134.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S156713481830724X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30677534/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2019.01.022; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156713481830724X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["PEDV representative strains","G2 variant PEDV strains","epidemic PEDV isolates","PEDV strain FJzz1","emerging PEDV isolates of China","main prevalent strains","current circulating strains","original pandemic strains","oral infection","S1-NTD","amino acid mutations","outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea","intramuscular infection routes","PED outbreaks","amino acid homology","altered pathogenicity","common mutations","study","virulent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","N terminal domain of S1","G2 genotype","linked glycosylation sites of S1","fecal samples of diarrheic piglets","S proteins","genetic variation","genetic evolution","nucleotide homology","Computational analysis","phylogenetic analysis","prototype strain CV777","asparagine","etiological characteristics","severe economic impacts","conformational structure","variants","typical clinical signs","remarkable changes","better control","pork industry","molecular epidemiology","provinces","delayed onset","recent years","necessity","genome","cities","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to develop a real-time RT-PCR detection assay specific for SARS-CoV, taking into account its intrinsic polymorphic nature due to genetic drift and recombination and the possibility of continuous and multiple introductions of genetically non-identical strains into the human population, by using mismatch-tolerant molecular beacons designed to specifically detect the SARS-CoV S, E, M and N genes.

The overall influence of natural selection was more profound than that of mutation pressure, acting on a specific set of viral genes in the Asian-genotype ZIKV strains from the recent outbreak. An interplay between codon adaptation and deoptimization may have allowed the virus to adapt to multiple host and vectors and is reported for the first time in ZIKV genomes.

Here, we report the crystal structure of CpNanICD in complex with CHES at 1.24 \u00C5 resolution. Amphipathic CHES binds to the catalytic site of CpNanICD similar to the substrate (Neu5Ac) binding site. The 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid moiety and cyclohexyl groups of CHES interact with the cluster of three arginine residues and with the hydrophobic pocket of the CpNanICD catalytic site. In addition, a structural comparison with other bacterial and human neuraminidases suggests that CHES could serve as a scaffold for the development of new anti-neuraminidase agents targeting CpNanI.","publish_time":"2017-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Youngjin; Youn, Hyung-Seop; Lee, Jung-Gyu; An, Jun Yop; Park, Kyoung Ryoung; Kang, Jung Youn; Ryu, Young Bae; Jin, Mi Sun; Park, Ki Hun; Eom, Soo Hyun","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b5ff3bcbc732bd0dfad0a90fa838bfefe54f52a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092837.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X17305211; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.03.064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28315686/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X17305211","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHES"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-viral neuraminidase agents","neuraminidase activity","new anti-neuraminidase drugs","development of new anti-neuraminidase agents","CpNanICD catalytic site","Amphipathic CHES","catalytic site of CpNanICD similar","catalytic domain of Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase","cyclohexyl groups of CHES","crystal structure of CpNanICD","Neu5Ac","binding site","aminoethanesulfonic acid moiety","serendipitous complex crystal","hydrolysis of terminal N-acetylneuraminic acid","bacteremia","fatal infectious diseases","hydrophobic pocket","substrate","drug resistances","influenza","Tamiflu","need","oseltamivir","structural comparison","human neuraminidases","sepsis","host pathogenesis","arginine residues","cluster","glycoconjugates","scaffold","cyclohexylamino","Relenza","zanamivir","Emerging antibiotic","\u00C5 resolution","addition","cholera","buffer"],"language":"en"},

Previously, we reported that an endoribonuclease (EndoU) encoded by murine coronavirus plays a pivotal role in evasion of host innate immune defenses in macrophages. Here, we asked if the EndoU activity of porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV), which causes acute diarrhea in swine, plays a role in antagonizing the innate response in porcine epithelial cells and macrophages, the sites of viral replication. We constructed an infectious clone of PEDV-Colorado strain (icPEDV-wt) and an EndoU-mutant PEDV (icPEDV-EnUmt) by changing the codon for a catalytic histidine residue of EndoU to alanine (His226Ala). We found that both icPEDV-wt and icPEDV-EnUmt propagated efficiently in interferon (IFN)-deficient Vero cells. In contrast, the propagation of icPEDV-EnUmt was impaired in porcine epithelial cells (LLC-PK1), where we detected an early and robust transcriptional activation of type I and type III IFNs. Infection of piglets with the parental Colorado strain, icPEDV-wt, or icPEDV-EnUmt revealed that all viruses replicated in the gut and induced diarrhea; however, there was reduced viral shedding and mortality in the icPEDV-EnUmt-infected animals. These results demonstrate that EndoU activity is not required for PEDV replication in immortalized, IFN-deficient Vero cells, but is important for suppressing the IFN response in epithelial cells and macrophages, which facilitates replication, shedding, and pathogenesis in vivo. We conclude that PEDV EndoU activity is a key virulence factor that suppresses both type I and type III IFN responses. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) can emerge from an animal reservoir into a naive host species to cause pandemic respiratory or gastrointestinal diseases with significant mortality in humans or domestic animals. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an alphacoronavirus (alpha-CoV), infects gut epithelial cells and macrophages, inducing diarrhea and resulting in high mortality in piglets. How PEDV suppresses the innate immune response was unknown. We found that mutating a viral endoribonuclease, EndoU, results in a virus that activates both the type I interferon response and the type III interferon response in macrophages and epithelial cells. This activation of interferon resulted in limited viral replication in epithelial cell cultures and was associated with reduced virus shedding and mortality in piglets. This study reveals a role for EndoU activity as a virulence factor in PEDV infection and provides an approach for generating live-attenuated vaccine candidates for emerging coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2019-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deng, Xufang; van Geelen, Albert; Buckley, Alexandra C.; O\u2019Brien, Amornrat; Pillatzki, Angela; Lager, Kelly M.; Faaberg, Kay S.; Baker, Susan C.","journal":"Journal of Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b626729d78325a28a47be0f1b847ad6925d3473.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6450110.xml.json","url":"https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/93/8/e02000-18.full.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02000-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728254/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["III"],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["Colorado"],"keyphrases":["PEDV EndoU activity","icPEDV-EnUmt","PEDV replication","porcine epithelial cells","EndoU-mutant PEDV","icPEDV-wt","macrophages","gut epithelial cells","PEDV infection","interferon response","propagation of icPEDV","innate response","EndoU activity of porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus","viral shedding","IFN-deficient Vero cells","innate immune response","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","viral endoribonuclease","infectious clone of PEDV","limited viral replication","sites of viral replication","activation of interferon","induced diarrhea","acute diarrhea","catalytic histidine residue of EndoU","viral antagonists of innate immunity","epithelial cell cultures","significant mortality","robust transcriptional activation of type","IFN responses","high mortality","reduced virus","Infection of piglets","pivotal role","emerging viruses","emerging coronaviruses","results","pathogenesis","parental Colorado strain","key virulence factor","evasion of host","murine coronavirus","immune defenses","domestic animals","infected animals","IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses","naive host species","gastrointestinal diseases","humans","live-attenuated vaccine candidates","alanine","effective strategies","approach","animal reservoir","alpha-CoV","codon","alphacoronavirus","LLC-PK1","CoVs","His226Ala","swine","study","contrast","IFNs"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we investigated the antiviral activity and mechanism of AR-12 against ZIKV. We evaluated the in vitro anti-ZIKV activity of AR-12, using cell protection and virus yield reduction assays, in multiple clinically relevant cell lines, and the in vivo treatment effects of AR-12 in a lethal mouse model using type I interferon receptor-deficient A129 mice. AR-12 inhibited ZIKV strains belonging to both the African and Asian/American lineages in Huh-7 and/or neuronal cells. AR12\u0027s IC50 against ZIKV was consistently \u003C2 \u03BCM in these cells.

There are no specific treatments for chronic HPV infection, resulting in an urgent unmet need for a modality that is safe and effective for both immunocompromised and otherwise normal patients with recalcitrant disease. DNA vaccination is attractive because it avoids the risks of administration of live vectors to immunocompromised patients, and can induce potent HPV-specific cytotoxic T cell responses. We have developed a DNA vaccine (pNGVL4a-hCRTE6E7L2) encoding calreticulin (CRT) fused to E6, E7 and L2 proteins of HPV-16, the genotype associated with approximately 90% vaginal, vulvar, anal, penile and oropharyngeal HPV-associated cancers and the majority of cervical cancers. Administration of the DNA vaccine by intramuscular (IM) injection followed by electroporation induced significantly greater HPV-specific immune responses compared to IM injection alone or mixed with alum. Furthermore, pNGVL4a-hCRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccination via electroporation of mice carrying an intravaginal HPV-16 E6/E7-expressing syngeneic tumor demonstrated more potent therapeutic effects than IM vaccination alone. Of note, administration of the DNA vaccine by IM injection followed by electroporation elicited potent E6 and E7-specific CD8\u002B T cell responses and antitumor effects despite CD4\u002B T cell-depletion, although no antibody response was detected. While CD4\u002B T cell-depletion did reduce the E6 and E7-specific CD8\u002B T cell response, it remained sufficient to prevent subcutaneous tumor growth and to eliminate circulating tumor cells in a model of metastatic HPV-16\u002B cancer. Thus, the antibody response was CD4-dependent, whereas CD4\u002B T cell help enhanced the E6/E7-specific CD8\u002B T cell immunity, but was not required.

However, a previously undescribed reaction of these compounds with alcohols in the presence of a base, leads to 1-alkoxy-1H-benzo- (Bt-OR) and 7-azabenzotriazoles (At-OR). Although BOP undergoes reactions with alcohols to furnish 1-alkoxy-1H-benzotriazoles, Bt-OTs proved to be superior. Both, primary and secondary alcohols undergo reaction under generally mild reaction conditions. Correspondingly, 1-alkoxy-1H-7-azabenzotriazoles were synthesized from At-OTs. Mechanistically, there are three pathways by which these peptide-coupling agents can react with alcohols. From (31)P{(1)H}, [(18)O]-labeling, and other chemical experiments, phosphonium and tosylate derivatives of alcohols seem to be intermediates. These then react with BtO(\u2212) and AtO(\u2212) produced in situ. In order to demonstrate broader utility, this novel reaction has been used to prepare a series of acyclic nucleoside-like compounds. Because BtO(\u2212) is a nucleofuge, several Bt-OCH(2)Ar substrates have been evaluated in nucleophilic substitution reactions. Finally, the possible formation of Pd \u03C0\u2013allyl complexes by departure of BtO(\u2212) has been queried.

Results HMPV was detected in 108 of 1296 patients (8.3%) versus RSV in 23.1%, adenovirus in 3.4%, influenza A virus in 2.9%, and parainfluenza viruse in 2.9%. During the period of peak activity (November to May), HMPV was detected in 95 of 1017 patients (9.3%) and in 3 of 136 controls (2.2%) (P = .005). The patients with HMPV were older than those with RSV (P \u003C .001) with a more common history of acute otitis media requiring tympanocentesis (P = .032), wheezing (P = .001) and gastrointestinal symptoms (P \u003C .001) and a lower hospitalization rate (P = .005).

Among these, eight were infected with a second arbovirus: six with Zika virus (ZIKV), one with Dengue virus serotype 2, and one with Mayaro virus (MAYV). These dual infections were only detected following culture of the specimen, suggesting low viral loads of the co-infecting species. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that the ZIKV and MAYV strains differ from those detected later in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Moreover, CHIKV and ZIKV strains from co-infected patients clustered monophyletically in their respective phylogeny, and clock calibration traced back the common ancestor of each clade to an overlapping timeframe of introduction of these arboviruses onto the island.","publish_time":"2018-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"White, Sarah K.; Mavian, Carla; Elbadry, Maha A.; Beau De Rochars, Valery Madsen; Paisie, Taylor; Telisma, Taina; Salemi, Marco; Lednicky, John A.; Morris, J.

The prevalence of COVID-19 among older adults in independent/assisted living is not understood. Objectives To conduct surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 and describe symptoms of COVID-19 among residents and staff of an independent/assisted living community. Design, Setting, and Participants In March 2020, public health surveillance of staff and residents was conducted on site at an assisted and independent living residence for older adults in Seattle, Washington, after exposure to 2 residents who were hospitalized with COVID-19. Exposures Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a congregate setting implementing social isolation and infection prevention protocols. Main Outcomes and Measures SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs from residents and staff; a symptom questionnaire was completed assessing fever, cough, and other symptoms for the preceding 14 days. Residents were retested for SARS-CoV-2 7 days after initial screening. Results Testing was performed on 80 residents; 62 were women (77%), with mean age of 86 (range, 69-102) years. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 3 of 80 residents (3.8%); none felt ill, 1 male resident reported resolved cough and 1 loose stool during the preceding 14 days. Virus was also detected in 2 of 62 staff (3.2%); both were symptomatic. One week later, resident SARS-CoV-2 testing was repeated and 1 new infection detected (asymptomatic). All residents remained in isolation and were clinically stable 14 days after the second test. Conclusions and Relevance Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic residents highlights challenges in protecting older adults living in congregate settings. In this study, symptom screening failed to identify residents with infections and all 4 residents with SARS-CoV-2 remained asymptomatic after 14 days. Although 1 asymptomatic infection was found on retesting, a widespread facility outbreak was avoided. Compared with skilled nursing settings, in assisted/independent living communities, early surveillance to identify asymptomatic persons among residents and staff, in combination with adherence to recommended preventive strategies, may reduce viral spread.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roxby, Alison C; Greninger, Alexander L; Hatfield, Kelly M; Lynch, John B; Dellit, Timothy H; James, Allison; Taylor, Joanne; Page, Libby C; Kimball, Anne; Arons, Melissa; Munanga, Albert; Stone, Nimalie; Jernigan, John A; Reddy, Sujan C; Lewis, James; Cohen, Seth A; Jerome, Keith R; Duchin, Jeffrey S; Neme, Santiago","journal":"JAMA internal medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32437547/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.2233","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsxNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Relevance Detection"],"locations":["Washington"],"keyphrases":["resident SARS-CoV","Measures SARS-CoV","asymptomatic residents highlights challenges","days","asymptomatic infection","residents of skilled nursing facilities","Relevance Detection of SARS","independent living residence","independent living communities","older adults","asymptomatic persons","living community","symptoms of COVID","public health surveillance of staff","early surveillance","Exposures Surveillance","new infection","prevalence of COVID","Seattle","Washington","infection prevention protocols","congregate settings","skilled nursing settings","symptom screening","social isolation","resolved cough","male resident","epidemic spread of coronavirus disease","symptom questionnaire","viral spread","initial screening","Results Testing","Importance Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","real-time polymerase chain reaction","mortality","loose stool","nasopharyngeal swabs","preventive strategies","metropolitan area","morbidity","retesting","combination","site","Participants","adherence","fever","Main Outcomes","infections","range","widespread facility outbreak","Conclusions","week","mean age","Design","study","Objectives","years","women"],"language":"en"},

Guide RNA-CAS9 methods were used to develop an isogenic IFITM1/IFITM3 double null cervical cancer model in order to define dominant pathways triggered by presence or absence of IFITM1/3 signalling. A pulse SILAC methodology identified IRF1, HLA-B, and ISG15 as the most dominating IFN\u03B3 inducible proteins whose synthesis was attenuated in the IFITM1/IFITM3 double-null cells. Conversely, SWATH-IP mass spectrometry of ectopically expressed SBP-tagged IFITM1 identified ISG15 and HLA-B as dominant co-associated proteins. ISG15ylation was attenuated in IFN\u03B3 treated IFITM1/IFITM3 double-null cells. Proximity ligation assays indicated that HLA-B can interact with IFITM1/3 proteins in parental SiHa cells. Cell surface expression of HLA-B was attenuated in IFN\u03B3 treated IFITM1/IFITM3 double-null cells. SWATH-MS proteomic screens in cells treated with IFITM1-targeted siRNA cells resulted in the attenuation of an interferon regulated protein subpopulation including MHC Class I molecules as well as IFITM3, STAT1, B2M, and ISG15. These data have implications for the function of IFITM1/3 in mediating IFN\u03B3 stimulated protein synthesis including ISG15ylation and MHC Class I production in cancer cells. The data together suggest that pro-metastatic growth associated with IFITM1/3 negative cervical cancers relates to attenuated expression of MHC Class I molecules that would support tumor immune escape.","publish_time":"2019-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"G\u00F3mez-Herranz, Maria; Nekulova, Marta; Faktor, Jakub; Hernychova, Lenka; Kote, Sachin; Sinclair, Elizabeth H.; Nenutil, Rudolf; Vojtesek, Borivoj; Ball, Kathryn L.; Hupp, Ted R.","journal":"Cell Signal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/651c33d1074c4c805339a116eeaba4112dde7290.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111284.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cellsig.2019.03.024; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0898656819300750; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0898656819300750; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30951861/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsxNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["isogenic IFITM1","absence of IFITM1","function of IFITM1","transmembrane proteins IFITM1","IFITM1-targeted siRNA cells","cancer cells","IFITM3 double-null cells","HLA-B","IFITM3 double null cervical cancer model","attenuated expression of MHC Class","protein expression","parental SiHa cells","dominating IFN\u03B3 inducible proteins","subgroups of cervical cancer patients","Cell surface expression of HLA","dominant co-associated proteins","mediating IFN\u03B3 stimulated protein synthesis","molecules","protein subpopulation","human cancer progression","ISG15ylation","Interferon","data","negative cervical cancers","dominant pathways","RNA viral restriction","SWATH-MS proteomic screens","SWATH-IP mass spectrometry","Guide RNA-CAS9 methods","order","attenuation","IRF1","SBP","production","pulse SILAC methodology","pro-metastatic growth","role","presence","STAT1","immunohistochemical staining of FFPE tissue","Proximity ligation assays","tumor immune escape","implications","B2M","signalling","metastasis"],"language":"en"},

The peak bone mass (PBM) is a significant determinant of osteoporosis. To gain insights into the indicating effect of PBM to osteoporosis, this study focused on characterizing the PBM networks and identifying key genes. One biological data set with 12 monocyte low PBM samples and 11 high PBM samples was derived to construct protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs). Based on clique-merging, module-identification algorithm was used to identify modules from PPINs. The systematic calculation and comparison were performed to test whether the network entropy can discriminate the low PBM network from high PBM network. We constructed 32 destination networks with 66 modules divided from monocyte low and high PBM networks. Among them, network 11 was the only significantly differential one (P\u003C0.05) with 8 nodes and 28 edges.

In conclusion, based on the entropy in PBM PPINs, the differential network appears to be a novel therapeutic indicator for osteoporosis during the bone monocyte progression; these findings are helpful in disclosing the pathogenetic mechanisms of osteoporosis.","publish_time":"2018-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Lili; Du, Hongmei; Chen, Guangdong","journal":"Exp Ther Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0432d20b18db0900a9074dc773e27bd4b8ad1b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5995033.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3892/etm.2018.6169; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29896257/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsyMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PBM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PBM PPINs","low PBM network","high PBM networks","high PBM samples","monocyte low PBM samples","indicating effect of PBM","network entropy","differential network","destination networks","bone monocyte progression","pathogenetic mechanisms of osteoporosis","significant determinant of osteoporosis","protein-protein interaction networks","modules","peak bone mass","key genes","decrease","findings","biological data set","novel therapeutic indicator","module-identification algorithm","common skeletal disorder","test","study","calcium transport","clique-merging","comparison","blood monocytes","density","insights","systematic calculation","precursors of osteoclasts","nodes","edges","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

These included the previously identified N-terminal ORF 1a product, p28, as well as 290-, 240-, and 50-kDa polypeptides. P28 was always detected as a discrete band without larger precursors, suggesting rapid cleavage of p28 immediately after its synthesis. Once p28 was cleaved there was little degradation of the protein over a 2-hr period. The intracellular cleavage of p28 was not inhibited by the protease inhibitor leupeptin, in contrast to results obtained during in vitro translation of genome RNA (Denison and Perlman, 1986). These data suggest that different protease activities may be responsible for the cleavage of p28 in vitro and in vivo. The 290-kDa protein was an intermediate cleavage product derived from a precursor of greater than 400 kDa. The 290-kDa product was subsequently cleaved into secondary products of 50 and 240 kDa. The intracellular cleavage of the 290-kDa polypeptide was inhibited by leupeptin at concentrations which did not inhibit the early cleavage of p28 or the cleavage of the 290-kDa product from its larger polyprotein precursor. In the presence of zinc chloride, a product of \u003E320 kDa was detected, which appears to incorporate p28 at its amino terminus. This suggests that at least two protease activities may be necessary for processing of ORF1a proteins, one of which cleaves p28 and is sensitive to zinc chloride but resistant to leupeptin, and the other which cleaves the 290-kDa precursor and is sensitive to both inhibitors. Both the 290- and 240-kDa proteins should contain sequences predicted to encode two papain-like protease activities.","publish_time":"1992-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Denison, Mark R.; Zoltick, Philip W.; Hughes, Scott A.; Giangreco, Bernadette; Olson, Ann L.; Perlman, Stanley; Leibowitz, Julian L.; Weiss, Susan R.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28723c966abfe96dfb451c94701fb2addec5a68e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229290703R; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229290703R","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsyNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["kDa product","kDa precursor","intracellular cleavage of p28","kDa proteins","rapid cleavage of p28","early cleavage of p28","kDa polypeptides","intermediate cleavage product","protease inhibitor leupeptin","different protease activities","A59 ORF","larger polyprotein precursor","polypeptide products of MHV","precursor of greater","presence of zinc chloride","processing of ORF1a proteins","larger precursors","secondary products","MHV-A59 infected DBT cells","identified N-terminal ORF","antisera","results","contrast","translation of genome RNA","Denison","discrete band","Perlman","concentrations","papain","data","little degradation","sequences","fusionn roteins","hr period","inhibitors","amino terminus","synthesis"],"language":"en"},

Peptide immunotherapy focussing on the modulation of T cell responses by interfering with TCR-peptide-MHC complex formation requires the elucidation of the molecular basis of TCR-peptide-MHC interactions for an efficient design of modulatory peptides. In the Lewis rat most autoimmune-associated CD4\u002B T cell responses are MHC class II RT1.BL restricted. In this study, the characteristics of RT1.BL-peptide interactions were explored. A series of substitution analogs of two Lewis rat T cell epitopes was examined in a direct peptide-MHC binding assay on isolated RT1.BL molecules. Furthermore, other autoimmune-related as well as non-disease-related T cell epitopes were tested in the binding assay. This has led to the definition of an extended RT1.BL-peptide binding motif. The RT1.BL-peptide binding motif established in this study is the first described rat MHC-peptide binding motif based on direct MHC-peptide binding experiments. To predict good or intermediate RT1.BL binding peptides, T cell epitope search profiles were deduced from this motif. The motif and search profiles will greatly facilitate the prediction of modulatory peptides based on autoimmune-associated T cell epitopes and the identification of target structures in experimental autoimmune diseases in Lewis rats.","publish_time":"1997-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wauben, M H; van der Kraan, M; Grosfeld-Stulemeyer, M C; Joosten, I","journal":"Int Immunol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109845/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzI50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lewis"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["peptide-MHC interactions","TCR-peptide","peptide interactions","Peptide immunotherapy","described rat MHC-peptide binding motif","direct peptide-MHC binding assay","direct MHC-peptide binding experiments","binding peptides","Lewis rat T cell epitopes","autoimmune-associated T cell epitopes","study peptide-mediated immunotherapy","modulation of T cell responses","MHC class","T cell epitope search profiles","non-disease-related T cell epitopes","inbred rat","autoimmune-associated CD4","MHC complex formation","Lewis rats","well-characterized experimental autoimmune diseases","prediction of modulatory peptides","efficient design of modulatory peptides","good model","molecular basis of TCR","identification of target structures","elucidation","series of substitution analogs","molecules","characteristics of","definition"],"language":"en"},

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus are common causes of infantile lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI).

In infants, RSV LRTI is known to be more severe than influenza virus LRTI. Methods. We compared cytokines and chemokines in secretions of infants surviving various forms of respiratory illness caused by RSV or influenza viruses, to determine which mediators were associated with more-severe illness. We analyzed lung tissue from infants with fatal cases of RSV and influenza virus LRTI to determine the types of inflammatory cells present. Autopsy tissues were studied for the lymphotoxin granzyme and the apoptosis marker caspase 3. Results. Quantities of lymphocyte-derived cytokines were minimal in secretions from infants with RSV infection. Concentrations of most cytokines were greater in influenza virus, rather than RSV, infection. Lung tissues from infants with fatal RSV and influenza virus LRTI demonstrated an extensive presence of viral antigen and a near absence of CD8-positive lymphocytes and natural killer cells, with marked expression of markers of apoptosis.

Moreover, once thought as merely a systemic effector, RAS components exist within tissues. The highest tissue concentrations of ACE2 mRNA are located in the gut making it an important target for altering RAS function.

Text messaging could be utilized to perform longitudinal ILI surveillance in a community-based sample but has not been assessed. We recruited 161 households (789 people) in New York City for a study of mobile ARI/ILI surveillance, and selected reporters received text messages twice weekly inquiring whether anyone in the household was ill. Home visits were conducted to obtain nasal swabs from persons with ARI/ILI. Participants were primarily female, Latino, and publicly insured. During the 44-week period from December 2012 through September 2013, 11,282 text messages were sent. In responses to 8,250 (73.1%) messages, a household reported either that someone was ill or no one was ill; 88.9% of responses were received within 4 hours. Swabs were obtained for 361 of 363 reported ARI/ILI episodes. The median time from symptom onset to nasal swab was 2 days; 65.4% of samples were positive for a respiratory pathogen by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. In summary, text messaging promoted rapid ARI/ILI reporting and specimen collection and could represent a promising approach to timely, community-based surveillance.","publish_time":"2014-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stockwell, Melissa S.; Reed, Carrie; Vargas, Celibell Y.; Camargo, Stewin; Garretson, Aaron F.; Alba, Luis R.; LaRussa, Philip; Finelli, Lyn; Larson, Elaine L.; Saiman, Lisa","journal":"Am J Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9dcc6b9bf42a5a26209595c1a633a475fc1986fc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109952.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109952/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozkz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ILI reporting","longitudinal ILI surveillance","Community surveillance","ILI episodes","reported ARI","text messages","community-based surveillance","rapid ARI","Text messaging","study of mobile ARI","respiratory pathogen","timely collection of respiratory tract samples","nasal swabs","community-based sample","illness","responses","acute respiratory infection","specimen collection","selected reporters","reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","symptom onset","New York City","weekly inquiring","promising approach","influenza","median time","people","days","economic burden","cases","summary","delays","persons","female","Latino","Home visits","Participants","households","reports","week period","hours"],"language":"en"},

Less complete information exists about other viruses, although new data on respiratory syncytial virus are emerging. (2) Tools for the diagnosis of respiratory viral infections have been developed in conjunction with the use of solid-phase immunoassays. A role remains for tissue culture in surveillance and epidemiological studies. Detection of bacterial involvement in respiratory infections has been more difficult. (3) Treatment of infections due to respiratory viruses has advanced with the use of amantadine and aerosolized ribavirin. On the other hand, many viruses remain refractory to treatment.

The virus is notoriously fickle and may attack citizens in say two adjacent countries but not the third. More rarely a global pandemic virus emerges causing millions of deaths worldwide. The SARS outbreak has illuminated weaknesses in planning for sudden outbreaks of disease in a modern society and in particular how panic can grip and cause intense economic disruption. Many communities in the world are neither prepared for a global pandemic nor a very acute epidemic of influenza. The neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are a new class of antiviral drug targeting a viral influenza enzyme, the neuraminidase, which acts both to facilitate virus infection of cells by clearing a passage through otherwise protective respiratory fluids and also by helping release of the virus by cutting the chemical umbilical cord which links up the virus to the infected cell. Extensive laboratory studies of the two molecules zanamivir and oseltamivir have shown that they block all influenza A and B viruses yet tested and would, in theory, even inhibit the 1918 pandemic virus. Both drugs can be used prophylactically to prevent spread of infection in families and communities where 80\u201390% protection has been documented. The therapeutic effects are also strong in adults and children abbreviating infection, reducing quantities of excreted virus and reducing antibiotic prescriptions. The drugs have to be taken within 48 h of the onset of symptoms. Drug resistance is not a problem at present because although such mutants occur the mutants are compromised and are less virulent than their drug-sensitive parents and they spread less easily. The two drugs could be stockpiled to prepare for an influenza pandemic but, importantly, clinical and scientific experience need to be gained by using these inhibitors in the yearly conflagrations of epidemic influenza, which unchecked do great harm to our communities.","publish_time":"2004-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oxford, John; Balasingam, Shobana; Lambkin, Rob","journal":"J Antimicrob Chemother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d545924ffd7086c6a9b8867d76028a21203186a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110053.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110053/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzE1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza pandemic","global pandemic virus","virus infection of cells","quantities of excreted virus","acute epidemic of influenza","communities","drugs","viral influenza enzyme","yearly conflagrations of epidemic influenza","spread of infection","particular countries","B viruses","Drug resistance","neuraminidase inhibitors","mutants","world","drug-sensitive parents","social disruption","new class of antiviral drug","adjacent countries","intense economic disruption","serious medical problems","planning","modern society","sudden outbreaks of disease","weaknesses","panic","passage","adults","molecules zanamivir","causing millions of deaths","children","NAIs","Extensive laboratory studies","protective respiratory fluids","chemical umbilical cord","antibiotic prescriptions","great harm","therapeutic effects","SARS outbreak","citizens","release","families","onset of symptoms","scientific experience","oseltamivir","infected cell","protection","theory"],"language":"en"},

These glycoproteins are key to the infection process as they are mediators of the receptor binding and membrane fusion of the virion with the host cell. Therefore, they are attractive therapeutic targets for the development of novel antiviral therapies. Recently, carbohydrate-binding agents (CBA) were shown to possess antiviral activity towards coronaviruses. The current study further elucidates the inhibitory mode of action of CBA. METHODS: Different strains of two coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus and feline infectious peritonitis virus, were exposed to CBA: the plant lectins Galanthus nivalis agglutinin, Hippeastrum hybrid agglutinin and Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA) and the non-peptidic mannose-binding antibiotic pradimicin A. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that CBA target the two glycosylated envelope glycoproteins, the spike (S) and membrane (M) protein, of mouse hepatitis virus and feline infectious peritonitis virus. Furthermore, CBA did not inhibit virus\u2013cell attachment, but rather affected virus entry at a post-binding stage. The sensitivity of coronaviruses towards CBA was shown to be dependent on the processing of the N-linked carbohydrates. Inhibition of mannosidases in host cells rendered the progeny viruses more sensitive to the mannose-binding agents and even to the N-acetylglucosamine-binding UDA. In addition, inhibition of coronaviruses was shown to be dependent on the cell-type used to grow the virus stocks. All together, these results show that CBA exhibit promising capabilities to inhibit coronavirus infections.","publish_time":"2007-08-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"van der Meer, F. J. U. M.; de Haan, C. A.

The activity of this substance was evaluated in a coordinated study at five institutions. Experimental models in five species of animals were established using 11 viruses. Criteria for selection were: (l) representation of most major groups of viruses, (2) reproduction of natural routes of infection, and (3) simulation of potentially treatable viral infections of man. No therapeutic effect could be demonstrated in infections with encephalomyocarditis virus, type 2 Herpesvirus hominis, influenza, and rabies viruses in mice; vaccinia virus in rabbits; rhinotracheitis and panleukopenia viruses in cats; distemper virus in ferrets; and influenza and transmissible gastroenteritis viruses in swine. The only antiviral activity observed in this extensive series of experiments was suppression of fibroma virus lesions in rabbits given 600 mg/ kg per day of isoprinosine. Although antiviral activity is not precluded in other viral infections in animals or in man, these results clearly fail to substantiate the potential of isoprinosine as a potent, broad-spectrum antiviral substance.","publish_time":"1972-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Glasgow, L.

Several well described autoimmune disease models exist in the Lewis rat and thus this particular rat strain provides a good model system to study the effect of competitor peptldes. So far no information has been available on the peptide binding characteristics of the Lewis rat MHC class II RT1.B(I) molecule. We have now developed a biochemical binding assay which enables competition studies in which the relative MHC binding affinity of a set of non-labelled peptldes can be assessed while employing detection of blotlnylated marker peptides by chemllumlnescence. The assay is sensitive and specific. We have used this assay to determine the binding characteristics of several disease associated T cell determinants and their sequence analogues in the Lewis rat. Notably, most of the autoimmune disease associated peptide sequences tested were found to be intermediate to poor binders. Single amino acid substitutions at defined positions were sufficient to turn certain peptldes into good binders.

The lectin DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin) augments Ebola virus (EBOV) infection. However, it its unclear whether DC-SIGN promotes only EBOV attachment (attachment factor function, nonessential) or actively facilitates EBOV entry (receptor function, essential). Methods. We investigated whether DC-SIGN on B cell lines and dendritic cells acts as an EBOV attachment factor or receptor. Results. Engineered DC-SIGN expression rendered some B cell lines susceptible to EBOV glycoprotein (EBOV GP)-driven infection, whereas others remained refractory, suggesting that cellular factors other than DC-SIGN are also required for susceptibility to EBOV infection. Augmentation of entry was independent of efficient DCSIGN internalization and might not involve lectin-mediated endocytic uptake of virions. Therefore, DC-SIGN is unlikely to function as an EBOV receptor on B cell lines; instead, it might concentrate virions onto cells, thereby allowing entry into cell lines expressing low levels of endogenous receptor(s). Indeed, artificial concentration of virions onto cells mirrored DC-SIGN expression, confirming that optimization of viral attachment is sufficient for EBOV GP-driven entry into some B cell lines. Finally, EBOV infection of dendritic cells was only partially dependent on mannose-specific lectins, such as DC-SIGN, suggesting an important contribution of other factors. Conclusions. Our results indicate that DC-SIGN is not an EBOV receptor but, rather, is an attachmentpromoting factor that boosts entry into B cell lines susceptible to low levels of EBOV GP-mediated infection.","publish_time":"2007-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marzi, Andrea; M\u00F6ller, Peggy; Hanna, Sheri L.; Harrer, Thomas; Eisemann, Jutta; Steinkasserer, Alexander; Becker, Stephan; Baribaud, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc21330943dbede154960703825b2d12e800f6fc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110133.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110133/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzE5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBOV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EBOV entry","EBOV receptor","lectin DC-SIGN","EBOV glycoprotein","EBOV attachment factor","EBOV infection of dendritic cells","EBOV GP-driven entry","Engineered DC-SIGN expression","B cell lines susceptible","low levels of EBOV GP-mediated infection","receptor function","driven infection","attachment factor function","Augmentation of entry","dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule","low levels of endogenous receptor","optimization of viral attachment","attachmentpromoting factor","Results","artificial concentration of virions","endocytic uptake of virions","cellular factors","mannose-specific lectins","nonintegrin","nonessential","augments Ebola virus","independent of efficient DCSIGN internalization","important contribution","susceptibility","Background","Conclusions","Methods"],"language":"en"},

The calculated molecular weight of the purified enzyme was approximately 137,000\u00B15,000 from light scattering, 140,000 (main) and 137,000 (minor) from non-denatured PAGE and 153,000 from SDS-PAGE in the absence or presence of 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME). These findings suggest that the enzyme is monomeric in form in human seminal plasma. The enzyme hydrolyzed several amino acid 4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide (MCA) substrates. The order of K(cat;)/K(m) values of AAP at optimal pH (pH 7.5) was Ala- \u003ELys-Ala- \u2265 Met- \u003E Leu- \u003E Phe- \u003E Arg- \u2265 Arg-Arg- \u003E Lys- \u003E Gly-MCAs. AAP was potently inhibited by bestatin, leuhis-tin, actinonin, amastatin, and 1,10-phenanthroline. These findings suggest that AAP is an aminopeptidase. We determined that the amino acid sequence of the first 22 residues of the enzyme was Ser(1)-Thr-Thr-Pro-Ser(5)-Ala-Ser-Ala-Thr-Thr(10)-Asn-Pro-Ala-Ser-Ala(15)-Thr-Thr-Leu-Asp-Gln(20)-Ser-Lys-. This sequence was completely coincident with that downstream of the transmembrane site of human intestinal alanyl aminopeptidase N (CD13). We also isolated cDNA encoding AAP from human prostate cDNA library, sequenced its structure, and confirmed human seminal plasma AAP to be identical with alanyl aminopeptidase N. We postulated that native human seminal plasma alanyl aminopeptidase is released into the seminal plasma after the specific site is cleaved by elastase or an elastase-like enzyme.

Concerns included housing conditions, dietary regimens, management practices, and behavioral aspects imposed on special-fed calves. Four categories of parameters including environment and housing, nutrition, health and stress, and behavior provided a broad base of evaluating veal systems. Observations and samples were collected on 550 Holstein bull calves located in 10 commercial veal facilities. Each facility was visited to collect data during wk 0 (week of arrival of the calves), 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16. Nine facilities used individual stalls 48 to 55 cm in width with tethers attached to the front of the stalls. One facility housed 30 calves in group pens after obtaining calves at 8 wk of age. Ammonia, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide gas did not exceed the permissible limit for humans in any facility. All facilities exceeded the 2-foot-candle recommendation for lighting. The average daily gain of calves was .85 kg during wk 0 to 8 and 1.18 kg during wk 8 to 16. Dietary iron levels decreased from 209 ppm at wk 0 to 32 ppm at wk 16. At 16 wk, 25% of calves were marginally anemic and 10% clinically anemic. Overall mortality was 4.2%.

There is strong evidence to suggest that AMPs, in combination with cellular and physical factors, play an important role in preventing infection. Although AMPs act directly on microorganisms, there is increasing recognition that they also exert their protective effect via immunomodulatory mechanisms, especially in noninflammatory conditions. Further studies that manipulate physiologically relevant concentrations of AMPs are required to shed light on the role they play in reducing susceptibility to infection. Evidence shows that in various form prolonged and/or exhaustive exercise is a potent modulator of the immune system, which can either sharpen or blunt the immune response to pathogens. The intensity and duration of exercise can be readily controlled in experimental settings to manipulate the degree of physical stress. This would allow for an investigation into a potential dose\u2013response effect between exercise and AMPs.

Currently, the risk of blood-borne agent transmission of well-known viruses (HBV, HCV, HIV and HTLV) can be considered as under control in high-resource countries. However, other viruses unknown or unsuspected may be transmitted to recipients by blood-derived products. This is particularly relevant considering that a significant proportion of transfused patients are immunocompromised and more frequently subjected to fatal outcomes. Several measures to prevent transfusion transmission of unknown viruses have been implemented including the exclusion of at-risk donors, leukocyte reduction of donor blood, and physicochemical treatment of the different blood components. However, up to now there is no universal method for pathogen inactivation, which would be applicable for all types of blood components and, equally effective for all viral families. In addition, among available inactivation procedures of viral genomes, some of them are recognized to be less effective on non-enveloped viruses, and inadequate to inactivate higher viral titers in plasma pools or derivatives. Given this, there is the need to implement new methodologies for the discovery of unknown viruses that may affect blood transfusion. Viral metagenomics combined with High Throughput Sequencing appears as a promising approach for the identification and global surveillance of new and/or unexpected viruses that could impair blood transfusion safety.","publish_time":"2016-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sauvage, V.; Eloit, M.","journal":"Transfus Clin Biol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110881.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110881/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzMwNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["blood virome","human blood","risk of blood","blood transfusion safety","viruses unknown","different blood components","types of blood components","blood-derived products","transfusion transmission of unknown viruses","unexpected viruses","discovery of unknown viruses","leukocyte reduction of donor blood","viral community","Viral metagenomics","viral families","non-enveloped viruses","agent transmission of well-known viruses","higher viral titers","global surveillance of new","new methodologies","available inactivation procedures of viral genomes","new potential threats","epidemiological surveillance","pathogen inactivation","High Throughput Sequencing","high-resource countries","HBV","physicochemical treatment","promising approach","exclusion of at-risk donors","plasma pools","HCV","identification","significant proportion of transfused patients","derivatives","HIV","recipients","HTLV","control","universal method","addition","measures","need","characterization","fatal outcomes"],"language":"en"},

In the presence of periodic modulation of the transmission rate, the dynamics varies from periodic to chaotic. The route to chaos is typically through period doubling bifurcation. There are coexisting attractors for some sets of parameters. However in the presence of quasiperiodic modulation, tori are created in place of periodic orbits and chaos appears via finite torus doublings. Strange nonchaotic attractors (SNAs) are created at the boundary of chaotic and torus dynamics. Multistability is found to be reduced as a function of quasiperiodic modulation strength.

METHODS: Using emergency claims data, we identified significant deviations in emergency department use after Hurricane Sandy. Using time-series analysis, we analyzed the frequency of visits for specific conditions and comorbidities to identify medically vulnerable populations who developed acute postdisaster medical needs. RESULTS: We found statistically significant decreases in overall post-Sandy emergency department use in New York City but increased utilization in the most vulnerable evacuation zone. In addition to dialysis- and ventilator-dependent patients, we identified that patients who were elderly or homeless or who had diabetes, dementia, cardiac conditions, limitations in mobility, or drug dependence were more likely to visit emergency departments after Hurricane Sandy. Furthermore, patients were more likely to develop drug-resistant infections, require isolation, and present for hypothermia, environmental exposures, or administrative reasons. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified high-risk populations who developed acute medical and social needs in specific geographic areas after Hurricane Sandy. Our findings can inform coherent and targeted responses to disasters. Early identification of medically vulnerable populations can help to map \u201Chot spots\u201D requiring additional medical and social attention and prioritize resources for areas most impacted by disasters.

Accordingly, multiple strategies have been developed to improve outcomes, the majority of which are based on the Johns Hopkins platform from 2012.

First-generation fusion partners were compared for fusion efficiency and the number of antigen-specific antibody-producing clones generated.

The optimal time intervals between the final booster injection and fusion were found to be 4 days for splenocytes and 7 days for lymph node cells. Finally, the characterization of bovine monoclonal antibodies against bovine rotavirus and pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin and their neutralizing capacities in vitro are described.","publish_time":"2002-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Booman, P.; Tieman, M.; Van Zaane, D.; Bosma, A.A.; De Boer, G.F.","journal":"Vet Immunol Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119475/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzU3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Fusion of heteromyelomas","fusion efficiency","fusion efficiencies","second-generation fusion partners","First-generation fusion partners","lymph node cells","bovine rotavirus","ratio of bovine","lymphoid cells","higher number of specific antibody","clones","splenocytes","Bovine-murine heteromyeloma cell lines","presence of cell","second-generation heteromyelomas","first-generation heteromyelomas","bovine leukemia virus","mouse myeloma cells","characterization of bovine monoclonal antibodies","Selection of hybrid cell colonies","number of antigen","days","secreted antibodies","murine chromosomes","pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin","infected cow","BLV","final booster injection","surface immunoglobulins","optimal time intervals","neutralizing capacities","growth characteristics","generations"],"language":"en"},

One cytokine of interest is interleukin-1 (IL-1), an immunoregulatory polypeptide that is produced by macrophages and also by cells in the CNS. In this study, the effedt of IL-1\u03B2 on MHC expression in a human glioblastoma multiforme cell line, U-105 MG, has been examined. Treatment of U-105 MG with 10 U IL-1\u03B2/ml for a period of 5 days resulted in a decrease in constitutive cell surface HLA class II expression and limited the induction of class II by IFN-\u03B3. This effect was also observed on steady-state levels of class II RNA and could be neutralized with antibodies to IL-1\u03B2. All class II transcripts examined (HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP \u03B1 and \u03B2) were affected. Class I expression was only marginally changed by IL-1\u03B2 treatment. A minimal concentration of 1 U IL-1\u03B2/ml was required to reduce class II expression and a kinetics experiment indicated that U-105MG must be treated for at least 4 days with IL-1\u03B2 for a decrease in class II expression to be observed. This study suggests that IL-1 may play a role in limiting immunoreactivity in the CNS by limiting class II induction.","publish_time":"2002-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cowan, Elliot P.; Pierce, Michael L.; Dhib-Jalbut, Suhayl","journal":"J Neuroimmunol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119491/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzU3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["U IL","induction of class","\u03B2 treatment","MHC expression","effedt of IL","Treatment of U","CNS","constitutive cell surface HLA class","steady-state levels of class","IFN-\u03B3","decrease","interferon-\u03B3","days","study","HLA-DR","human glioblastoma multiforme cell line","DQ","major histocompatibility complex","RNA","inflammatory process","kinetics experiment","macrophages","Antigens","central nervous system","DP \u03B1","transcripts","immunoreactivity","role","minimal concentration","antibodies","immunoregulatory polypeptide","cytokines","cells","interleukin","period","effect"],"language":"en"},

The Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which has thousands of years\u2019 clinical application among China and other Asian countries, is the pioneer of the \u201CMulti-component\u2013multi-target\u201D and network pharmacology. Hundreds of different components in a TCM prescription can cure the diseases or relieve the patients by modulating the network of potential therapeutic targets. Although there is no doubt of the efficacy, it is difficult to elucidate convincing underlying mechanism of TCM due to its complex composition and unclear pharmacology. Without thorough investigation of its potential targets and side effects, TCM is not able to generate large-scale medicinal benefits, especially in the days when scientific reductionism and quantification are dominant. The use of ligand-protein networks has been gaining significant value in the history of drug discovery while its application in TCM is still in its early stage. This article firstly surveys TCM databases for virtual screening that have been greatly expanded in size and data diversity in recent years. On that basis, different screening methods and strategies for identifying active ingredients and targets of TCM are outlined based on the amount of network information available, both on sides of ligand bioactivity and the protein structures. Furthermore, applications of successful in silico target identification attempts are discussed in details along with experiments in exploring the ligand-protein networks of TCM. Finally, it will be concluded that the prospective application of ligand-protein networks can be used not only to predict protein targets of a small molecule, but also to explore the mode of action of TCM.","publish_time":"2014-06-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Mingzhu; Wei, Dongqing","journal":"Advance in Structural Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/47f0a4495058390c39376534a85826d1d9379b23.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120483.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120483/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzY2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TCM"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["targets of TCM","ligand-protein networks of TCM","TCM prescription","TCM databases","protein targets","multi-target","Multi-component","single target","convincing underlying mechanism of TCM","potential targets","protein structures","prospective application of ligand","single component","network of potential therapeutic targets","use of ligand","network pharmacology","sides of ligand bioactivity","silico target identification attempts","history of drug discovery","different screening methods","network information available","thousands of years\u2019 clinical application","virtual screening","unclear pharmacology","Hundreds of different components","strategies","China","active ingredients","significant value","days","Asian countries","applications of successful","complex composition","scientific reductionism","quantification","size","data diversity","recent years","large-scale medicinal benefits","details","basis","pioneer","effects","patients","Traditional Chinese Medicine","diseases","article","thorough investigation","concept","small molecule","experiments","end","promising way","field","efficacy","early stage","mode of action","doubt"],"language":"en"},

To analyse zoonoses long longitudinal studies are needed with a multidisciplinary approximation to obtain the following eco-epidemiological data: colony size, number of bats per species, population structure, behaviour of each species, degree of contact between bats, social structure, remaining time of bats in the colony, colony type, foraging area, turnover rate of individuals, shelter temperature, relationship with other colonies and co-infection processes. These data allows assessing the epidemiological risk and which preventive measures are necessary to take. The structure and functionality of ecosystems are changing worldwide at an unprecedented rate and can modify the interactions between humans and infected bats. There are more or less local factors that can affect the emergence and spread of diseases (environmental alterations, changes in land use, human population growth, changes in human socioeconomic behavior or social structure, people mobility increase, trade increase, forest fires, extreme weather events, wars, breakdown in public health infrastructure, etc.).

Its disease spectrum varies from mild edematous to severe disease with fatal complications. Pancreatic acinar cells are very susceptible to inflammation during an episode of AP attack. It is believed that some initiating factors can lead to the premature transformation of inactive pro-proteases into active proteases within the pancreas.

The One Health concept is not new, but under its umbrella, a new generation of veterinarians, physicians, ecologists, biologists, and social scientists is shaping the concept in novel ways. This has led to increased support for One Health initiatives to control disease by international agencies, national governments, and nongovernmental organizations as well as a growing emphasis on One Health concepts in training the veterinary workforce. Veterinary schools are reorganizing veterinary education to better teach students the precepts of One Health. This chapter explores the evolution and application of the One Health concept from the perspective of the veterinarian. The veterinary profession is positioned to be a strong advocate and leader of One Health. Veterinarians have a long history of involvement with One Health activities, and this involvement has adjusted and shifted with the changing needs of society.

In this chapter, we structurally review current evidence of inflammasome-related components in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic lung diseases, focusing on the \u201Cinflammasome-caspase-1-IL-1 beta/IL-18\u201D axis.","publish_time":"2018-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Fengying; Wen, Zongmei; Shi, Xueying; Fan, Jie","journal":"Inflammasomes: Clinical and Therapeutic Implications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18e5ca6859a1131329eb3b2c61b66955d97aed20.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123416.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123416/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozc0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chronic lung diseases","important role of IL","beta","important regulator of lung diseases","Inflammasomes","inflammasome-caspase","current evidence of inflammasome","pathogenesis of acute","related components","significant causes of illness","death","inflammatory response","active forms","precursors","world","chapter","cleavage","axis"],"language":"en"},

Transmission of human schistosomes, which involves multiple environmental stages, offers a model for applying our understanding of the environmental determinants of the viability, longevity, infectivity and mobility of these stages to controlling disease in diverse environments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: HRCT findings and clinical course were studied in 13 hospital-treated NE patients. Chest radiograph findings were studied in 12 of them. RESULTS: Twelve patients (92%) showed lung parenchymal abnormalities in HRCT, while only 8 had changes in their chest radiography. Atelectasis, pleural effusion, intralobular and interlobular septal thickening were the most common HRCT findings. Ground-glass opacification (GGO) was seen in 4 and hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy in 3 patients. Atelectasis and pleural effusion were also mostly seen in chest radiographs, other findings only in HRCT. CONCLUSION: Almost every NE patient showed lung parenchymal abnormalities in HRCT. The most common findings of lung involvement in NE can be defined as accumulation of pleural fluid and atelectasis and intralobular and interlobular septal thickening, most profusely in the lower parts of the lung. As a novel finding, lymphadenopathy was seen in a minority, probably related to capillary leakage and overall fluid overload. Pleural effusion is not the prominent feature in other viral pneumonias, whereas intralobular and interlobular septal thickening are characteristic of other viral pulmonary infections as well. Lung parenchymal findings in HRCT can thus be taken not to be disease-specific in NE and HRCT is useful only for scientific purposes.","publish_time":"2011-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paakkala, Antti; J\u00E4rvenp\u00E4\u00E4, Ritva; M\u00E4kel\u00E4, Satu; Huhtala, Heini; Mustonen, Jukka","journal":"Eur J Radiol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125555.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7125555/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozc5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRCT","NE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["common HRCT findings","Lung parenchymal findings","chest radiograph findings","common findings of lung involvement","lung parenchymal abnormalities","pleural effusion","interlobular septal thickening","Atelectasis","hospital-treated NE patients","chest radiographs","chest radiography","accumulation of pleural fluid","lung high-resolution computed tomography","viral pneumonias","mediastinal lymphadenopathy","overall fluid overload","viral pulmonary infections","Puumala hantavirus-induced nephropathia epidemica","capillary leakage","prominent feature","METHODS","clinical course","disease-specific","GGO","Ground-glass opacification","minority","scientific purposes","changes","MATERIALS","lower parts","novel finding","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Of these, the norovirus (NoV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) are currently recognised as the most important human foodborne pathogens with regard to the number of outbreaks and people affected in the Western world. NoV and HAV are highly infectious and may lead to widespread outbreaks. The clinical manifestation of NoV infection, however, is relatively mild. Asymptomatic infections are common and may contribute to the spread of the infection. Introduction of NoV in a community or population (a seeding event) may be followed by additional spread because of the highly infectious nature of NoV, resulting in a great number of secondary infections (50% of contacts). Hepatitis A is an increasing problem because of the decrease in immunity of populations in countries with high standards of hygiene. Molecular-based methods can detect viruses in shellfish but are not yet available for other foods. The applicability of the methods currently available for monitoring foods for viral contamination is unknown. No consistent correlation has been found between the presence of indicator microorganisms (i.e. bacteriophages, E. coli) and viruses. NoV and HAV are highly infectious and exhibit variable levels of resistance to heat and disinfection agents. However, they are both inactivated at 100 \u00B0C. No validated model virus or model system is available for studies of inactivation of NoV, although investigations could make use of structurally similar viruses (i.e. canine and feline caliciviruses). In the absence of a model virus or model system, food safety guidelines need to be based on studies that have been performed with the most resistant enteric RNA viruses (i.e. HAV, for which a model system does exist) and also with bacteriophages (for water). Most documented foodborne viral outbreaks can be traced to food that has been manually handled by an infected foodhandler, rather than to industrially processed foods. The viral contamination of food can occur anywhere in the process from farm to fork, but most foodborne viral infections can be traced back to infected persons who handle food that is not heated or otherwise treated afterwards. Therefore, emphasis should be on stringent personal hygiene during preparation. If viruses are present in food preprocessing, residual viral infectivity may be present after some industrial processes. Therefore, it is key that sufficient attention be given to good agriculture practice (GAP) and good manufacturing practice (GMP) to avoid introduction of viruses onto the raw material and into the food-manufacturing environment, and to HACCP to assure adequate management of (control over) viruses present during the manufacturing process. If viruses are present in foods after processing, they remain infectious in most circumstances and in most foods for several days or weeks, especially if kept cooled (at 4 \u00B0C). Therefore, emphasis should be on stringent personal hygiene during preparation. For the control of foodborne viral infections, it is necessary to: \u2022 Heighten awareness about the presence and spread of these viruses by foodhandlers; \u2022 Optimise and standardise methods for the detection of foodborne viruses; \u2022 Develop laboratory-based surveillance to detect large, common-source outbreaks at an early stage; and \u2022 Emphasise consideration of viruses in setting up food safety quality control and management systems (GHP, GMP, HACCP).","publish_time":"2004-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koopmans, Marion; Duizer, Erwin","journal":"Int J Food Microbiol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127053.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7127053/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozg2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["HAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["introduction of viruses","similar viruses","consideration of viruses","groups of viruses","detection of foodborne viruses","viral contamination of food","control of foodborne viral infections","model system","food preprocessing","documented foodborne viral outbreaks","HAV","resistant enteric RNA viruses","food-manufacturing environment","food safety guidelines","food safety quality control","validated model virus","number of outbreaks","monitoring foods","processed foods","residual viral infectivity","widespread outbreaks","infectious nature","Asymptomatic infections","manufacturing process","good manufacturing practice","common-source outbreaks","stringent personal hygiene","Molecular-based methods","GMP","important human foodborne pathogens","HACCP","great number of secondary infections","bacteriophages","emphasis","preparation","hepatitis","additional spread","infected persons","good agriculture practice","high standards of hygiene","laboratory-based surveillance","management systems","adequate management","studies of inactivation","infected foodhandler","presence of indicator microorganisms","countries","GHP","regard","GAP","immunity of populations","decrease","sufficient attention","early stage","variable levels of resistance","raw material","community","increasing problem","people","shellfish","seeding event","feline caliciviruses","investigations","weeks","ingestion","coli","absence","disinfection agents","Western world","industrial processes","clinical manifestation","awareness","contacts","days","applicability","farm","circumstances","foodhandlers","consistent correlation","stool","norovirus","water"],"language":"en"},

Both quantitative and qualitative techniques, whether signal or target amplification based systems, are currently used routinely in most if not all virology laboratories. Technological improvements, from automated sample isolation to real time amplification technology, have given the ability to develop and introduce systems for most viruses of clinical interest, and to obtain clinical relevant information needed for optimal antiviral treatment options. Both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) can currently be used together with real time detection to generate results in a short turn-around time and to determine whether variants relevant for antiviral resistance are present. These new technologies enable the introduction of an individual patient disease management concept. Within our clinical setting, we have introduced this e.g. for quantitative detection of Epstein\u2013Barr Virus (EBV) in T-dell depleted allogeneic stem cell transplant patients. This enabled us to develop models for pre-emptive anti B-cell immunotherapy for EBV reactivation, thereby effectively reducing not the incidence of EBV-lymphoproliferative disease but the virus related mortality. Furthermore, additional clinically relevant viruses can now easily be detected simultaneously. It also becomes more feasible to introduce molecular testing for those viruses that can easily be detected using classical virological methods, like culture techniques or antigen detection. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the clinical importance of the additional positive samples detected. It should however be made clear that a complete exchange of technologies is unlikely to occur, and that some complementary technologies should stay operational enabling the discovery of new viruses. The implementation of these molecular diagnostic technologies furthermore warrants the use and introduction of standardized materials as well as participation in international quality control programs. Finally, the use of an internal control throughout the whole procedure not only ensures the accuracy of the results generated, but also is necessary to enable precise quantification of these results and to determine detection thresholds more accurately. Since so many targets do have clinical implications, laboratories might prefer to use universal internal controls before the in-house developed assays should be introduced in clinical virology.","publish_time":"2002-12-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Niesters, Hubert G.M","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128152.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128152/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzkyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viruses of clinical","clinical virology","clinical importance","clinical implications","clinical setting","clinical relevant information","relevant viruses","real time detection","results","new technologies","complementary technologies","antigen detection","detection thresholds","virology laboratories","molecular diagnostic technologies","quantitative detection of Epstein","discovery of new viruses","real time amplification technology","target amplification","EBV reactivation","incidence of EBV","variants relevant","complete exchange of technologies","systems","ability","nucleic acid sequence-based amplification","lymphoproliferative disease","culture techniques","Barr Virus","qualitative techniques","antiviral resistance","nucleic acids","molecular testing","universal internal controls","virus related mortality","introduction of standardized materials","additional positive samples","optimal antiviral treatment options","international quality control programs","pre-emptive anti B-cell immunotherapy","allogeneic stem cell transplant patients","individual patient disease management concept","automated sample isolation","T-dell","participation","PCR","signal","in-house developed assays","classical virological methods","Technological improvements","polymerase chain reaction","models","NASBA","major impact","diagnostics","short turn","precise quantification","procedure","implementation","targets","accuracy","Prospective studies"],"language":"en"},

Immunological and non-immunological defences of the gastrointestinal are impaired in early life. Consequently the gut of the preterm infant is predisposed to bacterial overgrowth. A wide range of pathogenic bacteria and viruses have been isolated from infants with necrotizing enterocolitis or detected histologically. The presence of bacterial metabolites in the breath, intestinal bullae (hydrogen) and urine (D-lactate) during the course of the illness is further confirmatory evidence. The presence of bacteria or bacterial products (such as exo- and endotoxin) in the circulation will lead to ischaemia of the intestine and other organs either directly or via mediators such as cytokines or platelet activating factor. Future studies in necrotizing enterocolitis should be directed to understanding and modulating inflammatory mediators in necrotizing enterocolitis and preventing the disease with breast milk and nutritional supplements (glutamine, short chain fatty acids), chemoprophylaxis, and antibodies.","publish_time":"2006-12-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Candy, David C.A.; Devane, Se\u00E1n P.","journal":"Semin Neonatol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129339/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzExNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["necrotizing enterocolitis","bacterial products","presence of bacterial metabolites","illness","bacterial overgrowth","inflammatory mediators","non-immunological defences","wide range of pathogenic bacteria","glutamine","nutritional supplements","short chain fatty acids","breath","disease","intestinal bullae","breast milk","urine","hydrogen","chemoprophylaxis","viruses","course","preterm infant","D-lactate","ischaemia","early life","organs","cytokines","platelet","exo","outbreaks","Future studies","infants","confirmatory evidence","circulation","endotoxin","intestine","factor"],"language":"en"},

Fifty-one patients had proven/probable aspergillosis. We compared galactomannan (GM), PCR and mycologic analysis of pulmonary samples in both neutropenic and nonneutropenic patients. PCR performed in serum yielded 66.7% sensitivity, 98.7% specificity, 75.6% positive predictive value and 98.0% negative predictive value, while the GM index yielded 78.4% sensitivity, 87.5% specificity, 27% positive predictive value and 98.6% negative predictive value. The inclusion of PCR in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the Mycosis Study Group (MSG) mycologic criteria permitted the reclassification of nine other cases from possible to probable aspergillosis and increased the sensitivity to 71.7%. Combining the GM index with serum PCR increased the detection rate of invasive aspergillosis with 88.2% sensitivity. PCR was systematically negative in 16 patients with noninvasive forms of aspergillosis (namely aspergilloma and chronic aspergillosis). Remaining PCR positive after a period of 14 to 20 days of treatment was related to poor outcome at 30 and 90 days. Our results also indicate that, unlike the determination of the GM index, the initial fungus load as determined by PCR was highly predictive of 90-day mortality, with the rate of the latter being 15.8% for patients with \u003C150 copies/mL vs. 73.2% for patients at or above that cutoff (p \u003C0.0001). Therefore, PCR appears to be a powerful and interesting tool for the identification of patients with invasive aspergillosis who might benefit from more intense care.","publish_time":"2016-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Imbert, S.; Gauthier, L.; Joly, I.; Brossas, J.-Y.; Uzunov, M.; Touafek, F.; Brun, S.; Mazier, D.; Datry, A.; Gay, F.; Fekkar, A.","journal":"Clin Microbiol Infect","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129605.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129605/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzE1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GM","PCR","European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer","Mycosis Study Group"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["serum PCR","inclusion of PCR","probable aspergillosis","Remaining PCR positive","negative predictive value","positive predictive value","chronic aspergillosis","identification of patients","nonneutropenic patients","sensitivity","serum Aspergillus PCR assay","prognosis of invasive aspergillosis","GM index","detection rate of invasive aspergillosis","noninvasive forms of aspergillosis","serum samples","specificity","days of treatment","mycologic criteria","mycologic analysis of pulmonary samples","Treatment of Cancer","Mycosis Study Group","diagnosis","EORTC","MSG","Research","European Organization","reclassification","aspergilloma","initial fungus load","interesting tool","cases","usefulness","period","total","poor outcome","day mortality","cutoff","determination","galactomannan","intense care","copies","results"],"language":"en"},

Among surface expressed polypeptides is the 35-kDa antigen, previously designated Ag35. Both monoclonal (mAb) and monospecific affinity pure antibodies directed against Ag35 neutralized vaccinia infectiousness, indicating that this prominent surface antigen has a function during early virus-host cell interactions. The binding of several monoclonal antibodies to various regions of Ag35 was tested by reacting CNBr fragments, derived from the polypeptide, employing Western blotting. All mAbs tested reacted with the same region of Ag35. Estimation of the molecular weights (MW), based on migration of the CNBr peptides in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealed that those partial digestion products which contained a proline-rich 99 amino acid limit digest fragment were present at a position approximately 12.5 kDa larger than that predicted from the DNA sequence. By contrast, partial and limit digest products lacking the proline-rich fragment migrated to the MW position expected from the length of the DNA sequence. This observation demonstrates that departure from a predicted 22.3 kDa to an anomalous MW of Ag35 is conferred by the proline-rich peptide. The surface location of Ag35 was confirmed by immune electron microscopy. In a competition test the binding specificity of mAb and affinity-purified antibodies at the surface of virions could be demonstrated. Evidence for an association of Ag35 with the virus envelope at various stages during biogenesis of vaccinia was obtained by immune electron microscopy of whole mounts and thin sections. Presence of Ag35 as an early component of immature and mature virions, probably residing in the bilayer membrane structure was detected. A distinction can, therefore, be made between Ag35 and several other vaccinia envelope polypeptides which are synthesized as late functions and added during late stages of envelope assembly.","publish_time":"2004-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gordon, James; Mohandas, Anjani; Wilton, Sharon; Dales, Samuel","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130692/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzMzNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["surface location of Ag35","association of Ag35","Presence of Ag35","designated Ag35","region of Ag35","anomalous MW of Ag35","various regions of Ag35","surface of virions","Ag35 neutralized vaccinia infectiousness","vaccinia virus envelope","vaccinia envelope polypeptides","surface tag","surface expressed polypeptides","prominent surface antigen","proline-rich fragment","monoclonal antibodies","biogenesis of vaccinia","kDa antigen","MW position","proline-rich peptide","late stages of envelope assembly","limit digest products","various stages","kDa larger","immune electron microscopy","DNA sequence","monospecific affinity pure antibodies","partial digestion products","binding specificity of mAb","amino acid limit digest fragment","early virus-host cell interactions","CNBr peptides","late functions","CNBr fragments","mature virions","early component of immature","sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis","hydroxysuccinimidobiotin","migration","mounts","contrast","length","sulfo-N","Estimation","molecular weights","competition","departure","bilayer membrane structure","Western blotting","observation","sections","Evidence","mAbs","distinction"],"language":"en"},

With this goal mostly achieved, discussion of etiological factors should be reintroduced into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V). A research agenda for the DSM-V advocated the \u201Cdevelopment of a pathophysiologically based classification system\u201D. The author critically reviews the neuroevolutionary literature on stress-induced and fear circuitry disorders and related amygdala-driven, species-atypical fear behaviors of clinical severity in adult humans. Over 30 empirically testable/falsifiable predictions are presented. It is noted that in DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10, the classification of stress and fear circuitry disorders is neither mode-of-acquisition-based nor brain-evolution-based. For example, snake phobia (innate) and dog phobia (overconsolidational) are clustered together. Similarly, research on blood-injection-injury-type-specific phobia clusters two fears different in their innateness: 1) an arguably ontogenetic memory-trace-overconsolidation-based fear (hospital phobia) and 2) a hardwired (innate) fear of the sight of one\u0027s blood or a sharp object penetrating one\u0027s skin. Genetic architecture-charting of fear-circuitry-related traits has been challenging. Various, non-phenotype-based architectures can serve as targets for research. In this article, the author will propose one such alternative genetic architecture. This article was inspired by the following: A) Nesse\u0027s \u201CSmoke-Detector Principle\u201D, B) the increasing suspicion that the \u201Csmooth\u201D rather than \u201Clumpy\u201D distribution of complex psychiatric phenotypes (including fear-circuitry disorders) may in some cases be accounted for by oligogenic (and not necessarily polygenic) transmission, and C) insights from the initial sequence of the chimpanzee genome and comparison with the human genome by the Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium published in late 2005. Neuroevolutionary insights relevant to fear circuitry symptoms that primarily emerge overconsolidationally (especially Combat related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder) are presented. Also introduced is a human-evolution-based principle for clustering innate fear traits. The \u201CNeuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle\u201D of innate fears proposed in this article may be useful in the development of a neuroevolution-based taxonomic re-clustering of stress-triggered and fear-circuitry disorders in DSM-V. Four broad clusters of evolved fear circuits are proposed based on their time-depths: 1) Mesozoic (mammalian-wide) circuits hardwired by wild-type alleles driven to fixation by Mesozoic selective sweeps; 2) Cenozoic (simian-wide) circuits relevant to many specific phobias; 3) mid Paleolithic and upper Paleolithic (Homo sapiens-specific) circuits (arguably resulting mostly from mate-choice-driven stabilizing selection); 4) Neolithic circuits (arguably mostly related to stabilizing selection driven by gene\u2013culture co-evolution). More importantly, the author presents evolutionary perspectives on warzone-related PTSD, Combat-Stress Reaction, Combat-related Stress, Operational-Stress, and other deployment-stress-induced symptoms. The Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle presented in this article may help explain the dissimilar stress-resilience levels following different types of acute threat to survival of oneself or one\u0027s progency (aka DSM-III and DSM-V PTSD Criterion-A events). PTSD rates following exposure to lethal inter-group violence (combat, warzone exposure or intentionally caused disasters such as terrorism) are usually 5\u201310 times higher than rates following large-scale natural disasters such as forest fires, floods, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes. The author predicts that both intentionally-caused large-scale bioevent-disasters, as well as natural bioevents such as SARS and avian flu pandemics will be an exception and are likely to be followed by PTSD rates approaching those that follow warzone exposure. During bioevents, Amygdala-driven and locus-coeruleus-driven epidemic pseudosomatic symptoms may be an order of magnitude more common than infection-caused cytokine-driven symptoms. Implications for the red cross and FEMA are discussed. It is also argued that hospital phobia as well as dog phobia, bird phobia and bat phobia require re-taxonomization in DSM-V in a new \u201Coverconsolidational disorders\u201D category anchored around PTSD. The overconsolidational spectrum category may be conceptualized as straddling the fear circuitry spectrum disorders and the affective spectrum disorders categories, and may be a category for which Pitman\u0027s secondary prevention propranolol regimen may be specifically indicated as a \u201Cmorning after pill\u201D intervention. Predictions are presented regarding obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (e.g., female-pattern hoarding vs. male-pattern hoarding) and \u201Cculture-bound\u201D acute anxiety symptoms (taijin-kyofusho, koro, shuk yang, shook yong, suo yang, rok-joo, jinjinia-bemar, karoshi, gwarosa, Voodoo death). Also discussed are insights relevant to pseudoneurological symptoms and to the forthcoming Dissociative-Conversive disorders category in DSM-V, including what the author terms fright-triggered acute pseudo-localized symptoms (i.e., pseudoparalysis, pseudocerebellar imbalance, psychogenic blindness, pseudoseizures, and epidemic sociogenic illness). Speculations based on studies of the human abnormal-spindle-like, microcephaly-associated (ASPM) gene, the microcephaly primary autosomal recessive (MCPH) gene, and the forkhead box p2 (FOXP2) gene are made and incorporated into what is termed \u201CThe pre-FOXP2 Hypothesis of Blood-Injection-Injury Phobia.\u201D Finally, the author argues for a non-reductionistic fusion of \u201Cdistal (evolutionary) neurobiology\u201D with clinical \u201Cproximal neurobiology,\u201D utilizing neurological heuristics. It is noted that the value of re-clustering fear traits based on behavioral ethology, human-phylogenomics-derived endophenotypes and on ontogenomics (gene\u2013environment interactions) can be confirmed or disconfirmed using epidemiological or twin studies and psychiatric genomics.","publish_time":"2006-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bracha, H.

Control calves (n = 5 per group) received either pooled colostrum from unvaccinated (BRV field exposure seropositive) control cows, or no colostrum. IgG1 antibody titers to IND BRV for the pooled colostrum were: 1048576 (VLP); 1048576 (CLP); 262144 (SA11); and 16384 (control colostrum). Elevated titers of BRV neutralizing (VN) antibodies were present in VLP colostrum (98 000), and SA11 colostrum (25 000), but not in CLP colostrum (1400), compared to colostrum from nonvaccinates (2081). Calves were orally inoculated with virulent IND BRV at 2 days of age and challenged at post-inoculation day (PID) 21. Calves were monitored daily for diarrhea and faecal BRV shedding through PID 10 and post-challenge day (PCD) 10. After colostrum feeding, the IgG1 antibody titers were highest in serum and faeces of calves fed VLP and CLP colostrum, but VN and IgA antibodies were highest in calves fed VLP colostrum. After BRV inoculation, calves fed colostrum from vaccinated cows had significantly fewer days of BRV-associated diarrhea and BRV shedding than control calves. All calves fed VLP colostrum were protected from diarrhea after BRV inoculation; two calves shed BRV. In the CLP colostrum group, one calf developed BRV-associated diarrhea and all calves shed virus. In the SA11 colostrum group, three calves developed BRV-associated diarrhea and four calves shed virus. BRV-associated diarrhea and shedding occurred in 9 of 10 control calves. Active IgM antibody responses occurred in faeces and/or serum of most calves after BRV inoculation. However, the highest active antibody responses (IgM and IgG1 in serum, and IgM, IgG1 or IgA in faeces) after BRV inoculation were in calves fed control or no colostrum, in association with clinical diarrhea in most of these calves. After challenge at PID 21, BRV-associated diarrhea and shedding were of short duration or absent, in all groups. These results demonstrate the efficacy of colostrum from VLP vaccinated cows to provide heterologous, passive protection against BRV diarrhea and shedding in calves. In comparison, calves fed CLP or SA11 colostrum were only partially protected against BRV diarrhea or shedding.","publish_time":"1998-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fernandez, F.M.; Conner, M.E.; Hodgins, D.C.; Parwani, A.V.; Nielsen, P.R.; Crawford, S.E.; Estes, M.K.; Saif, L.J.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131086/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzM5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BRV","CLP","IND BRV","VLP","PID","VN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BRV diarrhea","BRV inoculation","VLP colostrum","control colostrum","Control calves","BRV-associated diarrhea","faeces of calves","faecal BRV","groups of calves","SA11 colostrum group","efficacy of colostrum","CLP colostrum group","BRV seropositive cows","fewer days of BRV","virulent IND BRV","pooled colostrum supplements","Elevated titers of BRV neutralizing","BRV field exposure seropositive","shedding","clinical diarrhea","control cows","VLP vaccinated cows","inactivated SA11 rotavirus","recombinant SA11 rotavirus core","IgG1 antibody titers","serum","PID","post-inoculation day","highest active antibody responses","Active IgM antibody responses","days of age","bovine rotavirus","VN","particles","IgA antibodies","post-challenge day","passive protection","Heterotypic passive immunity","CLPs","VLPs","calf","short duration","birth","G6","G3","association","PCD","comparison","results","nonvaccinates"],"language":"en"},

There are few virus glycoproteins that provide prototypes for illustrating important relationships between the functions and glycoprotein structure. The discussion presented in the chapter concentrates on those viral glycoproteins that (1) span the lipid bilayer once, (2) are oriented such that the carboxy terminus comprises the cytoplasmic domain, and (3) contain asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. There are also viral glycoproteins with extensive O-linked glycosylation, some of which are also presented in the discussion. The chapter also focuses on the studies involving directed mutagenesis and construction of chimeric proteins. The effects of altering specific amino acid sequences, of swapping domains, and of adding a new domain to a protein serve to define the functions of a domain and to show that a domain can be independently associated with a specific function. The experiments described have been carried out by inserting the genes of particular viral glycoproteins\u2014such as cDNAs\u2014into expression vectors and transcribing the cDNAs from the promoter provided by the expression vector. This approach established that localization and functions such as the fusogenic activity are properties of the viral glycoprotein per se and do not require other viral-coded components.","publish_time":"2008-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schlesinger, Milton J.; Schlesinger, Sondra","journal":"Adv Virus Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131334/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzQzOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genes of particular viral glycoproteins","functions","function of virus glycoproteins","cytoplasmic domain","new domain","viral-coded components","glycoprotein structure","cDNAs","specific function","discussion","chapter reviews current information","expression vectors","asparagine-linked oligosaccharides","specific amino acid sequences","extensive O-linked glycosylation","directed mutagenesis","swapping domains","properties","important relationships","fusogenic activity","construction of chimeric proteins","effects","studies","prototypes","localization","carboxy terminus","promoter","approach","lipid bilayer","experiments"],"language":"en"},

In fact, health policy-makers could manage the problem of the regional spread of an epidemic, by organizing many vaccination campaigns, or by suggesting other defensive strategies such as blocking movement of people coming from borders of regions at high-risk of infection and entering very controlled regions or with insignificant infection rate. Further, we introduce in the discrete SIR systems, two control variables which represent the effectiveness rates of vaccination and travel-blocking operation. We focus in our study to control the outbreaks of an epidemic that affects a hypothetical population belonging to a specific region. Firstly, we analyze the epidemic model when the control strategy is based on the vaccination control only, and secondly, when the travel-blocking control is added. The multi-points boundary value problems, associated to the optimal control problems studied here, are obtained based on a discrete version of Pontryagin\u2019s maximum principle, and resolved numerically using a progressive-regressive discrete scheme that converges following an appropriate test related to the Forward-Backward Sweep Method on optimal control.","publish_time":"2016-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zakary, Omar; Rachik, Mostafa; Elmouki, Ilias","journal":"Int J Dyn Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db33b48ca4ee731bc64e1636585ea89ab1deb8ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7133609.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133609/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzYyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccination control","control variables","control strategy","optimal control problems","travel","epidemic model","discrete SIR systems","discrete time SIR model","controlled regions","borders of regions","movement of people","vaccination campaigns","progressive-regressive discrete scheme","various geographical regions","effectiveness rates of vaccination","discrete version of Pontryagin\u2019s maximum principle","regional spread","high-risk of infection","specific region","spread of infectious diseases","insignificant infection rate","kind of anthropological movement","multi-points boundary value problems","Forward-Backward Sweep Method","appropriate test","hypothetical population","health policy-makers","fact","defensive strategies","outbreaks","paper","operation","study"],"language":"en"},

However, because of resource constraints few ocmprehensive aetiological studies have conducted in sub-Saharan Africa which have included a broad range of microbiological investigations. We undertook a prospective cross-sectional study of adult patients admitted to a government hospital in Nairobi, Kenya, to determine possible bacterial, mycobacterial, parasitic and viral causes of diarrhoca; to consider which may be treatable; and to relate microbiological findings to clinical outcome. METHODS: Stool specimens from 75 consecutive HIV-seropositive patients with chronic diarrhoca admitted to a Nairobi hospital were subjected to microbiological investigation and results were compared with clinical findings and outcome. Stool samples were cultured for bacteria and mycobacteria and underwent light and electron microscopy; lawns of Escherichica coli were probed for pathogenic types and aliquots were tested for the presence of Clostridium difficile cytotoxin. Blood cultures for mycobacteria and other bacterial pathogens were performed as clinically indicated. RESULTS: Thirty-nine (52%) patients yielded putative pathogens, the most common being Cryptosporidium sp. (17%), Salmonella typhimurium (13%), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (13%). Of 41 patients investigated for pathogenic Escherichia coli, enteroaggregative E. coli and diffusely adherent E. coli were each found in four patients. Thirty-one (41%) patients died. Detection of cryptosporidium cysts was the single most significant predictor of death (X(2) = 5.2, P\u003C0.05). Many patients did not improve (21; 285) or self-discharged whilst still sick (5; 7%) but five (7%) were diagnosed ante mortem with tuberculosis and treated and a further 13 (17%) showed improvement by time of discharge. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected patients with chronic diarrhoea in Nairobi have a poor outcome overall, and even with extensive investigation a putative pathogen was identified in only just over half the patients. The most important step is to exclude tuberculosis: and the most useful investigation appears to be Ziehl-Neelsen staining. Other potentially treatable Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, S. typhimurium, Shigella sp. and adherent E. coli were, however, common but require culture facilities which are not widely accessible for definitive identification. Further studies focussing on simple ways to identify sub-groups of patients with treatable infections are warranted.","publish_time":"2004-10-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mwachari, C.; Batchelor, B.I.F.; Paul, J.; Waiyaki, P.G.; Gilks, C.F.","journal":"J Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86f673fe6c84866da3fbafd60862ee1f1fb87a66.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133614/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzYzMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Salmonella","E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa","sub-Saharan Africa","Nairobi","Kenya"],"keyphrases":["HIV-infected patients","sub-groups of patients","consecutive HIV-seropositive patients","prospective cross-sectional study of adult patients","pathogenic Escherichia coli","Chronic diarrhoea","chronic diarrhoca","Nairobi hospital","treatable Gram-negative bacterial pathogens","putative pathogens","microbiological findings","clinical outcome","lawns of Escherichica coli","mycobacteria","extensive investigation","useful investigation","treatable infections","clinical findings","poor outcome","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","results","government hospital","sub-Saharan Africa","pathogenic types","broad range of microbiological investigations","Stool specimens","Stool samples","Salmonella typhimurium","ocmprehensive aetiological studies","viral causes of diarrhoca","Detection of cryptosporidium cysts","electron microscopy","significant predictor of death","light","Kenya","enteroaggregative","Shigella","simple ways","resource constraints","recognized features of AIDS","Blood cultures","presence of Clostridium difficile cytotoxin","culture facilities","Ziehl-Neelsen staining","aliquots","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","improvement","time of discharge","definitive identification","ante mortem","important step","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

Here we have studied the intracellular transport and targeting to the GC of G1 and G2 of Uukuniemi virus, a member of the Phlebovirus genus, and report on their expression from cloned cDNAs either together or separately by using a T7 RNA polymerase-driven vaccinia virus expression system. When G1 and G2 were expressed together from a full-length cDNA as the p110 precursor, both proteins were localized to the Golgi complex, as evidenced by colocalization with the Golgi marker enzyme mannosidase II. Immunofluorescent staining indicated that G1 expressed alone also localized to the GC. However, pulse-chase experiments showed that G1 remained endoglycosidase H sensitive. G2 expressed alone remained associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). G2 could be rescued from the ER and transported to the GC by coexpression with G1 from separate mRNAs. Coexpression also increased the efficiency of G1 transport to the GC. With none of the constructs could the glycoproteins be observed on the cell surface. These results show that efficient export of G1 and G2 from the ER requires coexpression of both proteins, in conformity with our previous results showing that G1 and G2 from heterodimeric complexes in the ER. Since G1 expressed alone is retained in the GC, we conclude that G1 contains a retention signal for localization to the GC.

Conventionally reared calves were fully susceptible to the experimental infection induced by three rotaviruses originating from heterologous hosts, i.e. monkeys, pigs and rabbits, respectively. When rotavirus strains of bovine, simian, porcine and rabbit origin were compared by cross neutralization tests, it was found the simian and porcine strains were indistinguishable and both appeared to relate antigenically to the bovine strain. On the other hand, a reciprocal antigenic correlation was found between bovine and rabbit isolates. Finally, it was proven that feeding newborn calves with colostrum of their dams, previously vaccinated with an inactivated rotavirus vaccine, could prevent the neonatal diarrhea from occurring.","publish_time":"2002-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Castrucci, G; Frigeri, F; Ferrari, M; Cilli, V; Gualandi, G.L; Aldrovandi, V","journal":"Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133910/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzY4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bovine rotaviruses","rotavirus strains of bovine","neonatal diarrhea","bovine strain","rotavirus infection","simian","porcine strains","newborn calves","reared calves","results","rabbits","inactivated rotavirus vaccine","rabbit origin","evidence of differences","rabbit isolates","experimental infection","Italy","comprehensive study","etiologic role","reciprocal antigenic correlation","cross neutralization tests","dams","virulence","hand","pigs","heterologous hosts","colostrum","presentation"],"language":"en"},

This chapter examines the polio virus in regard to its virology, disease, and prevention by vaccines and chemoprophylaxis. Polio has been well controlled in most developed countries using live or inactivated vaccines. Research work has intensified using genetic engineering techniques to produce live attenuated viruses with defined and stable mutations so as to prevent reversion to virulence, and also to produce immunogenic oligopeptides or proteins for a new generation of inactivated polio vaccines. Chemotherapy is therefore not required for polio infections. In contrast, neither vaccines have been developed against rhinovirus infections, nor are the vaccines thought to have a use, unless broadly reacting antigenic determinants can be located. Several interesting but only weakly effective antiviral compounds have been selected against rhinoviruses and this is a major research area at present. Studies continue also with interferon, but because of toxicity problems these look less interesting at present. Sequence and biochemical data is now available for several additional enterovirus strains and this could open new possibilities both with antivirals or vaccines (for example synthetic peptides) in the near future.","publish_time":"2008-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Perspect Med Virol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134062/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzcxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inactivated vaccines","polio virus","polio infections","new generation of inactivated polio vaccines","present","new possibilities","Research work","developed countries","rhinovirus infections","live attenuated viruses","major research area","characteristic paralytic disease","genetic engineering techniques","stable mutations","example synthetic peptides","proteins","Picornaviruses group","antivirals","regard","virology","weakly effective antiviral compounds","additional enterovirus strains","rhinoviruses","immunogenic oligopeptides","prevention","biochemical data","near future","oldest member","toxicity problems","interferon","Sequence","reversion","clinicians","chapter","antigenic determinants","virulence","chemoprophylaxis","Studies","Chemotherapy","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Doses of BFA which neither inhibit the metabolism of the cell nor the infectivity of EMCV, decreased the IFN-induced antiviral activity against EMCV as demonstrated by virus titer from supernatants. Since 2\u20135A synthetase and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR) have been suggested to be involved in the antiviral action of IFN against EMCV, their activities were investigated in L(B) cells after BFA treatment.

METHODS: Sixty male Kunming mice received the following treatments by gavage: normal saline solution (control); arsenic trioxide (ATO; 4 mg/kg); GSPE (400 mg/kg); ATO\u002BGSPE (100 mg/kg); ATO\u002BGSPE (200 mg/kg) and ATO\u002BGSPE (400 mg/kg). Thereafter, the mice were sacrificed and weighed, and the testis was examined for pathological changes. Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase 1 (HO1), glutathione S-transferase (GST), NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, and quinone 1 (NQO1) expression in the testis was detected by real-time PCR. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), total antioxidative capability (T-AOC), malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and reproductive indexes were analyzed. RESULTS: ATO-treated mice showed a significantly decreased sperm count and testis somatic index and activity levels of SOD, GSH, and T-AOC than control group. Compared to the ATO-treated group, ATO \u002BGSPE group showed recovery of the measured parameters. Mice treated with ATO\u002Bhigh-dose GSPE showed the highest level of mRNA expression of Nrf2, HO, NQO1, and GST. CONCLUSIONS: GSPE alleviates oxidative stress damage in mouse testis by activating Nrf2 signaling, thus counteracting arsenic-induced reproductive toxicity.","publish_time":"2015-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"LI, Shu Gang; DING, Yu Song; NIU, Qiang; XU, Shang Zhi; PANG, Li Juan; MA, Ru Lin; JING, Ming Xia; FENG, Gang Ling; LIU, Jia Ming; GUO, Shu Xia","journal":"Biomed Environ Sci","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135117/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2Ozk0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Superoxide"],"organizations":["ATO GSPE","ATO  GSPE","ATO","GST","GSPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GSPE group","ATO-treated mice","ATO-treated group","high-dose GSPE","control group","mouse testis","reproductive toxicity","GSH","T-AOC","alleviating arsenic","testis somatic index","arsenic trioxide","counteracting arsenic","NQO1","male Kunming mice","GST","reproductive indexes","highest level of mRNA expression of Nrf2","activity levels of SOD","glutathione S-transferase","following treatments","gavage","normal saline solution","oxidative stress damage","total antioxidative capability","ability of grape seed proanthocyanidin extract","NAD","HO1","quinone","sperm","recovery","H dehydrogenase","CONCLUSIONS","heme oxygenase","measured parameters","MDA","HdG","METHODS","Superoxide dismutase","malondialdehyde","RESULTS","Nuclear factor","hydroxydeoxyguanosine","pathological changes","real-time PCR","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

We implemented a study of the feasibility and efficacy of face masks and hand hygiene to reduce influenza transmission among Hong Kong household members. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial of households (composed of at least 3 members) where an index subject presented with influenza-like-illness of \u003C48 hours duration. After influenza was confirmed in an index case by the QuickVue Influenza A\u002BB rapid test, the household of the index subject was randomized to 1) control or 2) surgical face masks or 3) hand hygiene. Households were visited within 36 hours, and 3, 6 and 9 days later. Nose and throat swabs were collected from index subjects and all household contacts at each home visit and tested by viral culture. The primary outcome measure was laboratory culture confirmed influenza in a household contact; the secondary outcome was clinically diagnosed influenza (by self-reported symptoms). We randomized 198 households and completed follow up home visits in 128; the index cases in 122 of those households had laboratory-confirmed influenza. There were 21 household contacts with laboratory confirmed influenza corresponding to a secondary attack ratio of 6%. Clinical secondary attack ratios varied from 5% to 18% depending on case definitions. The laboratory-based or clinical secondary attack ratios did not significantly differ across the intervention arms. Adherence to interventions was variable. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The secondary attack ratios were lower than anticipated, and lower than reported in other countries, perhaps due to differing patterns of susceptibility, lack of significant antigenic drift in circulating influenza virus strains recently, and/or issues related to the symptomatic recruitment design.

IFN-gamma mRNA expression was stimulated in the mucosa of all four infected piglets, indicating that they all responded to the rotavirus infection. RNA pools prepared from two infected piglets were used to compare whole mucosal gene expression at 12 and 18 hpi to expression in uninfected germ-free piglets (n = 3) using a porcine intestinal cDNA microarray. Microarray analysis identified 13 down-regulated and 17 up-regulated genes. Northern blot analysis of a selected group of genes confirmed the data of the microarray. Genes were functionally clustered in interferon-regulated genes, proliferation/differentiation genes, apoptosis genes, cytoskeleton genes, signal transduction genes, and enterocyte digestive, absorptive, and transport genes. Down-regulation of the transport gene cluster reflected in part the loss of rotavirus-infected enterocytes from the villous tips. Data mining suggested that several genes were regulated in lower- or mid-villus immature enterocytes and goblet cells, probably to support repair of the damaged epithelial cell layer at the villous tips. Furthermore, up-regulation was observed for IFN-\u03B3 induced guanylate binding protein 2, a protein that effectively inhibited VSV and EMCV replication in vitro (Arch Virol 150:1213\u20131220, 2005). This protein may play a role in the small intestine\u2019s innate defense against enteric viruses like rotavirus.

During the present study, we evaluated prospectively the potential of cytokines present in plasma from patients with dengue in stratifying disease severity. METHODS: Seventeen-cytokine multiplex fluorescent microbead immunoassay was used for the simultaneous detection in 59 dengue patients. GLM models using bimodal or Gaussian family were determined in order to associate cytokines with clinical manifestations and laboratory diagnosis. RESULTS: IL-1\u03B2, IFN-\u03B3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, IL-7 and GM-CSF were significantly increased in patients with severe clinical manifestations (severe dengue) when compared to mild disease forms (mild dengue). In contrast, increased MIP-1\u03B2 levels were observed in patients with mild dengue. MIP-1\u03B2 was also associated with CD56\u002BNK cell circulating rates. IL-1\u03B2, IL-8, TNF-\u03B1 and MCP-1 were associated with marked thrombocytopenia. Increased MCP-1 and GM-CSF levels correlated with hypotension. Moreover, MIP-1\u03B2 and IFN-\u03B3 were independently associated with both dengue severity and disease outcome. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated that the use of a multiple cytokine assay platform was suitable for identifying distinct cytokine profiles associated with the dengue clinical manifestations and severity. MIP-\u03B2 is indicated for the first time as a good prognostic marker in contrast to IFN-\u03B3 that was associated with disease severity.","publish_time":"2008-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bozza, Fernando A; Cruz, Oswaldo G; Zagne, Sonia MO; Azeredo, Elzinandes L; Nogueira, Rita MR; Assis, Edson F; Bozza, Patricia T; Kubelka, Claire F","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9e25b3fb07c1338b5a21c36014e295ab14ca736.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2474613.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2474613/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzU1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GLM","NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dengue patients","dengue severity","severe dengue","mild dengue","dengue clinical manifestations","MIP-\u03B2","\u03B2 levels","dengue patient care","Dengue virus pathogenesis","increased MIP","severe disease forms","mild disease forms","stratifying disease severity","severe clinical manifestations","identification of patients","IFN-\u03B3","disease outcome","Increased MCP","contrast","GM-CSF levels","distinct cytokine profiles","potential of cytokines present","multiple cytokine assay platform","present study","great challenge","plasma","high risk","good prognostic marker","Gaussian family","use","order","simultaneous detection","fluorescent microbead immunoassay","GLM models","CD56","time","laboratory diagnosis","TNF-\u03B1","NK cell","rates","BACKGROUND","hypotension","data","METHODS","RESULTS","marked thrombocytopenia","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

The viruses pose a threat of emergence of a global pandemic influenza through point mutation or reassortment leading to a strain that can effectively transmit among humans. In this study, we present phylogenetic evidences for the interlineage reassortment among H5N1 HPAI viruses isolated from humans, cats, and birds in Indonesia, and identify the potential genetic parents of the reassorted genome segments. Parsimony analyses of viral phylogeography suggest that the reassortant viruses may have originated from greater Jakarta and surroundings, and subsequently spread to other regions in the West Java province. In addition, Bayesian methods were used to elucidate the genetic diversity dynamics of the reassortant strain and one of its genetic parents, which revealed a more rapid initial growth of genetic diversity in the reassortant viruses relative to their genetic parent. These results demonstrate that interlineage exchange of genetic information may play a pivotal role in determining viral genetic diversity in a focal population. Moreover, our study also revealed significantly stronger diversifying selection on the M1 and PB2 genes in the lineages preceding and subsequent to the emergence of the reassortant viruses, respectively. We discuss how the corresponding mutations might drive the adaptation and onward transmission of the newly formed reassortant viruses.","publish_time":"2008-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lam, Tommy Tsan-Yuk; Hon, Chung-Chau; Pybus, Oliver G.; Kosakovsky Pond, Sergei L.; Wong, Raymond Tze-Yeung; Yip, Chi-Wai; Zeng, Fanya; Leung, Frederick Chi-Ching","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d45a0c89997d27fe2e01fbee4b407e01cc595c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2515348.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2515348/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzU2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Indonesia","Jakarta","West Java"],"keyphrases":["reassortant viruses relative","formed reassortant viruses","viral genetic diversity","genetic diversity dynamics","H5N1 HPAI viruses","reassortant strain","potential genetic parents","interlineage exchange of genetic information","rapid initial growth of genetic diversity","interlineage reassortment","humans","study","threat of emergence","global pandemic influenza","pathogenic avian influenza","Parsimony analyses of viral phylogeography","M1","pivotal role","point mutation","PB2 genes","stronger diversifying selection","lineages","onward transmission","cats","reassorted genome segments","phylogenetic evidences","adaptation","Indonesia","focal population","Asian poultry industry","greater Jakarta","regions","West Java province","recurrence","birds","results","corresponding mutations","Bayesian methods","addition","surroundings"],"language":"en"},

The intrapulmonary administration of activated recombinant factor VII (rFVIIa) in DAH was recently published in six patients by Heslet et al with an efficient hemostatic effect. We describe two cases of DAH treated with intrapulmonary rFVIIa. METHODS: Two cases of DAH were admitted to the ICU after presenting abrupt desaturation, tachypnea, cough and haemoptysis, requiring orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The diagnosis was achieved by the bloody return during the bronchoalveolar lavage, during the procedure rFVIIa (50 \u03BCg/Kg in 50 ml of isotonic saline) was administered via the bronchoscope. RESULTS: Immediate cessation of bleeding was observed. Prior to intrapulmonary administration of rFVIIa, the FiO(2 )was 1, which was reduced to 0.4 24 hours later. Following the procedure, the haemostatic effect made blood transfusion superfluous. No thrombotic complications associated with administration of the drug were observed. After the intervention both cases progressed fast and was discharged from the ICU with no further episodes of bleeding. CONCLUSION: 1. Local intrabronchial deposition of DAH with rFVIIa has been shown to be effective in controlling life-threatening DAH. 2. In the case described above, no thrombotic complications were observed following the intrapulmonary administration of rFVIIa.","publish_time":"2008-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Estella, \u00C1ngel; Jare\u00F1o, Antonio; Perez-Bello Fontai\u00F1a, Luis","journal":"Cases J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/559e8ed0debec62db69c8a6b94e5e0548efa32f3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2551590.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2551590/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzU2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DAH","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["intrapulmonary rFVIIa","intrapulmonary administration of rFVIIa","cases of DAH","procedure rFVIIa","life-threatening DAH","Local intrabronchial deposition of DAH","ICU","thrombotic complications","haemostatic effect","episodes of bleeding","efficient hemostatic effect","Immediate cessation of bleeding","haemoptysis","cough","high mortality rate","serious pulmonary complication","orotracheal intubation","tachypnea","bronchoalveolar lavage","Heslet et","abrupt desaturation","blood transfusion superfluous","Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage","recombinant factor","bloody return","absence of specific treatment","BACKGROUND","mechanical ventilation","RESULTS","patients","FiO","diagnosis","intervention","drug","\u03BCg","METHODS","isotonic saline","bronchoscope","hours","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

These particles are classified as ichnovirus virions and resemble ascovirus virions, which are also transmitted by parasitic wasps and attack caterpillars. Ascoviruses replicate DNA and produce virions. Polydnavirus DNA consists of wasp DNA replicated by the wasp from its genome, which also directs particle synthesis. Structural similarities between ascovirus and ichnovirus particles and the biology of their transmission suggest that ichnoviruses evolved from ascoviruses, although molecular evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. RESULTS: Here we show that a family of unique pox-D5 NTPase proteins in the Glypta fumiferanae ichnovirus are related to three Diadromus pulchellus ascovirus proteins encoded by ORFs 90, 91 and 93. A new alignment technique also shows that two proteins from a related ichnovirus are orthologs of other ascovirus virion proteins. CONCLUSION: Our results provide molecular evidence supporting the origin of ichnoviruses from ascoviruses by lateral transfer of ascoviral genes into ichneumonid wasp genomes, perhaps the first example of symbiogenesis between large DNA viruses and eukaryotic organisms. We also discuss the limits of this evidence through complementary studies, which revealed that passive lateral transfer of viral genes among polydnaviral, bacterial, and wasp genomes may have occurred repeatedly through an intimate coupling of both recombination and replication of viral genomes during evolution. The impact of passive lateral transfers on evolutionary relationships between polydnaviruses and viruses with large double-stranded genomes is considered in the context of the theory of symbiogenesis.","publish_time":"2008-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bigot, Yves; Samain, Sylvie; Aug\u00E9-Gouillou, Corinne; Federici, Brian A","journal":"BMC Evol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9f9e925d9999ab39745f2ee8be3efffb5277d082.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2567993.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2567993/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzU3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Diadromus"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wasp DNA","ichnovirus particles","ichnovirus virions","ascovirus virions","ichneumonid wasp genomes","ascovirus virion proteins","related ichnovirus","large DNA viruses","Ascoviruses replicate DNA","Diadromus pulchellus ascovirus proteins","molecular evidence","Polydnavirus DNA","replication of viral genomes","passive lateral transfer of viral genes","lateral transfer of ascoviral genes","Glypta fumiferanae ichnovirus","large double-stranded genomes","RESULTS","impact of passive lateral transfers","family of unique pox-D5 NTPase proteins","origin of ichnoviruses","Female endoparasitic ichneumonid wasps","example of symbiogenesis","parasitic wasps","theory of symbiogenesis","polydnaviruses","evolutionary relationships","polydnaviral","orthologs","recombination","biology","complementary studies","eukaryotic organisms","BACKGROUND","context","ORFs","transmission","Structural similarities","caterpillar hosts","intimate coupling","attack caterpillars","limits","CONCLUSION","new alignment technique","particle synthesis","immunity","hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

Cleavage of proAtPSK4 was induced by placing root explants in tissue culture. The processing of proAtPSK4 was dependent on AtSBT1.1, a subtilisin-like serine protease, encoded by one of 56 subtilase genes in Arabidopsis.

Notably, this severity has been recently suggested to be associated with chloroquine resistance. PATIENTS: Two different patients presented at the Hospital Clinic in Barcelona with P. vivax malaria episodes. One patient had severe symptoms and the other mild symptoms. Both patients traveled through the Brazilian Amazon (Manaus) in 2007. For both patients the current diagnosis of malaria was the first. Two other patients with mild symptoms presented to the \u0022Centro de Pesquisa em Medicina Tropical\u0022, also in the Brazilian Amazon (Rond\u00F4nia) in 2000. METHODS: To exclude the possibility that the patient\u0027s severe symptoms were due to Plasmodium falciparum, a nested PCR was performed. A magnetic method was used to purify P. vivax free of human leukocytes. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to compare the transcript levels of two main transporters likely to be involved in chloroquine resistance in P. vivax, namely the P. vivax chloroquine resistance transporter, pvcrt-o, and the P. vivax multidrug resistance transporter, pvmdr 1. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that the severe clinical symptoms were exclusively due to P. vivax. The patient presented acute respiratory conditions requiring admission to the intensive care unit. The magnetic method showed highly purified infected-reticulocytes with mature stages. In addition, it was found that parasites obtained from the severe patient had up to 2.9-fold increase in pvmdr1 levels and up to 21.9-fold increase in pvcrt-o levels compared to expression levels of parasites from the other patients with mild symptoms. CONCLUSION: This is the first clinical case of severe disease exclusively associated with vivax malaria in Spain. Moreover, these findings suggest that clinical severity could be associated with increased expression levels of parasite genes likely involved in chloroquine resistance. It is necessary to further explore the potential of pvmdr1 and particularly pvcrt-o expression levels as molecular markers of severe disease in P. vivax.","publish_time":"2009-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fern\u00E1ndez-Becerra, Carmen; Pinazo, Maria Jes\u00FAs; Gonz\u00E1lez, Ana; Alonso, Pedro L; del Portillo, Hernando A; Gasc\u00F3n, Joaquim","journal":"Malar J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/63de315a51179233d670bab8a6957e27cc7a2c03.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2682795.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2682795/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzYzMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Barcelona","Spain"],"keyphrases":["severe clinical symptoms","severe patient","vivax chloroquine resistance transporter","patient\u0027s severe symptoms","mild symptoms","vivax malaria episodes","vivax multidrug resistance transporter","pvcrt-o levels","pvmdr1 levels","Plasmodium vivax infections","pvcrt-o expression levels","expression levels of parasites","transcript levels","clinical case of severe disease","different patients","reports of severe clinical cases","vivax free of human leukocytes","clinical severity","molecular markers of severe disease","increased expression levels of parasite genes","fold increase","RESULTS","Brazilian Amazon","magnetic method","current diagnosis of malaria","Plasmodium falciparum","potential of pvmdr1","nested PCR","main transporters likely","Quantitative real-time PCR","admission","Centro","purified infected-reticulocytes","Hospital Clinic","acute respiratory conditions","Barcelona","Pesquisa em Medicina Tropical","intensive care unit","mature stages","possibility","Manaus","Rond\u00F4nia","findings","Spain","BACKGROUND","METHODS","addition","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

These viruses are widespread and can be grouped in several types. Understanding the evolutionary history of HPeV could answer questions such as how long the circulating lineages last shared a common ancestor and how the evolution of this viral species is shaped by its population dynamics. Using both strict and relaxed clock Bayesian phylogenetics we investigated 1) the substitutions rates of the structural P1 and capsid VP1 regions and 2) evolutionary timescale of currently circulating HPeV lineages. RESULTS: Our estimates reveal that human parechoviruses exhibit high substitution rates for both structural P1 and capsid VP1 regions, respectively 2.21 \u00D7 10(-3 )(0.48 \u2013 4.21 \u00D7 10(-3)) and 2.79 \u00D7 10(-3 )(2.05 \u2013 3.66 \u00D7 10(-3)) substitutions per site per year. These are within the range estimated for other picornaviruses. By employing a constant population size coalescent prior, the date of the most recent common ancestor was estimated to be at around 1600 (1427\u20131733). In addition, by looking at the frequency of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions within the VP1 gene we show that purifying selection constitutes the dominating evolutionary force leading to strong amino acid conservation. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our estimates provide a timescale for the evolution of HPeVs and suggest that genetic diversity of current circulating HPeV types has arisen about 400 years ago.","publish_time":"2009-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Faria, Nuno R; de Vries, Michel; van Hemert, Formijn J; Benschop, Kimberley; van der Hoek, Lia","journal":"BMC Evol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8987e37e0598cf67e121bc72d1b95b8f1d9fde73.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2723090.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2723090/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzY1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["evolutionary timescale","substitutions rates","HPeV lineages","circulating lineages","capsid VP1 regions","evolutionary history of HPeV","structural P1","VP1 gene","non-synonymous substitutions","estimates","evolution of HPeVs","CONCLUSION","genetic diversity of current circulating HPeV types","dominating evolutionary force","reclassified human parechoviruses","recent common ancestor","frequency of synonymous","population dynamics","high substitution rates","number of important pathogenic viruses","constant population size coalescent prior","date","purifying selection","strong amino acid conservation","Picornaviridae family","relaxed clock Bayesian phylogenetics","questions","viral species","BACKGROUND","site","RESULTS","years","range","picornaviruses","addition"],"language":"en"},

Design Repeated cross sectional studies using self administered, anonymous questionnaires Setting Surveys at 31 hospital departments of internal medicine, paediatrics, and emergency medicine under the Hong Kong Hospital Authority from January to March 2009 and in May 2009 Participants 2255 healthcare workers completed the questionnaires in the two studies. They were doctors, nurses, or allied health professionals working in the public hospital system. Main outcome measures Stated willingness to accept pre-pandemic influenza vaccination (influenza A subtypes H5N1 or H1N1) and its associating factors. Results The overall willingness to accept pre-pandemic H5N1 vaccine was only 28.4% in the first survey, conducted at WHO influenza pandemic alert phase 3. No significant changes in the level of willingness to accept pre-pandemic H5N1 vaccine were observed despite the escalation to alert phase 5. The willingness to accept pre-pandemic H1N1 vaccine was 47.9% among healthcare workers when the WHO alert level was at phase 5. The most common reasons for an intention to accept were \u201Cwish to be protected\u201D and \u201Cfollowing health authority\u2019s advice.\u201D The major barriers identified were fear of side effects and doubts about efficacy. More than half of the respondents thought nurses should be the first priority group to receive the vaccines. The strongest positive associating factors were history of seasonal influenza vaccination and perceived risk of contracting the infection. Conclusions The willingness to accept pre-pandemic influenza vaccination was low, and no significant effect was observed with the change in WHO alert level. Further studies are required to elucidate the root cause of the low intention to accept pre-pandemic vaccination.","publish_time":"2009-08-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chor, Josette S Y; Ngai, Karry LK; Goggins, William B; Wong, Martin C S; Wong, Samuel Y S; Lee, Nelson; Leung, Ting-fan; Rainer, Timothy H; Griffiths, Sian; Chan, Paul K S","journal":"BMJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/144b7ff1474e0a37ed9135160e2da0027279d55e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2731837.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2731837/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzY4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["pre-pandemic vaccination","influenza pandemic alert phase","acceptability of pre-pandemic influenza vaccination","pre-pandemic H5N1 vaccine","pre-pandemic H1N1 vaccine","level of willingness","history of seasonal influenza vaccination","healthcare workers","overall willingness","World Health Organization\u2019s alert level","Hong Kong Hospital Authority","subtypes H5N1","public hospital system","effect of escalation","low intention","nurses","significant effect","hospital departments of internal medicine","allied health professionals","cross sectional studies","emergency medicine","public hospitals","anonymous questionnaires","strongest positive associating factors","following health authority\u2019s advice","significant changes","Surveys","paediatrics","perceived risk","Design","Main outcome measures","root cause","effects","priority group","doctors","Participants","Conclusions","doubts","efficacy","vaccines","infection","half","respondents","common reasons","Objective","major barriers"],"language":"en"},

Compounds that stimulate innate immune pathways may be valuable in the design of novel adjuvants, vaccines, and other immunotherapeutics. The cyclic dinucleotide cyclic-di\u2013guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) is a recently appreciated second messenger that plays critical regulatory roles in many species of bacteria but is not produced by eukaryotic cells. In vivo and in vitro studies have previously suggested that c-di-GMP is a potent immunostimulatory compound recognized by mouse and human cells. We provide evidence that c-di-GMP is sensed in the cytosol of mammalian cells via a novel immunosurveillance pathway. The potency of cytosolic signaling induced by c-di-GMP is comparable to that induced by cytosolic delivery of DNA, and both nucleic acids induce a similar transcriptional profile, including triggering of type I interferons and coregulated genes via induction of TBK1, IRF3, nuclear factor \u03BAB, and MAP kinases. However, the cytosolic pathway that senses c-di-GMP appears to be distinct from all known nucleic acid\u2013sensing pathways.

Clinical manifestations range from inapparent infections and fevers to fatal encephalitis but the factors that determine disease severity are currently undefined. TBEV is characteristically a hemagglutinating (HA) virus; the ability to agglutinate erythrocytes tentatively reflects virion receptor/fusion activity. However, for the past few years many atypical HA-deficient strains have been isolated from patients and also from the natural European host tick, Ixodes persulcatus. By analysing the sequences of HA-deficient strains we have identified 3 unique amino acid substitutions (D67G, E122G or D277A) in the envelope protein, each of which increases the net charge and hydrophobicity of the virion surface. Therefore, we genetically engineered virus mutants each containing one of these 3 substitutions; they all exhibited HA-deficiency. Unexpectedly, each genetically modified non-HA virus demonstrated increased TBEV reproduction in feeding Ixodes ricinus, not the recognised tick host for these strains. Moreover, virus transmission efficiency between infected and uninfected ticks co-feeding on mice was also intensified by each substitution. Retrospectively, the mutation D67G was identified in viruses isolated from patients with encephalitis. We propose that the emergence of atypical Siberian HA-deficient TBEV strains in Europe is linked to their molecular adaptation to local ticks. This process appears to be driven by the selection of single mutations that change the virion surface thus enhancing receptor/fusion function essential for TBEV entry into the unfamiliar tick species. As the consequence of this adaptive mutagenesis, some of these mutations also appear to enhance the ability of TBEV to cross the human blood-brain barrier, a likely explanation for fatal encephalitis. Future research will reveal if these emerging Siberian TBEV strains continue to disperse westwards across Europe by adaptation to the indigenous tick species and if they are associated with severe forms of TBE.","publish_time":"2009-10-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khasnatinov, Maxim A.; Ustanikova, Katarina; Frolova, Tatiana V.; Pogodina, Vanda V.; Bochkova, Nadezshda G.; Levina, Ludmila S.; Slovak, Mirko; Kazimirova, Maria; Labuda, Milan; Klempa, Boris; Eleckova, Elena; Gould, Ernest A.; Gritsun, Tamara S.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9491c7cabcc6dd1baa0de1d335c71095798cd3f9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2750751.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2750751/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzY5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TBEV","TBE"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["ability of TBEV","TBEV entry","atypical HA-deficient strains","emerging Siberian TBEV strains","emergence of atypical Siberian HA-deficient TBEV strains","sequences of HA","HA-deficiency","Tick-borne encephalitis virus","modified non-HA virus","increased TBEV reproduction","fatal encephalitis","virion receptor","virion surface","virus transmission efficiency","recognised tick host","unfamiliar tick species","indigenous tick species","engineered virus mutants","natural European host tick","patients","feeding Ixodes ricinus","uninfected ticks co-feeding","Ixodes persulcatus","fusion activity","human epidemics","local ticks","molecular adaptation","mutation D67G","fusion function essential","selection of single mutations","human blood-brain barrier","unique amino acid substitutions","E122G","inapparent infections","fevers","likely explanation","D277A","mice","factors","erythrocytes","years","hydrophobicity","viruses","Clinical manifestations","disease severity","net charge","adaptive mutagenesis","past","Eurasia","hemagglutinating","envelope protein","Future research","severe forms of TBE","consequence","process"],"language":"en"},

While IFN induction complicates gene function studies, immunostimulation by siRNAs may be beneficial in certain therapeutic settings. Various forms of siRNA, meeting different compositional and structural requirements, have been reported to trigger IFN activation. The consensus is that intracellularly expressed short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) are less prone to IFN activation because they are not detected by the cell-surface receptors. In particular, lentiviral vector-mediated transduction of shRNAs has been reported to avoid IFN response. Here we identify a shRNA that potently activates the IFN pathway in human cells in a sequence- and 5\u2032-triphosphate-dependent manner. In addition to suppressing its intended mRNA target, expression of the shRNA results in dimerization of interferon regulatory factor-3, activation of IFN promoters and secretion of biologically active IFNs into the extracellular medium. Delivery by lentiviral vector transduction did not avoid IFN activation by this and another, unrelated shRNA. We also demonstrated that retinoic-acid-inducible gene I, and not melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 or toll-like receptor 3, is the cytoplasmic sensor for intracellularly expressed shRNAs that trigger IFN activation.","publish_time":"2009-09-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kenworthy, Rachael; Lambert, Diana; Yang, Feng; Wang, Nan; Chen, Zihong; Zhu, Haizhen; Zhu, Fanxiu; Liu, Chen; Li, Kui; Tang, Hengli","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d02f9e2414da034e0aded233a37de3077f40c93b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2770676.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2770676/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzcxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN activation","IFN pathway","activation of IFN promoters","IFN induction","IFN response","inducible gene","lentiviral vector transduction","lentiviral vector-mediated transduction of shRNAs","shRNA results","unrelated shRNA","gene function studies","target effects of RNA interference","mammalian cells","human cells","small interfering RNA","intended mRNA target","Various forms of siRNA","dimerization of interferon regulatory factor","siRNAs","immunostimulation","expression","active IFNs","secretion","melanoma differentiation","toll","sequence","major contributor","type","certain therapeutic settings","short-hairpin RNAs","structural requirements","extracellular medium","addition","retinoic-acid","cytoplasmic sensor","Delivery","triphosphate-dependent manner","cell-surface receptors","consensus"],"language":"en"},

However, little is known about the evolutionary dynamics of H1N1pdm and its geographic and temporal diversification. Methods Phylogenetic analysis was conducted upon the concatenated coding regions of whole-genome sequences from 290 H1N1pdm isolates sampled globally between April 1 \u2013 July 9, 2009, including relatively large samples from the US states of Wisconsin and New York. Results At least 7 phylogenetically distinct viral clades have disseminated globally and co-circulated in localities that experienced multiple introductions of H1N1pdm. The epidemics in New York and Wisconsin were dominated by two different clades, both phylogenetically distinct from the viruses first identified in California and Mexico, suggesting an important role for founder effects in determining local viral population structures. Conclusions Determining the global diversity of H1N1pdm is central to understanding the evolution and spatial spread of the current pandemic, and to predict its future impact on human populations. Our results indicate that H1N1pdm has already diversified into distinct viral lineages with defined spatial patterns.","publish_time":"2009-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nelson, Martha; Spiro, David; Wentworth, David; Fan, Jiang; Beck, Eric; St. George, Kirsten; Ghedin, Elodie; Halpin, Rebecca; Bera, Jayati; Hine, Erin; Proudfoot, Kathleen; Stockwell, Tim; Lin, Xudong; Griesemer, Sara; Bose, Michael; Jurgens, Lisa; Kumar, Swati; Viboud, Cecile; Holmes, Edward; Henrickson, Kelly","journal":"PLoS Curr","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2773564.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2773564/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzcxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wisconsin","New York","California","Mexico"],"keyphrases":["H1N1pdm isolates","distinct viral clades","multiple introductions of H1N1pdm","global diversity of H1N1pdm","H1N1pdm influenza virus","evolutionary dynamics of H1N1pdm","distinct viral lineages","spatial spread","New York","Results","local viral population structures","different clades","human populations","human deaths","US states of Wisconsin","defined spatial patterns","founder effects","genome sequences","important role","localities","concatenated coding regions","Mexico","humans","current pandemic","large samples","future impact","Methods Phylogenetic analysis","California","viruses","temporal diversification","Conclusions","epidemics","Background","initial detection"],"language":"en"},

During the first few days after the initial outbreak in Mexico, extensive media coverage together with a high degree of uncertainty about the transmissibility and mortality rate associated with the virus caused widespread concern in the population. The spread of an infectious disease can be strongly influenced by behavioral changes (e.g., social distancing) during the early phase of an epidemic, but data on risk perception and behavioral response to a novel virus is usually collected with a substantial delay or after an epidemic has run its course. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report the results from an online survey that gathered data (n = 6,249) about risk perception of the Influenza A(H1N1) outbreak during the first few days of widespread media coverage (April 28 - May 5, 2009). We find that after an initially high level of concern, levels of anxiety waned along with the perception of the virus as an immediate threat. Overall, our data provide evidence that emotional status mediates behavioral response. Intriguingly, principal component analysis revealed strong clustering of anxiety about swine flu, bird flu and terrorism. All three of these threats receive a great deal of media attention and their fundamental uncertainty is likely to generate an inordinate amount of fear vis-a-vis their actual threat. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that respondents\u0027 behavior varies in predictable ways. Of particular interest, we find that affective variables, such as self-reported anxiety over the epidemic, mediate the likelihood that respondents will engage in protective behavior. Understanding how protective behavior such as social distancing varies and the specific factors that mediate it may help with the design of epidemic control strategies.","publish_time":"2009-12-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jones, James Holland; Salath\u00E9, Marcel","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/076d18c2ee294256a400299b5c4631aac187d47a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2779851.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2779851/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzcxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Influenza A"],"locations":["Mexico"],"keyphrases":["data","novel virus","novel influenza virus","behavioral response","swine flu","risk perception","protective behavior","days of widespread media coverage","extensive media coverage","levels of anxiety","social distancing","bird flu","behavioral changes","respondents\u0027 behavior","widespread concern","results","H1N1","design of epidemic control strategies","strong clustering of anxiety","self-reported anxiety","high degree of uncertainty","high level of concern","great deal of media attention","fundamental uncertainty","initial outbreak","fear vis","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","actual threat","immediate threat","principal component analysis","Mexico","transmissibility","evidence","emotional status","mortality rate","early phase","infected hundreds of thousands","affective variables","online survey","terrorism","globe","people","SIGNIFICANCE","predictable ways","threats","specific factors","likelihood","population","infectious disease","substantial delay","METHODOLOGY","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","course"],"language":"en"},

Innate immunity activation plays a central role in the development of ALI. Innate immunity is activated through families of related pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize conserved microbial motifs or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Toll-like receptors were the first major family of PRRs discovered in mammals. Recently, NACHT\u2013leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptors and retinoic acid\u2013inducible gene\u2013like receptors have been added to the list. It is now understood that in addition to recognizing infectious stimuli, both Toll-like receptors and NACHT-LRR receptors can also respond to endogenous molecules released in response to stress, trauma and cell damage. These molecules have been termed damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). It has been clinically observed for a long time that infectious and noninfectious insults initiate inflammation, so confirmation of overlapping receptor-signal pathways of activation between PAMPs and DAMPs is no surprise. This review provides an overview of the PRR-dependent mechanisms of ALI and clinical implication. Modification of PRR pathways is likely to be a logical therapeutic target for ALI/acute respiratory distress syndrome.","publish_time":"2009-11-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiang, Meng; Fan, Jie","journal":"Mol Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/78bbe04ee54d5cc04b77653077aa142af88fa2ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2785474.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2785474/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzcyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NACHT-LRR receptors","development of ALI","acute respiratory distress syndrome","families of related pattern recognition receptors","PRR-dependent mechanisms of ALI","PAMPs","Innate immunity activation","molecular patterns","trauma","DAMPs","Toll","Modification of PRR pathways","major family of PRRs","Acute lung injury","clinical events","clinical implication","major surgery","infectious stimuli","cell damage","endogenous molecules","confirmation of overlapping receptor-signal pathways of activation","uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response","logical therapeutic target","noninfectious insults","inflammation","pathogen","sepsis","retinoic acid","central role","leucine-rich repeat","inducible gene","conserved microbial motifs","overview","long time","mammals","review","addition","surprise","list"],"language":"en"},

Recently, a novel outcome was postulated for low FeLV infectious doses. Na\u00EFve cats exposed to faeces of persistently infected cats seroconverted, indicating infection, but remained negative for provirus and p27 antigen in blood. FeLV provirus was found in some tissues but not in the bone marrow, infection of which is usually considered a necessary stage for disease progression. To investigate the impact of low FeLV doses on young cats and to test the hypothesis that low dose exposure may lead to an unknown pathogenesis of infection without involvement of the bone marrow, 21 cats were infected oronasally with variable viral doses. Blood p27, proviral and viral loads were followed until week 20 post-infection. Tissue proviral loads were determined as well. The immune response was monitored by measuring FeLV whole virus and p45 antibodies; and feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA) assay. One cat showed regressive infection (transient antigenemia, persistent provirus-positivity, and seroconversion) with provirus only found in some organs at sacrifice. In 7 of the 20 remaining cats FOCMA assay positivity was the only sign of infection, while all other tests were negative. Overall, the results show that FeLV low dose exposure can result in seroconversion during a presumed abortive infection. Therefore, commonly used detection methods do not detect all FeLV-infected animals, possibly leading to an underestimation of the prevalence of infection.","publish_time":"2009-10-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Major, Andrea; Cattori, Valentino; Boenzli, Eva; Riond, Barbara; Ossent, Peter; Meli, Marina Luisa; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina; Lutz, Hans","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b329eb91fdc5ea7e947a48e414a7a1f10ed40c9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2789331.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2789331/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzcyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection results","FeLV provirus","regressive infection","progressive infection","sign of infection","post-infection","prevalence of infection","presumed abortive infection","unknown pathogenesis of infection","infected cats","FeLV low dose exposure","low FeLV infectious doses","impact of low FeLV doses","FeLV-infected animals","young cats","Na\u00EFve cats","persistent provirus-positivity","remaining cats FOCMA assay positivity","variable viral doses","feline leukemia virus","seroconversion","p27 antigen","viral shedding","Blood p27","bone marrow","Tissue proviral loads","persistent viremia","feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen","transient antigenemia","p45 antibodies","involvement","hypothesis","variety of outcomes","felids","week","faeces","tissues","novel outcome","necessary stage","disease progression","underestimation","used detection methods","organs","immune response","tests","sacrifice"],"language":"en"},

For the first time, post-mortem findings from a fatal case of knowlesi malaria are reported here. CASE PRESENTATION: A formerly healthy 40 year-old male became symptomatic 10 days after spending time in the jungle of North Borneo. Four days later, he presented to hospital in a state of collapse and died within two hours. He was hyponatraemic and had elevated blood urea, potassium, lactate dehydrogenase and amino transferase values; he was also thrombocytopenic and eosinophilic. Dengue haemorrhagic shock was suspected and a post-mortem examination performed. Investigations for dengue virus were negative. Blood for malaria parasites indicated hyperparasitaemia and single species P. knowlesi infection was confirmed by nested-PCR. Macroscopic pathology of the brain and endocardium showed multiple petechial haemorrhages, the liver and spleen were enlarged and lungs had features consistent with ARDS. Microscopic pathology showed sequestration of pigmented parasitized red blood cells in the vessels of the cerebrum, cerebellum, heart and kidney without evidence of chronic inflammatory reaction in the brain or any other organ examined. Brain sections were negative for intracellular adhesion molecule-1. The spleen and liver had abundant pigment containing macrophages and parasitized red blood cells. The kidney had evidence of acute tubular necrosis and endothelial cells in heart sections were prominent. CONCLUSIONS: The overall picture in this case was one of systemic malaria infection that fit the WHO classification for severe malaria. Post-mortem findings in this case were unexpectedly similar to those that define fatal falciparum malaria, including cerebral pathology. There were important differences including the absence of coma despite petechial haemorrhages and parasite sequestration in the brain. These results suggest that further study of knowlesi malaria will aid the interpretation of, often conflicting, information on malaria pathophysiology in humans.","publish_time":"2010-01-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cox-Singh, Janet; Hiu, Jessie; Lucas, Sebastian B; Divis, Paul C; Zulkarnaen, Mohammad; Chandran, Patricia; Wong, Kum T; Adem, Patricia; Zaki, Sherif R; Singh, Balbir; Krishna, Sanjeev","journal":"Malar J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf1d95ada5ce959db1a171eba72b349366a6748b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2818646.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2818646/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozc1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":["North Borneo"],"keyphrases":["fatal case of knowlesi malaria","malaria parasites","malaria pathophysiology","Zoonotic malaria","severe malaria","study of knowlesi malaria","fatal falciparum malaria","systemic malaria infection","knowlesi infection","Brain sections","Plasmodium knowlesi","CASE PRESENTATION","post-mortem findings","sequestration of pigmented parasitized red blood cells","endothelial cells","kidney","elevated blood urea","heart sections","liver","Microscopic pathology","cerebral pathology","Macroscopic pathology","days","spleen","post-mortem examination","multiple petechial haemorrhages","parasite sequestration","spending time","important differences","dengue virus","Dengue haemorrhagic shock","evidence of acute tubular necrosis","evidence of chronic inflammatory reaction","lactate dehydrogenase","potassium","macrophages","hyperparasitaemia","abundant pigment","absence of coma","endocardium","single species","vessels","amino transferase values","year-old male","information","cerebellum","cerebrum","jungle of North Borneo","lungs","interpretation","classification","intracellular adhesion molecule","hospital","overall picture","hyponatraemic","Investigations","humans","BACKGROUND","state of collapse","human pathogen","nested-PCR","ARDS","CONCLUSIONS","results","hours","organ"],"language":"en"},

There was a limited record of waterborne viral disease outbreaks at the time; recorded data on foodborne outbreaks were fewer still. Laboratory environmental (water and wastewater) virology was in its infancy, and food virology was in gestation. Detection of viruses was most often attempted by inoculation of primary primate cell cultures, with observation for plaque formation or cytopathic effects. Focus was initially on enteroviruses and reoviruses. Environmental and food samples had to be liquefied if not already in liquid form; clarified to remove solids, bacteria, and fungi; and concentrated to a volume that could be tested in cell culture. Cytotoxicity was also a concern. Studies at the FRI and some other laboratories addressed all of these challenges. The FRI group was the World Health Organization\u2019s Collaborating Center for Food Virology for many years. Other topics studied were virus inactivation as functions of temperature, time, matrix, disinfectants, and microbial action; peroral and ex-vivo infectivity; and the suitability of various virus surrogates for environmental monitoring and inactivation experiments. Detection of noroviruses and hepatitis A virus required molecular methods, most often RT-PCR.

The viral nucleoprotein (NP) and ion channel matrix protein (M2) are highly conserved among different strains and various influenza A subtypes. Here, we investigate the relative efficacy of NP and M2 compared to HA in protecting against HPAI H5N1 virus. In mice, previous studies have shown that vaccination with NP and M2 in recombinant DNA and/or adenovirus vectors or with adjuvants confers protection against lethal challenge in the absence of HA. However, we find that the protective efficacy of NP and M2 diminishes as the virulence and dose of the challenge virus are increased. To explore this question in a model relevant to human disease, ferrets were immunized with DNA/rAd5 vaccines encoding NP, M2, HA, NP\u002BM2 or HA\u002BNP\u002BM2. Only HA or HA\u002BNP\u002BM2 vaccination conferred protection against a stringent virus challenge. Therefore, while gene-based vaccination with NP and M2 may provide moderate levels of protection against low challenge doses, it is insufficient to confer protective immunity against high challenge doses of H5N1 in ferrets. These immunogens may require combinatorial vaccination with HA, which confers protection even against very high doses of lethal viral challenge.","publish_time":"2010-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rao, Srinivas S.; Kong, Wing-Pui; Wei, Chih-Jen; Van Hoeven, Neal; Gorres, J.

Evidence that DNA vaccines are well tolerated and have an excellent safety profile proved to be of advantage as many clinical trials combines the first phase with the second, saving both time and money. It is clear from the results obtained in clinical trials that such DNA vaccines require much improvement in antigen expression and delivery methods to make them sufficiently effective in the clinic. Similarly, it is clear that additional strategies are required to activate effective immunity against poorly immunogenic tumor antigens. Engineering vaccine design for manipulating antigen presentation and processing pathways is one of the most important aspects that can be easily handled in the DNA vaccine technology. Several approaches have been investigated including DNA vaccine engineering, co-delivery of immunomodulatory molecules, safe routes of administration, prime-boost regimen and strategies to break the immunosuppressive networks mechanisms adopted by malignant cells to prevent immune cell function. Combined or single strategies to enhance the efficacy and immunogenicity of DNA vaccines are applied in completed and ongoing clinical trials, where the safety and tolerability of the DNA platform are substantiated. In this review on DNA vaccines, salient aspects on this topic going from basic research to the clinic are evaluated.

An important aspect of domain evolution is their atomic structure and biochemical function, which are both specified by the information in the amino acid sequence. Changes in this information may bring about new folds, functions and protein architectures. With the present and still increasing wealth of sequences and annotation data brought about by genomics, new evolutionary relationships are constantly being revealed, unknown structures modeled and phylogenies inferred. Such investigations not only help predict the function of newly discovered proteins, but also assist in mapping unforeseen pathways of evolution and reveal crucial, co-evolving inter- and intra-molecular interactions. In turn this will help us describe how protein domains shaped cellular interaction networks and the dynamics with which they are regulated in the cell. Additionally, these studies can be used for the design of new and optimized protein domains for therapy.

Pregnancy and differences in the presentation of various risk factors contribute to the worse outcome of infection in women. Vaccination and antiviral treatment efficacy also vary in a sex-dependent manner. Finally, sex-specific genetic and hormonal differences may contribute to the severity of influenza and the clearance of viral infection. The contribution of sex and gender to influenza can only be determined by a greater consideration of these factors in clinical and epidemiological studies and increased research into the biological basis underlying these differences.","publish_time":"2010-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klein, Sabra L; Passaretti, Catherine; Anker, Martha; Olukoya, Peju; Pekosz, Andrew","journal":"Biol Sex Differ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3b433d903791c682135be571dbdf7835fe56741.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3010100.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3010100/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzkwNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severity of influenza","contribution of sex","H1N1 influenza virus","sex-dependent manner","exposure","hormonal differences","sex-specific genetic","age-dependent","H1N1 pandemic","worse outcome of infection","clearance of viral infection","presentation of various risk factors","young adults of reproductive age","increased research","morbidity","epidemiological studies","mortality rates","disease burden","susceptibility","females","biological basis","Children","fundamental factor","immune responses","antiviral treatment efficacy","Vaccination","incidence","groups","greater consideration","women","individual","gender","Pregnancy"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Lung specimens underwent microbiologic analysis, and examination by optical and electron microscopy. Immunophenotyping was used to characterize macrophages, natural killer, T and B cells, and expression of cytokines and iNOS. RESULTS: The pathological features observed were necrotizing bronchiolitis, diffuse alveolar damage, alveolar hemorrhage and abnormal immune response. Ultrastructural analysis showed viral\u2010like particles in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Viral\u2010like particles can be successfully demonstrated in lung tissue by ultrastructural examination, without confirmation of the virus by RT\u2010PCR on nasopharyngeal aspirates.

In parasitic infections, atopic diseases such as atopic dermatitis and asthma, the numbers of the circulating eosinophils are frequently elevated. In conditions such as Hypereosinophilic Syndrome (HES) circulating eosinophil levels are even further raised. Although, eosinophils were identified more than hundred years ago, their roles in homeostasis and in disease still remain unclear. The most prominent feature of the eosinophils are their large secondary granules, each containing four basic proteins, the best known being the eosinophil cationic protein (ECP). This protein has been developed as a marker for eosinophilic disease and quantified in biological fluids including serum, bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal secretions. Elevated ECP levels are found in T helper lymphocyte type 2 (atopic) diseases such as allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis but also occasionally in other diseases such as bacterial sinusitis. ECP is a ribonuclease which has been attributed with cytotoxic, neurotoxic, fibrosis promoting and immune-regulatory functions. ECP regulates mucosal and immune cells and may directly act against helminth, bacterial and viral infections. The levels of ECP measured in disease in combination with the catalogue of known functions of the protein and its polymorphisms presented here will build a foundation for further speculations of the role of ECP, and ultimately the role of the eosinophil.","publish_time":"2011-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bystrom, Jonas; Amin, Kawa; Bishop-Bailey, David","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa88fbb8716e5fca7d513bcb5a0a608456a59205.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3030543.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3030543/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzkyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ECP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["levels of ECP","role of ECP","Elevated ECP levels","eosinophil levels","atopic diseases","eosinophil cationic protein","Eosinophil granulocytes","circulating eosinophils","atopic dermatitis","allergic asthma","eosinophilic disease","catalogue of known functions","immune-regulatory functions","best known","allergic rhinitis","immune cells","viral infections","parasitic infections","bacterial sinusitis","T helper lymphocyte type","serum","bronchoalveolar lavage","biological fluids","lungs","thymus","organs","fibrosis","HES","numbers","combination","basic proteins","respiratory mucosa","Hypereosinophilic Syndrome","large secondary granules","lymph nodes","nasal secretions","gastro-intestinal tract","homeostasis","helminth","spleen","conditions","foundation","years","roles","polymorphisms","marker","speculations","prominent feature","ribonuclease"],"language":"en"},

Hepatitis associated aplastic anemia (HAAA) is a variant of aplastic anemia in which aplastic anemia follows an acute attack of hepatitis. Several reports have noted an association between HGV and hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia besides other hepatitis causing viruses. CASE PRESENTATION: A female girl of age 11 year with a history of loose motion for one month, vomiting for last 15 days and poor oral intake for last few days is reported here. The physical examination presents fever, pallor whereas bleeding, hepatomegaly, Splenomegaly and bruising were absent, abdominal ultrasonography confirmed the absence of hepatomegaly, Splenomegaly and lymphodenopathy. The laboratory investigation parameters were: haemoglobin 6.2 g/L, total leucocytes count 1.51, neutrophils 0.47%, absolute reticulocyte count 0.5%, Monocytes 0.16%, red cell count 3.2 mil/uL, Picked cell volume (PCV) 30.13%, Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) 78 fL, Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) 26.3 pg. The liver enzymes were alanine aminotransferease (ALT) 98 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 114 IU/L. Serologic and molecular tests for hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, TTV, B19 were negative, whereas HGV RNA PCR test was found positive for hepatitis G virus. The bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy examination revealed hypo- cellularity, erythropoiesis, myelopoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. CONCLUSION: HAAA is an uncommon but severe condition, which may occur following idiopathic cases of acute hepatitis. Our finding suggests the involvement of HGV in the development of aplastic anemia. In patients presenting with pancytopenia after an episode of acute hepatitis, the definitive diagnosis should be considered and confirmed by RT-PCR and if possible by bone marrow biopsy.","publish_time":"2011-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Riaz Shah, Shahida Amjad; Idrees, Muhammad; Hussain, Abrar","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e7bc618b50638df929fb544a45005596c08b3c97.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3032715.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3032715/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzkyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin","IU/L.

In this paper I explore the place and relevance of heroism in contemporary nursing. I propose that nursing heroism deserves a broader appreciation and that within the term lie many hidden, \u0027unsung\u0027 or \u0027unrecorded\u0027 heroisms. I also challenge the critiques of heroism that would condemn it as part of a \u0027militarisation\u0027 of nursing.

Although previous studies had demonstrated that this mutation impaired the replication capacity of the influenza virus in vitro and in vivo, the A/Brisbane/59/2007 H275Y oseltamivir-resistant mutant completely out-competed the wild-type (WT) strain and was, in the 2008\u20132009 influenza season, the primary A/H1N1 circulating strain. Using a combination of plaque and viral yield assays, and a simple mathematical model, approximate values were extracted for two basic viral kinetics parameters of the in vitro infection. In the ST6GalI-MDCK cell line, the latent infection period (i.e., the time for a newly infected cell to start releasing virions) was found to be 1\u20133 h for the WT strain and more than 7 h for the H275Y mutant. The infecting time (i.e., the time for a single infectious cell to cause the infection of another one) was between 30 and 80 min for the WT, and less than 5 min for the H275Y mutant. Single-cycle viral yield experiments have provided qualitative confirmation of these findings. These results, though preliminary, suggest that the increased fitness success of the A/Brisbane/59/2007 H275Y mutant may be due to increased infectivity compensating for an impaired or delayed viral release, and are consistent with recent evidence for the mechanistic origins of fitness reduction and recovery in NA expression. The method applied here can reconcile seemingly contradictory results from the plaque and yield assays as two complementary views of replication kinetics, with both required to fully capture a strain\u0027s fitness.","publish_time":"2011-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Holder, Benjamin P.; Simon, Philippe; Liao, Laura E.; Abed, Yacine; Bouhy, Xavier; Beauchemin, Catherine A.

Our goal was to evaluate the outcome of patients with severe CAP, focusing on the impact of new rather than old fluoroquinolones combined with \u03B2-lactam in the empirical antimicrobial treatments. METHODS: Retrospective study of consecutive patients admitted in a 16-bed general intensive care unit (ICU), between January 1996 and January 2009, for severe (Pneumonia Severity Index \u003E or = 4) community-acquired pneumonia due to non penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and treated with a \u03B2-lactam combined with a fluoroquinolone. RESULTS: We included 70 patients of whom 38 received a \u03B2-lactam combined with ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin and 32 combined with levofloxacin. Twenty six patients (37.1%) died in the ICU. Three independent factors associated with decreased survival in ICU were identified: septic shock on ICU admission (AOR = 10.6; 95% CI 2.87-39.3; p = 0.0004), age \u003E 70 yrs.

For such samples the localization and orientation of the molecular species or probe within the lipid bilayer environment is the focus of research prior to an evaluation of their dynamic or mechanistic behavior. X-ray scattering is a powerful method to study peptide/lipid interactions in the fluid, fully hydrated state of a lipid bilayer. For one, the lipid response can be revealed by observing membrane thickening and thinning as well as packing in the membrane plane; at the same time, the distinct positions of peptide moieties within lipid membranes can be elucidated at resolutions of up to several angstroms by applying heavy-atom labeling techniques. In this study, we describe a generally applicable X-ray scattering approach that provides robust and quantitative information about peptide insertion and localization as well as peptide/lipid interaction within highly oriented, hydrated multilamellar membrane stacks. To this end, we have studied an artificial, designed \u03B2-helical peptide motif in its homodimeric and hairpin variants adopting different states of oligomerization. These peptide lipid complexes were analyzed by grazing incidence diffraction (GID) to monitor changes in the lateral lipid packing and ordering. In addition, we have applied anomalous reflectivity using synchrotron radiation as well as in-house X-ray reflectivity in combination with iodine-labeling in order to determine the electron density distribution \u03C1(z) along the membrane normal (z axis), and thereby reveal the hydrophobic mismatch situation as well as the position of certain amino acid side chains within the lipid bilayer. In the case of multiple labeling, the latter technique is not only applicable to demonstrate the peptide\u2019s reconstitution but also to generate evidence about the relative peptide orientation with respect to the lipid bilayer.

During infection, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a widespread pathogen, not only phosphorylates the APC coactivator Cdh1 via the multifunctional viral kinase pUL97, it also promotes degradation of APC subunits via an unknown mechanism. Using a proteomics approach, we found that a recently identified HCMV protein, pUL21a, interacted with the APC. Importantly, we determined that expression of pUL21a was necessary and sufficient for proteasome-dependent degradation of APC subunits APC4 and APC5. This resulted in APC disruption and required pUL21a binding to the APC. We have identified the proline-arginine amino acid pair at residues 109\u2013110 in pUL21a to be critical for its ability to bind and regulate the APC. A point mutant virus in which proline-arginine were mutated to alanines (PR-AA) grew at wild-type levels. However, a double mutant virus in which the viral ability to regulate the APC was abrogated by both PR-AA point mutation and UL97 deletion was markedly more attenuated compared to the UL97 deletion virus alone. This suggests that these mutations are synthetically lethal, and that HCMV exploits two viral factors to ensure successful disruption of the APC to overcome its restriction on virus infection. This study reveals the HCMV protein pUL21a as a novel APC regulator and uncovers a unique viral mechanism to subvert APC activity.","publish_time":"2012-07-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fehr, Anthony R.; Gualberto, Nathaniel C.; Savaryn, John Paul; Terhune, Scott S.; Yu, Dong","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ae7223cc6ab3437ba262bb2bb47768948e01d59.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3390409.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3390409/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzUzNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["APC","HCMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["APC disruption","APC activity","novel APC regulator","APC coactivator Cdh1","HCMV protein pUL21a","proteasome-dependent degradation of APC subunits APC4","viral ability","pUL21a binding","expression of pUL21a","virus infection","UL97 deletion virus","point mutant virus","viral factors","HCMV exploits","unique viral mechanism","double mutant virus","multifunctional viral kinase pUL97","PR-AA point mutation","unknown mechanism","successful disruption","proline-arginine amino acid pair","degradation of multiple cell cycle regulatory proteins","ubiquitination","residues","E3 ubiquitin ligase","alanines","APC5","human cytomegalovirus","wild-type levels","complex","widespread pathogen","study","restriction","anaphase","proteomics approach","mutations"],"language":"en"},

In China, routine molecular tests for upper respiratory pathogens are not widely performed and antibiotics abuse in treating upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) is a major public health concern. METHODS: We performed qualitative real-time PCR tests to detect common upper respiratory tract pathogens including 9 viruses and 3 bacteria in 1221 nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with fever and influenza-like symptoms in a Chinese city. A quantitative real-time PCR was also performed to measure the bacterial density of the colonizing Streptococcus pneumoniae in these samples. RESULTS: We found very diverse pathogens including 81.7% viruses, 11.6% bacteria and 6.7% mixed viruses and bacteria. S. pneumoniae colonization was found in 8.0% of the cases but most of them had low bacterial density (Mean = 3.9 log cfu/ml). We also discovered an increase of S. pneumoniae colonization frequency (but not the density) in patients with detectable upper respiratory tract pathogens, in a pathogen variety-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided strong evidence against empiric antibiotic use for treating URTIs, and highlighted a strong need for improving the diagnostic capacity for URTIs by using more molecular testing in China.","publish_time":"2019-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Jialiang; Chen, Jinkun; He, Tingting; Jiang, Zhuojing; Zhou, Jiale; Hu, Bin; Yang, Shangxin","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a1aa4efc2be62dfd565fee353b7d512e495d83a3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6323860.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30616564/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-018-3662-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus","S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["upper respiratory pathogens","common upper respiratory tract pathogens","detectable upper respiratory tract pathogens","upper respiratory tract infections","URTIs","diverse pathogens","patients","low bacterial density","mixed viruses","pneumoniae colonization frequency","China","qualitative real-time PCR tests","routine molecular tests","colonizing Streptococcus pneumoniae","quantitative real-time PCR","strong evidence","strong need","molecular testing","similar symptoms","empiric antibiotic use","study","influenza","fever","Mean","nasopharyngeal swabs","antibiotics abuse","diagnostic capacity","pathogen variety-dependent manner","major public health concern","log cfu","CONCLUSIONS","samples","METHODS","increase","BACKGROUND","Chinese city","RESULTS","cases"],"language":"en"},

Our previous experiments demonstrated that ATMUV infection effectively triggered host innate immune response through MDA5 and TLR3-dependent signaling pathways. However, little information is available on the role of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in defending against ATMUV infection. In this study, we found that ATMUV infection induced robust expression of type I and type III interferon (IFNs) in duck tissues. Furthermore, we observed that expression of interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) was significantly upregulated in DEF and DF-1 cells after infection with ATMUV. Similar results were obtained from in vivo studies using ATMUV-infected ducklings. Importantly, we showed that knockdown of endogenous IFITM1 or IFITM3 by specific shRNA markedly enhanced ATMUV replication in DF-1 cells. However, disruption of IFITM2 expression had no obvious effect on the ATMUV replication. In addition, overexpression of chicken or duck IFITM1 and IFITM3 in DF-1 cells impaired the replication of ATMUV. Taken together, these results reveal that induced expression of avian IFITM1 and IFITM3 in response to ATMUV infection can effectively restrict the virus replication, and suggest that increasing IFITM proteins in host may be a useful strategy for control of ATMUV infection.","publish_time":"2017-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Shilong; Wang, Long; Chen, Jieying; Zhang, Lanlan; Wang, Song; Goraya, Mohsan U.; Chi, Xiaojuan; Na, Yang; Shao, Wenhan; Yang, Zhou; Zeng, Xiancheng; Chen, Shaoying; Chen, Ji-Long","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa5d4e0d5a2afc924b07e8835aa0ac3cf0646089.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5397487.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28473814/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.00672","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["III"],"organizations":["ATMUV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["replication of ATMUV","control of ATMUV infection","enhanced ATMUV replication","ATMUV-infected ducklings","expression of interferon","IFITM3","expression of avian IFITM1","DF","virus replication","cells","duck IFITM1","robust expression of type","role of interferon","disruption of IFITM2 expression","knockdown of endogenous IFITM1","Avian Tembusu virus","immune response","triggered host","duck tissues","Similar results","inducible transmembrane proteins","increasing IFITM proteins","specific shRNA","MDA5","significant economic losses","obvious effect","useful strategy","IFITMs","pathogenic flavivirus","studies","ISGs","Chinese poultry industry","TLR3-dependent","overexpression of chicken","stimulated genes","IFNs","previous experiments","little information","pathways","addition","DEF","study"],"language":"en"},

The outbreak containment strategies in China based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) appear to be effective2, but quantitative research is still needed to assess the efficacy of NPIs and their timings3. Using epidemiological and anonymised human movement data4,5, here we develop a modelling framework that uses daily travel networks to simulate different outbreak and intervention scenarios across China. We estimated that there were a total of 114,325 COVID-19 cases (interquartile range 76,776 - 164,576) in mainland China as of February 29, 2020. Without NPIs, the COVID-19 cases would likely have shown a 67-fold increase (interquartile range 44 - 94) by February 29, 2020, with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. The early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to have prevented more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but combined NPIs achieved the strongest and most rapid effect. The lifting of travel restrictions since February 17, 2020 does not appear to lead to an increase in cases across China if the social distancing interventions can be maintained, even at a limited level of 25% reduction on average through late April.

Crucial to adaptation is the degree of mixing of original, susceptible hosts, and novel hosts. An increase in the frequency of the original host has two opposing effects on adaptation: an increase in the supply of mutant pathogens with improved performance on the novel host [7\u20139]; and reduced selection to infect novel hosts, caused by fitness costs commonly observed to be associated with host switching [10\u201317]. The probability of disease emergence will therefore peak at intermediate frequencies of the original host. We tested these predictions by following the evolution of a virus grown under a range of different frequencies of susceptible (original) and resistant (novel) host bacteria. Viruses that evolved to infect resistant hosts were only detected when susceptible hosts were at frequencies between 0.1% and 1%. Subsequent experiments supported the predictions that there was reduced selection and mutation supply at higher and lower frequencies, respectively. These results suggest that adaptation to novel hosts can occur only under very specific ecological conditions, and that small changes in contact rates between host species might help to mitigate disease emergence.","publish_time":"2009-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Benmayor, Rebecca; Hodgson, David J.; Perron, Gabriel G.; Buckling, Angus","journal":"Current Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13bea4e60e6161f1132a83bc5ed2b3bceab1e05e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126095.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19375316/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960982209008276; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2009.03.023; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982209008276","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs0NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel hosts","susceptible hosts","original host","resistant hosts","host species","host bacteria","parasite adaptation","intermediate frequencies","lower frequencies","range of different frequencies of susceptible","increase","reduced selection","predictions","probability of disease emergence","mutation supply","ecological mechanisms","supply of mutant pathogens","specific ecological conditions","small changes","improved performance","Summary Recent cases of emergent diseases","contact rates","degree of mixing","opposing effects","fitness costs","frequency","results","Subsequent experiments","evolution","Viruses"],"language":"en"},

In order to gain insight into the molecular basis of protease cleavage and its impact on the efficiency of viral entry, we investigated the susceptibility of a recombinant native full-length S-protein trimer (triSpike) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) to cleavage by various airway proteases. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Purified triSpike proteins were readily cleaved in vitro by three different airway proteases: trypsin, plasmin and TMPRSS11a. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and amino acid sequencing analyses identified two arginine residues (R667 and R797) as potential protease cleavage site(s). The effect of protease-dependent enhancement of SARS-CoV infection was demonstrated with ACE2 expressing human bronchial epithelial cells 16HBE. Airway proteases regulate the infectivity of SARS-CoV in a fashion dependent on previous receptor binding. The role of arginine residues was further shown with mutant constructs (R667A, R797A or R797AR667A). Mutation of R667 or R797 did not affect the expression of S-protein but resulted in a differential efficacy of pseudotyping into SARS-CoVpp. The R667A SARS-CoVpp mutant exhibited a lack of virus entry enhancement following protease treatment. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that SARS S-protein is susceptible to airway protease cleavage and, furthermore, that protease mediated enhancement of virus entry depends on specific conformation of SARS S-protein upon ACE2 binding. These data have direct implications for the cell entry mechanism of SARS-CoV along the respiratory system and, furthermore expand the possibility of identifying potential therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV.","publish_time":"2009-11-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kam, Yiu-Wing; Okumura, Yuushi; Kido, Hiroshi; Ng, Lisa F.

Abstract Kawasaki disease is a systemic vasculitis of unknow etiology that occurs predominantly in children under the age of 5 years. Kawasaki disease is the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children in the developed world. The exact cause has not yet been established but there is considerable support for it to be due to an infectious agent. The diagnosis of Kawasaki disease is based in clinical criteria: fever persisting at least 5 days and the presence of at least 4 principal features: changes of extremities, polymorphous exanthem, bilateral bulbar conjunctival injection without exudate, changes in lips and oral cavity and cervical lymphadenopathy\u003E1.5cm, usually unilateral. The most common complication is coronary arterial aneurysm and coronay arterial dilatation that occurs in 20-25% untreated children. Standard treatment for Kawasaki disease include intravenous immunoglobulin as a single 2g/kg dose within the first 10 days and oral acetilsalycilic acid.

This article will also discuss that, because of the genetic and immunologic similarity to humans, autoimmune models of MS in non-human primates are the experimental models \u201Cpar excellence\u201D to test this hypothesis.","publish_time":"2001-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u2019t Hart, Bert A; Brok, Herbert P.M; Amor, Sandra; Bontrop, Ronald E","journal":"Human Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c94b3e200b69db937ef56c8eb4035e179e6f93a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7135550.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198885901003469; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0198885901003469","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HLA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HLA class","non-MHC genes","influence of HLA genes","autoimmune models of MS","hypothesis","article","non-human primates","human leukocyte antigen","sum of multiple antigen","experimental models","disease susceptibility","immune system","receptor molecules","significant influence","T-cell interactions","central nervous system","Abstract Multiple sclerosis","chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease","humans","FcR","APC","candidate polymorphic major histocompatibility complex","immunologic similarity","TCR","par excellence","cytokines","chemokines","effector","risk"],"language":"en"},

Herein we conceptualize hospital surge elements, and lessons learnt from such events, to help build appropriately matched responses to future ID surge threats. METHODS: We used the Interpretive Descriptive qualitative approach. Interviews (n = 35) were conducted with governance and public health specialists; hospital based staff; and General Practitioners. Key policy literature in tandem with the interview data were used to iteratively generate a Hospital ID Surge framework. We anchored our narrative account within this framework, which is used to structure our analysis. RESULTS: A spectrum of surge threats from combinations of capacity (for crowding) and capability (for treatment complexity) demands were identified. Starting with the Pyramid scenario, or an influx of high screening rates flooding Emergency Departments, alongside fewer and manageable admissions; the Reverse-Pyramid occurs when few cases are screened and admitted but those that are, are complex; during a \u2018Black\u2019 scenario, the system is overburdened by both crowding and complexity. The Singapore hospital system is highly adapted to crowding, functioning remarkably well at constant near-full capacity in Peacetime and resilient to Endemic surges. We catalogue 26 strategies from lessons learnt relating to staffing, space, supplies and systems, crystalizing institutional memory. The DECIDE model advocates linking these strategies to types of surge threats and offers a step-by-step guide for coordinating outbreak planning and response. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of a shared definition and decision making of surge threats had rendered the procedures somewhat duplicative. This burden was paradoxically exacerbated by a health system that highly prizes planning and forward thinking, but worked largely in silo until an ID crisis hit. Many such lessons can be put into play to further strengthen our current hospital governance and adapted to more diverse settings.","publish_time":"2017-09-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, Shweta R.; Coker, Richard; Vrijhoef, Hubertus J-M; Leo, Yee Sin; Chow, Angela; Lim, Poh Lian; Tan, Qinghui; Chen, Mark I-Cheng; Hildon, Zoe Jane-Lara","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2dcb2c53f12e45bb92c07e5b47d82dbe495bede9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5584534.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28870193/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-017-2552-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsxMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["General Practitioners"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Hospital ID Surge framework","hospital surge elements","future ID surge threats","spectrum of surge threats","Singapore hospital system","Hospital usage","health system","current hospital governance","lessons","crowding","ID crisis","outbreak planning","strategies","Pyramid scenario","public health specialists","combinations of capacity","Reverse-Pyramid","treatment complexity","Emergency Departments","service demand","fewer","influx of high screening rates","manageable admissions","Infectious Disease","shared definition","matched responses","step-by-step guide","tandem","Peacetime","capability","decision","systems","Key policy literature","Lack","BACKGROUND","staffing","prizes","Interpretive Descriptive qualitative approach","interview data","Endemic surges","CONCLUSIONS","forward thinking","demands","space","silo","General Practitioners","different ways","play","procedures","RESULTS","diverse settings","institutional memory","METHODS","narrative account","model advocates","cases","constant","events","Interviews","burden","analysis"],"language":"en"},

Importantly, CoVs have been shown to cross species barriers and have emerged from animal reservoirs to infect humans and cause severe disease. The CoV responsible for an outbreak of severe acute respiratory disease (SARS-CoV) in 2002\u201303 likely originated as a bat coronavirus which, during replication in an intermediate host (such as the palm civet), evolved to be able to infect humans efficiently. SARS-CoV infected over 8000 people with approximately 10% mortality rate before it was controlled by public health measures of isolation of infected individuals and contacts. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), first reported in 2012, is likely transmitted from camels to humans with potentially fatal consequences.

We carried out a randomised controlled cross-over study to compare the efficacy of such a mask (Totobobo, Dream Lab One Pte Ltd, Singapore) with fit-tested N95 masks (1860 or 1860s or 1862; 3M, St Paul, MN, USA) in 22 healthy volunteers.

This paper presents evidence to suggest that strategic decision-making following a shock event involves a more intuitive, less analytical and less consultative approach, while decision-making in a stable environment is characterised by a more cooperative, formal and analytical process. Decision-making following a shock event tends to be simplified and fast, whereas decision-making in a stable environment tends to be comprehensive and slow. Furthermore, the strategic role of the board transforms following a shock event from a limited involvement in strategy setting to a strong involvement in the setting of strategy.

Among the taxa capable to adapt to urban landscapes, bats are particularly ubiquitous. Brazil has one of the world\u2019s largest diversity of bat species and one of the highest urbanization rates of the world. Yet, few studies have synthesized the biology of bats in urban environments, especially in Brazil. To fill this gap, we systematically reviewed the published scientific literature on the bat fauna found in urban areas of Brazil. The knowledge of urban bats is still incipient and heterogeneously spatially distributed, mostly concentrated in the southeastern region of the country. The assembled list of 84 urban species, of which nineteen are new species records for urban areas (including one new family), represents 47% of the bat richness registered in the country. Thirty-one bat species (37%) were captured exclusively inside forest fragments. Moreover, we provide information on the resources used within the urban matrix by summarizing the roosting sites for 38 bat species, as well as 31 plants consumed by at least twelve bat species. Regarding parasitological aspects, we listed eleven zoonotic parasites hosted by 27 bat species and discussed their potential to become a public health threat. Likewise, we considered the different features linked to urbanization, including impacts on immunity, body condition and susceptibility to acquiring parasites, as possible bat conservation issues. Finally, we defined an agenda for bat studies in urban areas of Brazil.

In the absence of an effective vaccine, inhibitor repurposing or de novo drug design may offer a longer-term strategy to combat this and future infections due to similar viruses. Here, we report on detailed classical and mix-solvent molecular dynamics simulations of the main protease (Mpro) enriched by evolutionary and stability analysis of the protein. The results were compared with those for a highly similar SARS Mpro protein. In spite of a high level of sequence similarity, the active sites in both proteins show major differences in both shape and size indicating that repurposing SARS drugs for COVID-19 may be futile. Furthermore, analysis of the binding site\u2019s conformational changes during the simulation time indicates its flexibility and plasticity, which dashes hopes for rapid and reliable drug design. Conversely, structural stability of the protein with respect to flexible loop mutations indicates that the virus\u2019 mutability will pose a further challenge to the rational design of small-molecule inhibitors. However, few residues contribute significantly to the protein stability and thus can be considered as key anchoring residues for Mpro inhibitor design.","publish_time":"2020-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bz\u00F3wka, Maria; Mitusi\u0144ska, Karolina; Raczy\u0144ska, Agata; Samol, Aleksandra; Tuszy\u0144ski, Jack A.; G\u00F3ra, Artur","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d3d536de77577af8dbf3067883990ff6d17faa8.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ba8c0cedec178e277d0e79d7b12509fb32b6fac1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.968008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsyMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein stability","Mpro inhibitor design","similar SARS Mpro protein","stability analysis","novo drug design","reliable drug design","inhibitor repurposing","rational design of small","structural stability","repurposing SARS drugs","similar viruses","rapid rate","key anchoring residues","mix-solvent molecular dynamics simulations","simulation time","active sites","main protease","size","shape","respect","binding site\u2019s conformational changes","major differences","flexible loop mutations","high level of sequence similarity","proteins","longer-term strategy","future infections","effective vaccine","plasticity","challenge","molecule inhibitors","COVID","novel coronavirus","outbreak","place","spite","mutability","flexibility","absence","results"],"language":"en"},

Nevertheless, C3 can efficiently enter intact cells, including neurons, but the mechanism of C3 binding and uptake is not yet understood. Previously, we identified the intermediate filament vimentin as an extracellular membranous interaction partner of C3. However, uptake of C3 into cells still occurs (although reduced) in the absence of vimentin, indicating involvement of an additional host cell receptor. C3 harbors an Arg\u2013Gly\u2013Asp (RGD) motif, which is the major integrin-binding site, present in a variety of integrin ligands. To check whether the RGD motif of C3 is involved in binding to cells, we performed a competition assay with C3 and RGD peptide or with a monoclonal antibody binding to \u03B21-integrin subunit and binding assays in different cell lines, primary neurons, and synaptosomes with C3-RGD mutants. Here, we report that preincubation of cells with the GRGDNP peptide strongly reduced C3 binding to cells. Moreover, mutation of the RGD motif reduced C3 binding to intact cells and also to recombinant vimentin. Anti-integrin antibodies also lowered the C3 binding to cells. Our results indicate that the RGD motif of C3 is at least one essential C3 motif for binding to host cells and that integrin is an additional receptor for C3 besides vimentin.","publish_time":"2017-10-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rohrbeck, Astrid; H\u00F6ltje, Markus; Adolf, Andrej; Oms, Elisabeth; Hagemann, Sandra; Ahnert-Hilger, Gudrun; Just, Ingo","journal":"J Biol Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e1be35b4c835e9b982fe494d2d0b6e3fb1622d2e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5663871.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28882889/; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m117.798231","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsyMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["C3","RGD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reduced C3 binding","mechanism of C3 binding","RGD motif of C3","uptake of C3","C3-RGD mutants","essential C3 motif","cell-binding","binding assays","host cells","intact cells","preincubation of cells","major integrin-binding site","monoclonal antibody binding","RGD peptide","extracellular membranous interaction partner of C3","Rho ADP-ribosylating C3 exoenzyme","recombinant vimentin","absence of vimentin","\u03B21-integrin subunit","variety of integrin ligands","Anti-integrin antibodies","additional host cell receptor","additional receptor","intermediate filament vimentin","different cell lines","GRGDNP peptide","primary neurons","C3bot","involvement","synaptosomes","bacterial protein toxin devoid","Gly","competition assay","Asp","Arg","translocation domain","mutation","results"],"language":"en"},

Grey literature, PubMed. and Scopus were searched using specific terms. Most of the available data identified through the systematic literature review concerned entry screening measures at airports. Little evidence is available about entry and exit screening measure implementation and effectiveness at ports and ground crossings. Exit screening was part of the World Health Organisation\u2019s (WHO) temporary recommendations for implementation in certain points of entry, for specific time periods. Exit screening measures for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in the three most affected West African countries did not identify any cases and showed zero sensitivity and very low specificity. The percentages of confirmed cases identified out of the total numbers of travelers that passed through entry screening measures in various countries worldwide for Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) and EVD in West Africa were zero or extremely low. Entry screening measures for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) did not detect any confirmed SARS cases in Australia, Canada, and Singapore. Despite the ineffectiveness of entry and exit screening measures, authors reported several important concomitant positive effects that their impact is difficult to assess, including discouraging travel of ill persons, raising awareness, and educating the traveling public and maintaining operation of flights from/to the affected areas. Exit screening measures in affected areas are important and should be applied jointly with other measures including information strategies, epidemiological investigation, contact tracing, vaccination, and quarantine to achieve a comprehensive outbreak management response. Based on review results, an algorithm about decision-making for entry/exit screening was developed.","publish_time":"2019-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mouchtouri, Varvara A.; Christoforidou, Eleni P.; an der Heiden, Maria; Menel Lemos, Cinthia; Fanos, Margherita; Rexroth, Ute; Grote, Ulrike; Belfroid, Evelien; Swaan, Corien; Hadjichristodoulou, Christos","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6926871.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16234638; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31766548/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsyNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organisation","Ebola Virus Disease","Influenza Pandemic"],"locations":["West Africa","Canada"],"keyphrases":["entry screening measures","exit screening","ineffectiveness of entry","screening measure implementation","certain points of entry","systematic literature review","affected areas","confirmed SARS cases","EVD","review results","affected West African countries","Grey literature","percentages of confirmed cases","various countries","published evidence","available data","Little evidence","specific terms","low specificity","total numbers of travelers","specific time periods","important concomitant positive effects","authors","temporary recommendations","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","epidemiological investigation","H1N1","decision-making","Influenza Pandemic","awareness","quarantine","tracing","guidelines","impact","Australia","Canada","Ebola Virus Disease","algorithm","information strategies","discouraging travel of ill persons","World Health Organisation\u2019s","experiences","traveling public","vaccination","practices","operation of flights","scoping search","comprehensive outbreak management response","airports","ground crossings","sensitivity","insight","years","Singapore","Scopus","PubMed"],"language":"en"},

Once infected, HSV-1 can remain latent in the host for a lifetime and be reactivated in patients with a compromised immune system. Reactivation of latent HSV-1 can also be achieved by other stimuli. Though acyclovir (ACV) is a classic drug for HSV-1 infection, ACV-resistant strains have been found in immune-compromised patients and drug toxicity has also been commonly reported. Therefore, there is an urge to search for new anti-HSV-1 agents. Natural products with potential anti-HSV-1 activity have the advantages of minimal side effects, reduced toxicity, and they exert their effect by various mechanisms. This paper will not only provide a reference for the safe dose of these agents if they are to be used in humans, referring to the interrelated data obtained from in vitro experiments, but also introduce the main pharmacodynamic mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) against HSV-1. Taken together, TCM functions as a potential source for HSV-1 therapy by direct (blocking viral attachment/absorption/penetration/replication) or indirect (reducing the susceptibility to HSV-1 or regulating autophagy) antiviral activities. The potential of these active components in the development of anti-HSV-1 drugs will also be described.","publish_time":"2018-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Wen; Wang, Xiao-Hua; Luo, Zhuo; Liu, Li-Fang; Yan, Chang; Yan, Chang-Yu; Chen, Guo-Dong; Gao, Hao; Duan, Wen-Jun; Kurihara, Hiroshi; Li, Yi-Fang; He, Rong-Rong","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/77dc3c4e78b6fe5c233613de24779897f673bb9c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6213986.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms19103266; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30347851/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjszMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TCM","HSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["potential anti-HSV","development of anti-HSV","new anti-HSV","Reactivation of latent HSV","potential source","immune-compromised patients","drug toxicity","agents","compromised immune system","classic drug","reduced toxicity","TCM functions","common virus","various mechanisms","estimated infection rate","ACV-resistant strains","Herpes simplex virus type","main pharmacodynamic mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicine","therapy","viral attachment","penetration","absorption","advantages of minimal","activity","active components","replication","effects","Natural products","reference","interrelated data","experiments","safe dose","lifetime","autophagy","urge","drugs","antiviral activities","humans","host","acyclovir","susceptibility","adult population","paper","stimuli"],"language":"en"},

Although the initial reports showed dismal prognosis, recent data suggest that an increased number of patients with solid and hematological malignancies benefit from intensive care support, with dramatically decreased mortality rates. Advances in the management of the underlying malignancies and support of organ dysfunctions have led to survival gains in patients with life-threatening complications from the malignancy itself, as well as infectious and toxic adverse effects related to the oncological treatments. In this review, we will appraise the prognostic factors and discuss the overall perspective related to the management of critically ill patients with cancer. The prognostic significance of certain factors has changed over time. For example, neutropenia or autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) have less adverse prognostic implications than two decades ago. Similarly, because hematologists and oncologists select patients for ICU admission based on the characteristics of the malignancy, the underlying malignancy rarely influences short-term survival after ICU admission. Since the recent data do not clearly support the benefit of ICU support to unselected critically ill allogeneic BMT recipients, more outcome research is needed in this subgroup. Because of the overall increased survival that has been reported in critically ill patients with cancer, we outline an easy-to-use and evidence-based ICU admission triage criteria that may help avoid depriving life support to patients with cancer who can benefit.

Pre- and postfusion structures of viral fusion proteins have been characterized, but conformational changes between them remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the intermediate conformation of the murine coronavirus fusion protein, called the spike protein, which must be cleaved by a cellular protease following receptor binding. Western blot analysis of protease digestion products revealed that two subunits (67 and 69 kDa) are produced from a single spike protein (180 kDa). These two subunits were considered to be by-products derived from conformational changes and were useful for probing the intermediate conformation of the spike protein. Interaction with a heptad repeat (HR) peptide revealed that these subunits adopt packed and unpacked conformations, respectively, and two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed a trimeric assembly. Based on biochemical observations, we propose an asymmetric trimer model for the intermediate structure of the spike protein. Receptor binding induces the membrane-binding potential of the trimer, in which at least one HR motif forms a packed-hairpin structure, while membrane fusion subunits are covered by the receptor-binding subunit, thereby preventing the spike protein from forming the typical homotrimeric prehairpin structure predicted by the current model of class I viral fusion protein. Subsequent proteolysis induces simultaneous packing of the remaining unpacked HRs upon assembly of three HRs at the central axis to generate a six-helix bundle. Our model proposes a key mechanism for membrane fusion of enveloped viruses. IMPORTANCE Recent studies using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) revealed the mechanism underlying activation of viral fusion protein at the priming stage. However, characterizing the subsequent triggering stage underpinning transition from pre- to postfusion structures is difficult because single-particle cryoEM excludes unstable structures that appear as heterogeneous shapes. Therefore, population-based biochemical analysis is needed to capture features of unstable proteins. Here, we analyzed protease digestion products of a coronavirus fusion protein during activation; their sizes appear to be affected directly by the conformational state. We propose a model for the viral fusion protein in the intermediate state, which involves a compact structure and conformational changes that overcome steric hindrance within the three fusion protein subunits.","publish_time":"2019-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kawase, Miyuki; Kataoka, Michiyo; Shirato, Kazuya; Matsuyama, Shutoku","journal":"Journal of Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/59346a784647136a6502277e4c78cf912c551e8f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6744234.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00785-19; https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/93/19/e00785-19.full.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315988/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjszNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fusion protein subunits","activation of viral fusion protein","single spike protein","murine coronavirus fusion protein","membrane fusion subunits","postfusion structures of viral fusion proteins","membrane fusion of enveloped viruses","intermediate structure","receptor binding","conformational changes","intermediate conformation","intermediate state","conformational state","membrane-binding potential","receptor-binding subunit","compact structure","unstable structures","cellular protease","single-particle cryoEM","packed-hairpin structure","asymmetric trimer model","current model of class","biochemical analysis","kDa","Western blot analysis of protease digestion products","typical homotrimeric prehairpin structure","remaining unpacked HRs","surface of enveloped viruses","subsequent triggering stage","features of unstable proteins","single-particle cryo-electron microscopy","key mechanism","unpacked conformations","HR motif","cellular membranes","priming stage","Subsequent proteolysis","trimeric assembly","biochemical observations","simultaneous packing","transition","steric hindrance","peptide","IMPORTANCE Recent studies","two-dimensional electrophoresis","heptad repeat","virus infection","Interaction","central axis","heterogeneous shapes","by-products","sizes","population","helix bundle"],"language":"en"},

Many inanimate surfaces can act as a reservoir for infection, and adequate disinfection is difficult to achieve and requires direct intervention. In this study we demonstrate the preparation and performance of materials with inherent photodynamic, surface-active, persistent antimicrobial properties through the incorporation of photosensitizers into high density poly(ethylene) (HDPE) using hot-melt extrusion, which require no external intervention except a source of visible light. Our aim is to prevent bacterial adherence to these surfaces and eliminate them as reservoirs of nosocomial pathogens, thus presenting a valuable advance in infection control. A two-layer system with one layer comprising photosensitizer-incorporated HDPE, and one layer comprising HDPE alone is also described to demonstrate the versatility of our approach. The photosensitizer-incorporated materials are capable of reducing the adherence of viable bacteria by up to 3.62 Log colony forming units (CFU) per square centimeter of material surface for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and by up to 1.51 Log CFU/cm(2) for Escherichia coli.

No phytotoxic activity was observed in the treated plants and environmental toxicology showed that this new acetone extract was environmentally friendly, indicating that this acetone extract has potential application in the control of plant virus in the future.","publish_time":"2015-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Lei; Feng, Chaohong; Hou, Caiting; Hu, Lingyun; Wang, Qiaochun; Wu, Yunfeng","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3118aa53f6b7e539049e2a52e973f4124ba121e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4337905.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0117496; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25705894/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs0Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rice"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new acetone extract","novel acetone extract","extract mixture","control of plant virus","plant viruses","Rice stripe virus","plant-viruses activity","Tobacco mosaic virus","anti-TMV","Southern rice black streaked dwarf virus","phytotoxic activity","different geographic distributions","different host varieties","RSV","broad spectrum of","cottonseed oil sludge","nuclear magnetic resonance","environmental toxicology","commercial agent Ningnanmycin","potential application","SRBSDV","treated plants","field trials","NMR","assay","effects","\u03B2-sitosterol","future","Gossypol"],"language":"en"},

These viruses have also contributed internal genes to H5N1, H5N6, H7N9, and H10N8 viruses, which have been isolated from humans with infections and are a substantial public health threat. To investigate the potential pathogenic mechanism of the H9N2 virus, we performed serial lung-to-lung passage of an avirulent H9N2 avian influenza virus (A/Chicken/Shandong/416/2016 [SD/416]) in mice to increase the pathogenicity of this virus. We generated a mouse-adapted (MA) virus that exhibited increased viral titers in the lungs, caused severe lung damage in mice, and induced body weight loss in mice; however, the avirulent parental virus did not cause any clinical symptoms in infected mice. Global gene expression analysis was performed and indicated that the transcriptional responses of these viruses were distinct. The lungs of mice infected with the MA virus exhibited the downregulation of genes related to innate immunity and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, which was not seen in infections with the avirulent parental virus. These data indicated that the MA virus might evade immune surveillance and changed its replication capacity to increase the viral replication level and pathogenicity. Our study demonstrates that host factors play an important role in the adaptive evolution of influenza virus in new hosts.

With the widespread implementation of advanced life-support techniques in emergency medical services (EMS), orotracheal intubation is now performed not only by professional practitioners but, in many occasions, nonprofessionals. With extensively diversified skill equipped, we tested whether the Sunscope, a patented tracheal intubation device with a digital display, is able to facilitate tracheal intubation by na\u00EFve EMS personnel with various training backgrounds. METHODS: We conducted a study to determine rate of success and time required to insert an orotracheal tube into a mannequin using Sunscope. The participants were placed into the professional group (i.e., anesthesiologists and emergency medical paramedics; EMT-P) or the nonprofessional group (i.e., emergency medical technicians; EMT). Intubation required three steps: equipment preparation, vocal cord exposure, and tube insertion. The time required for each step was recorded by a senior staff member, and the data were analyzed by nonparametric statistics. RESULTS: Each consecutive step in the operating procedure was significantly shorter for the professional group in comparison with the nonprofessional group during the first trial: equipment preparation, 10.5 \u00B1 2.1 vs. 11.9 \u00B1 4.1 seconds; vocal cord exposure, 7.4 \u00B1 7.7 vs. 12.2 \u00B1 7.7 seconds; tube insertion, 8.8 \u00B1 4.8 vs. 17.6 \u00B1 9.4 seconds; and total time required for intubation, 26.7 \u00B1 8.8 vs. 35.8 \u00B1 19.6 seconds. The professional practitioners showed no significant improvement, in terms of time reduction, on the following three trials. On the other hand, the nonprofessional practitioners showed no significant differences, in terms of time required to expose the vocal cords and total operation time, following the third trial in comparison with the professional practitioners. CONCLUSION: Our research demonstrates that professional practitioners are able to use the Sunscope on their first attempt. Despite a lack of training in conventional endotracheal intubation, emergency medical technicians (EMT-I and -II) were able to complete intubation on their first attempt; a significant reduction in the time required to intubate was noted after repeated practice. All levels of na\u00EFve EMTs were able to readily visualize the vocal cords through Sunscope and, thereby, reliably insert the endotracheal tube in less than 1 minute, regardless of their skills before testing.","publish_time":"2012-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Man-Ling; Dai, Chun-Yi; Huei-Ming Ma, Matthew; Chang, Kuan-Wu; Lin, Chih-Peng; Sun, Wei-Zen","journal":"Acta Anaesthesiol Taiwan","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c97ce1c773ff11d854ad04c5dac65e20dad6c533.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102757.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1875459712000045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22500907/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aat.2012.02.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875459712000045","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs0NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EMS","EMT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["orotracheal intubation","total time","nonprofessional practitioners","Sunscope","seconds","terms of time reduction","nonprofessional group","emergency medical technicians","conventional endotracheal intubation","total operation time","emergency medical services","emergency medical paramedics","vocal cords","endotracheal tube","orotracheal tube","tube insertion","patented tracheal intubation device","vocal cord exposure","significant reduction","EMT-P","significant improvement","significant differences","equipment preparation","comparison","attempt","na\u00EFve EMS personnel","lack of training","consecutive step","various training backgrounds","levels of na\u00EFve EMTs","widespread implementation of advanced life-support techniques","proper technique","digital display","anesthesiologists","data","Effective airway management","steps","operating procedure","research","senior staff member","study","appropriate devices","OBJECTIVE","rate of success","minute","occasions","mannequin","skills","nonparametric statistics","RESULTS","trials","CONCLUSION","hand","participants","diversified skill","testing","METHODS","nonprofessionals","practice"],"language":"en"},

Following clinical malaria episodes, children had short-lived, sequence-independent increases in average whole-protein seroreactivity, as well as strain-specific responses to peptides representing diverse epitopes. Vaccination resulted in dramatically increased seroreactivity to all 263 AMA1 whole-protein variants. High-density peptide analysis revealed that vaccinated children had increases in seroreactivity to four distinct epitopes that exceeded responses to natural infection. A single amino acid change was critical to seroreactivity to peptides in a region of AMA1 associated with strain-specific vaccine efficacy.

Little is understood regarding how specific thymine residues are targeted for J-modification or the mechanism of J regulated transcription termination. To identify proteins involved in J-synthesis, we expressed a tagged version of the J-glucosyltransferase (JGT) in Leishmania tarentolae, and identified four co-purified proteins by mass spectrometry: protein phosphatase (PP1), a homolog of Wdr82, a potential PP1 regulatory protein (PNUTS) and a protein containing a J-DNA binding domain (named JBP3). Gel shift studies indicate JBP3 is a J-DNA binding protein. Reciprocal tagging, co-IP and sucrose gradient analyses indicate PP1, JGT, JBP3, Wdr82 and PNUTS form a multimeric complex in kinetoplastids, similar to the mammalian PTW/PP1 complex involved in transcription termination via PP1 mediated dephosphorylation of Pol II. Using RNAi and analysis of Pol II termination by RNA-seq and RT-PCR, we demonstrate that ablation of PNUTS, JBP3 and Wdr82 lead to defects in Pol II termination at the 3\u2019-end of polycistronic gene arrays in Trypanosoma brucei. Mutants also contain increased antisense RNA levels upstream of transcription start sites, suggesting an additional role of the complex in regulating termination of bi-directional transcription. In addition, PNUTS loss causes derepression of silent Variant Surface Glycoprotein genes involved in host immune evasion.

However, the effects of the national quality improvement (QI) program remain unknown in China. METHODS: A national ICU QI program was implemented in a controlled cohort of 586 hospitals from 2016 to 2018. The effects of the QI program on critical care quality were comprehensively investigated. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 81,461,554 patients were enrolled in 586 hospitals, and 1,587,724 patients were admitted to the ICU over 3 years. In 2018, there was a significantly higher number of ICU beds (2016 vs. 2018: 10668 vs. 13,661, P = 0.0132) but a lower doctor-to-bed ratio (2016 vs. 2018: 0.64 (0.50, 0.83) vs. 0.60 (0.45, 0.75), P = 0.0016) and nurse-to-bed ratio (2016 vs. 2018: 2.00 (1.64, 2.50) vs. 2.00 (1.50, 2.40), P = 0.031) than in 2016. Continuous and significant improvements in the ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) incidence rate, microbiology detection rate before antibiotic use and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis rate were associated with the implementation of the QI program (VAP incidence rate (per 1000 ventilator-days), 2016 vs. 2017 vs. 2018: 11.06 (4.23, 22.70) vs. 10.20 (4.25, 23.94) vs. 8.05 (3.13, 17.37), P = 0.0002; microbiology detection rate before antibiotic use (%), 2016 vs. 2017 vs. 2018: 83.91 (49.75, 97.87) vs. 84.14 (60.46, 97.24) vs. 90.00 (69.62, 100), P \u003C 0.0001; DVT prophylaxis rate, 2016 vs. 2017 vs. 2018: 74.19 (33.47, 96.16) vs. 71.70 (38.05, 96.28) vs. 83.27 (47.36, 97.77), P = 0.0093). Moreover, the 6-h SSC bundle compliance rates in 2018 were significantly higher than those in 2016 (6-h SSC bundle compliance rate, 2016 vs. 2018: 64.93 (33.55, 93.06) vs. 76.19 (46.88, 96.67)). A significant change trend was not found in the ICU mortality rate from 2016 to 2018 (ICU mortality rate (%), 2016 vs. 2017 vs. 2018: 8.49 (4.42, 14.82) vs. 8.95 (4.89, 15.70) vs. 9.05 (5.12, 15.80), P = 0.1075).

It has been recommend as an assessment tool that allows anesthetic providers in developing countries to assess their compliance and needs. This study was performed to describe the anesthesia service in one main public hospital during an 8-month medical mission in Cambodia and evaluate its anesthetic safety issues according to the ISSPA. METHODS: We conduct a retrospective study involving 1953 patients at the Preah Ket Mealea hospital. Patient demographics, anesthetic techniques, and complications were reviewed according to the registers of the anesthetic services and questionnaires. The inadequacies in personnel, facilities, equipment, medications, and conduct of anesthesia drugs were recorded using a checklist based on the ISSPA. RESULTS: A total of 1792 patients received general and regional anesthesia in the operating room, while 161 patients receiving sedation for gastroscopy. The patients\u2019 mean age was 45.0 \u00B1 16.6 years (range, 17\u201387 years). The three most common surgical procedures were abdominal (52.0%; confidence interval [CI], 49.3\u201354.7), orthopedic (27.6%; CI, 25.2\u201329.9), and urological surgery (14.7%; CI, 12.8\u201316.6). General anesthesia, spinal anesthesia, and brachial plexus block were performed in 54.3% (CI, 51.7\u201356.8), 28.2% (CI, 25.9\u201330.5), and 9.4% (CI, 7.9\u201310.9) of patients, respectively. One death occurred. Twenty-six items related to professional aspects, monitoring, and conduct of anesthesia did not meet the ISSPA-recommended standards. A lack of commonly used drugs and monitoring equipment was noted, posing major threats to the safety of anesthesia practice, especially in emergency situations. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the scarce literature on anesthesia practice in low- and middle-income countries such as Cambodia. Future medical assistance should help to strengthen these countries\u2019 inadequacies, allowing for the adoption of international standards for the safe practice of anesthesia.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tao, Kun-ming; Sokha, Sann; Yuan, Hong-bin","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a922eaa280805167b036180a490bcb34de2b5c0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7068932.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7068932/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzUwNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["The International Standards","World Federation of Societies","World Health Organization"],"locations":["Cambodia"],"keyphrases":["General anesthesia","spinal anesthesia","regional anesthesia","anesthesia service","Safe Practice of Anesthesia","safety of anesthesia practice","conduct of anesthesia drugs","ISSPA-recommended standards","anesthetic providers","anesthetic techniques","anesthetic services","anesthetic safety issues","monitoring equipment","adoption of international standards","Cambodia","retrospective study","years","developing countries","middle-income countries","used drugs","countries\u2019 inadequacies","main public hospital","World Federation of Societies","World Health Organization","month medical mission","Future medical assistance","Preah Ket Mealea hospital","Anaesthesiologists","medications","operating room","scarce literature","major threats","brachial plexus block","registers","complications","personnel","facilities","professional aspects","behalf","Patient demographics","assessment tool","common surgical procedures","compliance","items","questionnaires","sedation","lack","confidence interval","total","emergency situations","checklist","patients\u2019 mean age","needs","METHODS","gastroscopy","RESULTS","range","urological surgery","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","death"],"language":"en"},

Each infant had two Sarnat examinations performed at \u003C6 h, one by a gold standard (GS) study investigator, and the second either by (a) another GS examiner or (b) an attending physician (28 examiners), all blinded to clinical variables. Agreement was calculated using kappa (k) statistics. RESULTS: One hundred and two (9, fetal acidosis) infants underwent a modified Sarnat examination.

The incidence of trauma-induced, moderate-to-severe hypoxaemia, according to the Berlin definition, could be as high as 45%. Its pathophysiology includes the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which propagate tissue injuries by triggering neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs include a DNA backbone coated with cytoplasmic proteins, which drive pulmonary cytotoxic effects. The structure of NETs and many DAMPs includes double-stranded DNA, which prevents their neutralization by plasma. Dornase alfa is a US Food and Drug Administration-approved recombinant DNase, which cleaves extracellular DNA and may therefore break up the backbone of NETs and DAMPs. Aerosolized dornase alfa was shown to reduce trauma-induced lung injury in experimental models and to improve arterial oxygenation in ventilated patients. METHODS: TRAUMADORNASE will be an institution-led, multicentre, double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial in ventilated trauma patients. The primary trial objective is to demonstrate a reduction in the incidence of moderate-to-severe hypoxaemia in severe trauma patients during the first 7 days from 45% to 30% by providing aerosolized dornase alfa as compared to placebo. The secondary objectives are to demonstrate an improvement in lung function and a reduction in morbidity and mortality. Randomization of 250 patients per treatment arm will be carried out through a secure, web-based system. Statistical analyses will include a descriptive step and an inferential step using fully Bayesian techniques. The study was approved by both the Agence Nationale de la S\u00E9curit\u00E9 du M\u00E9dicament et des Produits de Sant\u00E9 (ANSM, on 5 October 2018) and a National Institutional Review Board (CPP, on 6 November 2018). Participant recruitment began in March 2019. Results will be published in international peer-reviewed medical journals. DISCUSSION: If early administration of inhaled dornase alfa actually reduces the incidence of moderate-to-severe hypoxaemia in patients with severe trauma, this new therapeutic strategy may be easily implemented in many clinical trauma care settings. This treatment may facilitate ventilator weaning, reduce the burden of trauma-induced lung inflammation and facilitate recovery and rehabilitation in severe trauma patients.

Abundant expression and secretion of lactoferrin, in particular in milk and fluids of the digestive tract, are related to its implication in the first line of host defense. Lactoferrin is also a prominent component of the secondary granules of neutrophils (PMNs) and is released in infected tissues and blood during the inflammatory process. In addition to its direct antimicrobial properties, the abilities of lactoferrin to regulate the immune response and to protect against infection and septic shock have been described in numerous in vitro and in vivo studies. Although the cellular and molecular mechanisms that account for the modulation of the inflammatory and immune responses by lactoferrin are not yet totally elucidated, many are now established. At the cellular level, lactoferrin modulates the migration, maturation and function of immune cells. At the molecular level and in addition to iron binding, interactions of lactoferrin with a plethora of compounds, either soluble or membrane molecules, account for its modulatory properties. This paper reviews our current understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that explain the regulatory properties of lactoferrin in host defence.","publish_time":"2005-11-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Legrand, D.; Elass, E.; Carpentier, M.; Mazurier, J.","journal":"Cell Mol Life Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e343a37eb39d557f599901a6cc63135adcdc13c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079806/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzU1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["interactions of lactoferrin","abilities of lactoferrin","secretion of lactoferrin","regulatory properties of lactoferrin","molecular mechanisms","molecular level","cellular level","iron binding","modulatory properties","immune responses","addition","account","iron-binding glycoprotein","direct antimicrobial properties","function of immune cells","inflammatory process","host defence","line of host defense","migration","membrane molecules","milk","maturation","modulation","secondary granules of neutrophils","prominent component","plethora of compounds","current understanding","fluids","PMNs","blood","infected tissues","infection","digestive tract","transferrin family","septic shock","implication","Abundant expression","paper","studies"],"language":"en"},

All eligible countries in the European Union and European Economic Area participated with energy and commitment. Indicators of preparedness were developed based on WHO planning guidance and these were set within a simple assessment which included a formal country visit. The procedure evolved considerably with field experience. As the complexity of pandemic preparedness was appreciated it changed from being a classical short external assessment to longer national self-assessments with demonstrable impact, especially when self-assessments were published. There were essential supporting activities undertaken including a series of pan-European pandemic preparedness workshops organised by EC, WHO-Euro, ECDC and countries holding the European Union Presidency. The self-assessments highlighted additional work and documentation that was needed by national authorities from the ECDC. This work was undertaken and the document produced. The benefits of the self-assessments were seen in the 2009 pandemic in that EU/EEA countries performed better than some others. A number of the guidance documents were updated to fit the specific features of the pandemic. However the pandemic revealed many weaknesses and brought new challenges for European countries, notably over communication and vaccines, the need to prepare for a variety of scenarios and to factor severity estimates into preparedness, to improve surveillance for severe disease and to deliver seroepidemiology. Any revised self-assessment procedure will need to respond to these challenges.","publish_time":"2010-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nicoll, A.","journal":"Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a0e5e8f999b67645d9e22bca35691a8878ad502.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7079977.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079977/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzYxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control","ECDC","EC","WHO Regional Office for Europe","European Economic Area","European Union Presidency","EU/EEA"],"locations":["European Union"],"keyphrases":["European countries","European pandemic preparedness workshops","European Centre","European Commission","complexity of pandemic preparedness","European Union Presidency","national self-assessments","European Economic Area","ECDC","EEA countries","eligible countries","Indicators of preparedness","revised self-assessment procedure","future influenza pandemic","Disease Prevention","simple assessment","additional work","Planning","need","effective risk prevention work","national authorities","classical short external assessment","severe disease","new challenges","guidance documents","series of pan","documentation","demonstrable impact","place","pandemics","Control","severity estimates","energy","surveillance","communication","weaknesses","formal country visit","Regional Office","essential supporting activities","commitment","variety of scenarios","Practise","vaccines","specific features","number","field experience","seroepidemiology","benefits"],"language":"en"},

PURPOSE: To provide direction for health care professionals in the preparation and management of emergency ICU situations during an influenza epidemic or mass disaster, standardize activities, and promote coordination and communication among the medical teams. METHODS: Based on a literature review and contributions of content experts, a list of essential categories for managing emergency situations in the ICU were identified. Based on three cycles of a modified Delphi process, consensus was achieved regarding the categories. A primary author along with an expert group drafted SOPs for each category. RESULTS: Based on the Delphi cycles, the following key topics were found to be important for emergency preparedness: triage, infrastructure, essential equipment, manpower, protection of staff and patients, medical procedures, hospital policy, coordination and collaboration with interface units, registration and reporting, administrative policies and education. CONCLUSIONS: The draft SOPs serve as benchmarks for emergency preparedness and response of ICUs to emergencies or outbreak of pandemics.","publish_time":"2010-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sprung, Charles L.; Cohen, Robert; Adini, Bruria","journal":"Intensive Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/795dee44eab7765b4c518eeb9d42efb57e4da233.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7079978.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079978/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzYxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emergency preparedness","emergency situations","management of emergency ICU situations","intensive care units","coordination","medical procedures","influenza epidemic","draft SOPs","Delphi cycles","mass disaster","health care professionals","list of essential categories","standard operating procedures","European Society of Intensive Care Medicine","essential equipment","interface units","expert group drafted SOPs","medical teams","modified Delphi process","patients","Task Force","preparation","hospital policy","reporting","contributions of content experts","registration","manpower","protection of staff","collaboration","response of ICUs","triage","infrastructure","literature review","emergencies","activities","benchmarks","following key topics","administrative policies","direction","category","consensus","communication","outbreak of pandemics","primary author"],"language":"en"},

Results from these investigations should be transferred to the pathologist to distinguish between infection-associated changes and transplant rejection.","publish_time":"2011-02-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Theegarten, D.; Anhenn, O.; M\u00FCller, K.-D.","journal":"Pathologe","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0af5763471d296f84b578992b648c760476d535.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7080147.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7080147/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzY3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["causal agent","organ transplantations","potential agents","different agents","inflammatory reaction","crucial role","fungi","parasites","cases","infection-associated changes","possible complications","additional microbiological diagnostics","bacteria","transplant rejection","concrete identification","pathologist","Viruses","Infections","relevance of individual diseases","investigations","Histology","Morphology"],"language":"en"},

The induced temperature rise generated at these exposure parameters, hereafter termed thermal gradient, was measured and applied independently to cell suspensions in order to differentiate inactivation triggered by electric field (E-field) from heating. Treated cell suspensions were plated and cellular inactivation was quantified by colony counts after a 24-hour (h) incubation period. Additionally, cells from both exposure conditions were incubated with various antibiotic-soaked discs to determine if nsPEF exposure would induce changes in antibiotic susceptibility. Results indicate that, for both species, the total delivered energy (amplitude, pulse number and pulse duration) determined the magnitude of cell inactivation. Specifically, for 18.5 and 23.5 kV cm(\u22121) exposures, L. acidophilus was more sensitive to the inactivation effects of nsPEF than E. coli, however, for the 13.5 kV cm(\u22121) exposures E. coli was more sensitive, suggesting that L. acidophilus may need to meet an E-field threshold before significant inactivation can occur. Results also indicate that antibiotic susceptibility was enhanced by multiple nsPEF exposures, as observed by increased zones of growth inhibition. Moreover, for both species, a temperature increase of \u2264 20 \u00B0C (89% of exposures) was not sufficient to significantly alter cell inactivation, whereas none of the thermal equivalent exposures were sufficient to change antibiotic susceptibility categories.","publish_time":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martens, Stacey L.; Klein, Savannah; Barnes, Ronald A.; TrejoSanchez, Patricia; Roth, Caleb C.; Ibey, Bennett L.","journal":"AMB Express","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c39ef825050419db56a87e17959c13f497ec48dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7080936.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7080936/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzY5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["magnitude of cell inactivation","cellular inactivation","significant inactivation","inactivation effects of nsPEF","multiple nsPEF exposures","Cell suspensions of Escherichia coli","Treated cell suspensions","kV","antibiotic susceptibility categories","thermal equivalent exposures","exposure parameters","pulse duration","exposure conditions","E-field threshold","pulse numbers","Lactobacillus acidophilus","species","Results","various antibiotic-soaked discs","electric fields","temperature increase","thermal gradient","induced temperature rise","nsPEFs","total delivered energy","varying amplitudes","hour","changes","increased zones of growth inhibition","order","hertz","Hz","repetition rate","incubation period","colony","sham","cells","heating"],"language":"en"},

Currently, there are limited data from middle-income countries analysing the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination in this population. We explored the clinical effects and economic benefits of expanding the current national influenza vaccination schedule in Mexico to include the school-aged population. METHODS: A static 1-year model incorporating herd effect was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of expanding the current national influenza vaccination schedule of Mexico to include the school-aged population. We performed a cross-sectional epidemiological study using influenza records (2009\u20132018), death records (2010\u20132015), and discharge and hospitalisation records (2010\u20132016), from the databases of Mexico\u2019s Influenza Surveillance System (SISVEFLU), the National Mortality Epidemiological and Statistical System (SEED), and the Automated Hospital Discharge System (SAEH), respectively. Cost estimates for influenza cases were based on 7 scenarios using data analysed from SISVEFLU; assumptions for clinical management of cases were defined according to Mexico\u2019s national clinical guidelines. The primary health outcome for this study was the number of influenza cases avoided. A sensitivity analysis was performed using conservative and optimistic parameters (vaccination coverage: 30% / 70%, Vaccine effectiveness: 19% / 68%). RESULTS: It was estimated that expanding the influenza immunisation programme to cover school-aged population in Mexico over the 2018\u20132019 influenza season would result in 671,461 cases of influenza avoided (50% coverage and 50% effectiveness assumed). Associated with this were 262,800 fewer outpatient consultations; 154,100 fewer emergency room consultations; 97,600 fewer hospitalisations, and 15 fewer deaths. Analysis of cases avoided by age-group showed that 55.4% of them were in the school-aged population, and the decrease in outpatient consultations was largest in this population. There was an overall decrease in the economic burden for the Mexican health care system of 111.9 million US dollars; the immunization programme was determined to be cost-saving in the base, conservative and optimistic scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccinating school-aged population in Mexico would be cost-effective; expansion of the current national vaccination schedule to this age group is supported.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Falc\u00F3n-Lezama, Jorge Abelardo; Saucedo-Mart\u00EDnez, Rodrigo; Betancourt-Cravioto, Miguel; Alfaro-Cortes, Myrna Mar\u00EDa; Bahena-Gonz\u00E1lez, Roberto Isaac; Tapia-Conyer, Roberto","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cdd4255b1f3494e224d67365ae72ad47bb428d34.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7085158.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7085158/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzY5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Influenza Surveillance System","National Mortality Epidemiological and Statistical System","Automated Hospital Discharge System"],"locations":["Mexico"],"keyphrases":["cases of influenza","influenza records","cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination","current national influenza vaccination schedule of Mexico","influenza season","number of influenza cases","current national vaccination schedule","Vaccinating school-aged population","influenza immunisation programme","vaccination coverage","databases of Mexico\u2019s Influenza Surveillance System","Analysis of cases","National Mortality Epidemiological","fewer outpatient consultations","Mexico\u2019s national clinical guidelines","clinical management of cases","fewer hospitalisations","Statistical System","fewer deaths","fewer emergency room consultations","SISVEFLU","Mexican health care system","Automated Hospital Discharge System","optimistic scenarios","age-group","age group","clinical effects","hospitalisation records","death records","cross-sectional epidemiological study","economic burden","economic benefits","optimistic parameters","overall decrease","immunization programme","limited data","sensitivity analysis","Cost estimates","Vaccine effectiveness","primary health outcome","SEED","expansion","US dollars","middle-income countries","assumptions","year model","herd effect","SAEH","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","METHODS","years","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

In this study, the altered genes expressions in the PBMC of convalescent SARS patients were investigated with suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH). We found that genes encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were obviously upregulated, while mitochondria were now found to be closely connected with antiviral immunity. The identification of a viral gene, M, in SSH cDNA library shows the long-term existence of SARS-CoV in vivo.

Phylogenetically, PCV2 can be divided into two major genotypic groups, PCV2-group 1 and PCV2-group 2. Whereas PCV2-group 1 isolates were detected in all the diseased animals, only two of the diseased animals harbored PCV2-group 2 isolates. This observation is important because PCV2-group 1 isolates had never been reported in the United States before (GenBank as of May 16, 2006), and they are closely related to the PCV2-group 1 isolates that have been described in Europe and Asia, previously.

It shares approximately 94% identity of nucleotide sequence with two recently reported North American strains, 16244B and VR2332, but only 78% with a European strain, Lelystad virus (LV). Its genome is the longest among the four published complete sequences of PRRSV, due to an insertion in the Nsp2-encoding region. Compared to Nsp2 of the North American strains and the European strain, the predicted Nsp2 of strain SP contains 36 and 155 amino acid insertions, respectively, near the C-terminus, in addition to several highly variable regions. The insertion shows no homology with any equivalent arterivirus proteins. This high sequence disparity of Nsp2 among different PRRSV isolates suggested that it could be used as a marker to differentiate PRRSV genotypes. The 5\u2032 RACE and primer extension analysis of three North American strains demonstrated that the utmost 5\u2032-end nucleotides are conserved among PRRSV strains isolated from two continents.

After the one-day group debriefing, participants showed significant decrease in depression level, as measured by Brief Symptom Inventory (Derogatis \u0026 Melisaratos, 1983, Psychological Medicine, 13(3), 595\u2013605) and changes in cognitive appraisal towards SARS. Such changes were sustained in a 1-month follow-up. Clinical implications and directions for further study were discussed.","publish_time":"2006-01-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ng, S.

Objectives: To determine whether the structural proteins M and N of SARS-CoV induce apoptosis. Study design: We investigated human pulmonary fibroblast (HPF) cells, were transfected with plasmids containing the M or N gene, by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), Hoechst 33342 staining for nuclei, and observation of morphology. Results: We found that in the absence of serum about 16.34% of cells transfected by pcDNA3.1-M and 21.72% of N-transfected cells showed typical apoptotic characteristics, significantly different from mock-transfected cells (only 6.23%, p\u003C0.01). Furthermore, the cells that were co-transfected with M and N proteins showed more obvious phenomena of cell death (about 36.03%). There was a statistical significance between M-transfected cells and co-transfected cells (p\u003C0.01), and a remarkable difference between N-transfected cells and co-transfected cells (p\u003C0.01). Conclusions: The results show that M and N proteins of SARS-CoV can induce apoptosis of HPF cells. Co-transfection of M and N enhances the induction of apoptosis by M or N alone, which also suggests that the structural proteins of SARS-CoV may play an important role not only in the process of invasion but also in the pathogenetic process in cells.","publish_time":"2006-07-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Gang; Shi, Shu-Qun; Yang, Ying; Peng, Jing-Pian","journal":"Cell Biol Toxicol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd996a0dd036e9453e23bef84300b51ffe0524ee.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087820/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzkxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Hoechst","HPF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["N-transfected cells","co-transfected cells","mock-transfected cells","N of SARS","N proteins of SARS","apoptosis of HPF cells","SARS-CoV","N gene","structural proteins of SARS","cell apoptosis","Co-transfection","induction of apoptosis","SARS-associated coronavirus","process of invasion","pathogenetic process","Results","important role","obvious phenomena of cell death","TUNEL","typical apoptotic characteristics","TdT-mediated dUTP nick end","human pulmonary fibroblast","nuclei","staining","Hoechst","remarkable difference","Study design","Background","plasmids","statistical significance","observation of morphology","absence of serum","Conclusions","Objectives","pcDNA3"],"language":"en"},

These records comprise 967 seizures including massive quantities of ivory, tiger skins, live reptiles, and other endangered wildlife and wildlife products. Most seizures originate in Southeast Asia, a recently identified hotspot for future emerging infectious diseases. To date, regulation and enforcement have been insufficient to effectively control the global trade in illegal wildlife at national and international scales.

Additional, we divide the post-infection process of AIDS disease into several sub-stages in order to facilitate the study of the dynamics in different development stages of epidemics. These features make the dynamics more complicated. We find that the epidemic in our model can generally end up in one of the two states: extinction and persistence, which is consistent with other researchers\u2019 work. Higher population density, higher mobility, higher number of infection source, and greater neighborhood are more likely to result in high levels of infections and in persistence.

The major biochemical abnormalities were hypokalemia (K(\u002B): 1.7 mmol/l) associated with high renal K(\u002B) wasting and metabolic alkalosis (HCO(3)(\u2212): 42.6 mmol/l). Low plasma renin activity, low aldosterone concentration, and normal cortisol concentration pointed to a state of pseudohyperaldosteronism. While reviewing his drug history, the patient revealed he had been consuming eight packs (100 ml/pack) of a Korean herbal tonic daily to treat his prostate cancer for the past 2 months. A significant amount of glycyrrhizic acid (0.23 mg/ml), an active ingredient of licorice, was detected in the tonic. Discontinuation of the herbal tonic along with KCl supplementation achieved recovery in 2 weeks.

We hypothesized that wild canids could be used as sentinels for the detection of regions with higher Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP) prevalence in wild and domestic animals. To test this hypothesis, we set up an ELISA to test 262 wolf (Canis lupus) and fox (Vulpes vulpes) sera for MAP-specific antibodies and processed a subset of samples for culture (n = 61), MAP-specific PCR (15) and histopathology (14). In wolves, the optical density (OD) values in the ELISA were continuously distributed. Ten fox sera (4%) had OD readings of over twice the mean, suggesting contact with mycobacteria. However, all samples tested by PCR were negative for both IS900 and ISMAP02 sequences, and samples cultured for MAP yielded no growth. No visible paratuberculosis or tuberculosis-compatible lesions were recorded. On histopathological examination, no lesions compatible with mycobacterial diseases were observed. These results suggest that wild canids show little or no evidence of paratuberculosis and are unlikely to be useful sentinels for the detection of MAP in Southwestern Europe.","publish_time":"2011-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sobrino, Raquel; Aurtenetxe, O.; Carta, Tania; Mamian, L.; Gerrikagoitia, X.; Balseiro, A.; Oleaga, A.; Sevilla, I.

In our concept-initiated studies, we defined the randomness as a cause for mutation, upon which we built a cause-mutation relationship, which is then switched into the classification problem because the occurrence and non-occurrence of mutations can be classified as unity and zero. Thereafter, we used the logistic regression and neural network to solve this classification problem to predict the mutation positions in hemagglutinins, and then used the amino acid mutating probability to predict the would-be-mutated amino acids.

The Luminex respiratory virus panel (RVP) assay has been shown to be comparable to or superior to culture/direct fluorescent-antibody assays (DFAs) and nucleic acid tests that are used to diagnose respiratory viral infections. We developed a multiplex asymmetric reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay that can simultaneously differentiate all influenza A virus epidemic subtypes. The amplified products were hybridized with an electrochemical DNA sensor, and the results were automatically acquired. The limits of detection (LoDs) of both the Luminex RVP assay and the multiplex RT-PCR-electrochemical DNA sensor were 10(1) TCID(50) for H1N1 virus and 10(2) TCID(50) for H3N2 virus. The specificity assessment of the multiplex RT-PCR-electrochemical DNA sensor showed no cross-reactivity among different influenza A subtypes or with other non-influenza respiratory viruses. In total, 3098 respiratory tract specimens collected from padiatric patients diagnosed with pneumonia were tested. More than half (43, 53.75%) of the specimens positive for influenza A viruses could not be further subtyped using the Luminex RVP assay. Among the remaining 15 specimens that were not subtyped, not degraded, and in sufficient amounts for the multiplex RT-PCR-electrochemical DNA sensor test, all (100%) were H3N2 positive. Therefore, the sensitivity of the Luminex RVP assay for influenza A virus was 46.25%, whereas the sensitivity of the multiplex RT-PCR-electrochemical DNA sensor for the clinical H1N1 and H3N2 specimens was 100%. The sensitivities of the multiplex RT-PCR-electrochemical DNA sensor for the avian H5N1, H5N6, H9N2, and H10N8 viruses were 100%, whereas that for H7N9 virus was 85.19%. We conclude that the multiplex RT-PCR-electrochemical DNA sensor is a reliable method for the rapid and accurate detection of highly variable influenza A viruses in respiratory infections with greater detection sensitivity than that of the Luminex xTAG assay. The high mutation rate of influenza A viruses, particularly H3N2 during the 2014 to 2016 epidemic seasons, has a strong impact on diagnosis. A study involving more positive specimens from all influenza A virus epidemic subtypes is required to fully assess the performance of the assay.","publish_time":"2018-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Lili; Jiang, Xiwen; Zhu, Yun; Duan, Yali; Huang, Taosheng; Huang, Zhiwen; Liu, Chunyan; Xu, Baoping; Xie, Zhengde","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f5ad2dee412dbb5a043d1a1c7aa2e0389bb2c7a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6036258.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.01405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30013525/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Luminex RVP","Luminex"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["multiplex RT-PCR","PCR assay","electrochemical DNA sensor test","H3N2 virus","Luminex RVP assay","non-influenza respiratory viruses","Luminex respiratory virus panel","respiratory infections","variable influenza","different influenza","H1N1 virus","H3N2 specimens","Luminex xTAG assay","virus epidemic subtypes","respiratory tract specimens","specimens positive","positive specimens","H7N9 virus","respiratory viral infections","H3N2 positive","H10N8 viruses","high mutation rate of influenza","greater detection sensitivity","multiplex asymmetric reverse transcription","accurate detection","limits of detection","rapid detection of viral pathogens","epidemic seasons","TCID","reliable method","clinical H1N1","padiatric patients","DFAs","direct fluorescent-antibody assays","culture","H5N6","avian H5N1","cross-reactivity","H9N2","advantages","physicians","nucleic acid tests","strong impact","LoDs","specificity assessment","sufficient amounts","total","results","sensitivities","amplified products","diagnosis","outbreaks","pneumonia","study","performance","half"],"language":"en"},

The mean air concentrations of ADA in the 2-week studies were 207, 102, 52, 9.4, or 2.0 mg/m3. No exposure-related mortality nor abnormal clinical signs were observed in rats or mice during or after exposure. The terminal body weights were slightly depressed in the highest exposure group.

In the 13-week subchronic study, the mean air concentrations of ADA were 204, 100, or 50 mg/m3. No mortality or clinical signs related to exposure were observed. The terminal body weights of exposed rats were not significantly different from those of control rats but were significantly depressed in mice exposed to 100 or 200 mg ADA/m3.

Viral titers for rats exposed to 50 mg ADA/m3 were negative for Sendai virus and pneumonia virus of mice, which produce similar lesions. The possibility of an unknown viral antigen causing this lesion cannot be eliminated. Lung tissue from male rats was analyzed for ADA and biurea, the major metabolite of ADA. No ADA was detected. The amount of biurea in the lungs increased nonlinearly with increasing exposure concentration, suggesting that clearance was somewhat impaired with repeated exposures. However, even at the highest exposure concentration, this amount of biurea was less than 1% of the estimated total ADA deposited over the exposure period. In summary, ADA is rapidly cleared from the lungs, even when inhaled at concentrations up to 200 mg/m3.

However, they require good laboratory infrastructure thereby restricting their use to reference laboratories and research studies. Therefore, adopting molecular tools for routine use in malaria endemic countries will require simpler molecular platforms. The recently developed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method is relatively simple and can be improved for better use in endemic countries. In this study, we attempted to improve this method for malaria diagnosis by using a simple and portable device capable of performing both the amplification and detection (by fluorescence) of LAMP in one platform. We refer to this as the RealAmp method. METHODOLOGY AND SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS: Published genus-specific primers were used to test the utility of this method. DNA derived from different species of malaria parasites was used for the initial characterization. Clinical samples of P. falciparum were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of this system compared to microscopy and a nested PCR method. Additionally, directly boiled parasite preparations were compared with a conventional DNA isolation method. The RealAmp method was found to be simple and allowed real-time detection of DNA amplification. The time to amplification varied but was generally less than 60 minutes. All human-infecting Plasmodium species were detected. The sensitivity and specificity of RealAmp in detecting P. falciparum was 96.7% and 91.7% respectively, compared to microscopy and 98.9% and 100% respectively, compared to a standard nested PCR method. In addition, this method consistently detected P. falciparum from directly boiled blood samples. CONCLUSION: This RealAmp method has great potential as a field usable molecular tool for diagnosis of malaria. This tool can provide an alternative to conventional PCR based diagnostic methods for field use in clinical and operational programs.","publish_time":"2010-10-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lucchi, Naomi W.; Demas, Allison; Narayanan, Jothikumar; Sumari, Deborah; Kabanywanyi, Abdunoor; Kachur, S.

To allow diagnosis, two conventional multiplex polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were developed to simultaneously identify four RNA and two DNA viruses associated with CIRDC. The two multiplex PCR assays were then validated on 102 respiratory samples collected from 51 dogs with respiratory illness by sensitivity and specificity determination in comparison to conventional simplex PCR and a rapid three-antigen test kit. All six viruses were detected in either individual or multiple infections. The developed multiplex PCR assays had a \u003E87% sensitivity and 100% specificity compared to their simplex counterpart. Compared to the three-antigen test kit, the multiplex PCR assays yielded 100% sensitivity and more than 83% specificity for detection of CAdV-2 and CDV, but not for CIV.

We aim to describe our hospital and Department of Surgery\u2019s experience in preparing for the COVID-19 pandemic and caring for surgical patients during this unprecedented time. STUDY DESIGN: This is a descriptive study outlining the strategy of a single academic health system for addressing the following 4 critical issues facing surgical departments during the COVID-19 pandemic: developing a cohesive leadership team and system for frequent communication throughout the department; ensuring adequate hospital capacity to care for an anticipated influx of COVID-19 patients; safeguarding supplies of blood products and personal protective equipment to protect patients and providers; and preparing for an unstable workforce due to illness and competing personal priorities, such as childcare. RESULTS: Through collaborative efforts within the Department of Surgery and hospital, we provided concise and regular communication, reduced operating room volume by 80%, secured a 4-week supply of personal protective equipment, and created reduced staffing protocols with back-up staffing plans. CONCLUSIONS: By developing an enabling infrastructure, a department can nimbly respond to crises like COVID-19 by promoting trust among colleagues and emphasizing an unwavering commitment to excellent patient care. Sharing principles and practical applications of these changes is important to optimize responses across the country and the world.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lancaster, Elizabeth M.; Sosa, Julie A.; Sammann, Amanda; Pierce, Logan; Shen, Wen; Conte, Michael C.; Wick, Elizabeth C.","journal":"J Am Coll Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/63305198d05816d2409842af9425a772b8adce37.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194622.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1072751520303124; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.04.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1072751520303124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32278726/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsxMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Department","Department of Surgery"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["surgical patients","pandemic","anticipated influx of COVID","personal priorities","Department of Surgery\u2019s experience","providers","week supply of personal protective equipment","reduced staffing protocols","adequate hospital capacity","regular communication","frequent communication","critical issues","surgical departments","descriptive study","STUDY DESIGN","back-up staffing plans","excellent patient care","single academic health system","safeguarding supplies of blood products","strategy","cohesive leadership team","unwavering commitment","changes","best outcomes","operating room volume","responses","practical applications","preparation","illness","collaborative efforts","swift actions","country","principles","colleagues","unstable workforce","enabling infrastructure","coronavirus disease","trust","unprecedented time","world","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","crises"],"language":"en"},

At the time of writing Italy is ranking first among countries both in terms of number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and in terms of number of deaths. Such a wide spread of COVID-19 has led to concern among workers who are facing the risk of becoming infected during the execution of their duties. We believe it is useful to remark on the need for professional expertise in the field of Occupational Hygiene in this emergency context, in which the indications provided by national and international bodies, the available scientific literature and the legal provisions are constantly and rapidly evolving. It is of fundamental importance that there is an effective analysis of expert inputs, to provide essential guidance to Health, Safety and Environmental managers and other prevention managers in workplaces. In this regard, not only a constant update of the regulatory framework is needed, but also a development and circulation of operational guidance to all the stakeholders to translate general indications into clear operating procedures and implementation tools to be adopted in the workplaces. We believe that the scientific associations in the field of Occupational Hygiene play a crucial role in guiding and assisting prevention professionals. There is considerable expertise in the occupational hygiene and exposure science communities that can help employers and workers to contain and delay the spread of COVID-19. For this reason, the Italian Association of Industrial Hygienists (AIDII\u2014Associazione Italiana degli Igienisti Industriali) published documents containing operational guidelines to provide correct and constantly updated information for: (i) workers employed in essential activities (with low and medium risk of contagion), (ii) health workers and other workers at high or very high risk of contagion, and (iii) for the correct use and handling of personal protective equipment for workers and for the population in general. It is worth pointing out that the documents produced are not intended to replace those produced by authoritative bodies, but to comply with and complete them by reporting an effective summary and further indications about the measures that should be taken in practice under the light of the Italian legislation. At present, the challenge is to produce scientifically sound knowledge, appropriate tools, and effective methodologies, by coordinating the initiatives of different scientific associations, with the final aim to effectively transfer them to employers and workers.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Spinazz\u00E8, Andrea; Cattaneo, Andrea; Cavallo, Domenico M","journal":"Ann Work Expo Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5d3327759a164d92e560baa9351301960aa5ea1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7184418.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32298415/; https://doi.org/10.1093/annweh/wxaa044","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsxMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Occupational Hygiene"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health workers","field of Occupational Hygiene","general indications","terms of number","high risk of contagion","wide spread of COVID","essential guidance","prevention managers","number of people","effective methodologies","documents","effective summary","medium risk of contagion","employers","workplaces","initiatives of different scientific associations","available scientific literature","circulation of operational guidance","Environmental managers","appropriate tools","implementation tools","correct use","operational guidelines","essential activities","effective analysis of expert inputs","international bodies","professional expertise","prevention professionals","coronavirus disease","considerable expertise","Italian legislation","authoritative bodies","Italian Association of Industrial Hygienists","AIDII","Associazione Italiana degli Igienisti Industriali","clear operating procedures","severe acute respiratory syndrome","handling of personal protective equipment","crucial role","Safety","exposure science communities","guiding","stakeholders","confirmed cases","sound knowledge","emergency context","constant update","legal provisions","need","countries","final aim","challenge","regulatory framework","light","practice","SARS-CoV","reason","measures","development","updated information","execution","population","time of writing Italy","fundamental importance","regard","duties","deaths","concern","size","pandemic","present"],"language":"en"},

These modifications are widely used by eukaryotic cells to control the functional repertoire of proteins. Over the last decade, it became apparent that the repertoire of ubiquitiylation and SUMOylation regulating various biological functions is not restricted to eukaryotic cells, but is also a feature of human virus families, used to extensively exploit complex host-cell networks and homeostasis. Intriguingly, besides binding to host SUMO/Ub control proteins and interfering with the respective enzymatic cascade, many viral proteins mimic key regulatory factors to usurp this host machinery and promote efficient viral outcomes. Advanced detection methods and functional studies of ubiquitiylation and SUMOylation during virus-host interplay have revealed that human viruses have evolved a large arsenal of strategies to exploit these specific PTM processes. In this review, we highlight the known viral analogs orchestrating ubiquitin and SUMO conjugation events to subvert and utilize basic enzymatic pathways.","publish_time":"2015-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wimmer, Peter; Schreiner, Sabrina","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d2e434006533cb3bbb701dffb53169b40a9c315.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4584293.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v7092849; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26343706/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsxNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SUMO/Ub","PTM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral proteins","host SUMO","functional repertoire of proteins","Ub control proteins","host machinery","virus-host interplay","SUMOylation","small ubiquitin","enzymatic changes","repertoire of ubiquitiylation","eukaryotic cells","complex host-cell networks","functional studies of ubiquitiylation","known viral analogs","SUMO conjugation events","efficient viral outcomes","respective enzymatic cascade","basic enzymatic pathways","human viruses","feature of human virus families","Posttranslational modifications","key regulatory factors","covalent addition of cellular regulatory determinants","various biological functions","PTMs","large arsenal of strategies","Advanced detection methods","homeostasis","modifier","binding","specific PTM processes","moieties","review","decade"],"language":"en"},

We conducted a review of the literature to evaluate the processes and procedures utilized for safe AE high-level containment transport (AE-HLCT) of patients with HHCDs. Methods A literature search was performed in PubMed/MEDLINE (from 1966 through January 2019). Authors screened abstracts for inclusion criteria and full articles were reviewed if the abstract was deemed to contain information related to the aim. Results Our search criteria yielded 14 publications and were separated based upon publication dates, with the natural break point being the beginning of the 2013-2016 Ebola virus disease epidemic. Best practices and recommendations from identified articles are subdivided into pre-flight preparations, inflight operations, and post-flight procedures. Conclusions Limited peer-reviewed literature exists on AE-HLCT, including important aspects related to healthcare worker fatigue, alertness, shift scheduling, and clinical care performance. This hinders the sharing of best practices to inform evacuations and equip teams for future outbreaks.

There are no comparable quantitative data on naturally-acquired infections. METHODS: In a community-based study in Hong Kong in 2008, we followed up initially well individuals to quantify trends in viral shedding based on culture and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) through the course of illness associated with seasonal influenza A and B virus infection. RESULTS: Trends in symptom scores more closely matched changes in molecular viral loads measured by RT-PCR for influenza A than influenza B. For influenza A virus infections, replicating viral loads measured by culture declined to undetectable levels earlier after illness onset than molecular viral loads. Most viral shedding occurred during the first 2\u20133 days after illness onset and we estimated that 1\u20138% of infectiousness occurs prior to illness onset. Only 14% of infections with detectable shedding by RT-PCR were asymptomatic, and viral shedding was low in these cases.

This study tested the hypothesis that the infection causes negligible impact on pigs\u2019 growth performance in terms of feed conversion efficiency, daily feed intake, daily growth, age on reaching 100 kg bodyweight and overall feed intake. A sample of 1955 pigs originating from 43 breeding herds was classified into five infection status groups; seronegative pigs (n = 887); seropositive pigs (n = 874); pigs positive for virus at bodyweight between 33 kg and 60 kg (n = 123); pigs positive for virus at bodyweight between 61 kg and 80 kg (n = 34) and pigs positive for virus at bodyweight between 81 kg and 100 kg (n = 37). Each pig had daily recordings of feed intake and bodyweight from 33 kg to 100 kg. Marginal effects of the virus infection on the outcomes were estimated by multi-level linear regression, which accounted for known fixed effects (breed, birthdate, average daily feed intake and growth phase) and random effects (cluster effects of pig and herd). RESULTS: The seropositive and virus positive pigs had decreased (P value\u003C0.05) growth performance compared to seronegative pigs even though feed intake was not decreased. Reduced feed conversion efficiency led to lower average daily growth, additional feed requirement and longer time needed to reach the 100 kg bodyweight. The effects were more marked (P value\u003C0.03) in pigs infected at a younger age and lasted a longer period. Despite increased feed intake observed, their growth rates were lower and they took more time to reach 100 kg bodyweight compared to the seronegative pigs.

The role of HBoV as the single causative agent for respiratory tract infections remains unclear. Detection of HBoV in children with respiratory disease is frequently in combination with other viruses or bacteria. We set up an algorithm to study whether HBoV alone can cause severe acute respiratory tract infection (SARI) in children. The algorithm was developed to exclude cases with no other likely cause than HBoV for the need for admission to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with SARI. We searched for other viruses by next-generation sequencing (NGS) in these cases and studied their HBoV viral loads. To benchmark our algorithm, the same was applied to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-positive patients. From our total group of 990 patients who tested positive for a respiratory virus by means of RT-PCR, HBoV and RSV were detected in 178 and 366 children admitted to our hospital. Forty-nine HBoV-positive patients and 72 RSV-positive patients were admitted to the PICU. We found seven single HBoV-infected cases with SARI admitted to PICU (7/49, 14%). They had no other detectable virus by NGS. They had much higher HBoV loads than other patients positive for HBoV. We identified 14 RSV-infected SARI patients with a single RSV infection (14/72, 19%). We conclude that our study provides strong support that HBoV can cause SARI in children in the absence of viral and bacterial co-infections.","publish_time":"2015-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moesker, F.M.; van Kampen, J.J.A.; van der Eijk, A.A.; van Rossum, A.M.C.; de Hoog, M.; Schutten, M.; Smits, S.L.; Bodewes, R.; Osterhaus, A.D.M.E.; Fraaij, P.L.A.","journal":"Clin Microbiol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7b4607e97bb4461d82efd83c2790929b3cf464a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172568.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X1500659X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26100374/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2015.06.014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X1500659X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsyNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARI","RSV","PICU","NGS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HBoV-positive patients","role of HBoV","Detection of HBoV","higher HBoV","patients positive","RSV-positive patients","HBoV viral loads","single HBoV-infected cases","RSV-infected SARI patients","respiratory virus","respiratory tract samples of children","respiratory tract infections","respiratory disease","single RSV infection","respiratory syncytial virus","PICU","algorithm","severe acute respiratory tract infection","detectable virus","NGS","viruses","likely cause","study","single causative agent","absence of viral","bacterial co-infections","paediatric intensive care unit","admission","need","RT-PCR","combination","strong support","generation sequencing","total group","human bocavirus","hospital"],"language":"en"},

Resolution of inflammation is an active process, and the pro-resolution effects of lipoxins, resolvins and protectins have received significant interest. Here, we review emerging data on the role of these lipid mediators in infectious disease. Lipoxins influence host control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma cruzi and Plasmodium berghei cerebral malaria in mice. Their effects are protective in toxoplasmosis, T. cruzi infection and cerebral malaria but detrimental in tuberculosis; related to the balance between pathogen-control and excessive immune response. Topical lipoxin abrogates the tissue damage seen in a rabbit model of Porphyromonas gingivalis periodontitis. The increased virulence of H5N1 influenza A virus in mice correlates with reduced expression of SOCS2, required to mediate the effects of lipoxin. Mice unable to synthesize lipoxin suffer increased lung pathology during respiratory syncytial virus infection. Protectin suppresses influenza A virus replication in vitro and increases survival in a mouse model of severe influenza infection. Resolvins were investigated in a number of animal models of systemic bacterial infection, and were found to enhance phagocytic clearance of bacteria, reduce inflammation severity, promote neutrophil apoptosis, modulate neutrophil chemotaxis and importantly, reduce mortality. Interestingly, resolvin also enhances the antibacterial effect of ciprofloxacin and vancomycin. Topical resolvin application reduces the severity of herpes simplex virus ocular infection in mice. If the effects of these mediators translate from pre-clinical studies into successful clinical trials, they represent promising new strategies in managing infectious disease.","publish_time":"2014-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Russell, Clark D; Schwarze, J\u00FCrgen","journal":"Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d7f10332fe3e37ee93b54d26dc0865ddf759a05.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3904237.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24400794/; https://doi.org/10.1111/imm.12206","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Protectin"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cruzi infection","respiratory syncytial virus infection","mouse model of severe influenza infection","severity of herpes simplex virus ocular infection","virus replication","mice correlates","inflammation severity","Mice unable","Resolution of inflammation","Topical lipoxin","pro-resolution effects of lipoxins","infectious disease","resolvins","number of animal models of systemic bacterial infection","increased virulence of H5N1 influenza","Lipoxins influence host control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis","Topical resolvin application","Trypanosoma cruzi","Plasmodium berghei cerebral malaria","pathogen-control","neutrophil apoptosis","neutrophil chemotaxis","lipid mediators","successful clinical trials","increased lung pathology","pre-clinical studies","essential host defence","excessive immune response","rabbit model of Porphyromonas gingivalis periodontitis","Toxoplasma gondii","promising new strategies","active process","role","survival","tissue damage","reduced expression of SOCS2","toxoplasmosis","balance","protectins","antibacterial effect of ciprofloxacin","phagocytic clearance of bacteria","vancomycin","emerging data","mortality"],"language":"en"},

These chimeric SARS VLPs have a similar size and morphology to the wild type SARS-CoV. We tested the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of purified chimeric SARS VLPs and full length SARS S protein vaccines in a mouse lethal challenge model. The SARS VLP vaccine, containing 0.8 \u03BCg of SARS S protein, completely protected mice from death when administered intramuscular (IM) or intranasal (IN) routes in the absence of an adjuvant. Likewise, the SARS VLP vaccine, containing 4 \u03BCg of S protein without adjuvant, reduced lung virus titer to below detectable level, protected mice from weight loss, and elicited a high level of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV. Sf9 cell-produced full length purified SARS S protein was also an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV but only when co-administered IM with aluminum hydroxide. SARS-CoV VLPs are highly immunogenic and induce neutralizing antibodies and provide protection against lethal challenge. Sf9 cell-based VLP vaccines are a potential tool to provide protection against novel pandemic agents.","publish_time":"2011-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Ye V.; Massare, Michael J.; Barnard, Dale L.; Kort, Thomas; Nathan, Margret; Wang, Lei; Smith, Gale","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8fed61a5e57b65f32da5ee1e1ef5d4b1df2fe250.json; document_parses/pdf_json/785e8e51292896154fffc2dc540f4025de81cd30.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3165014.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.06.111; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X1101005X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21762752/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X1101005X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszMzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","SARS S","IM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS spike","SARS-CoV VLPs","SARS VLP vaccine","\u03BCg of SARS S protein","chimeric SARS VLPs","length SARS S protein vaccines","recombinant SARS virus","wild type SARS-CoV","\u03BCg of S protein","influenza M1 protein","effective vaccine","Sf9 cell-based VLP vaccines","protected mice","high level of neutralizing antibodies","protection","adjuvant","co-administered IM","novel pandemic agents","detectable level","high levels","mouse lethal challenge model","novel method","global pandemic","baculovirus insect cell expression system","reduced lung virus titer","potential tool","similar size","weight loss","morphology","death","protective efficacy","particles","aluminum hydroxide","cause","routes","immunogenicity","absence","people","months"],"language":"en"},

The roles of other types of indirect contact among farms is rarely accounted for. In addition, data on animal movements is seldom available in the United States. However, the spread of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) in U.S. swine represents one of the best documented emergences of a highly infectious pathogen in the U.S. livestock industry, providing an opportunity to parameterize models of pathogen spread via direct and indirect transmission mechanisms in swine. Using observed data on pig movements during the initial phase of the PEDv epidemic, we developed a network-based and spatially explicit epidemiological model that simulates the spread of PEDv via both indirect and direct movement-related contact in order to answer unresolved questions concerning factors facilitating between-farm transmission. By modifying the likelihood of each transmission mechanism and fitting this model to observed epidemiological dynamics, our results suggest that between-farm transmission was primarily driven by direct mechanisms related to animal movement and indirect mechanisms related to local spatial spread based on geographic proximity. However, other forms of indirect transmission among farms, including contact via contaminated vehicles and feed, were responsible for high consequence transmission events resulting in the introduction of the virus into new geographic areas. This research is among the first reports of farm-level animal movements in the U.S. swine industry and, to our knowledge, represents the first epidemiological model of commercial U.S. swine using actual data on farm-level animal movement.","publish_time":"2018-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"VanderWaal, Kimberly; Perez, Andres; Torremorrell, Montse; Morrison, Robert M.; Craft, Meggan","journal":"Epidemics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4cfbba0b51ad95a18fc78f3817121b26fdbe3398.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104984.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29673815/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436517301755; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1755436517301755; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2018.04.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","U.S."],"keyphrases":["farm transmission","indirect transmission mechanisms","spread of PEDv","animal movement data","indirect mechanisms","forms of indirect transmission","direct movement-related contact","farm-level animal movement","spread of pathogens","types of indirect contact","level animal movements","local spatial spread","farms","swine industry","observed data","epidemiological model of commercial","explicit epidemiological model","actual data","PEDv epidemic","reports of farm","epidemiological dynamics","spread of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","Abstract Epidemiological models","high consequence transmission events","pig movements","livestock industry","models of pathogen","geographic proximity","infectious pathogen","livestock populations","new geographic areas","order","feed","introduction","initial phase","contaminated vehicles","unresolved questions","factors","cases","best documented emergences","opportunity","network","results","knowledge","roles","premises","addition","United States","likelihood","research"],"language":"en"},

The aim of the present study was to assess the presence of APMV in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples of critically ill patients suspected of ventilator\u2010associated pneumonia. The study was conducted in the intensive care unit of the Maastricht University Medical Centre. All consecutive bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples obtained between January 2005 and October 2009 from patients suspected of ventilator\u2010associated pneumonia were eligible for inclusion. All samples were analyzed by real\u2010time PCR targeting the APMV. A total of 260 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from 214 patients (139 male, 75 female) were included. Bacterial ventilator\u2010associated pneumonia was confirmed microbiologically in 105 out of 260 (40%) suspected episodes of ventilator\u2010associated pneumonia (86 patients).

This research suggests that any firm that wants market acceptance for its platform or e-commerce technology should focus more on building legitimacy among stakeholders than on anything else.","publish_time":"2019-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kwak, Jooyoung; Zhang, Yue; Yu, Jiang","journal":"Technological Forecasting and Social Change","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e77a315410f2d5c27fa99d4e7e044f185f43ec6f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127782.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0040162518309636; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287407/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2018.06.038; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162518309636","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs0NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Alibaba"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["building legitimacy","social legitimacy","type of legitimacy","perspective of legitimacy building","platform acceptance","market acceptance","platform evolution","case of Alibaba","development of e-commerce","e-commerce technology","Alibaba\u0027s continuous efforts","exposed weakness","emergence","infrastructure","intellectual property rights","culture","regulations","link","standard e-business model","existing studies","firm","study","stakeholders","research"],"language":"en"},

The PI3K/Akt pathway has recently attracted considerable interest due to its role in regulating virus replication. This study demonstrated for the first time that the mammalian reovirus strains Masked Palm Civet/China/2004 (MPC/04) and Bat/China/2003 (B/03) can induce transient activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway early in infection in vitro. When UV-treated, both viruses activated PI3K/Akt signaling, indicating that the virus/receptor interaction was sufficient to activate PI3K/Akt. Reovirus virions can use both clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis, but only chlorpromazine, a specific inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, or siRNA targeting clathrin suppressed Akt phosphorylation. We also identified the upstream molecules of the PI3K pathway. Virus infection induced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) but not Gab1, and blockage of FAK phosphorylation suppressed Akt phosphorylation. Blockage of PI3K/Akt activation increased virus RNA synthesis and viral yield. We also found that reovirus infection activated the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) in an interferon-independent manner and up-regulated IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) via the PI3K/Akt/EMSY pathway. Suppression of PI3K/Akt activation impaired the induction of ISRE and down-regulated the expression of ISGs. Overexpression of ISG15 and Viperin inhibited virus replication, and knockdown of either enhanced virus replication. Collectively, these results demonstrate that PI3K/Akt activated by mammalian reovirus serves as a pathway for sensing and then inhibiting virus replication/infection.","publish_time":"2015-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tian, Jin; Zhang, Xiaozhan; Wu, Hongxia; Liu, Chunguo; Li, Zhijie; Hu, Xiaoliang; Su, Shuo; Wang, Lin-Fa; Qu, Liandong","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a087143ccafb8699cca687a6548e99633a98fe21.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4557281.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26388843/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2015.00886","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs1MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PI3K/Akt","Masked Palm Civet/China","FAK","PI3K/Akt/EMSY","ISRE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Akt pathway","Akt phosphorylation","PI3K pathway","Blockage of PI3K","Suppression of PI3K","enhanced virus replication","reovirus infection","Akt activation increased virus RNA synthesis","Viperin inhibited virus replication","efficient replication","EMSY pathway","blockage of FAK phosphorylation","Reovirus virions","transient activation","China","phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase","regulated IFN-stimulated genes","mammalian reovirus strains Masked Palm Civet","specific inhibitor of clathrin","caveolae-mediated endocytosis","IFN-stimulated response element","induction of ISRE","expression of ISGs","knockdown","siRNA","viral yield","time","chlorpromazine","Gab1","Overexpression of ISG15","interferon-independent manner","receptor interaction","sensing","Bat","MPC","pathways","role","upstream molecules","viruses","host cellular","results","UV","study"],"language":"en"},

Methods This was a cross-sectional study. Clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory data of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory syndrome in a tertiary care hospital from 2012 to 2013 were reviewed. Results HRV was the most common CRV observed (36%, 162/444) and was present in the majority of viral co-detections (69%, 88/128), mainly in association with human enterovirus (45%). Most HRV-infected patients were younger than 2 years (57%). Overall, patients infected with HRV had a lower frequency of severe acute respiratory infection than those infected with other CRVs (60% and 84%, respectively, p =0.006), but had more comorbidities (40% and 27%, respectively; p =0.043). However, in the adjusted analysis this association was not significant. The mortality rate within the HRV group was 3%. Detection of HRV was more prevalent during autumn and winter, with a moderately negative correlation between viral infection frequency and temperature (r =\u22120.636, p \u003C0.001) but no correlation with rainfall (r =\u22120.036, p =0.866). Conclusion HRV is usually detected in hospitalized children with respiratory infections and is often present in viral co-detections. Comorbidities are closely associated with HRV infections. These infections show seasonal variation, with predominance during colder seasons.","publish_time":"2017-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leotte, Jaqueline; Trombetta, Hygor; Faggion, Heloisa Z.; Almeida, Bernardo M.; Nogueira, Meri B.; Vidal, Luine R.; Raboni, Sonia M.","journal":"Jornal de Pediatria","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/32b6ecf50c62b0c312394d6082c1824391f9d994.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094701.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021755716303023; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021755716303023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27916571/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jped.2016.07.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs1MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CRV","HRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HRV infections","HRV-infected patients","respiratory infections","HRV group","Results HRV","Detection of HRV","Conclusion HRV","respiratory virus","viral infection frequency","acute respiratory syndrome","lower frequency of severe acute respiratory infection","laboratory data of patients","majority of viral co-detections","association","hospitalized children","comorbidities","epidemiological features","clinical characteristics","common CRV","human enterovirus","consecutive years","moderately negative correlation","outcomes of human rhinovirus","comparison","winter","predominance","community","temperature","tertiary care hospital","seasonal variation","autumn","colder seasons","Abstract Objectives","adjusted analysis","mortality rate","Methods","cross-sectional study","rainfall","CRVs"],"language":"en"},

One of the common pathogens involved is canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), however little is known regarding its pathogenesis and the role it plays in the development of CIRD. The pathogenesis of five geographically unrelated canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) isolates was investigated. Following experimental infection in dogs, all five CRCoV isolates gave rise to clinical signs of respiratory disease consistent with that observed during natural infection. The presence of CRCoV was associated with marked histopathological changes in the nares and trachea, with loss and damage to tracheal cilia, accompanied by inflammation. Viral shedding was readily detected from the oropharynx up to 10 days post infection, but there was little or no evidence of rectal shedding. The successful re-isolation of CRCoV from a wide range of respiratory and mucosal associated lymphoid tissues, and lung lavage fluids demonstrates a clear tropism of CRCoV for respiratory tissues and fulfils the final requirement for Koch\u0027s postulates. By study day 14 dogs had seroconverted to CRCoV and the antibodies raised were neutralising against both homologous and heterologous strains of CRCoV in vitro, thus demonstrating antigenic homogeneity among CRCoV strains from the two continents. Defining the role that CRCoV and other agents play in CIRD is a considerable, but important, challenge if the disease is to be managed, treated and prevented more successfully. Here we have successfully developed a model for studying the pathogenicity and the role of CRCoV in CIRD.","publish_time":"2013-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mitchell, Judy A.; Brooks, Harriet W.; Szladovits, Bal\u00E1zs; Erles, Kerstin; Gibbons, Rachel; Shields, Shelly; Brownlie, Joe","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6fa6edca2532b5e33f63dbb20da5541773d3be10.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117275.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811351200658X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.11.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23280006/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037811351200658X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs1Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CIRD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of CRCoV","CRCoV isolates","CRCoV strains","presence of CRCoV","heterologous strains of CRCoV","clear tropism of CRCoV","respiratory tissues","successful re-isolation of CRCoV","unrelated canine respiratory coronavirus","Abstract Canine infectious respiratory disease","wide range of respiratory","development of CIRD","clinical signs of respiratory disease consistent","dogs","natural infection","experimental infection","pathogenesis","days post infection","mucosal associated lymphoid tissues","Viral shedding","evidence of rectal shedding","lung lavage fluids","rise","loss","nares","marked histopathological changes","final requirement","tracheal cilia","damage","oropharynx","common pathogens","agents","antigenic homogeneity","Koch\u0027s postulates","challenge","pathogenicity","study day","housed dog populations","inflammation","antibodies","continents","model"],"language":"en"},

The virus grew optimally in the CHSE-214 cell line at 15\u00B0C producing a diffuse cytopathic effect; however, juvenile rainbow trout exposed to cell culture-grown virus showed no mortality or gross pathology. Electron microscopy of preparations from infected cell cultures revealed the presence of typical orthomyxovirus particles. The complete genome of RbtOV is comprised of eight linear segments of single-stranded, negative-sense RNA having highly conserved 5\u2032 and 3\u2032-terminal nucleotide sequences. Another virus isolated in 2014 from steelhead trout (also O. mykiss) in Wisconsin, USA, and designated SttOV was found to have eight genome segments with high amino acid sequence identities (89\u201399%) to the corresponding genes of RbtOV, suggesting these new viruses are isolates of the same virus species and may be more widespread than currently realized. The new isolates had the same genome segment order and the closest pairwise amino acid sequence identities of 16\u201342% with Infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV), the type species and currently only member of the genus Isavirus in the family Orthomyxoviridae. However, pairwise comparisons of the predicted amino acid sequences of the 10 RbtOV and SttOV proteins with orthologs from representatives of the established orthomyxoviral genera and a phylogenetic analysis using the PB1 protein showed that while RbtOV and SttOV clustered most closely with ISAV, they diverged sufficiently to merit consideration as representatives of a novel genus. A set of PCR primers was designed using conserved regions of the PB1 gene to produce amplicons that may be sequenced for identification of similar fish orthomyxoviruses in the future.","publish_time":"2017-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Batts, William N.; LaPatra, Scott E.; Katona, Ryan; Leis, Eric; Ng, Terry Fei Fan; Brieuc, Marine S.O.; Breyta, Rachel B.; Purcell, Maureen K.; Conway, Carla M.; Waltzek, Thomas B.; Delwart, Eric; Winton, James R.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b3f9daeb1b6fa660774ccef8f9e545ceaf7bdc9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111338.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2017.01.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016817021630627X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016817021630627X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28088362/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel virus","virus species","rainbow trout orthomyxovirus","complete genome of RbtOV","juvenile rainbow trout","reared rainbow trout","genome segments","steelhead trout","corresponding genes of RbtOV","predicted amino acid sequences","Infectious salmon anemia virus","high amino acid sequence identities","cell line","representatives","SttOV proteins","designated SttOV","USA","novel genus","new isolates","infected cell cultures","genome segment order","Oncorhynchus mykiss","conserved regions","PB1 protein","PB1 gene","genus Isavirus","type species","new viruses","linear segments of single","terminal nucleotide sequences","presence of typical orthomyxovirus particles","phylogenetic analysis","orthologs","established orthomyxoviral genera","diffuse cytopathic effect","Electron microscopy of preparations","identification of similar fish orthomyxoviruses","negative-sense RNA","member","mortality","Wisconsin","Idaho","comparisons","set of PCR primers","future","family Orthomyxoviridae","amplicons","gross pathology","consideration","CHSE"],"language":"en"},

By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahmed, Syed Faraz; Quadeer, Ahmed A.; McKay, Matthew R.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/181b7b57851e6f58a601b68e613d10c10616f774.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c0f372d5b14d095e358b04f7dad5ea9c9ec4989d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.03.933226","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["available SARS-CoV","T cell epitopes","identified epitopes","immunogenic structural proteins of SARS","screened set of epitopes","set of B cell","existing immunological studies of SARS","derived B cell","novel coronavirus","novel virus","outbreak","new virus","broad coverage","population coverage analysis","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","associated MHC alleles","development of vaccines","spike","high genetic similarity","nucleocapsid","experimental efforts","insights","vaccine design","ways","findings","protection","sequences","imminent need","emergence of COVID","immune targeting","beginning","spread","study","mutation","China"],"language":"en"},

The assay system involves minimal manipulation after assay set-up, facilitates automated read-out and minimizes risks associated with hazardous viruses. Based on this assay system, we screened 7035 small molecule compounds from which we identified 7 compounds with anti-SARS-CoV activity. We demonstrate that the compounds inhibited SARS-CoV replication-dependent GFP expression in the replicon cells and reduced SARS-CoV viral protein accumulation and viral RNA copy number in the replicon cells.

The high sequence identity in the viral spike protein prompted us to investigate if HKU4 and HKU5 can recognize hCD26 for cell entry. We found that HKU4-RBD, but not HKU5-RBD, binds to hCD26, and pseudotyped viruses embedding HKU4 spike can infect cells via hCD26 recognition. The structure of the HKU4-RBD/hCD26 complex revealed a hCD26-binding mode similar overall to that observed for MERS-RBD. HKU4-RBD, however, is less adapted to hCD26 than MERS-RBD, explaining its lower affinity for receptor binding.

The aim of the present study is to describe the circulation of RV in the general population during six consecutive seasons from 2006 to 2012 in Catalonia, Spain. Cell culture, immunofluorescence and PCR-based assays were used for the RV laboratory-confirmation and influenza subtyping. Phylogenetic and molecular characterizations of viral haemagglutinin, partial neuraminidase and matrix 2 proteins were performed from a representative sampling of influenza viruses. A total of 6315 nasopharyngeal samples were collected, of which 64% were laboratory-confirmed, mainly as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses. Results show the significant burden of viral aetiological agents in acute respiratory infection, particularly in the youngest cases. The study of influenza strains reveals their continuous evolution through either progressive mutations or by segment reassortments. Moreover, the predominant influenza B lineage was different from that included in the recommended vaccine in half of the studied seasons, supporting the formulation and use of a quadrivalent influenza vaccine. Regarding neuraminidase inhibitors resistance, with the exception of the 2007/08 H275Y seasonal A(H1N1) strains, no other circulating influenza strains carrying known resistance genetic markers were found. Moreover, all circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) strains finally became genetically resistant to adamantanes. A wide knowledge of the seasonality patterns of the RV in the general population is well-appreciated, but it is a challenge due to the unpredictable circulation of RV, highlighting the value of local and global RV surveillance.","publish_time":"2016-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ant\u00F3n, A.; Marcos, M.A.; Torner, N.; Isanta, R.; Camps, M.; Mart\u00EDnez, A.; Dom\u00EDnguez, A.; Jan\u00E9, M.; Jim\u00E9nez de Anta, M.T.; Pumarola, T.","journal":"Clin Microbiol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1fddf608ae4fc494f692a200b963a9b7bd53ef44.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172104.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26939538/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X16001154; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X16001154; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2016.02.007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["seasonal influenza","circulating influenza strains","study of influenza strains","influenza subtyping","quadrivalent influenza vaccine","representative sampling of influenza viruses","unpredictable circulation of RV","respiratory viruses","RV laboratory-confirmation","predominant influenza B lineage","global RV surveillance","general population","H1N1","acute respiratory infection","neuraminidase inhibitors resistance","respiratory syncytial virus outbreaks","cumulative burden","partial neuraminidase","H275Y seasonal","studied seasons","consecutive seasons","recommended vaccine","present study","significant burden of viral aetiological agents","molecular characterizations of viral haemagglutinin","known resistance genetic markers","continuous evolution","value of local","immunofluorescence","progressive mutations","proteins","PCR-based assays","matrix","exception","seasonality patterns","half","H3N2","formulation","pdm09","Cell culture","segment reassortments","wide knowledge","challenge","Results","youngest cases","total","nasopharyngeal samples","Catalonia","aim","adamantanes","attention","rhinoviruses","Spain"],"language":"en"},

Viroporins stimulate virus production through different mechanisms, and ion channel conductivity has been proved particularly relevant in several cases. Key stages of the viral cycle such as virus uncoating, transport and maturation are ion-influenced processes in many viral species. Besides boosting virus propagation, viroporins have also been associated with pathogenesis.

Neutralization of TGEV is a specific event that requires the location of the epitope involved in the neutralization in the appropriate structural context, which is present in the wild-type virus but not in certain MAb escaping mutants. In neutralization of TGEV by binary combinations of MAbs specific for the same or for different antigenic sites, either no cooperation or a synergistic effect, respectively, was observed.

Recent efforts to develop transmissible vaccines focus on recombinant transmissible vaccine designs (RTVs) because they pose reduced risk if intra-host evolution causes the vaccine to revert to its vector form. However, the shared antigenicity of the vaccine and vector may confer vaccine-immunity to hosts infected with the vector, thwarting the ability of the vaccine to spread through the population. We build a mathematical model to test whether a RTV can facilitate disease management in instances where reversion is likely to introduce the vector into the population or when the vector organism is already established in the host population, and the vector and vaccine share perfect cross-immunity. Our results show that a RTV can autonomously eradicate a pathogen, or protect a population from pathogen invasion, when cross-immunity between vaccine and vector is absent. If cross-immunity between vaccine and vector exists, however, our results show that a RTV can substantially reduce the vaccination effort necessary to control or eradicate a pathogen only when continuously augmented with direct manual vaccination. These results demonstrate that estimating the extent of cross-immunity between vector and vaccine is a critical step in RTV design, and that herpesvirus vectors showing facile reinfection and weak cross-immunity are promising.","publish_time":"2017-12-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Basinski, Andrew J.; Varrelman, Tanner J.; Smithson, Mark W.; May, Ryan H.; Remien, Christopher H.; Nuismer, Scott L.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/76f4818047800fedb8deb664b66ff5c50fa76568.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5811206.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.12.037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29279283/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RTV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccine-immunity","vector organism","vector form","weak cross-immunity","perfect cross-immunity","recombinant transmissible vaccine designs","host population","extent of cross","results","Transmissible vaccines","RTV design","disease management","infectious disease control","vaccination effort necessary","pathogen invasion","direct manual vaccination","intra-host evolution","herpesvirus vectors","RTVs","facile reinfection","reduced risk","instances","reversion","potential","critical step","Recent efforts","shared antigenicity","mathematical model","ability"],"language":"en"},

It has caused heavy losses in global agriculture in recent decades. Rapid detection of PCV2 is very important for the effective prophylaxis and treatment of PMWS. RESULTS: A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was used to detect PCV2 in this study. Three pairs of primers were specially designed for recognizing eight distinct sequences of the ORF2 gene. This gene lies in the PCV2 virus genome sequence, and encodes the Rep protein that is involved in virus replication. Time and temperature conditions for amplification of PCV2 genes were optimized to be 55 min at 59\u00B0C. The analysis of clinical samples indicated that the LAMP method was highly sensitive. The detection limit for PCV2 by the LAMP assay was 10 copies, whereas the limit by conventional PCR was 1000 copies. The assay did not cross-react with PCV1, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, transmissible gastroenteritis of pigs virus or rotavirus. When 110 samples were tested using the established LAMP system, 95 were detected as positive. CONCLUSION: The newly developed LAMP detection method for PCV2 was more specific, sensitive, rapid and simple than before. It complements and extends previous methods for PCV2 detection and provides an alternative approach for detection of PCV2.","publish_time":"2011-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Kai; Shi, Wei; Han, Fangting; Xu, Yan; Zhu, Lianlong; Zou, Yong; Wu, Xiao; Zhu, Hong; Tan, Furong; Tao, Shiru; Tang, Xueming","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bcdceb50d70afda0d8615859b356484af61aab04.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3315793.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21414233/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-126","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PMWS","LAMP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCV2 detection","Rapid detection of PCV2","PCV2 virus genome sequence","amplification of PCV2 genes","LAMP assay","LAMP method","detection limit","developed LAMP detection method","respiratory syndrome virus","virus replication","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","porcine dermatitis","established LAMP system","transmissible gastroenteritis of pigs virus","nephropathy syndrome","Porcine circovirus type","copies","isothermal amplification","treatment of PMWS","ORF2 gene","analysis of clinical samples","global agriculture","causative agent of postweaning multisystemic","temperature conditions","PCV1","alternative approach","heavy losses","recent decades","effective prophylaxis","Rep protein","rotavirus","loop","PDNS","conventional PCR","distinct sequences","Time","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","previous methods","RESULTS","pairs of primers","study"],"language":"en"},

Here, we investigated the temporal transcriptional changes that occur in the cat intestine during T. gondii infection. METHODS: Cats were infected with 100 T. gondii cysts and their intestines were collected at 6, 12, 18, 24, 72 and 96 hours post-infection (hpi). RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) Illumina technology was used to gain insight into the spectrum of genes that are differentially expressed due to infection. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was also used to validate the level of expression of a set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) obtained by sequencing. RESULTS: Our transcriptome analysis revealed 2363 DEGs that were clustered into six unique patterns of gene expression across all the time points after infection. Our analysis revealed 56, 184, 404, 508, 400 and 811 DEGs in infected intestines compared to uninfected controls at 6, 12, 18, 24, 72 and 96 hpi, respectively. RNA-Seq results were confirmed by qRT-PCR. DEGs were mainly enriched in catalytic activity and metabolic process based on gene ontology enrichment analysis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis showed that transcriptional changes in the intestine of infected cats evolve over the course of infection, and the largest difference in the enriched pathways was observed at 96 hpi. The anti-T. gondii defense response of the feline host was mediated by Major Histocompatibility Complex class I, proteasomes, heat-shock proteins and fatty acid binding proteins. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed novel host factors, which may be critical for the successful establishment of an intracellular niche during T. gondii infection in the definitive feline host.

DUBs have been implicated as attractive therapeutic targets in the treatment of viral diseases, neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. The lack of selective chemical tools for the exploration of these enzymes significantly impairs the determination of their roles in both normal and pathological states. Commercially available fluorogenic substrates are based on the C-terminal Ub motif or contain Ub coupled to a fluorophore (Z-LRGG-AMC, Ub-AMC); therefore, these substrates suffer from lack of selectivity. By using a hybrid combinatorial substrate library (HyCoSuL) and a defined P2 library containing a wide variety of nonproteinogenic amino acids, we established a full substrate specificity profile for two DUBs\u2014MERS PLpro and human UCH-L3. Based on these results, we designed and synthesized Ub-based substrates and activity-based probes (ABPs) containing selected unnatural amino acids located in the C-terminal Ub motif. Biochemical analysis and cell-based experiments confirmed the activity and selectivity of engineered Ub-based substrates and probes. Using this approach, we propose that for any protease that recognizes Ub and Ub-like substrates, a highly active and selective unnatural substrate or probe can be engineered.","publish_time":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rut, Wioletta; \u017Bmudzi\u0144ski, Miko\u0142aj; Snipas, Scott J.; Bekes, Miklos; Huang, Tony T.; Drag, Marcin","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.30.926881","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ub-AMC","synthesized Ub-based substrates","selectivity of engineered Ub-based substrates","C-terminal Ub motif","activity-based probes","DUBs","cell-based experiments","selective unnatural substrate","available fluorogenic substrates","lack of selectivity","selected unnatural amino acids","hybrid combinatorial substrate library","substrate specificity profile","lack of selective chemical tools","Deubiquitinating enzymes","wide variety of nonproteinogenic amino acids","defined P2 library","HyCoSuL","treatment of viral diseases","ABPs","MERS PLpro","neurodegenerative disorders","Z-LRGG","attractive therapeutic targets","human UCH-L3","roles","cancer","exploration","Biochemical analysis","fluorophore","pathological states","determination","protein conjugates","results","protease","approach"],"language":"en"},

We have developed a quantitative proteomics protocol to identify HCV-triggered CD81 interactions and found 26 dynamic binding partners. At least six of these proteins promote HCV infection as indicated by RNA interference. We further characterized serum response factor binding protein 1 (SRFBP1), which is recruited to CD81 during HCV uptake and supports HCV infection in hepatoma cells and primary human hepatocytes. SRFBP1 facilitates host cell penetration by all seven HCV genotypes, but not of vesicular stomatitis virus and human coronavirus. Thus, SRFBP1 is an HCV specific, pan-genotypic host entry factor.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Demographic and state population data were extracted from the State Physician Workforce Reports published by the AAMC for the year 2018. A geospatial heat map of the United States was then constructed to illustrate the location of COVID-19 confirmed case counts and the distributions of ENTs over 60 years for each state. RESULTS: In 2018, out of a total of 9578 practicing U.S. ENT surgeons, 3081 were older than 60 years (32.2%). The states with the highest proportion of ENTs over 60 were Maine, Delaware, Hawaii, and Louisiana. The states with the highest ratios of confirmed COVID-19 cases to the number of total ENTs over 60 were New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Michigan.

Our results, of both poliovirus intertypic and intratypic recombination in the CRE-REP assay and using a range of polymerase variants in the biochemical assay, demonstrate that RdRp fidelity is a fundamental determinant of recombination frequency.

Because many attributes of immunity wane with advancing age, the elderly may be more susceptible to respiratory infections, even if they appear to be in good health. A decline in the ability of lymphoid tissues to mount an antigen-specific response (adaptive immunity) to specific microorganisms such as influenza virus or Streptococcus pneumoniae is thought to be an important factor in increasing susceptibility to respiratory tract infection with advancing age. However, abnormalities in innate immunity may also contribute to increased susceptibility to respiratory infections and have been poorly characterized in the elderly. Although changes in immune parameters such as T cell subsets and immunoglobulin concentrations have been observed in respiratory secretions from older healthy individuals compared to younger subjects, the significance of these changes for protective immunity in the lung is unknown. The incidence of pneumonia may be lessened by measures such as optimizing treatment of comorbid conditions, optimizing nutrition, and addressing swallowing disorders. The use of vaccines directed against the influenza virus and S. pneumoniae appears to have made an impact on the degree of morbidity and mortality, and perhaps, the incidence, of community-acquired pneumonia. However, better stimulation of specific immune responses with improved vaccines and more widespread use of these vaccines for protection of elderly individuals are needed.","publish_time":"2001-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meyer, Keith C","journal":"Respiration Physiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9ef6ec913540d29c34992b3e93d555b5e4c7498.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130717.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034568701002614; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034568701002614","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory infections","respiratory secretions","Abstract Respiratory tract infections","adaptive immunity","protective immunity","innate immunity","use of vaccines","incidence of pneumonia","specific microorganisms","improved vaccines","attributes of immunity wane","advancing age","influenza virus","changes","protection of elderly individuals","antigen-specific response","older healthy individuals","better stimulation of specific immune responses","increasing susceptibility","immune parameters","increased susceptibility","widespread use","Streptococcus pneumoniae","T cell subsets","immunoglobulin concentrations","younger subjects","nutrition","persons","significance","important factor","leading cause of death","ability of lymphoid tissues","years","lung","treatment of comorbid conditions","degree of morbidity","decline","mortality","impact","measures","swallowing disorders","abnormalities","community","good health","countries"],"language":"en"},

The chapter focuses on the detection, diagnosis, risk assessment, and decision-making regarding viral infections. Several infections caused by DNA viruses are parvoviruses, rat cytomegalovirus, poxviruses, adenovirus, and papovavirus. Several RNA viruses and infections caused by these viruses are coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, rotavirus and reovirus, and picornaviruses. Monitoring for viral infections should cover at least three venues: animals in established breeding and experimental colonies, animals held in entry quarantine, and animal tissues and products destined for in vivo use. For established colonies, monitoring should be tailored to local conditions. Effective monitoring should encompass sampling on a pre-arranged schedule, which can be intensified if evidence or suspicion of viral infection emerges. Because viral infections of rats can spread insidiously, early detection and epidemiologic \u201Cstaging\u201D should employ a detection matrix that includes clinical observation, appropriate sampling, and sensitive and specific diagnostic testing.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jacoby, Robert O.; Gaertner, Diane J.","journal":"The Laboratory Rat","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/42e1720ad53662ff33293d2f401039be86048ea2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149456.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780120749034500157; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780120749034500157","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral infections of rats","DNA viruses","RNA viruses","animals","detection matrix","established colonies","early detection","suspicion of viral infection","chapter","Effective monitoring","appropriate sampling","experimental colonies","established breeding","entry quarantine","rat cytomegalovirus","parvoviruses","clinical observation","risk assessment","poxviruses","rotavirus","diagnosis","staging","decision-making","coronaviruses","venues","animal tissues","products","reovirus","adenovirus","specific diagnostic testing","paramyxoviruses","pre-arranged schedule","evidence","Publisher Summary","papovavirus","picornaviruses"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to estimate the sensitivity of influenza testing in Canada based on results of a national respiratory virus surveillance system. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The weekly number of influenza-negative tests from 1999 to 2006 was modelled as a function of laboratory-confirmed positive tests for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus and parainfluenza viruses, seasonality, and trend using Poisson regression. Sensitivity was calculated as the number of influenza positive tests divided by the number of influenza positive tests plus the model-estimated number of false negative tests. The sensitivity of influenza testing was estimated to be 33% (95%CI 32\u201334%), varying from 30\u201340% depending on the season and region. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated sensitivity of influenza tests reported to this national laboratory surveillance system is considerably less than reported test characteristics for most laboratory tests. A number of factors may explain this difference, including sample quality and specimen procurement issues as well as test characteristics. Improved diagnosis would permit better estimation of the burden of influenza.","publish_time":"2009-08-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schanzer, Dena L.; Garner, Michael J.; Hatchette, Todd F.; Langley, Joanne M.; Aziz, Samina; Tam, Theresa W.

Like antibodies, immunoadhesins have long circulating half-lives, are readily purified by affinity-based methods and have the avidity advantages conferred by bivalency. Immunoadhesins that incorporate normal cellular receptors for viruses or bacterial toxins hold great, but as yet unrealized, potential for treating infectious disease. As decoy receptors, immunoadhesins have potential advantages over pathogen-targeted monoclonal antibodies. Planet Biotechnology has specialized in developing anti-infective immunoadhesins using plant expression systems. An immunoadhesin incorporating the cellular receptor for anthrax toxin, CMG2, potently blocks toxin activity in vitro and protects animals against inhalational anthrax. An immunoadhesin based on the receptor for human rhinovirus, ICAM-1, potently blocks infection of human cells by one of the major causes of the common cold.

Although endocrine therapy is effective, the development of endocrine resistance is a major clinical challenge. The tumor microenvironment (TME) promotes tumor malignancy, and tumor\u2010associated macrophages (TAM) within the TME play a crucial role in endocrine resistance. Herein, we aimed to elucidate the relationship between TAM and the endocrine\u2010resistant phenotype of breast cancer. Macrophages were cultured with conditioned medium (CM) from tamoxifen\u2010sensitive (MCF7\u2010S) or \u2010resistant (MCF7\u2010R) MCF7 breast cancer cells. M2 polarization was detected by CD163 immunofluorescence. To determine the effect on endocrine resistance, MCF7 cells were cultured in the supernatant of different TAM, and then treated with tamoxifen. CC\u2010chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) immunohistochemistry was carried out on pathological sections from 100 patients with invasive estrogen receptor\u2010positive breast cancer. We found that macrophages cultured in the CM of MCF7\u2010S and MCF7\u2010R cells were induced into TAM, with a more obvious M2 polarization in the latter. Tamoxifen resistance was increased by culture in TAM medium. TAM secreted CCL2, which increased endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells through activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. High expression of CCL2 was correlated with infiltration of CD163\u002Bmacrophages (r = 0.548, P \u003C .001), and patients with high CCL2 expression presented shorter progression\u2010free survival than those with low CCL2 expression (P \u003C .05). We conclude that CCL2 secreted by TAM activates PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and promotes an endocrine resistance feedback loop in the TME, suggesting that CCL2 and TAM may be novel therapeutic targets for patients with endocrine\u2010resistant breast cancer.","publish_time":"2019-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Dongbo; Ji, Hongfei; Niu, Xingjian; Yin, Lei; Wang, Yiran; Gu, Yucui; Wang, Jinlu; Zhou, Xiaoping; Zhang, Han; Zhang, Qingyuan","journal":"Cancer Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17f00e096a5f3ce94278a77011e6f38d7a47c618.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6942430.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/cas.14230; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31710162/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs5NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TME","TAM","PI3K/Akt"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TAM secreted CCL2","MCF7 breast cancer cells","development of endocrine resistance","MCF7 cells","resistant breast cancer","TAM medium","endocrine therapy","Tamoxifen resistance","positive breast cancer","endocrine resistance feedback loop","resistant phenotype of breast cancer","High expression of CCL2","high CCL2 expression","low CCL2 expression","supernatant of different TAM","patients","TME","tumor malignancy","associated macrophages","PI3K","tumor microenvironment","mTOR","Akt","obvious M2 polarization","prevalent malignancy","infiltration of CD163","CD163 immunofluorescence","free survival","invasive estrogen receptor","shorter progression","novel therapeutic targets","activation","immunohistochemistry","pathological sections","major clinical challenge","chemokine ligand","crucial role","culture","effect","pathway","women","relationship"],"language":"en"},

Although 56% of respondents replied that they could continue to visit the department if a SARS patient was admitted to the unit in the hospital before they read the information, the proportion of those who intended to continue outpatient care significantly increased by 15% after they read it. The logistic regression analyses revealed that respondents who had frequently visited the outpatient department (P \u003C 0.001), those who felt relieved by reading the information about the unit (P \u003C 0.001), and those who did not worry about nosocomial SARS infection inside the hospital (P \u003C 0.001) were significantly more likely to reply that they would continue outpatient visits.

Methods This analysis was part of the Community-Acquired Pneumonia immunization Trial in Adults (CAPiTA); a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 84 496 immunocompetent individuals aged \u226565 years. CAP was defined by clinical and radiological criteria, and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from all individuals referred to a sentinel centre with a clinical suspicion of pneumonia. Presence of influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2, 3 and 4, human adeno-, boca-, corona-, metapneumo-, rhino- and respiratory syncytial viruses was determined by real-time PCR. Results Of 3209 episodes of suspected pneumonia, viral aetiology was tested in 2917 and proportions with influenza virus, human metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus were 4.6%, 2.5% and 3.1%, respectively.

Methods This is a double-blind, randomized, controlled study in a university hospital emergency department (ED) in the New Territories of Hong Kong. Patients older than 17 years and presenting between February 1, 2003, and June 30, 2004, with a clinical diagnosis of goutlike arthritis were randomized to receive either oral prednisolone/acetaminophen or oral indomethacin/acetaminophen combination therapy. Primary outcome measures were pain scores, time to resolution of symptoms and signs, and adverse effects. Secondary outcome measures were the need for additional acetaminophen and relapse rate. Results There were 90 patients randomized: 46 patients to the indomethacin group and 44 patients to the prednisolone group. Baseline characteristics, including pain scores, were similar in the 2 groups. Both treatment groups had a similar decrease in pain score in the ED. The mean rate of decrease in pain score with activity for indomethacin was \u22121.7\u00B11.6 (SD) mm per day and for prednisolone was \u22122.9\u00B12.0 (SD) mm per day (mean difference 1.2 mm/day; 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 2.0 mm/day; P=.0026). Although these differences were statistically significant, at no time was the difference in mean pain score greater than 13 mm. Therefore, it is unclear whether these differences are clinically significant. The mean total dose of acetaminophen consumed by the prednisolone group was significantly more than in the indomethacin group (mean 10.3 g, range 1 to 21 g versus mean 6.4 g, range 1 to 21 g). Twenty-nine patients in the indomethacin group and 12 patients in the prednisolone group experienced adverse effects (P\u003C.05). The commonest adverse effects in the indomethacin group were nausea, indigestion, epigastric pain, dizziness, and gastrointestinal bleeding (N=5; 11%). None of the patients in the prednisolone group developed gastrointestinal bleeding. The relapse rate for both groups was similar. Conclusion In the treatment of acute goutlike arthritis, oral prednisolone/acetaminophen combination is as effective as oral indomethacin/acetaminophen combination in relieving pain but is associated with fewer adverse effects.","publish_time":"2007-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Man, Chi Yin; Cheung, Ian T.F.; Cameron, Peter A.; Rainer, Timothy H.","journal":"Annals of Emergency Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9bc72dcb21981faa5504ca0b2d670013d61dfdf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115288.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196064406025388; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064406025388","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":[],"locations":["New Territories","Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["indomethacin group","prednisolone group","oral indomethacin","mean pain","adverse effects of oral prednisolone","acetaminophen combination therapy","additional acetaminophen","pain scores","Patients older","epigastric pain","relieving pain","mean total dose of acetaminophen","mean difference","day","fewer adverse effects","commonest adverse effects","mean rate of decrease","treatment groups","treatment of acute goutlike arthritis","similar decrease","relapse rate","time","clinical diagnosis of goutlike arthritis","gastrointestinal bleeding","differences","SD","Primary outcome measures","Secondary outcome measures","university hospital emergency department","controlled study","Study objective","need","analgesic efficacy","dizziness","indigestion","nausea","resolution of symptoms","signs","New Territories of Hong Kong","activity","Baseline characteristics","Conclusion","confidence interval","years","Methods","Results"],"language":"en"},

The increasing rate of outbreaks of infectious diseases transferring from animals to humans (i.e. zoonotic diseases) necessitates detailed understanding of the education, research and practice of animal health and its connection to human health. These emerging microbial threats underline the need to exploring the evolutionary dynamics of zoonotic research across public health and animal health. This study investigates the collaboration network of different countries engaged in conducting zoonotic research. We explore the dynamics of this network from 1980 to 2012 based on large scientific data developed from Scopus. In our analyses, we compare several properties of the network including density, clustering coefficient, giant component and centrality measures over time. We also map the network over different time intervals using VOSviewer. We analyzed 5182 publication records. We found United States and United Kingdom as the most collaborative countries working with 110 and 74 other countries in 1048 and 599 cases, respectively.

All the wildcats but one (95.4%) presented evidence of contact with at least one of the agents (mean = 2.2). Contact with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) was detected in 81% of the wildcats (antibodies, 77%; antigen p27, 15%). Antibodies to feline calicivirus (FCV, 80%), feline herpesvirus (FHV, 20%), feline parvovirus (FPV, 18%), and Chlamydophila sp. (27%) were also detected. Analyses were negative for feline immunodeficiency virus and feline coronavirus. The probability of having antibodies to FPV was inversely related with the concentration of serum cholesterol and with a morphometric index of body condition. Similarity in the composition of antibodies against disease agents (number and identity of detected and undetected antibodies) was significantly higher in pairs of female wildcats than in pairs of males or heterosexual pairs, suggesting that females had a more homogeneous exposure to pathogens. Seroprevalence for FHV was higher in males than in females. Antibodies to FHV and Chlamydophila sp. were more frequent in winter than in other seasons. In addition, the mean similarity of the pathogen community between pairs of serum samples was higher if both wildcats were caught during the same season than if they were not. Mean similarity was lowest when serum samples obtained in winter were compared with those from spring or summer. The results suggest that some agents probably had a reservoir in domestic cats and may cause some undetected morbidity/mortality in the studied wildcat population, whereas others, such as FeLV and FCV, may be enzootic.","publish_time":"2009-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mill\u00E1n, Javier; Rodr\u00EDguez, Alejandro","journal":"Eur","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aba4145d91d789bc9756cb52bb3feb9eed87669f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087923.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10344-008-0246-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214938/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FHV"],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["feline pathogens","feline coronavirus","undetected antibodies","feline calicivirus","feline parvovirus","feline herpesvirus","pairs of serum samples","composition of antibodies","pairs of female wildcats","feline immunodeficiency virus","feline leukemia virus","pairs of males","mean similarity","FHV","heterosexual pairs","free-living European wildcats","concentration of serum cholesterol","disease agents","winter","evidence of exposure","FeLV","females","evidence of contact","FCV","FPV","Chlamydophila","undetected morbidity","homogeneous exposure","pathogen community","mortality","number","identity","studied wildcat population","morphometric index of body condition","domestic cats","Felis silvestris","reservoir","Analyses","Seroprevalence","central Spain","spring","seasons","antigen p27","addition","probability","summer","results"],"language":"en"},

A graft-versus-host-like (GVHL) syndrome, characterized by widespread necrotizing leukocytoclastic vasculitis of the bowel, skin, and other tissues, has also been observed after mercury treatment of BN rats. These findings have suggested that the autoimmunity caused by the administration of mercury to BN rats may result as a xenobiotic-induced GVHL effect under the control of OX22\u002B T lymphocytes. However, previous studies of mercury-induced autoimmunity have never reported any evidence of GVHL lesions. Therefore, we have carefully examined various tissues from a large group of BN rats injected with HgCl2 to identify possible areas of inflammatory reactions that may have been unnoticed in previous investigations. In addition, we have determined by flow cytometry whether exposure to mercury results in percentage and numerical alterations of OX22\u002B or other lymphocyte subpopulations in lymphoid organs of HgCl2-treated BN rats. The present article confirms that mercury induces autoimmune responses to laminin 1 but does not corroborate the hypothesis of a GVHL syndrome regulated by OX22\u002B lymphocytes. First, changes in OX22\u002B cells during treatment with HgCl2 were infrequent and had no significant correlation with the kinetics of autoimmune responses to laminin 1. Second, we detected no GVHL lesions in skin and intestine of mercury-treated BN rats.","publish_time":"2003-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bigazzi, P. E; Kosuda, L. L; Hannigan, M.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children presenting with acute respiratory infection and/or isolated fever at the Basurto University Hospital, Bilbao, Spain between November 2010 and May 2011 were included in this study (NCT01592799). Two nasopharyngeal secretion samples were taken from each; one for a rapid influenza diagnostic test in the emergency department, and the second for laboratory analysis using real-time polymerase chain reaction and viral culture. RESULTS: A total of 501 children were recruited, of whom 91 were hospitalized. Influenza diagnosis was confirmed in 131 children (26.1%); 120 of 410 (29.3%) treated as outpatients and 11 of 91 (12.1%) hospitalized children. A total of 370 of 501 children (73.9%) had no laboratory test positive for influenza. The proportion of subjects with other respiratory viruses was 145/501 (28.9%) cases and co-infection with the influenza virus plus another respiratory virus was detected in 7/501 (1.4%) cases. Influenza virus types were: A (H1N1 and H3N2) 53.2% (67/126); B (Victoria and Yamagata) 46.0% (58/126); A \u002B B 0.8% (1/126). The median direct medical costs associated with each case of laboratory-confirmed influenza was \u20AC177.00 (N = 131). No significant differences were observed between the medical costs associated with influenza A and B. CONCLUSION: Almost half of the cases were influenza virus B type.

Therefore, to apply the PM principles to the various rhinitis subtypes rise as a meaningful strategy to improve evaluation and treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: The technology of recombinant allergens has allowed molecular characterization of IgE reactivity of specific individual components of allergenic extracts. Recently published and ongoing clinical trials based on component resolved diagnosis (CRD) bring more precision to allergen immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis. Monoclonal antibodies against various cytokines involved in inflammatory allergic and nonallergic rhinitis endotypes show promissory results.

Many aspects of respiration can be measured using devices known as plethysmographs that can measure thoracic movement. One such approach (the Buxco platform) performs unrestrained whole body plethysmography on mice which infers thoracic movements from pressure differences from the act of inhalation and exhalation. While proprietary software is available to perform basic statistical analysis as part of machine\u2019s bundled software, it is desirable to be able to incorporate these analyses into high-throughput pipelines and integrate them with other data types, as well as leverage the wealth of analytic and visualization approaches provided by the R statistical computing environment. RESULTS: This manuscript describes the plethy package which is an R/Bioconductor framework for pre-processing and analysis of plethysmography data with emphasis on larger scale longitudinal experiments. The plethy package was designed to facilitate quality control and exploratory data analysis. We provide a demonstration of the features of plethy using a dataset assessing the respiratory effects over time of SARS and Influenza infection in mice.

We developed the 36-item COVID Stress Scales (CSS) to measure these features, as they pertain to COVID-19. The CSS were developed to better understand and assess COVID-19-related psychopathology. The scales were intentionally designed so they could be readily adapted for future pandemics. The CSS were developed and initially validated in population-representative samples from Canada (N = 3,479) and the United States (N = 3,375). A stable 5-factor solution was identified, corresponding to scales assessing COVID-related stress and anxiety symptoms: (1) Danger and contamination fears, (2) fears about economic consequences, (3) xenophobia, (4) compulsive checking, and (5) traumatic stress symptoms about COVID-19. The scales performed well on various indices of reliability and validity. The scales were intercorrelated, providing evidence of a COVID Stress Syndrome. The scales offer promise as tools for better understanding the psychopathology associated with COVID-19 and for identifying people in need of mental health services.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Taylor, Steven; Landry, Caeleigh; Paluszek, Michelle; Fergus, Thomas A.; McKay, Dean; Asmundson, Gordon J.G.","journal":"J Anxiety Disord","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/577ff5b5b67f3367ba8ee8f469983f6270c0c8ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7198206.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0887618520300463; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408047/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102232; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887618520300463?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyNDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COVID Stress Scales","CSS"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["COVID-related stress","item COVID Stress Scales","COVID Stress Syndrome","traumatic stress symptoms","anxiety-related psychopathology","CSS","possible pandemic-related threats","disease-related xenophobia","times of pandemic","anxiety symptoms","fear of foreigners","people","compulsive checking","socio-economic consequences","contamination fears","surfaces","contact","reassurance","clinical observations","contaminated objects","Canada","need of mental health services","Danger","evidence","population-representative samples","various indices of reliability","validity","Abstract Research","nightmares","infection","tools","intrusive thoughts","factor solution","United States","promise","features","future pandemics"],"language":"en"},

Much of the current research into the factors contributing to these declines has focused on exposure to drug residues, lead, and other toxins. Despite increased monitoring of these declining populations, little is known about infectious diseases affecting scavenger bird species. To assess potential infectious disease risks to both obligate and facultative scavenger bird species, we performed a serosurvey for eleven potential pathogens in three species of scavenging birds in California: the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus), turkey vulture (Cathartes aura) and golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos). California condors were seropositive for avian adenovirus, infectious bronchitis virus, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, avian paramyxovirus-2, West Nile virus (WNV) and Toxoplasma gondii. Golden eagles were seropositive for avian adenovirus, Chlamydophila psittaci and Toxoplasma gondii, and turkey vultures were seropositive for avian adenovirus, Chlamydophila psittaci, avian paramyxovirus-1, Toxoplasma gondii and WNV. Risk factor analyses indicated that rearing site and original release location were significantly associated with a positive serologic titer to WNV among free-flying condors. This study provides preliminary baseline data on infectious disease exposure in these populations for aiding in early disease detection and provides potentially critical information for conservation of the endangered California condor as it continues to expand its range and encounter new infectious disease threats.","publish_time":"2015-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Straub, Mary H.; Kelly, Terra R.; Rideout, Bruce A.; Eng, Curtis; Wynne, Janna; Braun, Josephine; Johnson, Christine K.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/83e137405afc87914e9128afa5aec46cc2b152cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4659623.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0143018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26606755/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["avian adenovirus","infectious disease exposure","avian paramyxovirus","infectious diseases","potential infectious disease risks","Toxoplasma gondii","California condors","populations of scavenger birds","WNV","declining populations","new infectious disease threats","infectious bronchitis virus","endangered California condor","facultative scavenger bird species","Chlamydophila psittaci","early disease detection","species of scavenging birds","turkey vultures","Golden eagles","potential pathogens","West Nile virus","rearing site","Mycoplasma gallisepticum","Cathartes aura","critical information","Gymnogyps californianus","preliminary baseline data","aiding","conservation","original release location","Risk factor analyses","positive serologic titer","lead","drug residues","study","serosurvey","range","Aquila chrysaetos","factors","declines","increased monitoring","world","current research","toxins","brink of extinction"],"language":"en"},

Data on subclinical infections are even totally absent, although asymptomatic persons might act as a source of respiratory infections. METHODS: In a 1-year community-based study, we prospectively investigated the possible virologic cause of acute respiratory infections in 107 symptomatic case episodes and 91 symptom-free control periods. Participants, persons \u2A7E60 years, reported daily the presence of respiratory symptoms in a diary. Virologic assessment was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology. RESULTS: In 58% of the case episodes a pathogen was demonstrated, the most common being rhinoviruses (32%), coronaviruses (17%), and influenzaviruses (7%). The odds ratio for demonstrating a virus in cases with symptoms vs. controls without symptoms was 30.0 (95% confidence interval 10.2\u201387.6). In 4% of the symptom-free control periods a virus was detected. CONCLUSION: This study supports the importance of rhinovirus infections in community-dwelling elderly persons, whereas asymptomatic elderly persons can also harbor pathogens as detected by PCR, and thus might be a source of infection for their environment.","publish_time":"2003-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Graat, Judith M; Schouten, Evert G; Heijnen, Marie-Louise A; Kok, Frans J; Pallast, Esther G.M; de Greeff, Sabine C; Dorigo-Zetsma, J.Wendelien","journal":"J Clin Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c8fd3420561aa8300cc5b6f30e7d2ceae4c8357b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119012.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895435603001719; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0895435603001719","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["source of respiratory infections","microbiology of acute respiratory infections","asymptomatic elderly persons","subclinical infections","asymptomatic persons","presence of respiratory symptoms","possible virologic cause of acute respiratory infections","importance of rhinovirus infections","elderly studies","symptom-free control periods","year community-based study","PCR","symptomatic case episodes","Virologic assessment","source of infection","polymerase chain reaction","cases","OBJECTIVE","controls","pathogens","serology","years","diary","odds ratio","rhinoviruses","environment","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","Participants","Data","confidence interval","coronaviruses","METHODS","RESULTS","influenzaviruses"],"language":"en"},

It recognises the O-antigenic repeating units of cell surface lipopolysaccharide of serogroup A, B and D1 as receptor, but also inactivates its receptor by endoglycosidase (endorhamnosidase) activity. In the final step of bacteriophage P22 assembly six homotrimeric tailspike molecules are non-covalently attached to the DNA injection apparatus, mediated by their N-terminal, head-binding domains. We report the crystal structure of the head-binding domain of P22 tailspike protein at 2.3 \u00C5 resolution, solved with a recombinant telluromethionine derivative and non-crystallographic symmetry averaging. The trimeric dome-like structure is formed by two perpendicular \u03B2-sheets of five and three strands, respectively in each subunit and caps a three-helix bundle observed in the structure of the C-terminal receptor binding and cleaving fragment, reported here after full refinement at 1.56 \u00C5 resolution. In the central part of the receptor binding fragment, three parallel \u03B2-helices of 13 complete turns are associated side-by-side, while the three polypeptide strands merge into a single domain towards their C termini, with close interdigitation at the junction to the \u03B2-helix part. Complex structures with receptor fragments from S. typhimurium, S. enteritidis and S. typhi253Ty determined at 1.8 \u00C5 resolution are described in detail. Insertions into the \u03B2-helix form the O-antigen binding groove, which also harbours the active site residues Asp392, Asp395 and Glu359. In the intact structure of the tailspike protein, head-binding and receptor-binding parts are probably linked by a flexible hinge whose function may be either to deal with shearing forces on the exposed, 150 \u00C5 long tailspikes or to allow them to bend during the infection process.","publish_time":"1997-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Steinbacher, Stefan; Miller, Stefan; Baxa, Ulrich; Budisa, Nediljko; Weintraub, Andrej; Seckler, Robert; Huber, Robert","journal":"J Mol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/56bd4bd786dd96bfda9f2c096eeed6eee4280ee8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172399.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283697909220; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283697909220","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. typhi253Ty"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["receptor binding fragment","receptor-binding parts","C-terminal receptor binding","head-binding domain of P22 tailspike protein","head-binding domains","receptor fragments","\u03B2-helix","\u00C5 resolution","O-antigen binding groove","tailspike protein of Salmonella phage P22","intact structure","crystal structure","viral adhesion protein","homotrimeric tailspike molecules","parallel \u03B2-helices","perpendicular \u03B2-sheets","\u00C5 long tailspikes","helix bundle","single domain","cleaving fragment","C termini","N-terminal","final step of bacteriophage P22 assembly","polypeptide strands merge","non-crystallographic symmetry averaging","O-antigenic repeating units of cell surface lipopolysaccharide of serogroup","recombinant telluromethionine derivative","Asp395","active site residues Asp392","typhimurium","complete turns","close interdigitation","Glu359","typhi253Ty","junction","Complex structures","DNA injection apparatus","enteritidis","endoglycosidase","endorhamnosidase","activity","D1","refinement","flexible hinge","shearing forces","function","trimeric dome","subunit","Insertions","activities","infection process"],"language":"en"},

Evidence has shown that there are asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 who can transmit the disease to others. The virus incubation time shows a wide range (0\u201324 days) and the virus displays a high infectivity. It is therefore urgent to develop an effective therapy to treat patients with COVID-19 and to control the spread of the causative agent, severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Repurposing of approved drugs is widely adopted to fight newly emerged diseases such as COVID-19, as these drugs have known pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. As pathological examination has confirmed the involvement of immune hyperactivation and acute respiratory distress syndrome in fatal cases of COVID-19, several disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDS), such as hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab, have been proposed as potential therapies for the treatment of COVID-19.

Microneutralization (MN) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays are currently used to evaluate neutralizing antibody responses against human and avian influenza viruses, including H5N1. The MN assay is somewhat labor intensive, while HI is a surrogate for neutralization. Moreover, use of replication competent viruses in these assays requires biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) containment. Therefore, a neutralization assay that does not require BSL-3 facilities would be advantageous. Toward this goal, we generated a panel of pseudotypes expressing influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) and developed a pseudotype-based neutralization (PN) assay. Here we demonstrate that HA/NA pseudotypes mimic release and entry of influenza virus and that the PN assay exhibits good specificity and reveals quantitative difference in neutralizing antibody titers against different H5N1 clades and subclades. Using immune ferret sera, we demonstrated excellent correlation between the PN, MN, and HI assays. Thus, we conclude that the PN assay is a sensitive and quantifiable method to measure neutralizing antibodies against diverse clades and subclades of H5N1 influenza virus.","publish_time":"2009-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsai, Cheguo; Caillet, Catherine; Hu, Hongxing; Zhou, Fan; Ding, Heng; Zhang, Guoliang; Zhou, Boping; Wang, Shixia; Lu, Shan; Buchy, Philippe; Deubel, Vincent; Vogel, Frederick R.; Zhou, Paul","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5325a03610cff1a81555fb64124ea2d493bdcf36.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115403.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.08.056; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X09012390; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19732860/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X09012390","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PN","HA/NA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PN assay","MN assay","neutralization assay","subclades of H5N1 influenza virus","influenza hemagglutinin","entry of influenza virus","HI assays","neutralizing antibody titers","neutralizing antibody responses","avian influenza viruses","Abstract Neutralizing antibody","neutralizing antibodies","clearance of influenza virus infection","different H5N1 clades","HA","BSL","pseudotype-based neutralization","diverse clades","NA pseudotypes mimic release","panel of pseudotypes","replication competent viruses","quantitative difference","quantifiable method","human","prevention","excellent correlation","good specificity","hemagglutination inhibition","biosafety level","labor intensive","neuraminidase","immune ferret sera","Microneutralization","surrogate","facilities","goal","containment"],"language":"en"},

Nevertheless, the role of viral infections in the pathogenesis of asthma remains poorly characterized. The factors that could explain this association are heterogeneous and sometimes contradictory. The four main causative mechanisms implicated in the association between viral respiratory infections and the subsequent development of asthma or wheezing in children are alterations in airway function and size, dysregulation (congenital and acquired) of airway tone, alterations in the immune response to infections, and the genetic variants involved in immune response. These mechanisms should be taken into account in future preventive and therapeutic strategies.","publish_time":"2007-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Castro-Rodr\u00EDguez, J.

Rapid and sensitive diagnosis aids effective disease management at points of need (PON). A commercially available, field-deployable and user-friendly system, designed with insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) technology, displays excellent sensitivity and specificity for nucleic acid detection. An iiPCR method was developed for on-site detection of all circulating CPV-2 strains. Limit of detection was determined using plasmid DNA. CPV-2a, 2b and 2c strains, a feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) strain, and nine canine pathogens were tested to evaluate assay specificity. Reaction sensitivity and performance were compared with an in-house real-time PCR using serial dilutions of a CPV-2b strain and 100 canine fecal clinical samples collected from 2010 to 2014, respectively. The 95% limit of detection of the iiPCR method was 13 copies of standard DNA and detection limits for CPV-2b DNA were equivalent for iiPCR and real-time PCR. The iiPCR reaction detected CPV-2a, 2b and 2c and FPV. Non-targeted pathogens were not detected. Test results of real-time PCR and iiPCR from 99 fecal samples agreed with each other, while one real-time PCR-positive sample tested negative by iiPCR. Therefore, excellent agreement (k = 0.98) with sensitivity of 98.41% and specificity of 100% in detecting CPV-2 in feces was found between the two methods. In conclusion, the iiPCR system has potential to serve as a useful tool for rapid and accurate PON, molecular detection of CPV-2.","publish_time":"2015-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilkes, Rebecca P.; Lee, Pei-Yu A.; Tsai, Yun-Long; Tsai, Chuan-Fu; Chang, Hsiu-Hui; Chang, Hsiao-Fen G.; Wang, Hwa-Tang T.","journal":"J Virol Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c2ee01cd5dfb4c002d0b5d1f5d243f35f0cd00ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119629.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25889355/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093415001433; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093415001433; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2015.04.007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["iiPCR system","iiPCR method","molecular detection of CPV","iiPCR reaction","circulating CPV","b DNA","Limit of detection","detection limits","b strain","on-site detection","in-house real-time PCR","real-time PCR-positive sample","Test results of real-time PCR","nucleic acid detection","canine pathogens","c strains","excellent sensitivity","Reaction sensitivity","insulated isothermal PCR","plasmid DNA","canine fecal clinical samples","fecal samples","FPV","assay specificity","copies of standard DNA","Canine parvovirus type","accurate PON","user-friendly system","excellent agreement","effective disease management","acute enteric disease","Non-targeted pathogens","technology","feline panleukopenia virus","sensitive diagnosis","points of need","serial dilutions","useful tool","potential","field-deployable","performance","wild animals","conclusion","feces","subtypes","methods"],"language":"en"},

In vivo studies showed increased susceptibility to MHV3 acute disease of C57Bl 6 and ( C57Bl 6 \u00D7 A J )F1 animals challenged with the pesticide. Significant decrease of mean time of death in dieldrin-exposed, MHV3-infected susceptible C57Bl 6 mice was observed similarly upon po or ip administration of a single, sublethal dose of dieldrin. In addition, decrease of humoral response to the virus was quantified by determination of anti-MHV3 IgG antibodies in spleen cell supernatant fractions and in blood sera of dieldrin-exposed C57Bl 6 mice. A single dose of dieldrin did not alter the in vivo resistance of A J animals to acute MHV3 disease. The resistant A J mice, however, showed increased mortality upon two subsequent exposures to dieldrin followed by infection with high lethal doses of MHV3.

However, the intrinsic activity of MHV3 restriction appeared to be affected in macrophages derived from dieldrin-treated animals: (i) peritoneal C57Bl 6 macrophages collected from the early phase of acute MHV3 disease contained increased MHV3 antigen and (ii) increased cytolysis was observed after in vitro MHV3 infection of macrophages originating from dieldrin-exposed C57Bl 6 mice.","publish_time":"1985-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krzystyniak, Krzystof; Hugo, Patrice; Flipo, Denis; Fournier, Michel","journal":"Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/68ed7fcee486b3e869c0088252cd8956d5872efa.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0041008X85903849; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0041008X85903849","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dieldrin-exposed C57Bl","MHV3 infection of macrophages","MHV3 acute disease of C57Bl","peritoneal C57Bl","MHV3-infected susceptible C57Bl","increased MHV3 antigen","single dose of dieldrin","J animals","J mice","H-radiolabeled MHV3","dieldrin-treated animals","mouse peritoneal macrophages","organochlorine pesticide dieldrin","sublethal dose of dieldrin","early phase of acute MHV3 disease","intrinsic activity of MHV3 restriction","high lethal doses of MHV3","blood sera of dieldrin","determination of anti-MHV3 IgG antibodies","affector activities of peritoneal macrophages","F1 animals","increased susceptibility","increased mortality","J strains of different genetic resistance","studies","mouse hepatitis virus","Phagocytic activity","cell adherence capacity","spleen cell supernatant fractions","Significant decrease of mean time of death","uptake","attachment","subsequent exposures","ip administration","body wt","humoral response","Abstract Interaction","cytolysis","addition","cells"],"language":"en"},

Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Methods In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Findings Of 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included. The mean age of the 52 patients was 59\u00B77 (SD 13\u00B73) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever. 32 (61\u00B75%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3\u201311) days for non-survivors. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64\u00B76 years [11\u00B72] vs 51\u00B79 years [12\u00B79]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively. Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax. 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation. Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13\u00B75%) patients. Interpretation The mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable. The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1\u20132 weeks after ICU admission. Older patients (\u003E65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.

Interventions such as proper hand and surface cleaning, better nutrition, sufficient numbers of nurses, better ventilator management, use of coated urinary and central venous catheters and use of high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters have all been associated with significantly lower nosocomial infection rates. Multiple infection control techniques and strategies simultaneously (\u2018bundling\u2019) may offer the best opportunity to reduce the morbidity and mortality toll of HAIs. Most of these infection control strategies will more than pay for themselves by saving the medical costs associated with nosocomial infections. Many non-pharmacological interventions to prevent many HAIs will also reduce the need for long or multiple-drug antibiotic courses for patients.

METHODS: The study included 680 South African patients randomly selected in age\u2010defined categories from hospitalised patients enrolled through SARI surveillance during 2012 to 2013. A multiplex reverse transcription real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction assay was used to detect hBoV; hCoV\u2010OC43, hCoV\u2010229E, hCoV\u2010NL63, and hCoV\u2010HKU1; and Washington University hPyV (hPyV\u2010WU) and Karolinska Insitute hPyV (hPyV\u2010KI), in respiratory tract specimens collected from patients with SARI. All respiratory specimens from patients enrolled through SARI surveillance were also routinely tested by multiplex reverse transcription real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction for adenovirus; enterovirus; human metapneumovirus; parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3; respiratory syncytial virus; rhinovirus; influenza A, and influenza B. RESULTS: Human bocavirus, hCoV\u2010229E, and hPyV\u2010WU were detected in 3.7% (25/680), 4.1% (28/680), and 4.1% (28/680) of respiratory specimens, respectively. All other viruses were detected in \u003C2% of specimens. Rhinovirus was the most common coinfecting virus (21.4%\u201060.7%), followed by adenovirus (21.4%\u201039.3%), and respiratory syncytial virus (10.7%\u201024.0%). Testing for the additional viruses (hBoV, hCoV, and hPyV) decreased the number of specimens that initially tested negative by 2.9% (20/680). CONCLUSION: Inclusion of laboratory tests for hBoV, hCoV\u2010229E, and hPyV\u2010WU in differential testing algorithms for surveillance and diagnostics for suspected cases of respiratory illness of unknown cause may improve our understanding of the etiology of SARI, especially in a country like South Africa with a high number of immune compromised persons.","publish_time":"2018-07-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Subramoney, Kathleen; Hellferscee, Orienka; Pretorius, Marthi; Tempia, Stefano; McMorrow, Meredith; von Gottberg, Anne; Wolter, Nicole; Variava, Ebrahim; Dawood, Halima; Kahn, Kathleen; Walaza, Sibongile; Madhi, Shabir A.; Cohen, Cheryl; Venter, Marietjie; Treurnicht, Florette K.","journal":"Health Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/66a3eded4d7bae681a0079a333c4acb75fe05828.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6266378.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30623094/; https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.59","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARI","Washington University","Karolinska Insitute"],"locations":["South Africa"],"keyphrases":["hCoV","respiratory specimens","respiratory syncytial virus","respiratory tract specimens","hBoV","SARI surveillance","number of specimens","Washington University hPyV","Karolinska Insitute hPyV","hospitalised patients","human metapneumovirus","human coronaviruses","human polyomaviruses","WU","South African patients","etiology of SARI","severe acute respiratory illness","prevalence of human bocavirus","suspected cases of respiratory illness of unknown cause","parainfluenza virus types","adenovirus","rhinovirus","common coinfecting virus","multiplex reverse transcription real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction assay","additional viruses","tested negative","differential testing algorithms","high number of immune compromised persons","diagnostics","enterovirus","age","KI","defined categories","HKU1","RESULTS","Inclusion of laboratory tests","understanding","study","country","NL63","OC43","CONCLUSION","METHODS","AIM"],"language":"en"},

In this article we address this relative lack of attention, arguing that enhanced traffic control bundling (eTCB) can and should be adopted and implemented as a means of protecting LTCF residents and staff. Enhanced TCB has been widely applied in hospital settings and has proven effective at limiting droplet and fomite transmissions both within hospitals and between hospitals and the general community. By effectively adapting eTCB to LTCF conditions, particularly by incorporating compartmentalization within zones plus active surveillance, COVID-19 transmission into and throughout LTCFs can be minimized, thereby saving numerous lives among an especially vulnerable population.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yen, Muh-Yong; Schwartz, Jonathan; King, Chwan-Chuen; Lee, Chung-Ming; Hsueh, Po-Ren","journal":"J Microbiol Immunol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19cef41905b073d74606008c3cf4ad151e296b77.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194976.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.04.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32303480/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1684118220300979; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1684118220300979","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TCB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hospitals","general community","vulnerable community","heightened attention","little attention","COVID","eTCB","LTCFs","relative lack of attention","LTCF residents","LTCF conditions","Enhanced TCB","vulnerable population","enhanced traffic control bundling","public health scholars","compartmentalization","ways","elders","active surveillance","long-term care facilities","fomite transmissions","zones","droplet","outbreak","numerous lives","means","staff","hospital settings","article","spread","research"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 17 to February 9, 2020, 38 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were consecutively enrolled in our hospitals. All clinical data and the chest CT on admission were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Firstly, a quantitative method based on multi-scale convolutional neural networks was used to assess the infected lung segments and this was compared with the semi-quantitative method. Secondly, the quantitative method was tested with laboratory results and the pneumonia severity index (PSI) by correlation analyses. Thirdly, both quantitative and semi-quantitative parameters between patients with different PSI were compared. RESULTS: Thirty cases were finally enrolled: 16 (53.33%) of them were male, and the mean age was 48 years old. The interval from onset symptoms to first chest CT scan was 8 days. The proportion of ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation and the total lesion based on the quantitative method was positively correlated with the semi-quantitative CT score (P \u003C 0.001 for all; rs = 0.88, 0.87, 0.90), CRP (P = 0.0278, 0.0168, 0.0078; rs = 0.40, 0.43, 0.48) and ESR (P = 0.0296, 0.0408, 0.0048; rs = 0.46, 0.44, 0.58), respectively, and was negatively correlated with the lymphocyte count (P = 0.0222, 0.0024, 0.0068; rs = \u22120.42, \u22120.53, \u22120.48). There was a positive correlation trend between the proportion of total infection and the pneumonia severity index (P = 0.0994; rs = 0.30) and a tendency that patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia had higher percentage of consolidation and total infection (P = 0.0903, 0.0989).

So far, most published studies identified host factors primarily for single pathogens. Furthermore, often only a small subset of genes, e.g., genes encoding kinases, have been targeted. Identification of host factors on a pan-pathogen level, i.e., genes that are crucial for the replication of a diverse group of pathogens has received relatively little attention, despite the fact that such common host factors would be highly relevant, for instance, for devising broad-spectrum anti-pathogenic drugs. Here, we present a novel two-stage procedure for the identification of host factors involved in the replication of different viruses using a combination of random effects models and Markov random walks on a functional interaction network. We first infer candidate genes by jointly analyzing multiple perturbations screens while at the same time adjusting for high variance inherent in these screens. Subsequently the inferred estimates are spread across a network of functional interactions thereby allowing for the analysis of missing genes in the biological studies, smoothing the effect sizes of previously found host factors, and considering a priori pathway information defined over edges of the network. We applied the procedure to RNAi screening data of four different positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, Hepatitis C virus, Chikungunya virus, Dengue virus and Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and detected novel host factors, including UBC, PLCG1, and DYRK1B, which are predicted to significantly impact the replication cycles of these viruses. We validated the detected host factors experimentally using pharmacological inhibition and an additional siRNA screen and found that some of the predicted host factors indeed influence the replication of these pathogens.","publish_time":"2020-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dirmeier, Simon; D\u00E4chert, Christopher; van Hemert, Martijn; Tas, Ali; Ogando, Natacha S.; van Kuppeveld, Frank; Bartenschlager, Ralf; Kaderali, Lars; Binder, Marco; Beerenwinkel, Niko","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7034926.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32040506/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007587","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","UBC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel host factors","Identification of host factors","detected host factors","predicted host factors","common host factors","replication of different viruses","candidate genes","single pathogens","replication cycles","analysis of missing genes","small subset of genes","Dengue virus","Chikungunya virus","functional interaction network","network of functional interactions","different positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses","Hepatitis C virus","Genetic perturbation screens","multiple perturbations screens","diverse group of pathogens","RNA interference","biological studies","stage procedure","published studies","Markov random walks","RNAi screening data","combination of random effects models","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","pharmacological inhibition","time","UBC","effect sizes","pan-pathogen level","life cycle of bacteria","instance","additional siRNA screen","high variance inherent","pathway information","PLCG1","broad-spectrum anti-pathogenic drugs","little attention","edges","DYRK1B","inferred estimates","kinases"],"language":"en"},

Type III interferon, also known as lambda IFN (IFN-III or IFN-\u03BB), is a complementary pathway to the antiviral response by IFN-I. This work analyzed the IFN-\u03BB (IFN-III) mediated antiviral response against DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) infection. METHODS: Dengue fever patients were sampled to determine their IFN-\u03BB levels by ELISA. To study the IFN-\u03BB response during DENV infection we selected the epithelial cell line C33-A, and we demonstrated that it is permissive to DENV-2 infection. The effect of IFN-\u03BB on virus replication was determined in these cells, in parallel to the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), and Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS), genes measured by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: We found increased (~1.8 times) serological IFN-\u03BB in dengue fever patients compared to healthy blood donors. IFN-\u03BB inhibited DENV-2 replication in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. The reduction of viral titer corresponded with increased ISG mRNA levels (MX1 and OAS1), with the highest inhibition occurring at ISG\u2019s peak expression. Presence of IFN-negative regulators, SOCS1 and SOCS3, during DENV-2 infection was associated with reduced IFN-\u03BB1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence described here suggests that IFN-\u03BB is a good candidate inhibitor of viral replication in dengue infection. Mechanisms for the cellular and organismal interplay between DENV and IFN- \u03BB need to be further studied as they could provide insights into strategies to treat this disease. Furthermore, we report a novel epithelial model to study dengue infection in vitro.","publish_time":"2015-09-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Palma-Ocampo, Helen K.; Flores-Alonso, Juan C.; Vallejo-Ruiz, Ver\u00F3nica; Reyes-Leyva, Julio; Flores-Mendoza, Lilian; Herrera-Camacho, Irma; Rosas-Murrieta, Nora H.; Santos-L\u00F3pez, Gerardo","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f057fa2845067210cbd31e79d8a83cdff0aa96f1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4584467.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26411318/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-015-0383-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV","ISG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN- \u03BB","expression of IFN","IFN-\u03BB response","IFN-\u03BB levels","serological IFN-\u03BB","Presence of IFN","effect of IFN","lambda IFN","IFN-\u03BB inhibited DENV","DENV infection","reduced IFN-\u03BB1 expression","study dengue infection","DENV serotype","dengue virus","Dengue fever patients","antiviral response","virus replication","viral disease","interferon","good candidate inhibitor of viral replication","reduction of viral titer","ISG\u2019s peak expression","increased ISG mRNA levels","stimulated genes","cellular level","novel epithelial model","epithelial cell line C33","OAS1","organismal interplay","highest inhibition","MX1","negative regulators","ISGs","SOCS3","SOCS1","healthy blood donors","complementary pathway","Suppressor of Cytokine","cells","times","work","dose-dependent manner","Mechanisms","METHODS","BACKGROUND","ability","ELISA","RT-qPCR","insights","strategies","Evidence","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The virus was considered to be of high importance and the number of new cases were tracked using different mechanisms by stakeholders such as veterinary services from the provincial government and the swine industry. In addition to the initial date of infection, veterinary organizations in the swine industry maintained a disease control program (DCP) database that contained the date of declaration of freedom from PEDV in individual herds. Such data allowed for the determination of the duration of PEDV infection in individual herds based on herd type, year and season of diagnosis. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine time to PEDV elimination in Ontario swine herds infected between 2014 and 2017, on the basis of records from the DCP database; and to identify factors associated with the likelihood of elimination. Duration of time to eliminate PEDV was estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The final Cox\u0027s proportional hazard model included herd type, season and year of diagnosis. The hazard of PEDV elimination for premises that were farrow-to-wean was 3.36 times larger (P-value: 0.044, 95% CI: 1.03, 10.93) than for farrow-to-feeder herds. Herds diagnosed in the summer and fall had hazard ratios of 1.40 (P-value: 0.044, 95% CI: 1.03, 10.93) and 7.32 (P-value: \u003C0.001, 95% CI: 3.12, 17.18), respectively compared to herds diagnosed in the winter months. The hazard ratio for herds diagnosed in 2015 was 0.54 (P-value: 0.015, 95% CI: 0.33, 0.89) compared to herds diagnosed in 2014. Factors associated with time to elimination are likely reflective of the complexity of infection control practices applied in herds with different demographics and population structures, seasonal variability in the pathogen transmissibility, and the availability of resources to manage an emerging production-limiting disease. The median times to elimination were relatively long, which could be due to how it was measured, decisions made at the level of individual herds or delays related to reporting PEDV elimination. Design of control measures for production-limiting diseases at the regional level should take these factors into consideration.","publish_time":"2019-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perri, Amanda M.; Poljak, Zvonimir; Dewey, Cate; Harding, John C.

Data entry and analysis were performed using Epi info software. RESULTS: A total of 56 HCWs were interviewed. The mean age was 31 years (SD \u00B1 8.16 years). The majority of the HCWs (80%; n = 45) were aged 18\u201339 years. Most were community health extension workers (60%), and 3.6% (n = 2) were medical doctors. Many of the HCWs had less than 2 years of work experience (42%). Additionally, 82% of the respondents had \u003C1 week of cholera emergency response training, and 50% of the HCWs managed \u003E20 suspected cases of cholera per day. Although 78% of HCWs reported the practice of universal safety precautions, 32% (n = 18) knew HCWs who developed symptoms of cholera during the epidemic, most of which was believed to be hospital acquired (78%). We also found that 77% (n = 43) of HCWs had no access to the required emergency response supplies. CONCLUSION: Inadequate training, a lack of qualified HCWs and a limited supply of emergency response kits were reported. Therefore, the government and stakeholders should address the gaps noted to adequately control and prevent future epidemics.","publish_time":"2012-10-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oladele, David A.; Oyedeji, Kolawole S.; Niemogha, Mary-Theresa; Nwaokorie, Francisca; Bamidele, Moses; Musa, Adesola Z.; Adeneye, Adeniyi K.; Bamidele, Tajudeen A.; Ochoga, Michael; Akinsinde, Kehinde A.; Brai, Bartholomew I.; Omonigbehin, Emmanuel A.; Fesobi, Toun W.; Smith, Stella I.; Ujah, Innocent A.","journal":"J Infect Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc99fbad2dc02c8b3848fcd294a00c91fc7b4fde.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102686.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034112000895; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034112000895; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2012.06.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23164563/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Nigeria"],"keyphrases":["lack of qualified HCWs","week of cholera emergency response training","emergency response of health care workers","required emergency response supplies","cholera outbreak","symptoms of cholera","limited supply of emergency response kits","suspected cases of cholera","years of work experience","Inadequate training","community health extension workers","Data entry","case management","case fatality rate","analysis","people","access","practice of universal safety precautions","northern Nigeria","SD","cross-sectional study","Epi info software","CFR","CONCLUSION","mean age","day","self-administered questionnaire","government","stakeholders","gaps","METHOD","medical doctors","BACKGROUND","respondents","RESULTS","total","future epidemics","majority","hospital"],"language":"en"},

We identified \u03B1\u2010actinin\u20104, a host cytoskeletal protein, as an interacting partner of IAV nucleoprotein (NP). We confirmed this interaction using co\u2010immunoprecipitation studies, first in a coupled in vitro transcription\u2010translation assay and then in cells either transiently co\u2010expressing the two proteins or infected with whole IAV. Importantly, the NP\u2013actinin\u20104 interaction was observed in several IAV subtypes, including the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus. Moreover, immunofluorescence studies revealed that both NP and actinin\u20104 co\u2010localized largely around the nucleus and also in the cytoplasmic region of virus\u2010infected A549 cells. Silencing of actinin\u20104 expression resulted in not only a significant decrease in NP, M2 and NS1 viral protein expression, but also a reduction of both NP mRNA and viral RNA levels, as well as viral titers, 24 h post\u2010infection with IAV, suggesting that actinin\u20104 was critical for viral replication. Furthermore, actinin\u20104 depletion reduced the amount of NP localized in the nucleus. Treatment of infected cells with wortmannin, a known inhibitor of actinin\u20104, led to a decrease in NP mRNA levels and also caused the nuclear retention of NP, further strengthening our previous observations. Taken together, the results of the present study indicate that actinin\u20104, a novel interacting partner of IAV NP, plays a crucial role in viral replication and this interaction may participate in nuclear localization of NP and/or viral ribonucleoproteins.

Proper attention to the growth of heifers is paramount to producing heifers that achieve adequate stature and body weight before first breeding and calving. Timely entry of heifers into the milking herd by 2 years of age, or their first eligible calving season in seasonal pasture-based dairy enterprises, can be facilitated by applying synchronization of estrus and ovulation in addition to traditional detection of estrus by visual or other means. Because fertility is better in heifers than in lactating cows, artificial insemination of heifers with semen from the best available progeny-tested bulls is a wise investment to ensure genetic gain of economically important traits. Annual culling rates of 25\u201333% necessitate a supply of herd replacement heifers. Application of gender-biased semen to produce more female offspring is also warranted for increasing the replacement population. The main goal of a heifer replacement program is to develop heifers at minimal cost and in a timely manner to obtain heifers of desired size and body weight so that they attain puberty, establish pregnancy, calve easily, and achieve their maximum genetic lifetime milk production as cows.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stevenson, J.

For patients at risk for asthma, or with existing asthma, viral respiratory tract infections can have a profound effect on the expression of disease or loss of control. New evidence has shown that wheezing episodes early in life with the common cold virus, human rhinovirus, is a major risk factor for the later diagnosis of asthma at age six years. For those with existing asthma, exacerbations are a major cause of morbidity, need for acute care and, rarely, death. Viral respiratory tract infections, most frequently with rhinovirus, are the predominant microorganisms associated with asthma exacerbations. Evidence is also emerging that deficiencies in antiviral activity and the integrity of the airway epithelial barrier may make individuals with asthma more likely to have severe viral respiratory infections of the lower airway, and thus increase the risk of exacerbation. Given the influences of respiratory viruses on many aspects of asthma, efforts to understand the mechanisms and risk factors by which these airway infections cause changes in airway pathophysiology are a first step in improved treatment.","publish_time":"2010-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Busse, William W.; Lemanske, Robert F.; Gern, James E.","journal":"The Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43913d3de280bbe325e4e0a8f9e6e50dbfd342b3.json; document_parses/pdf_json/aa9cce366595c48e1d45e1e75786d8c2ff5f61a3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2972660.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20816549/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673610613803; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2972660?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(10)61380-3; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673610613803","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["airway infections","existing asthma","asthma exacerbations","Viral respiratory tract infections","aspects of asthma","severe viral respiratory infections","later diagnosis of asthma","airway pathophysiology","lower airway","risk factors","risk of exacerbation","major risk factor","influences of respiratory viruses","airway epithelial barrier","major cause of morbidity","human rhinovirus","New evidence","integrity","common cold virus","profound effect","expression of disease","life","individuals","wheezing episodes","deficiencies","step","age","mechanisms","efforts","predominant microorganisms","changes","acute care","antiviral activity","self-limited illnesses","loss of control","years","improved treatment","death","patients"],"language":"en"},

In addition, the foreseeable shortage of supplies and an increasing flow of suspected and real cases of COVID-19 contribute to the pressures and concerns of health professionals. METHOD: : The studies were identified in well-known international journals found in two electronic databases: Scopus and Embase. The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. RESULTS: : Work-related stress is a potential cause of concern for health professionals. It has been associated with anxiety including multiple clinical activities, depression in the face of the coexistence of countless deaths, long work shifts with the most diverse unknowns and demands in the treatment with patients with COVID-19. Therefore, it is an important indicator of psychic exhaustion. CONCLUSIONS: : As coronavirus cases increase and deaths surge in Italy, new figures show an \u0022enormous\u0022 level of contagion among the country\u0027s medical personnel. At least 2,629 health workers have been infected with coronavirus since the outbreak onset in February, representing 8.3% of total cases. The percentage of infected health workers has almost doubled the number registered in China throughout the epidemic.

Study design We collected 143 respiratory samples from 120 symptomatic immunocompromised patients. Samples for which conventional and TAC results were discordant underwent further verification testing. Results The TAC assay identified viral pathogens in more samples than did conventional testing (77/143 versus 27/143; McNemar P \u003C0.0001), even when TAC results for viruses that could not be detected by conventional testing were excluded from analysis (59/143 versus 26/143; P \u003C0.0001). In addition, the TAC assay identified 18 samples with non-viral pathogens. Verification testing confirmed positive TAC results for 50 out of 55 samples for which conventional testing was negative. Two out of three samples with a positive conventional test but negative TAC result were confirmed positive. A viral and a total pathogen co-infection rate of 5.6% and 11.8% were found, respectively. Conclusions The customized TAC assay resulted in a significantly increased identification of respiratory viruses. This study provides a practical real-life assessment of the performance of the TAC assay in a population for whom rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral and atypical pathogens is crucial for appropriate clinical management.","publish_time":"2015-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Steensels, Deborah; Reynders, Marijke; Descheemaeker, Patrick; Curran, Martin D.; Jacobs, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9rique; Denis, Olivier; Delforge, Marie-Luce; Montesinos, Isabel","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5acc0f86359466e9ffbde510a34f2f4194905fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106552.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653215006575; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26364158/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2015.08.022; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653215006575","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TAC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["positive TAC results","customized TAC assay","respiratory samples","negative TAC result","performance of routine conventional testing","Conventional tests","verification testing","non-viral pathogens","positive conventional test","viral culture","accurate diagnosis of viral","atypical pathogens","Abstract Background Respiratory viral infections","number of detectable pathogens","increased identification of respiratory viruses","symptomatic immunocompromised patients","customized TaqMan","Study design","McNemar P","direct fluorescent antibody assays","significant morbidity","array card","real-time PCR method","mortality","population","total pathogen co-infection rate","appropriate clinical management","poor sensitivity","practical real-life assessment","institutions","long turnaround time","Conclusions","analysis","Objectives","bacteria","fungi","addition"],"language":"en"},

HCV replication cycle is closely tied to lipid metabolism and infection by this virus causes profound changes in host lipid homeostasis. We focused our attention on a phosphatidate phosphate (PAP) enzyme family (the lipin family), which mediate the conversion of phosphatidate to diacylglycerol in the cytoplasm, playing a key role in triglyceride biosynthesis and in phospholipid homeostasis. Lipins may also translocate to the nucleus to act as transcriptional regulators of genes involved in lipid metabolism. The best-characterized member of this family is lipin1, which cooperates with lipin2 to maintain glycerophospholipid homeostasis in the liver. Lipin1-deficient cell lines were generated by RNAi to study the role of this protein in different steps of HCV replication cycle. Using surrogate models that recapitulate different aspects of HCV infection, we concluded that lipin1 is rate limiting for the generation of functional replicase complexes, in a step downstream primary translation that leads to early HCV RNA replication. Infection studies in lipin1-deficient cells overexpressing wild type or phosphatase-defective lipin1 proteins suggest that lipin1 phosphatase activity is required to support HCV infection. Finally, ultrastructural and biochemical analyses in replication-independent models suggest that lipin1 may facilitate the generation of the membranous compartment that contains functional HCV replicase complexes.","publish_time":"2018-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mingorance, Lidia; Castro, Victoria; \u00C1vila-P\u00E9rez, Gin\u00E9s; Calvo, Gema; Rodriguez, Mar\u00EDa Josefa; Carrascosa, Jos\u00E9 L.; P\u00E9rez-del-Pulgar, Sof\u00EDa; Forns, Xavier; Gastaminza, Pablo","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a62150169f3f45fa30e13124ba0ff6c1945f5c0e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6161900.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30226904/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007284","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different aspects of HCV infection","lipin1 phosphatase activity","lipin1-deficient cells","functional HCV replicase complexes","early HCV RNA replication","different steps of HCV replication cycle","Infection studies","phosphatase-defective lipin1 proteins","Lipin1-deficient cell lines","lipid metabolism","replication-independent models","host lipid homeostasis","enzyme family","generation of functional replicase complexes","lipin family","glycerophospholipid homeostasis","key role","phosphatidate phosphate","surrogate models","conversion of phosphatidate","Hepatitis C virus","major etiologic agent of chronic liver disease","wild type","cirrhosis","PAP","profound changes","membranous compartment","triglyceride biosynthesis","biochemical analyses","primary translation","hepatocellular carcinoma","transcriptional regulators of genes","cytoplasm","RNAi","significant health burden","nucleus","diacylglycerol","attention","lipin2","member","rate","best","Lipins"],"language":"en"},

The dominant response (25/26 subjects) was specific to the EBOV nucleocapsid protein (NP).

The macro domain proteins are ubiquitously present from prokaryotes to human and in many positive-strand RNA viruses, playing important roles in multiple cellular processes. Towards understanding the function of the HEV macro domain, we characterized its interaction partners among other HEV encoded proteins. Here, we report that the HEV X-domain directly interacts with the viral methyltransferase and the ORF3 proteins. ORF3 association with the X-domain was mediated through two independent motifs, located within its N-terminal 35aa (amino acids) and C-terminal 63-123aa. Methyltransferase interaction domain was mapped to N-terminal 30-90aa. The X-domain interacted with both ORF3 and methyltransferase through its C-terminal region, involving 66(th),67(th) isoleucine and 101(st),102(nd) leucine, conserved across HEV genotypes. Furthermore, ORF3 and methyltransferase competed with each other for associating with the X-domain. These findings provide molecular understanding of the interaction between the HEV macro domain, methyltransferase and ORF3, suggesting an important role of the macro domain in the life cycle of HEV.","publish_time":"2016-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anang, Saumya; Subramani, Chandru; Nair, Vidya P.; Kaul, Sheetal; Kaushik, Nidhi; Sharma, Chandresh; Tiwari, Ashutosh; Ranjith-Kumar, CT; Surjit, Milan","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e1f84229bcacd4ea32af6127963a174f888acb09.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4844956.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27113483/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep25133","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Y.

ABSTRACT Introduction Rotavirus is the main cause of severe diarrhea in children aged less than 5 years, leading to elevated morbidity and mortality worldwide. The aim of the present study was to determine the etiology of enteric viruses reported to the Catalan Microbiology Notification System (CMNS) (rotavirus and adenovirus 40-41) and to evaluate the importance of these viruses in enteric disease. Material and methods We retrospectively reviewed the notifications made from 1995-2002 by the laboratories of hospitals participating in the CMNS. Cases of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) were diagnosed by antigen detection in stools. The variables analyzed were: age, sex, month, and year of isolation. Statistical analysis was performed using the X2 test and Fisher\u0027s test and proportions were compared using the binomial test. The level of statistical significance was set at 0.05. Results Rotavirus was detected in 6708 cases of AGE (94.3%) and adenovirus 40-41 in 409 (5.7%). Viral AGE produced greater morbidity in children aged less than 2 years with 76% of cases caused by rotavi-rus and 68% of those caused by adenovirus 40-41 occurring in this age group. Rotavirus was isolated mainly in winter (68%), while adenovi-rus, although stable throughout the seasons, was more frequent in autumn (35.2%). Of cases of bacterial and viral enteritis detected by the CMNS, rotavirus was the second etiological agent and adenovirus the fourth in children aged less than 5 years after Campylobacter and Salmonella. Conclusions Of the various viruses that can cause AGE, some are highly frequent, such as calcivirus and astrovirus, which are not systematically detected and consequently the frequencies reported in the present study should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, rotavirus is the main cause of viral AGE, affecting small children, especially infants aged 1-11 months, with a clear predominance in winter. Adenovirus 40-41 mainly affects children aged less than 2 years and is more frequent in autumn. Vaccination against rotavirus should be a priority to reduce the high rates of morbidity and mortality caused by this disease.","publish_time":"2004-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ciruela, P.; Izquierdo, C.; Oviedo, M.; Dom\u00EDnguez, A.","journal":"Vacunas","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50a8e43f80a2a77991bf1e32c3cbfb0d08c3cf66.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1576988704703519; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1576988704703519; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288702/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1576-9887(04)70351-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Fisher","autumn"],"organizations":["Sistema de Notificaci\u00F3n Microbiol\u00F3gica de Catalu\u00F1a"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rotavirus and adenovirus","by the","the main","the etiology of enteric","The aim of the present study was","the importance of these","of hospitals participating in the CMNS","cases of AGE","in enteric","Results Rotavirus was detected in","and year of isolation","occurring in","of those caused by adenovirus","Rotavirus was isolated mainly in winter","The variables analyzed were","Cases of acute gastroenteritis","was performed using the X2 test and Fisher\u0027s test and proportions were compared using the binomial test","The level of statistical significance was set at","ABSTRACT Introduction Rotavirus","ni\u00F1os menores","of cases caused by rotavi","frequent in autumn","of severe diarrhea in children aged less than","although stable throughout the seasons","the Catalan Microbiology Notification System","gastroenteritis viral","ni\u00F1os peque\u00F1os menores","Material and methods We retrospectively reviewed the notifications made from","were diagnosed by antigen detection in stools","test de Fisher","age group","SNMC","Viral AGE produced greater morbidity in children aged less than","elevated morbidity and mortality worldwide","gastroenteritis agudas virales","casos de gastroenteritis aguda","mayor morbilidad","virus ent\u00E9ricos","elevada morbilidad","oto\u00F1o","Respecto","invierno","principal causa de diarrea grave","alto \u00EDndice de morbilidad","cuarta causa etiol\u00F3gica","years with","prueba binomial","mayor frecuencia","frecuencias elevadas","variables analizadas","enfermedad ent\u00E9rica","m\u00E9todos estad\u00EDsticos","grupo de edad","mortalidad a escala mundial","leading","reported","month","while adenovi","Catalu\u00F1a","poder","calici","Sistema de Notificaci\u00F3n Microbiol\u00F3gica","nivel de significaci\u00F3n estad\u00EDstica","RESUMEN Introducci\u00F3n","contexto","sexo","detecci\u00F3n de ant\u00EDgeno","epidemiolog\u00EDa","vida","proporciones","edades tempranas","trabajo","laboratorios","estaciones","heces","claro predominio","declaraciones","hospitales","astrovirus","vacunaci\u00F3n","Campylobacter","Salmonella","objetivo","importancia","aislamiento","prudencia","Conclusiones","Resultados","the high","years and","Conclusions Of the various","not systematically detected and consequently the","Of cases of bacterial and viral enteritis detected by the CMNS","rotavirus was the second etiological agent and adenovirus the fourth in children aged less than","of viral AGE","of morbidity and mortality caused by","years after Campylobacter and Salmonella","reported in the present study should be interpreted with caution","such as calcivirus and astrovirus","mainly affects children aged less than","with a clear predominance in winter","affecting small children","especially infants aged","Vaccination against rotavirus should be a priority","highly frequent","which","that can","some","months","Nevertheless"],"language":"es"},

The SARS-CoV genome is predicted to contain 14 functional open reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF (1a and 1b) encodes a large polyprotein that is cleaved into nonstructural proteins (nsp). The other ORFs encode for four structural proteins (spike, membrane, nucleocapsid and envelope) as well as eight SARS-CoV-specific accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b). In this report we have cloned the predicted nsp8 gene and the ORF6 gene of the SARS-CoV and studied their abilities to interact with each other. We expressed the two proteins as fusion proteins in the yeast two-hybrid system to demonstrate protein\u2013protein interactions and tested the same using a yeast genetic cross. Further the strength of the interaction was measured by challenging growth of the positive interaction clones on increasing gradients of 2-amino trizole. The interaction was then verified by expressing both proteins separately in-vitro in a coupled-transcription translation system and by coimmunoprecipitation in mammalian cells. Finally, colocalization experiments were performed in SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 mammalian cells to confirm the nsp8\u2013ORF6 interaction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the interaction between a SARS-CoV accessory protein and nsp8 and our findings suggest that ORF6 protein may play a role in virus replication.","publish_time":"2007-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Purnima; Gunalan, Vithiagaran; Liu, Boping; Chow, Vincent T.K.; Druce, Julian; Birch, Chris; Catton, Mike; Fielding, Burtram C.; Tan, Yee-Joo; Lal, Sunil K.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/82f87f9e25518fb169113d7e891a5f8106e82133.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103355.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682207003145; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682207003145","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV accessory protein","SARS-CoV genome","ORF6 interaction","ORF6 protein","nonstructural proteins","fusion proteins","specific accessory proteins","SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 mammalian cells","ORF6 gene","protein interactions","predicted nsp8 gene","positive interaction clones","ORFs","report","hybrid system","severe outbreak","yeast genetic cross","coupled-transcription translation system","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome","increasing gradients","coronavirus","spike","membrane","coimmunoprecipitation","challenging growth","findings","functional open reading frames","nucleocapsid","vitro","envelope","role","large polyprotein","amino trizole","regions","virus replication","colocalization experiments","world","knowledge","abilities","best","strength"],"language":"en"},

The most active compounds of these four types of inhibitors could both form several hydrogen bonds with residues His90, Arg513, Leu352 and Arg120, and develop hydrophobic interaction with residues Phe518, Leu352 and Leu359. This is consistent with the investigation reported by R. G. Kurumbail et al. (Nature. 1996, 384, 644\u2010648). A common 3D\u2010QSAR model could be constructed with these four categories of COX\u20102 inhibitors using the method of docking\u2010 guided conformer selection.

Furthermore, a HQSAR model was used to evaluate the influence of substituents on anti\u2010inflammatory activity.

The identification of co-infections in dogs is important to determine the prognosis and to plan strategies for their treatment and prophylaxis. Although many pathogens have been individually detected with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a comprehensive panel of agents that cause diarrhea in privately owned dogs has not yet been established. The objective of this study was to use a real-time PCR diarrhea panel to survey the frequencies of pathogens and co-infections in owned dogs attended in a veterinary hospital with and without diarrhea, as well the frequency in different countries. Feces samples were tested for canine distemper virus, canine coronavirus, canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin (CPA), Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., and Salmonella spp. using molecular techniques. RESULTS: In total, 104 diarrheic and 43 control dogs that were presented consecutively at a major private veterinary hospital were included in the study. Overall, 71/104 (68.3%) dogs with diarrhea were positive for at least one pathogen: a single infection in 39/71 dogs (54.9%) and co-infections in 32/71 dogs (45.1%), including 21/32 dogs (65.6%) with dual, 5/32 (15.6%) with triple, and 6/32 (18.8%) with quadruple infections. In the control group, 13/43 (30.2%) dogs were positive, all with single infections only. The most prevalent pathogens in the diarrheic dogs were CPA (40/104 dogs, 38.5%), CPV-2 (36/104 dogs, 34.6%), and Giardia spp. (14/104 dogs, 13.5%). CPV-2 was the most prevalent pathogen in the dual co-infections, associated with CPA, Cryptosporidium spp., or Giardia spp. No statistical difference (P = 0.8374) was observed in the duration of diarrhea or the number of deaths (P = 0.5722) in the presence or absence of single or co-infections. CONCLUSIONS: Diarrheic dogs showed a higher prevalence of pathogen infections than the controls. Whereas the healthy dogs had only single infections, about half the diarrheic dogs had co-infections. Therefore, multiple pathogens should be investigated in dogs presenting with diarrhea. The effects of multiple pathogens on the disease outcomes remain unclear because the rate of death and the duration of diarrhea did not seem to be affected by these factors.","publish_time":"2014-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gizzi, Aline Baumann da Rocha; Oliveira, Simone Tostes; Leutenegger, Christian M; Estrada, Marko; Kozemjakin, Denise Adamczyk; Stedile, Rafael; Marcondes, Mary; Biondo, Alexander Welker","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b54ab920006bd7dceb8851d37e0eef82d3711534.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3896730.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-10-23; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24433321/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs0NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diarrheic dogs","owned dogs","control dogs","healthy dogs","single infections","dual co-infections","identification of co-infections","quadruple infections","duration of diarrhea","Infectious diarrhea","higher prevalence of pathogen infections","real-time PCR diarrhea panel","prevalent pathogens","CPA","frequencies of pathogens","Giardia","CPV","effects of multiple pathogens","absence of single","canine coronavirus","Cryptosporidium","study","canine distemper virus","canine parvovirus type","major private veterinary hospital","control group","comprehensive panel of agents","real-time polymerase chain reaction","disease outcomes","bacteria","Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin","rate of death","protozoan organisms","presence","Feces samples","number of deaths","strategies","viruses","Salmonella","statistical difference","frequency","total","prognosis","controls","CONCLUSIONS","treatment","prophylaxis","molecular techniques","different countries","combination","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","objective","triple","factors"],"language":"en"},

Many infected infants require hospitalisation and those living in regional centres frequently require transfer to metropolitan hospitals capable of providing assisted ventilation. METHOD: We reviewed infants with bronchiolitis transported by the Victorian Newborn Emergency Transport Service between January 2003 and June 2007. We compared the clinical presentation and treatment required by infants born preterm with those of their term counterparts. RESULTS: Of the 192 infants transported, 92 were born preterm. Preterm infants were younger at time of transport (mean post\u2010menstrual age 41 weeks vs. 45 weeks) and were more likely to require invasive ventilation (60% vs. 32%, P \u003C 0.001) and to receive a fluid bolus (47% vs. 34%, P = 0.04) when compared with infants who had been born at term.

Empirical selection of antibiotic treatment is the cornerstone of management of patients with pneumonia. To reduce the misuse of antibiotics, antibiotic resistance, and side-effects, an empirical, effective, and individualised antibiotic treatment is needed. Follow-up after the start of antibiotic treatment is also important, and management should include early shifts to oral antibiotics, stewardship according to the microbiological results, and short-duration antibiotic treatment that accounts for the clinical stability criteria.

Available evidence demonstrates clearly that viral infection of the CNS results in a dramatic increase in chemokine gene expression. Moreover, production of chemokines in response to infection is highly focused within areas of viral replication early in the disease process and areas of viral RNA persistence during the chronic stages of disease. Resident glial cells are capable of generating a robust chemokine response following viral infection in the absence of inflammatory cells suggesting that this response may reflect an innate CNS response against viral infection analogous to the response of phagocytic cells in the periphery. Differences in virus and cellular tropism are likely explanations for the slight differences in chemokine profiles and duration of expression observed in the different models. The non-ELR CXC chemokine CXCL10 is often the predominant chemokine expressed early following viral infection suggesting an important role as a sentinel molecule in initiating neuroinflammation. Based on the studies presented in this chapter, it is clear that targeting chemokines during either acute or chronic viral-induced CNS disease may offer exciting new insights into potentially novel interventional mechanisms in treating human neuroinflammatory diseases.","publish_time":"2002-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lane, Thomas E.; Buchmeier, Michael J.","journal":"Universes in Delicate Balance","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30283372002d68c96275b39ce208c4b56cd461b7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444510020500154; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780444510020500154","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs1MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","CXC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral infection analogous","robust chemokine response","early following viral infection","predominant chemokine","chemokine profiles","areas of viral replication","innate CNS response","chemokine gene expression","chronic viral-induced CNS disease","response of phagocytic cells","areas of viral RNA persistence","functional significance of chemokine expression","CNS results","non-ELR CXC chemokine CXCL10","disease process","chronic stages of disease","duration of expression","chapter","absence of inflammatory cells","Resident glial cells","slight differences","production of chemokines","novel interventional mechanisms","exciting new insights","important role","likely explanations","dramatic increase","cellular tropism","central nervous system","sentinel molecule","virus","emphasis","human neuroinflammatory diseases","initiating neuroinflammation","periphery","Available evidence","host defense","different models","Publisher Summary","neuropathology","studies"],"language":"en"},

We developed consensus statements to guide clinicians managing lung cancer screening programs and patients with lung nodules during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods An expert panel of 24 members, including pulmonologists (17), thoracic radiologists (5), and thoracic surgeons (2) was formed. The panel was provided with an overview of current evidence, summarized by recent guidelines related to lung cancer screening and lung nodule evaluation. The panel was convened by video teleconference to discuss then vote on statements related to 12 common clinical scenarios. A pre-defined threshold of 70% of panel members voting agree or strongly agree was used to determine if there was a consensus for each statement. Items that may influence decisions were listed as notes to be considered for each scenario. Results Twelve statements related to baseline and annual lung cancer screening (2), surveillance of a previously detected lung nodule (5), evaluation of intermediate and high risk lung nodules (4), and management of clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer (1) were developed and modified. All 12 statements were confirmed as consensus statements by voting results. The consensus statements provide guidance about situations where it was felt to be appropriate to delay screening, defer surveillance imaging of lung nodules, and minimize non-urgent interventions during the evaluation of lung nodules and stage I non-small cell lung cancer. Conclusions There was consensus that during the COVID-19 pandemic it is appropriate to defer enrollment in lung cancer screening and modify the evaluation of lung nodules due to the added risks from potential exposure and the need for resource reallocation. There are multiple local, regional, and patient related factors that should be considered when applying these statements to individual patient care.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mazzone, Peter J.; Gould, Michael K.; Arenberg, Douglas A.; Chen, Alexander C.; Choi, Humberto K.; Detterbeck, Frank C.; Farjah, Farhood; Fong, Kwun M.; Iaccarino, Jonathan M.; Janes, Samuel M.; Kanne, Jeffrey P.; Kazerooni, Ella A.; MacMahon, Heber; Naidich, David P.; Powell, Charles A.; Raoof, Suhail; Rivera, M.

The utility of this approach is illustrated by two examples: one is similarity/dissimilarity comparison among different ND6 protein sequences based on their DV-curve figures the other is the phylogenetic analysis among coronaviruses based on their spike proteins.","publish_time":"2014-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deng, Wei; Luan, Yihui","journal":"Comput Math Methods Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8446bfae882d6ec192e572e9bbcb858eeae83cc8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4034481.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/203871; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24899916/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs1NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["representation of protein sequences","alphabet of protein sequences","quantitative comparison of protein sequences","different ND6 protein sequences","DV-curve","length of protein sequence","D-graphical representation","dual-vector curve","dissimilarity comparison","HP","numerical characterization","model of amino acids","coronaviruses","detailed hydrophobic-hydrophilic","degeneracy","vectors","good visualization","examples","phylogenetic analysis","matter","spike proteins","approach","utility"],"language":"en"},

However, the implementation aspect of strategy has attracted relatively less scholarly interest than strategic planning despite its critical role in achieving performance outcomes. Consequently, it is timely to provide an in-depth analysis of the strategy implementation literature. This is particularly the case in hospitality and tourism management where comprehensive literature reviews of strategy implementation have been lacking. To address the knowledge gap, the authors conduct a systematic literature review of 139 articles that appeared in 42 journals over the period 1988-2019. The items were grouped into six topic clusters with a view to generating novel research questions that have the potential to advance the field. We identify four main gaps that should be addressed and suggest prospective research directions.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aladag, Omer Faruk; K\u00F6seoglu, Mehmet Ali; King, Brian; Mehraliyev, Fuad","journal":"Int J Hosp Manag","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/29bec92aea51ad8f21219f79dd11dc81b705aa16.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7205733.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278431920301080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32390680/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhm.2020.102556; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278431920301080?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs1NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["strategy implementation literature","implementation aspect of strategy","comprehensive literature reviews of strategy implementation","effective implementation","hospitality","consistent strategy formulation","systematic literature review","tourism management","tourism organizations","novel research questions","prospective research directions","critical role","authors","business objectives","in-depth analysis","strategic planning","potential","articles","topic clusters","performance outcomes","case","knowledge gap","journals","items","main gaps","period","field"],"language":"en"},

This study used microarray-based transcriptomic analysis of PBMCs from experimentally infected pigs to explore the patterns of immune dysregulation after infection with two East European PRRSV strains from subtype 2 (BOR and ILI) in comparison to a Danish subtype 1 strain (DAN). Transcriptional profiles were determined at day 7 post infection in three tested groups of pigs and analysed in comparison with the expression profile of control group. Microarray analysis revealed differential regulation (\u003E 1.5-fold change) of 4253 and 7335 genes in groups infected with BOR and ILI strains, respectively, and of 12518 genes in pigs infected with Danish strain. Subtype 2 PRRSV strains showed greater induction of many genes, especially those involved in innate immunity, such as interferon stimulated antiviral genes and inflammatory markers. Functional analysis of the microarray data revealed a significant up-regulation of genes involved in processes such as acute phase response, granulocyte and agranulocyte adhesion and diapedesis, as well as down-regulation of genes enrolled in pathways engaged in protein synthesis, cell division, as well as B and T cell signaling. This study provided an insight into the host response to three different PRRSV strains at a molecular level and demonstrated variability between strains of different pathogenicity level.

The world is experiencing a major demographic shift towards an older, obese, and physically inactive populace. Risk factor assessments based on pandemic data indicate that those at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 include older males, and people of all ages with obesity and related comorbidities such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Aging in and of itself leads to negative changes in innate and adaptive immunity, a process termed immunosenescence. Obesity causes systemic inflammation and adversely impacts immune function and host defense in a way that patterns immunosenescence. Two primary prevention strategies to reduce the risk for COVID-19 at both the community and individual level include mitigation activities and the adoption of lifestyle practices consistent with good immune health. Animal and human studies support the idea that, in contrast to high exercise workloads, regular moderate-intensity physical activity improves immunosurveillance against pathogens and reduces morbidity and mortality from viral infection and respiratory illnesses including the common cold, pneumonia, and influenza. The odds are high that infectious disease pandemics spawned by novel pathogens will continue to inflict morbidity and mortality as the world\u0027s population becomes older and more obese. COVID-19 is indeed a wake-up call, a tocsin, to the world that primary prevention countermeasures focused on health behaviors and hygiene demand our full attention and support.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nieman, David C.","journal":"J Sport Health Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5792e14254bd86e31f15ffd0650f613ada373b3e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7205734.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254620300600?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32389882/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095254620300600; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jshs.2020.05.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs2NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","mortality","chronic respiratory illnesses","novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome","novel pathogens","widespread morbidity","severe illness","higher risk","older males","Coronavirus Disease","obesity","support","good immune health","primary prevention countermeasures","Risk factor assessments","primary prevention strategies","immune function","health behaviors","class of illness","patterns immunosenescence","high exercise workloads","infectious disease pandemics","regular moderate-intensity physical activity","adoption of lifestyle practices consistent","mitigation activities","adaptive immunity","immunosurveillance","host defense","pandemic data","viral infection","idea","hypertension","related comorbidities","ages","way","contrast","community","hygiene","SARS-CoV","world\u0027s population","major demographic shift","individual level","type","negative changes","process","pneumonia","systemic inflammation","odds","people","Animal","human studies","influenza","attention","tocsin","inactive populace","diabetes","wake","Aging"],"language":"en"},

Macrophages are one of the critical cells linking the innate and adaptive immune system, and it has been shown that MSCs can differentiate between pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype and anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype of macrophages. However, it has not yet been fully clarified whether these differentiated macrophages are functional. In this study, we compared the immunomodulatory effects on the CD4 T cells of M1, M2a and M2c macrophages with the macrophages that directly and indirectly cultured with MSCs. We analyzed the changes in CD14, CD64, CD80, CD163 and CD200R expression to evaluate macrophage phenotypes, and the changes in CD4, IFN-g, IL-4, IL-17a and FoxP3 expression to evaluate T helper subsets using the FACS method. The changes in IL-1b, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17a and IFN-g in the media supernatants were analyzed using the Luminex method. We also performed WST-1 and Caspase-3 ELISA analyses to observe the proliferation and apoptosis status of the T cells. MSCs were found to differentiate macrophages into a distinctive phenotype, which was close to the M2c phenotype, but was not considered as an M2c cell due to the low expression of CD163, a characteristic marker for M2c. While MEM-D, MEM-ID and MSCs showed similar inhibitory effects on the Th2 and Th17 cells, the most significant increase in Treg cell frequencies was seen in MEM-D cells. Macrophages can alter their phenotypes and functions according to the stimuli from the environment. The fact that macrophages educated with MSCs suppressed the production of all the cytokines we evaluated even after the removal of MSCs suggests that these cells may be differentiated by MSCs into a suppressive macrophage subgroup. However, the Treg cell activation caused by direct interactions between MSCs and macrophage cells may be the most prominent observation of this study compared to previous work. As a result, according to our data, the interactions between MSCs and macrophages may lead to differentiation of macrophage cells into an immunosuppressive phenotype, and these macrophages may suppress the T lymphocyte subgroups at least as effectively as MSCs. However, our data obtained from in vitro experiments should be supported by future in vivo studies.","publish_time":"2019-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u00D6zdemir, Rabia Bilge \u00D6zg\u00FCl; \u00D6zdemir, Alper Tunga; Sar\u0131boyac\u0131, Ayla Eker; Uysal, Onur; Tu\u011Flu, Mehmet \u0130brahim; K\u0131rmaz, Cengiz","journal":"Immunobiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8aba6975d8bd8819c2490dedf131893850f5aa1c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124282.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31072631/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0171298518302389; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0171298518302389; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imbio.2019.04.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs2OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FACS","Luminex"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["M2c macrophages","removal of MSCs","differentiated macrophages","Th17 cells","critical cells","differentiation of macrophage cells","MEM-D cells","CD4 T cells of M1","M2c phenotype","strong immunomodulatory cells","anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype of macrophages","IL-12p70","M2c cell","Abstract Mesenchymal stem cells","immunosuppressive phenotype","macrophage phenotypes","distinctive phenotype","changes","pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype","immunomodulatory effects","CD200R expression","low expression of CD163","FoxP3 expression","T helper subsets","MEM-ID","Treg cell frequencies","T lymphocyte subgroups","Treg cell activation","suppressive macrophage subgroup","IFN-g","study","data","direct interactions","Crohn\u0027s disease","host disease","FACS method","Luminex method","similar inhibitory effects","numerous clinical studies","M2a","systemic lupus erythematosus","CD80","significant increase","autoimmune diseases","proliferation","CD64","Th2","fatal pathologies","media supernatants","characteristic marker","apoptosis status","adaptive immune system","CD14","prominent observation","ELISA analyses","ulcerative colitis","Caspase","stimuli","functions","production","previous work","cytokines","experiments","fact","WST","environment","result"],"language":"en"},

Such binding resulted in the folding of the \u03B25-\u03B26 loop toward a shallow groove on the RBD interface critical for accommodating DPP4. The key residues for binding are identified through site-directed mutagenesis. Structural modeling revealed that MERS-4 binds to RBD only in the \u201Cup\u201D position in the S trimer. Furthermore, MERS-4 demonstrated synergy with several reported antibodies. These results indicate that MERS-4 neutralizes MERS-CoV by indirect rather than direct competition with DPP4.

In this work, we report the main glycosidic modifications that occur during the maturation of porcine tissues, involving the sialylation process as determined with lectins. Sialic acids were identified at several levels in a broad range of cell types of nervous, respiratory, genitourinary and lymphoid origin. Nevertheless, the most contrasting was the type of glycosidic linkage between 5-N-acetyl-neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and galactose (Gal) expressed in central nervous system (CNS). Newborn CNS abundantly expressed Neu5Ac\u03B12,3Gal, but weakly or scarcely expressed Neu5Ac\u03B12,6Gal/GalNAc. Maturation of CNS induced drastic changes in sialic acid expression. These changes include decrease or complete loss of NeuAc\u03B12,3Gal residues, mainly in olfactory structures and brain cortex, which were replaced by their isomers Neu5Ac\u03B12,6Gal/GalNAc. In the brain cortex and cerebellum, the increase of Neu5Ac\u03B12,6Gal/GalNAc molecules was paralleled by an increase of 5-N-acetyl-9-O-acetyl-neuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2). In addition, terminal Gal and N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (GalNAc) residues also increased their expression in adult CNS tissues, but this was more significant in structures forming the encephalic trunk. Our results show that sialylation of porcine CNS is finely modulated throughout the maturation process.","publish_time":"2000-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vallejo, Ver\u00F3nica; Reyes-Leyva, Julio; Hern\u00E1ndez, Jes\u00FAs; Ram\u00EDrez, Humberto; Delannoy, Philippe; Zenteno, Edgar","journal":"Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part B: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5983dd565bffc17cbec2386b122ef040c1da628b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129425.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0305049100002133; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305049100002133","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Gal residues","terminal Gal","Maturation of CNS","N-acetyl","increase of Neu5Ac\u03B12","sialylation of porcine CNS","Newborn CNS","adult CNS tissues","neuraminic acid","O-acetyl","GalNAc molecules","isomers Neu5Ac\u03B12","maturation process","sialic acid expression","maturation of porcine tissues","olfactory structures","brain cortex","sialylation process","Abstract Sialylated structures","cell communication","drastic changes","Sialic acids","broad range of cell types of nervous","central nervous system","type of glycosidic linkage","main glycosidic modifications","important roles","complete loss of NeuAc\u03B12","d-galactosamine","levels","galactose","decrease","cerebellum","regulated manner","lymphoid origin","development","differentiation","contrasting","encephalic trunk","9Ac2","addition","results","work","lectins"],"language":"en"},

AIMS: To establish a mouse model of virus infection\u2010induced AE\u2010IPF and investigate the mechanism underlying the AE\u2010IPF. METHODS: Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) was inoculated intranasally to wild\u2010type (WT) and IL\u201017A gene knockout (IL\u201017A(\u2010/\u2010)) mice 21 days after intratracheal administration of bleomycin (BLM). RESULTS: HSV1 infection caused acute exacerbation in mice with BLM\u2010induced fibrosis. Compared with the BLM\u002BSaline mice, the mice with BLM\u002BHSV1 showed significantly higher acute lung injury (ALI) score (P \u003C 0.0001), lower survival rate (100% vs 21.4%, P \u003C 0.0001), poorer lung function and higher inflammatory response representing by increased total inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (P = 0.0323), increased proportion of Th17 cells in peripheral blood (P = 0.0004) and higher inflammatory factors in BALF. In addition, HSV1 infection increased the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)\u2010related proteins in mice with BLM\u2010induced fibrosis. The inhibition of ERS by tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA, an ERS inhibitor) significantly reduced the IL\u201017A levels in BALF (P = 0.0140) and TH17 cells in the peripheral blood (P = 0.0084) of mice with BLM\u002BHSV1, suggesting that suppression of ERS may reduce TH17 response in mice with AE\u2010IPF. Compared with WT mice with BLM\u002BHSV1, IL\u201017A(\u2010/\u2010) mice with BLM\u002BHSV1 had lower ALI score (P = 0.0119), higher survival rate (78.6% vs 21.4%, P = 0.004), improved lung function, and milder inflammatory response. CONCLUSIONS: HSV1 infection in addition to BLM\u2010induced IPF can successfully establish AE\u2010IPF in mice. IL\u201017A and ERS promote lung inflammation in AE\u2010IPF development.","publish_time":"2018-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Tao; Qiu, Hui; Zhao, Meng\u2010Meng; Chen, Shan\u2010Shan; Wu, Qin; Zhou, Nian\u2010Yu; Lu, Li\u2010Qin; Song, Jia\u2010Cui; Tang, Dan\u2010Li; Weng, Dong; Li, Hui\u2010Ping","journal":"J Cell Mol Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/937d7695ba3f5f31a54eef142d6865c6460d5032.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6349191.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30378252/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jcmm.13992","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ALI"],"organizations":["BLM Saline","BLM","ERS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BLM","HSV1 infection","WT mice","induced IPF","Saline mice","induced AE","IPF development","higher inflammatory response","induced fibrosis","higher acute lung injury","TH17 response","higher inflammatory factors","suppression of ERS","ERS inhibitor","inhibition of ERS","BALF","total inflammatory cells","milder inflammatory response","higher survival rate","lung inflammation","acute exacerbation","increased proportion of Th17 cells","poorer lung function","improved lung function","lower ALI score","mouse model of virus infection","peripheral blood","addition","vs","lower survival rate","idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis","Herpes simplex virus","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress","related proteins","tauroursodeoxycholic acid","Patients","TUDCA","intratracheal administration of bleomycin","BACKGROUND","days","RESULTS","mechanism","METHODS","episode of common cold","type","gene knockout","CONCLUSIONS","levels"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: There were three objectives: (1) to describe the epidemiological and clinical features of hospitalised patients with severe acute respiratory infection caused by influenza and other respiratory viruses (ORVs); (2) to report the influenza seasonality in the region and (3) to correlate findings of influenza circulation and immunisation time in Brazil. PATIENTS/METHODS: This study took place in three Brazilian hospitals located in cities with different climatic conditions (Curitiba (south), Rio de Janeiro (south-east) and Fortaleza (north-east)). Patients presenting with an acute process with indication for admission consisting of a predefined set of conditions potentially associated with recent influenza infection were enrolled. RESULTS: We screened 1666 patients, with 595 meeting the inclusion criteria. Influenza viruses and ORVs were detected in 6.5% and 59% of patients, respectively. Influenza-positive cases fell into the severe spectrum as compared with those with ORVs (30% vs 11%), but without any difference in mortality rates. Epidemiological results revealed variations in the peak time of influenza infections between north-east (Fortaleza) and south (Curitiba) Brazil, basically following the rain period of each region. In north-east Brazil, viral circulation was prevalent in the first 4 months of the year, indicating that the vaccination campaign occurred in a postseasonal period, possibly explaining the low effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The active-surveillance model is a valuable tool for investigating respiratory virus impact on hospitalised patients, with influenza-infection monitoring enabling implementation of adequate preventive measures.","publish_time":"2018-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Raboni, Sonia M; Moura, Fernanda EA; Caetano, Braulia C; Avanzi, Val\u00E9ria M; Pereira, Luciane A; Nogueira, Meri B; Vidal, Luine R; Tavares, Isabel CF; Pradel, Florence K; Picot, Valentina S; Puig-Barbera, Joan; Siqueira, Marilda M","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/99da54318cd9e891d43f15d7b96365e2a2e9740d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a78e31beaf8becf35eacaa356661ea99c97e8652.json; document_parses/pdf_json/231ba154ea0d9a668c5c5e7e5732c4f223608f6d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5829850.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29449287/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-017603","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["influenza-infection","Influenza viruses","influenza seasonality","recent influenza infection","findings of influenza circulation","Influenza-positive cases","peak time of influenza infections","north-east Brazil","ORVs","severe acute respiratory infection","clinical features of hospitalised patients","respiratory viruses","Curitiba","Fortaleza","Epidemiological results","region","OBJECTIVES","respiratory virus impact","immunisation time","severe spectrum","acute process","viral circulation","postseasonal period","peak timing","rain period","mortality rates","different climatic conditions","predefined set of conditions","significant annual mortality","valuable tool","cities","Brazilian hospitals","enabling implementation of adequate preventive measures","admission","study","variations","active-surveillance model","place","vaccination campaign","indication","south-east","year","CONCLUSIONS","severity","Janeiro","METHODS","illness","low effectiveness","months","difference","BACKGROUND","inclusion criteria"],"language":"en"},

As a result the nano/microspheres of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-3-trimethyl chitosan (HTCC-NS/MS) were obtained. HTCC-NS/MS were studied as the adsorbents of human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and human coronavirus HCoV-OC43 particles in aqueous virus suspensions. By studying cytopathic effect (CPE) caused by these viruses and performing PCR analyses it was found HTCC-NS/MS strongly adsorb the particles of HCoV-NL63 virus, moderately adsorb mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) particles, but do not adsorb HCoV-OC43 coronavirus. The adsorption capacity of HTCC-NS/MS well correlated with the antiviral activity of soluble HTCC against a given virus. Importantly, it was shown that HCoV-NL63 particles could be desorbed from the HTCC-NS/MS surface with a salt solution of high ionic strength with retention of virus virulence. The obtained material may be applied for the removal of coronaviruses, purification and concentration of virus samples obtained from biological matrices and for purification of water from pathogenic coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ciejka, Justyna; Wolski, Karol; Nowakowska, Maria; Pyrc, Krzysztof; Szczubia\u0142ka, Krzysztof","journal":"Materials Science and Engineering: C","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cba0c78527bddd3979f39104e3e8bb49577640e5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126271.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928493116319634; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28482585/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0928493116319634; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msec.2017.03.047","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HTCC-NS","NL63 virus","particles of HCoV","HCoV-NL63 particles","given virus","CHIT-NS","mouse hepatitis virus","MS surface","obtained material","HCoV-OC43 coronavirus","human coronavirus HCoV-OC43 particles","concentration of virus samples","retention of virus virulence","aqueous virus suspensions","chitosan nano","adsorption capacity of HTCC","adsorbents of human coronavirus NL63","antiviral activity of soluble HTCC","MHV","trimethyl chitosan","form of nano","crosslinking of chitosan","microspheres of N","removal of coronaviruses","pathogenic coronaviruses","capable of adsorbing coronaviruses","purification of water","novel biopolymeric material","salt solution of high ionic strength","inverted emulsion","biological matrices","nontoxic compound of plant origin","genipin","glycidyltrimethyl-ammonium chloride","PCR analyses","CPE","GTMAC","hydroxypropyl","result","cytopathic effect"],"language":"en"},

Our objectives were to determine the impact of SBM level on apparent total tract (ATTD) and ileal (AID) digestibility during PRRSV infection and to determine ileal basal endogenous losses (BEL) during PRRSV infection. Forty PRRSV negative gilts were fitted with a T-cannula in the distal ileum. Treatments were arranged in a 2 \u00D7 2 factorial with high and low SBM (HSBM, 29% vs. LSBM, 10%), with and without PRRSV (n = 6/treatment). The remaining pigs (n = 8/challenge status) were fed a N-free diet. Chromic oxide was used as an indigestible marker. On day post inoculation (dpi) 0, at 47.7 \u00B1 0.57 kg BW, 20 pigs were inoculated with live PRRSV; 20 control pigs were sham inoculated. Infection was confirmed by serum PCR. Feces were collected at dpi 5 to 6 and dpi 16 to 17, and ileal digesta collected at dpi 7 to 8 and dpi 18 to 19. Feed, feces, and digesta were analyzed for DM, N, and GE. Digesta and feed were analyzed for AA. Data were analyzed in a 2 \u00D7 2 \u002B 2 factorial design to determine main effects of diet and PRRSV and their interaction. Data from N-free fed pigs were analyzed separately to determine BEL and hindgut disappearance due to PRRSV infection. All control pigs remained PRRSV negative. There were no interactions for AID of AA; however, HSBM reduced DM, GE, Lys, and Met AID and increased Arg and Gly AID during both collection periods (P \u003C 0.05). At dpi 7 to 8 only, PRRSV reduced DM and GE AID (P \u003C 0.05). At 7 to 8 dpi, BEL of Arg, Ala, and Pro were reduced (P \u003C 0.05) due to PRRSV by 64%, 39%, and 94%, respectively. At dpi 18 to 19, BEL of Thr tended (P = 0.06) to be increased in PRRSV-infected pigs; however, no other differences were observed. Pigs fed LSBM had increased Lys, Met, Thr, Trp, and Pro standardized ileal digestibility (SID), primarily at 7 to 8 dpi. At 7 to 8 dpi, PRRSV reduced Arg, Gly, and Pro SID (P \u003C 0.01), and SID Pro continued to be reduced by 17% at dpi 18 to 19. Compared with HSBM pigs, LSBM reduced hindgut disappearance of DM and GE at dpi 5 to 8 and dpi 16 to 19, while N disappearance was reduced at dpi 5 to 8. There were no differences between control and PRRSV N-free fed pigs. Altogether, SBM inclusion impacts SID of AA and hindgut disappearance of nutrients, regardless of PRRSV. In contrast, there is minimal impact of PRRSV on BEL, and therefore, SID of most AA are not different.","publish_time":"2018-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schweer, Wesley P; Patience, John F; Burrough, Eric R; Kerr, Brian J; Gabler, Nicholas K","journal":"Journal of Animal Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f55628e0dcd9b8f71cf130bbfc0baa1c4381900.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6140837.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-pdf/96/5/1846/25763760/sky093.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1093/jas/sky093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29534187/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GE","PRRSV","BEL","HSBM","SID Pro"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRSV infection","PRRSV-infected pigs","live PRRSV","PRRSV N-free fed pigs","minimal impact of PRRSV","PRRSV negative gilts","HSBM pigs","control pigs","N disappearance","remaining pigs","AID of AA","GE AID","Pro SID","SID Pro","BEL of Arg","N-free diet","Gly AID","Met AID","BEL of Thr","ileal digesta","SBM inclusion impacts SID of AA","increased Arg","LSBM","Pro standardized ileal digestibility","hindgut disappearance of nutrients","low SBM","impact of SBM level","Lys","disease challenge","Feed","Data","differences","Feces","ileal basal endogenous losses","significant disease","challenge status","factorial design","main effects of diet","Trp","apparent total tract","ATTD","respiratory syndrome virus","swine industry","soybean meal","consumption","collection periods","T-cannula","distal ileum","Ala","Chromic oxide","indigestible marker","day post inoculation","contrast","serum PCR","performance","interactions","objectives","BW","Treatments"],"language":"en"},

In order to elucidate the multifactorial aetiology of porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) in Denmark, lungs from 148 finishing pigs with cranioventral bronchopneumonia (case group) and 60 pigs without lung lesions (control group) were collected from abattoirs. The pathogens involved in PRDC and their interactions were identified and linked to the histopathological diagnosis. The lung samples were cultured for bacteria and tested by multiplex polymerase chain reaction for presence of swine influenza virus (type A), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (both European and US type), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), porcine respiratory coronavirus, porcine cytomegalovirus, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Mycoplasma hyorhinis. All cases had cranioventral lobular bronchopneumonia consistent with PRDC. There was a broad range of microscopical lesions and the cases were characterized as acute (n =10), subacute (n =24) or chronic (n =114) bronchopneumonia. Five bacterial species, five viruses and two Mycoplasma spp. were detected in different combinations. PCV2, M. hyopneumoniae, M. hyorhinis and Pasteurella multocida were detected most frequently among the PRDC affected swine and the diversity and number of pathogens were higher in these animals compared with controls. No clear-cut associations were detected between pathogens and histological lesions or histopathological diagnoses. PRDC occurs more frequently than enzootic pneumonia among Danish finishing pigs and has complex and varied histopathology.","publish_time":"2010-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hansen, M. S.; Pors, S.

In this study, we successfully generated a recombinant LaSota candidate vaccine strain, rNDV-IBV-T/B, which expresses a short, synthetic, previously identified IBV S1 multi-epitope cassette using the reverse genetic system. The recombinant virus was propagated in nine-day-old embryonated chicken eggs for 20 passages and genetic stability was confirmed by whole genome DNA sequencing. The recombinant virus had a hemagglutination (HA) titer of 2(10), mean death time (MDT) of 118 hours, and intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) of 0.05. None of these were significantly different from the parental Newcastle disease virus (NDV) LaSota strain (p \u003E 0.05). Vaccination of white leghorn chickens at one day of age with 10(6) EID(50) rNDV-IBV-T/B provided 90% protection against virulent IBV M41 challenge at three weeks of age, which was significantly higher than the protection of the control group vaccinated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (p \u003C 0.05). The ciliostasis scores of rNDV-IBV-T/B-vaccinated and LaSota-vaccinated groups were 4.2 and 37.6, respectively, which indicated that rNDV-IBV-T/B vaccination reduced the pathogenicity of IBV toward the trachea. Furthermore, real-time RT-PCR assay showed that the rNDV-IBV-T/B vaccination resulted in low levels of viral load (647.80 \u00B1 49.65 RNA copies) in the trachea four days post-challenge, which is significantly lower than groups vaccinated with PBS (8591.25 \u00B1 311.10 RNA copies) or LaSota (7742.60 \u00B1 298.50 RNA copies) (p \u003C 0.05). Meanwhile, the same dose of rNDV-IBV-T/B vaccination provided complete protection against velogenic NDV F48E9 challenge. These results demonstrate that the rNDV-IBV-T/B strain is a promising vaccine candidate to control both IB and ND simultaneously. Furthermore, epitope-based live vector vaccines provide an alternative strategy for the development of cost-effective and, broadly, cross-protective vaccines.","publish_time":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Lei; Wen, Guoyuan; Qiu, Xusheng; Yuan, Yanmei; Meng, Chunchun; Sun, Yingjie; Liao, Ying; Song, Cuiping; Liu, Weiwei; Shi, Yonghong; Shao, Huabin; Ding, Chan","journal":"Vaccines (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/111e82fd55d8b42cd523cf365b53dfcdaa2165d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6963182.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683905/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines7040170","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle","IBV","PBS","IB","ND"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV-T","rNDV-IBV","pathogenicity of IBV","B vaccination","B strain","dose of rNDV","virulent IBV M41 challenge","LaSota strain","LaSota-vaccinated groups","ciliostasis scores of rNDV","recombinant virus","RNA copies","recombinant LaSota candidate vaccine strain","identified IBV S1 multi-epitope cassette","complete protection","parental Newcastle disease virus","day of age","PBS","trachea","velogenic NDV F48E9 challenge","Vaccination of white leghorn chickens","promising vaccine candidate","days post-challenge","genetic stability","weeks of age","Infectious bronchitis","control group","reverse genetic system","live vector vaccines","intracerebral pathogenicity index","major infectious diseases","cross-protective vaccines","day-old embryonated chicken eggs","threat","alternative strategy","passages","phosphate-buffered saline","low levels of viral load","hours","MDT","hemagglutination","real-time RT-PCR assay","development of cost-effective","mean death time","domestic poultry industry","genome DNA sequencing","ICPI","EID","titer","results","study"],"language":"en"},

Here we show that IFITM proteins restricted infection mediated by the entry glycoproteins (GP(1,2)) of Marburg and Ebola filoviruses (MARV, EBOV). Consistent with these observations, interferon-\u03B2 specifically restricted filovirus and IAV entry processes. IFITM proteins also inhibited replication of infectious MARV and EBOV. We observed distinct patterns of IFITM-mediated restriction: compared with IAV, the entry processes of MARV and EBOV were less restricted by IFITM3, but more restricted by IFITM1. Moreover, murine Ifitm5 and 6 did not restrict IAV, but efficiently inhibited filovirus entry. We further demonstrate that replication of infectious SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and entry mediated by the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein are restricted by IFITM proteins. The profile of IFITM-mediated restriction of SARS-CoV was more similar to that of filoviruses than to IAV. Trypsin treatment of receptor-associated SARS-CoV pseudovirions, which bypasses their dependence on lysosomal cathepsin L, also bypassed IFITM-mediated restriction. However, IFITM proteins did not reduce cellular cathepsin activity or limit access of virions to acidic intracellular compartments. Our data indicate that IFITM-mediated restriction is localized to a late stage in the endocytic pathway.

METHODS: To investigate the morbidity of travel associated infectious diseases in European travellers, we analysed diagnoses with demographic, clinical and travel-related predictors of disease, in 6957 ill returned travellers who presented in 2008 to EuroTravNet centres with a presumed travel associated condition. RESULTS: Gastro-intestinal (GI) diseases accounted for 33% of illnesses, followed by febrile systemic illnesses (20%), dermatological conditions (12%) and respiratory illnesses (8%). There were 3 deaths recorded; a sepsis caused by Escherichia coli pyelonephritis, a dengue shock syndrome and a Plasmodium falciparum malaria. GI conditions included bacterial acute diarrhea (6.9%), as well as giardiasis and amebasis (2.3%). Among febrile systemic illnesses with identified pathogens, malaria (5.4%) accounted for most cases followed by dengue (1.9%) and others including chikungunya, rickettsial diseases, leptospirosis, brucellosis, Epstein Barr virus infections, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and viral hepatitis. Dermatological conditions were dominated by bacterial infections, arthropod bites, cutaneous larva migrans and animal bites requiring rabies post-exposure prophylaxis and also leishmaniasis, myasis, tungiasis and one case of leprosy. Respiratory illness included 112 cases of tuberculosis including cases of multi-drug resistant or extensively drug resistant tuberculosis, 104 cases of influenza like illness, and 5 cases of Legionnaires disease. Sexually transmitted infections (STI) accounted for 0.6% of total diagnoses and included HIV infection and syphilis. A total of 165 cases of potentially vaccine preventable diseases were reported. Purpose of travel and destination specific risk factors was identified for several diagnoses such as Chagas disease in immigrant travellers from South America and P. falciparum malaria in immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa. Travel within Europe was also associated with health risks with distinctive profiles for Eastern and Western Europe. CONCLUSIONS: In 2008, a broad spectrum of travel associated diseases were diagnosed at EuroTravNet core sites. Diagnoses varied according to regions visited by ill travellers. The spectrum of travel associated morbidity also shows that there is a need to dispel the misconception that travel, close to home, in Europe, is without significant health risk.","publish_time":"2010-11-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Field, Vanessa; Gautret, Philippe; Schlagenhauf, Patricia; Burchard, Gerd-Dieter; Caumes, Eric; Jensenius, Mogens; Castelli, Francesco; Gkrania-Klotsas, Effrossyni; Weld, Leisa; Lopez-Velez, Rogelio; de Vries, Peter; von Sonnenburg, Frank; Loutan, Louis; Parola, Philippe","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a64149dbac768a5fac5c4ca620c09c2dea2e2bf0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3001727.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21083874/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-10-330","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Epstein Barr"],"organizations":["Eastern"],"locations":["Europe","South America","sub-Saharan Africa"],"keyphrases":["morbidity of travel","presumed travel","Purpose of travel","cases of tuberculosis","broad spectrum of travel","ill travellers","travel-related predictors of disease","cases of influenza","cases of Legionnaires disease","immigrant travellers","European travellers","infectious diseases","rickettsial diseases","ill returned travellers","total diagnoses","respiratory illnesses","cases of multi-drug resistant","febrile systemic illnesses","bacterial infections","GI conditions","dermatological conditions","majority of international travellers","vaccine preventable diseases","resistant tuberculosis","Plasmodium falciparum malaria","Chagas disease","transmitted infections","Western Europe","significant health risk","public health risks","animal bites","arthropod bites","Epstein Barr virus infections","returned patients","EuroTravNet centres","identified pathogens","dengue shock syndrome","bacterial acute diarrhea","EuroTravNet core sites","destination specific risk factors","cutaneous larva migrans","tick-borne encephalitis","rabies post-exposure prophylaxis","leptospirosis","brucellosis","South America","leishmaniasis","TBE","clinicians","distinctive profiles","Escherichia coli pyelonephritis","myasis","essential role","immigrants","demographic","tungiasis","sepsis","Europeans","sub-Saharan Africa","recognizing","HIV infection","Gastro-intestinal","viral hepatitis","misconception","RESULTS","home","syphilis","chikungunya","regions","case of leprosy","BACKGROUND","giardiasis","amebasis","need","deaths","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Knowledge about the enzymes (writers and erasers) that attach and remove post-translational modifications, the targets that are modified and the functional consequences elicited by specific modifications, is crucial for understanding cell biological processes. Moreover detailed knowledge about these mechanisms and pathways helps to elucidate the molecular causes of various diseases and in defining potential targets for therapeutic approaches. Intracellular adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation refers to the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(\u002B))-dependent modification of proteins with ADP-ribose and is catalyzed by enzymes of the ARTD (ADP-ribosyltransferase diphtheria toxin like, also known as PARP) family as well as some members of the Sirtuin family. Poly-ADP-ribosylation is relatively well understood with inhibitors being used as anti-cancer agents. However, the majority of ARTD enzymes and the ADP-ribosylating Sirtuins are restricted to catalyzing mono-ADP-ribosylation. Although writers, readers and erasers of intracellular mono-ADP-ribosylation have been identified only recently, it is becoming more and more evident that this reversible post-translational modification is capable of modulating key intracellular processes and signaling pathways. These include signal transduction mechanisms, stress pathways associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and stress granules, and chromatin-associated processes such as transcription and DNA repair. We hypothesize that mono-ADP-ribosylation controls, through these different pathways, the development of cancer and infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2015-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"B\u00FCtepage, Mareike; Eckei, Laura; Verheugd, Patricia; L\u00FCscher, Bernhard","journal":"Cells","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/77c8f24d21f25774e383052c028b90b178c7b3d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4695847.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26426055/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells4040569","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sirtuin"],"organizations":["ARTD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ADP-ribose","Poly-ADP","erasers of intracellular mono-ADP","catalyzing mono-ADP","stress pathways","ADP-ribosylating Sirtuins","different pathways","post-translational mechanisms","ribosylation controls","ADP-ribosyltransferase diphtheria toxin","post-translational modifications","reversible post-translational modification","capable of modulating key intracellular processes","dependent modification of proteins","chromatin-associated processes","majority of ARTD enzymes","writers","Intracellular adenosine diphosphate","cell biological processes","signal transduction mechanisms","stress granules","potential targets","key process","development of cancer","specific modifications","infectious diseases","detailed knowledge","Sirtuin family","anti-cancer agents","molecular causes of various diseases","endoplasmic reticulum","regulation of protein activities","transcription","NAD","nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide","inhibitors","readers","functional consequences","DNA repair","therapeutic approaches","members","PARP"],"language":"en"},

Importantly, no significant systemic pathological lesions and no reduction in average daily gain were noted in pigs supplemented with the BLFP, which suggests that it is safe for use in pigs.

During viral infection, autophagy can act as a surveillance mechanism that delivers viral antigens to the endosomal/lysosomal compartments that are enriched in immune sensors. Additionally, activated immune sensors can signal to activate autophagy. To evade this antiviral activity, many viruses elaborate functions to block the autophagy pathway at a variety of steps. Alternatively, some viruses actively subvert autophagy for their own benefit. Manipulated autophagy has been proposed to facilitate nearly every stage of the viral lifecycle in direct and indirect ways. In this review, we synthesize the extensive literature on virus-autophagy interactions, emphasizing the role of autophagy in antiviral immunity and the mechanisms by which viruses subvert autophagy for their own benefit.","publish_time":"2012-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jordan, Tristan X.; Randall, Glenn","journal":"Microbes and Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5817c04611d4664bade6aa51207d29686974a94.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ef425d406ff3747c64de40c9147815959523bf23.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3264745.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S128645791100253X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2011.09.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22051604/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S128645791100253X; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3264745?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of autophagy","autophagy pathway","Manipulated autophagy","virus-autophagy interactions","viruses","functions","viral antigens","viral lifecycle","viral infection","immune sensors","benefit","lysosomal degradation","lysosomal compartments","antiviral immunity","antiviral activity","cytoplasmic components","stressful conditions","cellular metabolism","cell survival","extensive literature","mechanisms","subsequent recycling","homeostatic process","indirect ways","surveillance mechanism","stage","variety of steps","review"],"language":"en"},

Most of studies have focused on molecular and pathogenic characterization of PEDV, whereas there were limited studies in understanding the role of gut microbiota (GM) in viral-associated diarrhea. Here, using the Illumina MiSeq platform, we examined and compared the impact of PEDV infection on the GM of sows and their piglets less than 10 days old. Our results showed that PEDV caused alternations in the structure and abundance of GM from levels of phylum to genus, and even species. For sows, a significant decrease of observed species was found in diarrheal sows than that in healthy sows (p \u003C 0.05). The unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances also revealed considerable segregations of GM structure among healthy, asymptomatic, and diarrheal sows. For piglets, Bacteroidetes, the dominant bacteria in healthy piglets, were replaced by Firmicutes in asymptomatic and diarrheal piglets. The abundances of Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria were also remarkably increased in asymptomatic piglets and diarrheal piglets when compared to those of the healthy piglets. Our findings demonstrated that PEDV infection caused severe perturbations of GM, reduced probiotic bacteria, and enriched pathogenic bacteria.","publish_time":"2017-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Deping; Peng, Qi; Chen, Yanjun; Zhou, Xinrong; Zhang, Fanfan; Li, Anqi; Huang, Dongyan; Wu, Qiong; Ye, Yu; He, Houjun; Wang, Leyi; Tang, Yuxin","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c17c17e58e174ba99b3964a2ddd1a0a4b9a35d4.json; document_parses/pdf_json/76585719cd2c0b067b878acf53964015a47bb917.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5727058.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-17830-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29234140/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","GM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["healthy piglets","diarrheal piglets","GM of sows","asymptomatic piglets","healthy sows","diarrheal sows","abundance of GM","impact of PEDV infection","pathogenic characterization of PEDV","severe perturbations of GM","considerable segregations of GM structure","probiotic bacteria","dominant bacteria","enriched pathogenic bacteria","devastating cause of diarrhea","viral-associated diarrhea","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","limited studies","significant decrease of observed species","weighted UniFrac distances","levels of phylum","role of gut microbiota","Firmicutes","alternations","genus","Bacteroidetes","Proteobacteria","pigs","findings","Illumina MiSeq platform","abundances of Fusobacteria","results","days old"],"language":"en"},

The ability to replicate in the enteric tract directly correlates with virulence, as TGEVs with an exclusive respiratory tropism are attenuated. The tissue tropism is determined by spike (S) protein, although the molecular bases for enteric tropism remain to be fully characterized. Both pAPN and sialic acid binding domains (aa 506\u2013655 and 145\u2013155, respectively) are necessary but not sufficient for enteric tract infection. Using a TGEV infectious cDNA and enteric (TGEV-SC11) or respiratory (TGEV-SPTV) isolates, encoding a full-length S protein, a set of chimeric recombinant viruses, with a sequential modification in S protein amino terminus, was engineered. In vivo tropism, either enteric, respiratory or both, was studied by inoculating three-day-old piglets and analyzing viral titers in lung and gut. The data indicated that U655\u003EG change in S gene (S219A in S protein) was required to confer enteric tropism to a respiratory virus that already contains the pAPN and sialic acid binding domains in its S protein. Moreover, an engineered virus containing U655\u003EG and a 6 nt insertion at position 1124 (Y374-T375insND in S protein) was genetically stable after passage in cell cultures, and increased virus titers in gut by 1000-fold. We postulated that the effect of these residues in enteric tropism may be mediated by the modification of both glycosaminoglycan binding and S protein structure.","publish_time":"2019-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sanchez, Carlos M.; Pascual-Iglesias, Alejandro; Sola, Isabel; Zu\u00F1iga, Sonia; Enjuanes, Luis","journal":"Pathogens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f04c16afe6170aa82f7480354bcac3dd0d1f29de.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168613.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31861369/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens9010002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsxMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["enteric tropism","full-length S protein","S protein structure","enteric coronavirus","S gene","respiratory virus","S protein amino terminus","exclusive respiratory tropism","enteric tract infection","tissue tropism","engineered virus","TGEV-SC11","TGEV-SPTV","increased virus titers","sialic acid binding domains","glycosaminoglycan binding","pAPN","TGEV infectious cDNA","U655","Transmissible gastroenteritis virus","gut","sequential modification","viral titers","G change","high morbidity","mortality","cell cultures","S219A","isolates","set of chimeric recombinant viruses","passage","Y374-T375insND","porcine herds","nt insertion","molecular bases","position","day-old piglets","lung","virulence","TGEVs","spike","data","effect","residues","fold","ability"],"language":"en"},

Thirty-three cats were grouped according to FECV seropositivity and fecal virus shedding into na\u00EFve/immunologically quiescent, convalescent and actively infected groups. Blood, fecal samples and colon biopsies were collected to assess the mucosal and systemic immunologic and virologic profile. Results showed that cats with active FECV infections have strong systemic IgG and mucosal IgA responses that wane after virus clearance. Significant FECV-specific mucosal T cell IFN\u03B3 responses were not detected in any of the three groups. A shift toward an inflammatory state in the mucosa was suggested by increased IL17:FoxP3 expression. However, no histologic abnormalities were observed, and no shifts in lymphocyte subpopulation phenotype or proliferation were noted.

We hypothesized that an assessment of the adaptive immune system, using CD4(\u002B) T-lymphocyte transcriptomics, would identify gene expression correlates of disease severity. METHODS: Infants infected with RSV representing extremes of clinical severity were studied. Mild illness (n = 23) was defined as a respiratory rate (RR) \u003C 55 and room air oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) \u2265 97%, and severe illness (n = 23) was defined as RR \u2265 65 and SaO2 \u2264 92%.

RESULTS: Gestational age, age at illness onset, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, bacterial colonization, and breastfeeding were associated (adjusted P \u003C .05) with disease severity. RNA sequencing analysis reliably measured approximately 60% of the genome. Severity of RSV illness had the greatest effect size upon CD4 T-cell gene expression. Pathway analysis identified correlates of severity, including JAK/STAT, prolactin, and interleukin 9 signaling. We also identified genes and pathways associated with timing of symptoms and RSV group (A/B).

We have isolated and characterized revertants of ts24, a member of the A complementation group of Sindbis HR mutants, that we had demonstrated previously to have a temperature-sensitive defect in the regulation of minus-strand synthesis. These revertants of ts24 replicated efficiently at 40\u00B0 but nevertheless retained the temperature sensitive defect in the regulation of minus-strand synthesis: they continued to synthesize minus strands late in the replication cycle at 40\u00B0 but not at 30\u00B0 and in the presence or absence of protein synthesis. Although failure to regulate the synthesis of minus strands resulted in continuous minus-strand synthesis and in the accumulation of minus strands, the rate of plus-strand synthesis was not increased concertedly. Minus strands synthesized after the rate of plus-strand synthesis had become constant were demonstrated to be utilized as templates for 26 S mRNA synthesis. Thus, the change from an increasing to a constant rate of plus-strand synthesis during the alphavirus replication cycle cannot be governed solely by the number of minus strands that accumulate in infected cells. We present a model for the preferential utilization of minus strands as a mechanism for the cessation of minus-strand synthesis that occurs normally during alphavirus replication.","publish_time":"1986-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sawicki, Stanley G.; Sawicki, Dorothea L.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa5d0074495d60de05c6a95a182bbc299f2fb7d5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682286900541; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682286900541","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsxNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["synthesis of minus strands","continuous minus-strand synthesis","regulation of minus","cessation of minus","accumulation of minus strands","number of minus strands","preferential utilization of minus strands","absence of protein synthesis","S mRNA synthesis","constant rate","alphavirus replication cycle","replication cycle of Sindbis virus","maximum rate","temperature-sensitive defect","temperature sensitive defect","characterized revertants of ts24","complementation group of Sindbis HR mutants","member","mechanism","time","increasing","presence","templates","model","Abstract","infected cells","change","failure"],"language":"en"},

In addition, antiS-CT24 antibodies exhibited neutralizing activities against KPEDV-9 in focus reduction neutralization tests suggesting that the GPRLQPY motif induces neutralizing antibodies against PEDV.","publish_time":"2008-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cruz, Deu John M.; Kim, Chul-Joong; Shin, Hyun-Jin","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/00799d9acb7f964564fd4c31d0e6268185e68e3c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114191.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170207003759; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170207003759","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsxODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GPRLQPY motif","peptide motif GPRLQPY","antiS-CT24 antibodies","target of neutralizing antibodies","specific reactivity","neutralizing activities","synthetic peptide","spike protein of Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","carboxy-terminal portion","virus attachment","specific affinity","non-reactivity","main surface glycoprotein","KPEDV","c mice","BALB","strong antibody response","focus reduction neutralization tests","novel antigenic domain","entry","linear sequence","immunogenicity","addition"],"language":"en"},

It is therefore important that high-containment labs coordinate and communicate globally to share their experiences and lessons to improve their capacity to respond to threats. The National Biosafety (Level 4) Laboratory in Wuhan, CAS, which is the first Level 4 biosafety laboratory (BSL-4) in China, has been certified recently and it is expected to play an important role in the prevention and control of highly infectious agents in future. Trained and experienced staff in such organizations is the most important factor contributing to safety and security. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a standard training program. Accordingly, in the present study, we developed an improved training program and assessment system based on policies and practices developed by BSL-3/4s in other countries. It included the following three components: (1) A flexible modularized theoretical training: This training comprised 14 modularized theoretical topics such that staffs with different backgrounds could take this theoretical training with different topic combinations according to their knowledge and skill levels; (2) A standardized practical training assessment: This comprehensive assessment, which could be used with biosafety laboratory staff before, during, and after training, included standard operation procedures to meet the special requirements of trainees with different scores; and (3) An applicable documentation system: A certification system was established to evaluate the ability of all staff working inside or outside the laboratory, implemented by a special committee. This certification was approved and authorized by the director of the laboratory and was classified into three grades with corresponding minimal requirements. Further, the present study examined the importance of and need for networking for training BSL-3/4 staff. The establishment of rigorous standards for training BSL-3/4 staff will instill confidence in the public, policy makers, and security officials. Additionally, the expanded international network of BSL-3/4s will continue to be operated safely and will pose no risk to scientific staff, local communities, surrounding environment, and host nations. The clarification and coordination of training standards will help develop a highly-qualified biocontainment workforce and will result in a series of programs that will enable scientists to develop measures to deal with existing threat agents and new diseases that emerge.","publish_time":"2019-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Yi; Huang, Jicheng; Xia, Han; Shi, Yongxia; Ma, Haixia; Yuan, Zhiming","journal":"Journal of Biosafety and Biosecurity","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc8829e212c0a2a1b75d345ffebe20901cdcb5db.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2588933818300037; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2588933818300037","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAS","BSL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["training BSL","standard training program","biosafety laboratory staff","improved training program","coordination of training standards","flexible modularized theoretical training","standardized practical training assessment","scientific staff","experienced staff","assessment system","certification system","different backgrounds","comprehensive assessment","modularized theoretical topics","different scores","expanded international network of BSL","important factor","important role","National Biosafety","present study","different topic combinations","applicable documentation system","special requirements of trainees","infectious agents","special committee","security officials","existing threat agents","standard operation procedures","establishment of rigorous standards","corresponding minimal requirements","public health systems","surrounding environment","local communities","control","knowledge","policy makers","prevention","staffs","confidence","practices","policies","measures","new diseases","risk","grades","organizations","networking","host nations","capacity","scientists","skill levels","future","high-containment labs","importance","Wuhan","CAS","clarification","series of programs","qualified biocontainment workforce","experiences","lessons","components","countries","ability","re-emerging viruses","threats","director","China"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Respiratory samples from 229 and 267 patients identified with and without H1N1 influenza respectively were screened for the presence of 13 seasonal respiratory viruses by multiplex RT-PCR. Disease severity between coinfected and monoinfected H1N1 patients were quantified using a standardized clinical severity scale. Influenza viral load was calculated by quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: Thirty (13.1%) influenza samples screened positive for the presence of 31 viral copathogens. The most prominent copathogens included rhinovirus (61.3%), and coronaviruses (16.1%). Median clinical severity of both monoinfected and co-infected groups were 1. Patients coinfected with rhinovirus tended to have lower clinical severity (median 0), whereas non rhinovirus co-infections had substantially higher clinical severity (median 2). No difference in H1N1 viral load was observed between co-infected and mono infected groups. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses co-infect patients with influenza disease.

However, comprehensive estimates of the incidence and mortality due to specific aetiologies of diarrhoeal diseases are not available. The objective of this study is to provide estimates of the global and regional incidence and mortality of diarrhoeal diseases caused by nine pathogens that are commonly transmitted through foods. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We abstracted data from systematic reviews and, depending on the overall mortality rates of the country, applied either a national incidence estimate approach or a modified Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group (CHERG) approach to estimate the aetiology-specific incidence and mortality of diarrhoeal diseases, by age and region. The nine diarrhoeal diseases assessed caused an estimated 1.8 billion (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1.1\u20133.3 billion) cases and 599,000 (95% UI 472,000\u2013802,000) deaths worldwide in 2010. The largest number of cases were caused by norovirus (677 million; 95% UI 468\u20131,153 million), enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) (233 million; 95% UI 154\u2013380 million), Shigella spp. (188 million; 95% UI 94\u2013379 million) and Giardia lamblia (179 million; 95% UI 125\u2013263); the largest number of deaths were caused by norovirus (213,515; 95% UI 171,783\u2013266,561), enteropathogenic E. coli (121,455; 95% UI 103,657\u2013143,348), ETEC (73,041; 95% UI 55,474\u201396,984) and Shigella (64,993; 95% UI 48,966\u201392,357). There were marked regional differences in incidence and mortality for these nine diseases. Nearly 40% of cases and 43% of deaths caused by these nine diarrhoeal diseases occurred in children under five years of age.

Although PEDV induced cell apoptosis has been established in vitro and in vivo, the functional protein that contributes to this event remains unclear. METHODS: The activation or cleavage of main apoptosis-associated molecular such as AIFM1, caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9 and PARP in PEDV infected host cells were analyzed by western blotting. The nuclear change of infected cell was monitored by confocal immunofluorescence assay. The overexpressing plasmids of 16 non-structural proteins (Nsp1\u201316) and 6 structural proteins (M, N, E, ORF3, S1 and S2) were constructed by cloning. Cell apoptosis induced by PEDV or overexpression non-structural or structural proteins was measured by the flow cytometry assay. RESULTS: PEDV could infect various host cells including Vero, Vero-E6 and Marc-145 and cause obvious cytopathic effects, including roundup, cell fusion, cell membrane vacuolation, syncytium formation and cause apparent apoptosis. In infected cells, PEDV-induced apoptosis is accompanied by nuclear concentration and fragmentation as a result of caspase-3 and caspase-8 activation and AIFM1 and PARP cleavage. Overexpression of S1 Spike protein of PEDV SM98 strain effectively induced host cell apoptosis, while the expression of the other non-structure proteins (Nsp1\u201316) and structural proteins (M, N, E, S2 and ORF3) has no or less effect on cell apoptosis. Similarly, expression of S1 protein from wild-type strain BJ2011 or cell-adapted strain CV777, also induce apoptosis in transfected cells. Finally, we demonstrated that the S1 proteins from various coronavirus family members such as TGEV, IBV, CCoV, SARS and MERS could also induce Vero-E6 cells apoptosis. CONCLUSION: S1 Spike protein is one of the most critical functional proteins that contribute to cell apoptosis. Expression of S1 proteins of the coronavirus tested in this study could all induce cell apoptosis suggesting S1 maybe is an effective inducer in Coronavirus-induced cell apoptosis and targeting S1 protein expression probably is a promising strategy to inhibit coronavirus infection and thus mediated apoptosis on host cells.

However, its etiological role in acute gastroenteritis is unclear, and its genetic characteristics are poorly described. In this study, the role of circoviruses (CVs) in mink acute gastroenteritis was investigated, and the MiCV genome was molecularly characterized through sequence analysis. Detection results demonstrated that MiCV was the only pathogen found in this infection. MiCVs and previously characterized CVs shared genome organizational features, including the presence of (i) a potential stem-loop/nonanucleotide motif that is considered to be the origin of virus DNA replication; (ii) two major inversely arranged open reading frames encoding putative replication-associated proteins (Rep) and a capsid protein; (iii) direct and inverse repeated sequences within the putative 5\u02B9 region; and (iv) motifs in Rep. Pairwise comparisons showed that the capsid proteins of MiCV shared the highest amino acid sequence identity with those of porcine CV (PCV) 2 (45.4%) and bat CV (BatCV) 1 (45.4%). The amino acid sequence identity levels of Rep shared by MiCV with BatCV 1 (79.7%) and dog CV (dogCV) (54.5%) were broadly similar to those with starling CV (51.1%) and PCVs (46.5%). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that MiCVs were more closely related to mammalian CVs, such as BatCV, PCV, and dogCV, than to other animal CVs. Among mammalian CVs, MiCV and BatCV 1 were the most closely related. This study could contribute to understanding the potential pathogenicity of MiCV and the evolutionary and pathogenic characteristics of mammalian CVs.","publish_time":"2018-06-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ge, Junwei; Gu, Shanshan; Cui, Xingyang; Zhao, Lili; Ma, Dexing; Shi, Yunjia; Wang, Yuanzhi; Lu, Taofeng; Chen, Hongyan","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/948647af9bea327965d46272c4b1944f649a663d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087342.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29948383/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-018-3908-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Mink"],"organizations":["Rep.

There is currently no evidence to suggest an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 through contact lens (CL) wear compared to spectacle lens wear and no scientific evidence that wearing standard prescription spectacles provides protection against COVID-19 or other viral transmissions. During the pandemic there will potentially be significant changes in access to local eyecare. Thus, it is imperative CL wearers are reminded of the steps they should follow to minimise their risk of complications, to reduce their need to leave isolation and seek care. Management of adverse events should be retained within optometric systems if possible, to minimise the impact on the wider healthcare service, which will be stretched. Optimal CL care behaviours should be the same as those under normal circumstances, which include appropriate hand washing (thoroughly with soap and water) and drying (with paper towels) before both CL application and removal. Daily CL cleaning and correct case care for reusable CL should be followed according to appropriate guidelines, and CL exposure to water must be avoided. Where the availability of local clinical care is restricted, practitioners should consider advising patients to reduce or eliminate sleeping in their CL (where patients have the appropriate knowledge about correct daily care and access to suitable lens-care products) or consider the option of moving patients to daily disposable lenses (where patients have appropriate lens supplies available). Patients should also avoid touching their face, including their eyes, nose and mouth, with unwashed hands and avoid CL wear altogether if unwell (particularly with any cold or flu-like symptoms).","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jones, Lyndon; Walsh, Karen; Willcox, Mark; Morgan, Philip; Nichols, Jason","journal":"Cont Lens Anterior Eye","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f29d729722278dbeb984128f57f5d48f35b7c318.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0cbb22ef36a375f7abca0f173953ba162929b40e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129028.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367048420300552; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clae.2020.03.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1367048420300552; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32273245/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["correct daily care","appropriate lens","care behaviours","eye care practitioners","correct case care","suitable lens-care products","availability of local clinical care","spectacle lens wear","option of moving patients","appropriate knowledge","contact lens","appropriate guidelines","coronavirus disease","access","appropriate hand washing","increased risk of contracting COVID","novel coronavirus","water","scientific evidence","local eyecare","SARS-CoV","risk of complications","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","accurate eye health guidance","standard prescription spectacles","disposable lenses","nose","significant changes","cleaning","impact","mouth","unwashed hands","protection","soap","optometric systems","normal circumstances","application","Management of adverse events","wider healthcare service","eyes","face","need","exposure","results","paper towels","wearers","flu","symptoms","pandemic","viral transmissions","isolation","information","steps","removal"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, this paper describes application of the framework, which sheds light on the current practice of TS maintenance. DESIGN: Observational study. MEASUREMENTS: By means of a literature study, criteria for the maintenance of TSs were obtained and categorized into a framework. The current practice of TS maintenance was explored by a survey among organizations that maintain a TS. Results were stratified by the size of the TS being maintained. RESULTS: From Sixty-three relevant articles, criteria for the maintenance processes of TSs were extracted and organized into four components. The primary component \u201CExecution\u201D concerns the core activities of the maintenance process. The other three components \u201CProcess management,\u201D \u201CChange specifications,\u201D and \u201CEditing tools\u201D support the core activities of the component \u201CExecution.\u201D The survey had a response rate of 40% (37 of 93). The answers reflect the large variation in the number of criteria that are satisfied for the participating organizations. Overall, maintenance of larger TSs seems to satisfy more criteria.

Surveying the current practice showed that there is ample room to improve the maintenance processes of medical TSs, especially for the smaller TSs.","publish_time":"2008-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bakhshi-Raiez, Ferishta; Cornet, Ronald; de Keizer, Nicolette F.","journal":"Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/edb259e862e6e83f66362bdf7bdd7f000db76c2d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/7efb54023782ec34318ba9acf95660567ae59d37.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2528044.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article-pdf/15/5/687/2187065/15-5-687.pdf; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1067502708001011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1067502708001011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18579838/; https://doi.org/10.1197/jamia.m2531","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Terminological Systems","TS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["maintenance of TSs","maintenance processes of TSs","maintenance of medical TSs","maintenance of larger TSs","maintenance processes of medical TSs","current practice of TS maintenance","smaller TSs","framework","number of criteria","Process management","standardization","core activities","Execution","survey","literature study","Observational study","Results","paper","components","primary component","participating organizations","Editing tools","Change specifications","important step","relevant articles","ample room","large variation","light","OBJECTIVE","Terminological Systems","answers","response rate","DESIGN","CONCLUSIONS","application","size","order","utility","MEASUREMENTS","shortcomings"],"language":"en"},

This review is focused on the plasticity of the PDZ interactions.","publish_time":"2012-08-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ivarsson, Ylva","journal":"FEBS Lett","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5fa7634d3fe1eeb4511f84bbe215ece3dae182b6.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2af5713a97c69565489dfc0154a24bf1e78b9980.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094393.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22576124/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014579312003043; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2012.04.015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579312003043","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PDZ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PDZ interactions","phosphorylation of PDZ domains","archetypical PDZ function","protein","recognition of internal peptide sequences","versatile module","recognition of short","disordered C-terminal peptide motifs","changes of physiological buffer conditions","allosteric effects","dimerization","functional repertoire","various means","phospholipid binding","important role","dynamic regulators of cell","ligands","organization","plasticity","complexes","review"],"language":"en"},

Since the introduction of metagenomics nearly a decade ago, numerous reports have described successful applications in an increasing variety of biological specimens, such as respiratory secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, stool, blood and tissue. Considerable advancements in sequencing and computational technologies in recent years have made CMg a promising tool in clinical microbiology laboratories. Moreover, costs per sample and turnaround time from specimen receipt to clinical management continue to decrease, making the prospect of CMg more feasible. Many difficulties, however, are associated with CMg and warrant further improvements such as the informatics infrastructure and analytical pipelines. Thus, the current review focuses on comprehensively assessing applications of CMg for diagnostic and subtyping purposes.","publish_time":"2018-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Forbes, Jessica D.; Knox, Natalie C.; Peterson, Christy-Lynn; Reimer, Aleisha R.","journal":"Comput Struct Biotechnol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4a77ed78a686731dd79b6adcb1c1052b13e18be1.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3b58ee0596ad8476e262079ab15fcfc377e0fec3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6050174.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30026887/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2001037017301198; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037017301198; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2018.02.006","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["applications of CMg","clinical specimen","Clinical metagenomics","prospect of CMg","clinical management","generation sequencing","clinical microbiology laboratories","specimen receipt","successful applications","diagnostic perspective","introduction of metagenomics","computational technologies","turnaround time","antimicrobial resistance profiles","recent years","promising tool","stool","respiratory secretions","nucleic acid material present","cerebrospinal fluid","increasing variety of biological specimens","sample","intent","targeted treatment regimens","putative pathogens","numerous reports","informatics infrastructure","blood","decade","ability","Considerable advancements","subtyping purposes","analytical pipelines","relevant microbial information","tissue","costs","NGS","improvements"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: We compared the clinical severity of HRV/ENT to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A/B (FLU), and other common respiratory viruses in children. PATIENTS/METHODS: Retrospective study of children with ARIs and confirmed single positive viral infections on mid\u2010turbinate swabs by molecular assays. Outcome measures included hospital admission and, for inpatients, a composite endpoint consisting of intensive care admission, hospitalization \u003E5 days, oxygen requirements or death. RESULTS: A total of 116 HRV/ENT, 102 RSV, 99 FLU, and 64 other common respiratory viruses were identified. Children with single HRV/ENT infections presented with significantly higher rates of underlying immunosuppressive conditions compared to those with RSV (37\u00B79% versus 13\u00B76%; P \u003C 0\u00B7001), FLU (37\u00B79% versus 22%; P = 0\u00B7018) or any other single viral infection (37\u00B79% versus 22\u00B75%; P = 0\u00B7024). In multivariable analysis adjusted for underlying conditions and age, children with HRV/ENT infections had increased odds of hospitalization compared to children with RSV infections (OR 2\u00B76; 95% CI 1\u00B74, 4\u00B78; P \u003C 0\u00B7003) or FLU infections (OR 3\u00B70; 95% CI 1\u00B76, 5\u00B78; \u003C0\u00B7001) and increased odds of severe clinical disease among inpatients (OR 3\u00B70; 95% CI 1\u00B76,5\u00B76; P = 0\u00B7001) when compared to those with FLU infections.

Among the restrictive measures, air traffic suspension is certainly quite effective in reducing the mobility on the global scale in the short term but it also has high socio-economic impact on the long and short term. The main focus of this study is to collect and prepare data on air passengers traffic worldwide with the scope of analyze the impact of travel ban on the aviation sector. Based on historical data from January 2010 till October 2019, a forecasting model is implemented in order to set a reference baseline. Making use of airplane movements extracted from online flight tracking platforms and on-line booking systems, this study presents also a first assessment of recent changes in flight activity around the world as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. To study the effects of air travel ban on aviation and in turn its socio-economic, several scenarios are constructed based on past pandemic crisis and the observed flight volumes. It turns out that, according to these hypothetical scenarios, in the first Quarter of 2020 the impact of aviation losses could have negatively reduced World GDP by 0.02% to 0.12% according to the observed data and, in the worst case scenarios, at the end of 2020 the loss could be as high as 1.41-1.67% and job losses may reach the value of 25-30 millions. Focusing on EU27, the GDP loss may amount to 1.66-1.98% by the end of 2020 and the number of job losses from 4.2 to 5 millions in the worst case scenarios. Some countries will be more affected than others in the short run and most European airlines companies will suffer from the travel ban. We hope that that these preliminary results may be of help for informed policy making design of exit strategies from this global crisis.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Iacus, Stefano Maria; Natale, Fabrizio; Santamaria, Carlos; Spyratos, Spyridon; Vespe, Michele","journal":"Saf Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/45de6f282c944c846d451b828b63a4db347c2ce9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7200368.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925753520301880?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925753520301880; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32377034/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104791","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs0NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["impact of aviation losses","impact of travel ban","study","worst case scenarios","short term","effects of air travel ban","observed data","hypothetical scenarios","coronavirus global crisis","high socio-economic impact","number of job losses","online flight","flight activity","observed flight volumes","short run","air traffic suspension","air passengers traffic","aviation sector","past pandemic crisis","order","global scale","countries","millions","end","GDP loss","historical data","place restrictive measures","reduced World GDP","number of casualties","platforms","design of exit strategies","on-line booking systems","informed policy","help","European airlines companies","scope","assessment of recent changes","use of airplane movements","pandemia","Quarter","mobility","COVID","value","preliminary results","forecasting model","reference baseline","main focus","EU27"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Objective As the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract represent a major portal of entry for most human viruses and many bacteria, they seem to be a critical component of the mammalian immunologic repertoire. Thus, vaccines stimulating this local immunity could represent an interesting approach to prevent these infections. After detailing the different mechanisms implied in this mucosal immunity, the aim of this study is to analyze the basis of such a vaccination and the different vaccines available to mucosal respiratory tract use. Mucosal immunity The major antibody isotype in external secretions is secretory immunoglobin A (S-IgA); the role of IgM (S-IgM) and IgG (S-IgG) are actually questionned. It is, however, interesting that the major effector cells in the mucosal surfaces are not IgA B cells, but T lymphocytes that may represent up to 80% of the entire mucosal lymphoid cell population. Immunoprophylaxis by the mucosal route Passive antibodies were shown to protect against mucosal viral infections, such as those caused by RSV, but very high quantities of passive antibodies are needed to restrict virus replication on mucosal surface. In general, factors which favor development of mucosal antibody and cell mediated immune responses include the oral or respiratory immunization and the replicating nature of the vaccine agents. However, to date only a few vaccines have become available to mucosal respiratory tract use, and cold-adapted influenza virus vaccines is the only one available using nasal route. Other parenteral licensed vaccines have not been recommended for mucosal administration. Some of them have been experimentally used with nasal administration of replicating agents (varicella and measles vaccines) or non replicating agents (influenza inactivated vaccine), but have been found to induce a very low mucosal response. Conclusion Based on the experience with existing vaccines, the development of mucosal immunity or administration of vaccines via the mucosal route is clearly not a prerequisite today for control or prevention of most viral infectious respiratory diseases or diseases with respiratory tract as a route of contamination. But the example of live attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine inducing both systemic and local immune response without immunopathology, is promising for the future of the mucosal immunization against respiratory viral infections.","publish_time":"2007-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Denis, F.; Hantz, S.; Alain, S.","journal":"Antibiotiques","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f88e22cb3c38c82226b07f7cdc3bd73cd3abea36.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1294550107887784; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1294550107887784","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["However"],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":["IgA"],"keyphrases":["voie muqueuse","the aim","the role","voie respiratoire","voie nasale","the vaccine agents","mucosal antibody","the replicating nature","the respiratory tract represent","interesting that the major effector cells in the mucosal surfaces","voie orale","voie parent\u00E9rale","voie inhabituelle","voie essentielle","Abstract Objective As the mucosal surfaces","immunit\u00E9 muqueuse","the different vaccines available to mucosal respiratory tract","the entire mucosal lymphoid cell population","the mammalian immunologic repertoire","this study is to analyze the basis","the mucosal route Passive antibodies were shown to protect against mucosal viral infections","r\u00E9ponse immune muqueuse","After detailing the different mechanisms implied in this mucosal immunity","niveau de la muqueuse","Mucosal immunity The major antibody isotype in external secretions is secretory immunoglobin","IgG","isotype IgA","vaccins commercialis\u00E9s","vaccins disponibles","vaccins vivants","vaccins stimulant","cell mediated immune responses include the oral or respiratory immunization","virus respiratoires","immunit\u00E9 locale","diff\u00E9rents vaccins administrables","cellules IgA de type","anticorps de type IgM","needed to restrict virus replication","vaccins antiviraux muqueux","they seem to be","In general","infections virales","arbre respiratoire","virus r\u00E9plicatifs","exemple du vaccin grippe","vaccines stimulating this local immunity could represent an interesting approach to prevent these infections","major portal","lymphocytes that may represent","surfaces muqueuses","It is","telle vaccination","avenir de la vaccination","vaccin grippal","vaccin actif","r\u00E9ponse locale mod\u00E9r\u00E9e","anticorps n\u00E9cessaires","principaux anticorps","seul exemple","such as those caused","but very high quantities","grippe injectable","cellules effectrices","nombreux agents pathog\u00E8nes","diff\u00E9rents m\u00E9canismes mis","critical component","many bacteria","RSV","entry","most human viruses","factors which favor development","however","entr\u00E9e","rougeole","immunoglobulines sp\u00E9cifiques administr\u00E9es","Thus","jeu","Immunoprophylaxis","m\u00E9diation cellulaire","approche int\u00E9ressante","quantit\u00E9s","porte","connaissances","varicelle","Immunoprophylaxie","R\u00E8sum\u00E8 Objectifs","site critique","facteurs susceptibles","\u00E9tat actuel","VRS","pr\u00E9vention","totalit\u00E9 des populations lymphocytaires","principe","approches","\u00E9tude","r\u00F4le","actually questionned","Conclusion","ann\u00E9es","mucosal administration","the future","the development","the mucosal route is clearly","the experience with existing vaccines","measles vaccines","mucosal immunity or administration","But the example","adapted influenza virus vaccines is the only","the mucosal immunization against respiratory viral infections","become available to mucosal respiratory tract","very low mucosal response","diseases with respiratory tract as","Other parenteral licensed vaccines","is promising","most viral infectious respiratory diseases","influenza inactivated vaccine","replicating agents","experimentally used with nasal administration","available using nasal route","to date only","control or prevention","found to induce","live attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine inducing both systemic","local immune response without immunopathology","prerequisite today","varicella","Conclusion Based","them","recommended","contamination","Some","However"],"language":"fr"},

The pharmacological inhibition of autophagy contributes to increase the efficacy of antineoplastic agents. Exposing tumor cells to low concentrations of select autophagy-inducing antineoplastic agents increases their immunogenicity and enhances their ability to stimulate dendritic cell (DC) maturation. We tested whether the application of an autophagy-inhibiting agent, chloroquine (CQ), in combination with low concentrations of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) increases the ability of tumor cells to induce DC maturation. DCs sensitized with the lysate of HCT-116 cells previously exposed to such a combination enhanced the DC maturation/activation ability. These matured DCs also increased the allogeneic responsiveness of both CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cells, which showed a greater proliferative response than those from DCs sensitized with control lysates. The T cells expanded in such cocultures were CD69\u002B and PD-1- and produced higher levels of IFN-\u03B3 and lower levels of IL-10, consistent with the preferential activation of Th1 cells. Cocultures of autologous DCs and lymphocytes improved the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, as assessed by the expression of CD107a, perforin, and granzyme B. The drug combination increased the expression of genes related to the CEACAM family (BECN1, ATGs, MAPLC3B, ULK1, SQSTM1) and tumor suppressors (PCBP1). Furthermore, the decreased expression of genes related to metastasis and tumor progression (BNIP3, BNIP3L, FOSL2, HES1, LAMB3, LOXL2, NDRG1, P4HA1, PIK3R2) was noted. The combination of 5-FU and CQ increases the ability of tumor cells to drive DC maturation and enhances the ability of DCs to stimulate T cell responses.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zamame Ramirez, Jofer Andree; Romagnoli, Graziela Gorete; Falasco, Bianca Francisco; Gorgulho, Carolina Mendon\u00E7a; Sanzochi Fogolin, Carla; dos Santos, Daniela Carvalho; Junior, Jo\u00E3o Pessoa Ara\u00FAjo; Lotze, Michael Thomas; Ureshino, Rodrigo Portes; Kaneno, Ramon","journal":"Int Immunopharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd2f584c21a2bc13a089348c021044609e55dc06.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152898.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106495; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576920306354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32298965/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567576920306354","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs1MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ability of tumor cells","T cells","ability of DCs","tumor progression","tumor escape","tumor suppressors","DC maturation","activation ability","preferential activation of Th1 cells","matured DCs","Cocultures of autologous DCs","drug combination","T cell responses","CQ","generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes","decreased expression of genes","low concentrations","expression of CD107a","pharmacological inhibition of autophagy","FU","efficacy of antineoplastic agents","dendritic cell","higher levels of IFN","lower levels of IL","LOXL2","LAMB3","ATGs","HES1","FOSL2","SQSTM1","ULK1","BNIP3L","metastasis","NDRG1","BECN1","MAPLC3B","CEACAM family","CD4","damage","allogeneic responsiveness","important mechanism","immunotherapy","chemotherapy","radiation therapy","P4HA1","perforin","granzyme","greater proliferative response","CD8","chloroquine","PIK3R2","PD","PCBP1","fluorouracil","CD69","immunogenicity","lysate of HCT","application","control lysates","development of resistance"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, the Glu54 residue of the protease was subjected to site-saturation mutagenesis, with the result that nearly half of the mutants retained the significant proteolytic activity. It was suggested that a carboxylate at position 54 was not essential for the activity. The in vitro assays of the proteolysis revealed that most of Glu54 mutants retained relatively high proteolytic activity. When the Glu54 mutation was combined with the Ser mutation of the Cys139 residue, a nucleophile, only the Asp54 and Gln54 mutations showed proteolytic activity comparable to that of the Ser139 single mutant, suggesting that a hydrogen bond between Glu54 and His30 was critical in the Ser139 background.

The aim of this study was to discover and identify potential biomarkers specific for TB. METHODS: The surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) combined with weak cation exchange (WCX) magnetic beads was used to screen serum samples from 180 cases of TB and 211 control subjects. A classification model was established by Biomarker Pattern Software (BPS). Candidate protein biomarkers were purified by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), identified by MALDI-TOF MS, LC-MS/MS and validated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: A total of 35 discriminating m/z peaks were detected that were related to TB (P \u003C 0.01). The model of biomarkers based on the four biomarkers (2554.6, 4824.4, 5325.7, and 8606.8 Da) was established which could distinguish TB from controls with the sensitivity of 83.3% and the specificity of 84.2%. The candidate biomarker with m/z of 2554.6 Da was found to be up-regulated in TB patients, and was identified as a fragment of fibrinogen, alpha polypeptide isoform alpha-E preproprotein. Analysis in 22 patients with TB showed increased fibrinogen degradation product (FDP) (5,005 \u00B1 1,297 vs. 4,010 \u00B1 1,181 ng/mL, P \u003C 0.05) and in 142 patients showed elevated plasma fibrinogen levels. CONCLUSIONS: A diagnostic model for TB with high sensitivity and specificity was developed using mass spectrometry combined with magnetic beads.

Systems biology-based approaches study infectious diseases by analyzing the interactions between the host species and the pathogen organisms. This work aims to combine the knowledge from experimental studies of host\u2013pathogen interactions in several diseases to build stronger predictive models. Our approach is based on a formalism from machine learning called \u2018multitask learning\u2019, which considers the problem of building models across tasks that are related to each other. A \u2018task\u2019 in our scenario is the set of host\u2013pathogen protein interactions involved in one disease. To integrate interactions from several tasks (i.e. diseases), our method exploits the similarity in the infection process across the diseases. In particular, we use the biological hypothesis that similar pathogens target the same critical biological processes in the host, in defining a common structure across the tasks. Results: Our current work on host\u2013pathogen protein interaction prediction focuses on human as the host, and four bacterial species as pathogens. The multitask learning technique we develop uses a task-based regularization approach. We find that the resulting optimization problem is a difference of convex (DC) functions. To optimize, we implement a Convex\u2013Concave procedure-based algorithm. We compare our integrative approach to baseline methods that build models on a single host\u2013pathogen protein interaction dataset. Our results show that our approach outperforms the baselines on the training data. We further analyze the protein interaction predictions generated by the models, and find some interesting insights.

A phylogenetic tree of the nucleocapsid protein of various coronaviruses indicates that the coronaviruses fall into distinct groups that correspond to the three major antigenic groups; however, a phylogenetic tree of the IBV nucleocapsid shows that this does not hold true for the type specific antigenic groups of IBV.","publish_time":"1992-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Williams, Anna K.; Li, Wang; Sneed, Loyd W.; Collisson, Ellen W.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51573a9d5b4012f520d0c71ac4b22c75fd659d95.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/016817029290135V; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016817029290135V","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV nucleocapsid","IBV strains","type specific antigenic groups of IBV","distinct groups","coronavirus major antigenic groups","nucleocapsid protein of various coronaviruses","nucleocapsid genes","IBV nucleotide sequence alignment","phylogenetic tree","evolutionary relationship of coronaviruses","natural sequence variations","strains of infectious bronchitis virus","Holl52","size","composition","Holland52","Arkansas99","Ark99","Gray","sequences","published sequencing data","order","homologies","regions"],"language":"en"},

The virus that causes this disease is indicated originating from animals traded in a live animal market in Wuhan, China. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 can attack lung cells because there are many conserved receptor entries, namely Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2. The presence of this virus in host cells will initiate various protective responses leading to pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. This review aimed to provide an overview related to this virus and examine the body\u0027s responses and possible therapies. METHOD: We searched PubMed databases for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. Full texts were retrieved, analyzed and developed into an easy-to-understand review. RESULTS: We provide a complete review related to structure, origin, and how the body responds to this virus infection and explain the possibility of an immune system over-reaction or cytokine storm. We also include an explanation of how this virus creates modes of avoidance to evade immune system attacks. We further explain the therapeutic approaches that can be taken in the treatment and prevention of this viral infection. CONCLUSION: In summary, based on the structural and immune-evasion system of coronavirus, we suggest several approaches to treat the disease.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Astuti, Indwiani; Ysrafil","journal":"Diabetes Metab Syndr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/81471fa1ace5ccb2b8e276da1bbe851373dd9689.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165108.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871402120300849; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32335367/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402120300849?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["coronavirus disease","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome","Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus","virus infection","immune-evasion system of coronavirus","pandemic disease","immune system attacks","immune system over-reaction","complete review","various protective responses","host cells","lung cells","various countries","body\u0027s responses","viral infection","therapeutic approaches","pneumonia","PubMed databases","status","possibility","live animal market","cytokine storm","modes of avoidance","epidemic","conserved receptor entries","rapid spread","Angiotensin","Wuhan","China","origin","animals","change","Enzyme","treatment","prevention","possible therapies","world","structure","presence","announcement","summary","BACKGROUND","AIM","METHOD","RESULTS","explanation","overview","CONCLUSION","texts"],"language":"en"},

The potential recurrence of the disease from animal reservoirs highlights the significance of development of safe and efficient vaccines to prevent a future SARS epidemic. In this study, we expressed the recombinant receptor-binding domain (rRBD) in mammalian (293T) cells, insect (Sf9) cells, and E. coli, respectively, and compared their immunogenicity and protection against SARS-CoV infection in an established mouse model. Our results show that all rRBD proteins expressed in the above systems maintained intact conformation, being able to induce highly potent neutralizing antibody responses and complete protective immunity against SARS-CoV challenge in mice, albeit the rRBD expressed in 293T cells elicited stronger humoral immune responses with significantly higher neutralizing activity (P \u003C 0.05) than those expressed in Sf9 and E. coli cells. These results suggest that all three rRBDs are effective in eliciting immune responses and protection against SARS-CoV and any of the above expression systems can be used for production of rRBD-based SARS subunit vaccines. Preference will be given to rRBD expressed in mammalian cells for future evaluation of the vaccine efficacy in a non-human primate model of SARS because of its ability to refold into a native conformation more readily and to induce higher level of neutralizing antibody responses than those expressed in E. coli and insect cells.","publish_time":"2009-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Du, Lanying; Zhao, Guangyu; Chan, Chris CS; Sun, Shihui; Chen, Min; Liu, Zhonghua; Guo, Hongxiang; He, Yuxian; Zhou, Yusen; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Jiang, Shibo","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec14f3a9dcb7254a6111420df8dec60d6a503104.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ced0deabb5630c40ad904cd57efc0a3799bb8e79.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2753736.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682209004516; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19683779/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2009.07.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682209004516","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["coli cells","mammalian cells","insect cells","SARS-CoV infection","SARS-CoV challenge","future SARS epidemic","production of rRBD","rRBD proteins","based SARS subunit vaccines","potent neutralizing antibody responses","higher level of neutralizing antibody responses","non-human primate model of SARS","eliciting immune responses","stronger humoral immune responses","higher neutralizing activity","protection","Sf9","results","efficient vaccines","future evaluation","expression systems","intact conformation","native conformation","established mouse model","emerging infectious disease","complete protective immunity","vaccine efficacy","significance of development","animal reservoirs","recombinant receptor-binding domain","rRBDs","ability","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","mice","potential recurrence","immunogenicity","study","Preference"],"language":"en"},

Evidence of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV infection in vitro and in non-human primates clouds the prospects for a safe vaccine. Using antibodies from SARS patients, we identified and characterized SARS-CoV B-cell peptide epitopes with disparate functions. In rhesus macaques, the spike glycoprotein peptides S(471\u2013503), S(604\u2013625), and S(1164\u20131191) elicited antibodies that efficiently prevented infection in non-human primates. In contrast, peptide S(597\u2013603) induced antibodies that enhanced infection both in vitro and in non-human primates by using an epitope sequence-dependent (ESD) mechanism. This peptide exhibited a high level of serological reactivity (64%), which resulted from the additive responses of two tandem epitopes (S(597\u2013603) and S(604\u2013625)) and a long-term human B-cell memory response with antisera from convalescent SARS patients. Thus, peptide-based vaccines against SARS-CoV could be engineered to avoid ADE via elimination of the S(597\u2013603) epitope.

The objective of this study is to investigate the short-term effect of risk-adapted treatment strategy on patients with COVID-19. Methods We collected the medical records of 55 COVID-19 patients for analysis. We divided these patients into mild, moderate and severe groups, and risk-adapted treatment approaches were given according to the illness severity. Results Twelve patients were in mild group and 22 were in moderate group (non-severe group, n=34), and 21 patients were in severe group. At the end of the first two weeks after admission, clinical manifestations had completely despeared in 31(91.2%)patients in non-severe group, and 18(85.7%) patients in severe group (p=0.85). Both groups had a satisfied chest CT imaging recovery, which includes 22(64.7%) patients in non-severe group and 12(57.1%) patients in severe group recovered at least 50% of the whole leisions in the first week, and 28(82.4%) and 16(76.2%) recovered at least 75% in the second week, respectively. There were no significant differences in SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance between two group (p=0.92). There were also no significant differences in the levels of SARS-CoV-2-IgM and IgG antibody production between the two groups (p=0.13, 0.62). There were 45 cases were discharged from the hospital, and no patients died at the time of this clinical analysis. Conclusions Risk-adapted treatment strategy was associated with significant clinical manifestations alleviation and clinical imaging recovery. In severe COVID-19 patients, early and short-term use of low-dose methylprednisolone was beneficial and did not delay SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance and influence IgG antibody production.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Changcheng; Wang, Jinquan; Guo, Hui; Lu, Zhaohui; Ma, Yan; Zhu, Yuyou; Xia, Daqing; Wang, Yinzhong; He, Hongliang; Zhou, Jian; Wang, Yong; Fei, Mingming; Yin, Yihong; Zheng, Mao; Xu, Yehong","journal":"Int J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0370abacf3b212bd6bded8f23c8c904000f6c2e6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S120197122030179X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32229257/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.047; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S120197122030179X?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","non-severe group","severe COVID","moderate group","severe groups","mild group","SARS-CoV","clinical analysis","clinical imaging recovery","risk-adapted treatment approaches","significant clinical manifestations alleviation","significant differences","Conclusions Risk-adapted treatment strategy","RNA clearance","short-term effect of risk","levels of SARS","influence IgG antibody production","satisfied chest CT imaging recovery","short-term use of low","dose methylprednisolone","IgM","clear expert consensus","guidelines","weeks","Abstract Background","medical records","study","admission","time","Results","coronavirus disease","Methods","hospital","illness severity","cases","objective","end","leisions"],"language":"en"},

The use of antibiotics remains highly prevalent in young children, but can lead to antimicrobial resistance as well as reinforcing the idea that parents should re-consult for similar symptoms. One of the main drivers of indiscriminate antimicrobial use is the lack of evidence for, and therefore uncertainty regarding, which children are at risk of poor outcome. This paper describes the protocol for the TARGET cohort study, which aims to derive and validate a clinical prediction rule to identify children presenting to primary care with respiratory tract infections who are at risk of hospitalisation. METHODS/DESIGN: The TARGET cohort study is a large, multicentre prospective observational study aiming to recruit 8,300 children aged \u22653 months and \u003C16 years presenting to primary care with a cough and respiratory tract infection symptoms from 4 study centres (Bristol, London, Oxford and Southampton). Following informed consent, symptoms, signs and demographics will be measured. In around a quarter of children from the Bristol centre, a single sweep, dual bacterial-viral throat swab will be taken and parents asked to complete a symptom diary until the child is completely well or for 28 days, whichever is sooner. A review of medical notes including clinical history, re-consultation and hospitalisations will be undertaken. Multivariable logistic regression will be used to identify the independent clinical predictors of hospitalisation as well as the prognostic significance of upper respiratory tract microbes. The clinical prediction rule will be internally validated using various methods including bootstrapping. DISCUSSION: The clinical prediction rule for hospitalisation has the potential to help identify a small group of children for hospitalisation and a much larger group where hospitalisation is very unlikely and antibiotic prescribing would be less warranted. This study will also be the largest natural history study to date of children presenting to primary care with acute cough and respiratory tract infections, and will provide important information on symptom duration, re-consultations and the microbiology of the upper respiratory tract.","publish_time":"2013-08-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Redmond, Niamh M; Davies, Rachel; Christensen, Hannah; Blair, Peter S; Lovering, Andrew M; Leeming, John P; Muir, Peter; Vipond, Barry; Thornton, Hannah; Fletcher, Margaret; Delaney, Brendan; Little, Paul; Thompson, Matthew; Peters, Tim J; Hay, Alastair D","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f9e15b30bfa7b75a43c5d9febf1b6f71240f80b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3765099.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23958109/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-13-322","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Oxford"],"locations":["Southampton"],"keyphrases":["respiratory tract infections","date of children","young children","quarter of children","respiratory tract infection symptoms","small group of children","clinical prediction rule","study centres","clinical history","risk of hospitalisation","TARGET cohort study","use of primary care health care resources","independent clinical predictors of hospitalisation","prognostic significance of upper respiratory tract microbes","largest natural history study","multicentre prospective observational study","re-consultations","use of antibiotics","similar symptoms","larger group","parents","frequent patient group","main drivers of indiscriminate antimicrobial use","single sweep","acute cough","Bristol centre","symptom duration","symptom diary","antimicrobial resistance","various methods","risk of poor outcome","dual bacterial-viral throat swab","important information","microbiology","London","review of medical notes","potential","Oxford","signs","antibiotic prescribing","idea","lack of evidence","protocol","hospitalisations","DESIGN","BACKGROUND","informed consent","Southampton","demographics","years","DISCUSSION","Multivariable logistic regression","bootstrapping","paper","months","uncertainty","days"],"language":"en"},

However, the seasonal and interannual risks of pathogens importation and onward transmission from endemic countries have rarely been quantified and validated. We constructed a modelling framework, integrating air travel, epidemiological, demographical, entomological and meteorological data, to measure the seasonal probability of dengue introduction from endemic countries. This framework has been applied retrospectively to elucidate spatiotemporal patterns and increasing seasonal risk of dengue importation from South-East Asia into China via air travel in multiple populations, Chinese travelers and local residents, over a decade of 2005\u201315. We found that the volume of airline travelers from South-East Asia into China has quadrupled from 2005 to 2015 with Chinese travelers increased rapidly. Following the growth of air traffic, the probability of dengue importation from South-East Asia into China has increased dramatically from 2005 to 2015. This study also revealed seasonal asymmetries of transmission routes: Sri Lanka and Maldives have emerged as origins; neglected cities at central and coastal China have been increasingly vulnerable to dengue importation and onward transmission. Compared to the monthly occurrence of dengue reported in China, our model performed robustly for importation and onward transmission risk estimates. The approach and evidence could facilitate to understand and mitigate the changing seasonal threat of arbovirus from endemic regions.","publish_time":"2018-11-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lai, Shengjie; Johansson, Michael A.; Yin, Wenwu; Wardrop, Nicola A.; van Panhuis, Willem G.; Wesolowski, Amy; Kraemer, Moritz U.

Pathogens and their vectors can now move further, faster and in greater numbers than ever before. Three important consequences of global transport network expansion are infectious disease pandemics, vector invasion events and vector-borne pathogen importation. This review briefly examines some of the important historical examples of these disease and vector movements, such as the global influenza pandemics, the devastating Anopheles gambiae invasion of Brazil and the recent increases in imported Plasmodium falciparum malaria cases. We then outline potential approaches for future studies of disease movement, focussing on vector invasion and vector-borne disease importation. Such approaches allow us to explore the potential implications of international air travel, shipping routes and other methods of transport on global pathogen and vector traffic.","publish_time":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tatem, A.J.; Rogers, D.J.; Hay, S.I.","journal":"Global Mapping of Infectious Diseases: Methods, Examples and Emerging Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b8e2ff89c21ed4324e6019ea7d29faa8335b0bd8.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8ed8119920d5f80eecacefd985a9e1e5a6c40217.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3145127.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065308X0562009X; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3145127?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065308X0562009X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["vector movements","vector traffic","vector invasion events","disease importation","global pathogen","infectious disease pandemics","methods of transport","global influenza pandemics","potential approaches","pathogen importation","important consequences of global transport network expansion","future studies of disease movement","land transport networks","potential implications of international air travel","speed of travel","devastating Anopheles gambiae invasion of Brazil","important historical examples","recent increases","shipping routes","imported Plasmodium falciparum malaria cases","reach","volume of passengers","goods","vectors","greater numbers","Pathogens","review"],"language":"en"},

In this context, it is important to analyze the innate immune host responses triggered against ChikV. Autophagy has been shown to be an important component of the innate immune response and is involved in host defense elimination of different pathogens. However, the autophagic process was recently observed to be hijacked by virus for their own replication. Here we provide the first evidence that hallmarks of autophagy are specifically found in HEK.293 infected cells and are involved in ChikV replication. METHODS: To test the capacity of ChikV to mobilize the autophagic machinery, we performed fluorescence microscopy experiments on HEK.GFP.LC3 stable cells, and followed the LC3 distribution during the time course of ChikV infection. To confirm this, we performed electron microscopy on HEK.293 infected cells. To test the effect of ChikV-induced-autophagy on viral replication, we blocked the autophagic process, either by pharmacological (3-MA) or genetic inhibition (siRNA against the transcript of Beclin 1, an autophagic protein), and analyzed the percentage of infected cells and the viral RNA load released in the supernatant. Moreover, the effect of induction of autophagy by Rapamycin on viral replication was tested. RESULTS: The increasing number of GFP-LC3 positive cells with a punctate staining together with the enhanced number of GFP-LC3 dots per cell showed that ChikV triggered an autophagic process in HEK.293 infected cells. Those results were confirmed by electron microscopy analysis since numerous membrane-bound vacuoles characteristic of autophagosomes were observed in infected cells. Moreover, we found that inhibition of autophagy, either by biochemical reagent and RNA interference, dramatically decreases ChikV replication. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results suggest that autophagy may play a promoting role in ChikV replication. Investigating in details the relationship between autophagy and viral replication will greatly improve our knowledge of the pathogenesis of ChikV and provide insight for the design of candidate antiviral therapeutics.","publish_time":"2011-09-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krejbich-Trotot, Pascale; Gay, Bernard; Li-Pat-Yuen, Ghislaine; Hoarau, Jean-Jacques; Jaffar-Bandjee, Marie-Christine; Briant, Laurence; Gasque, Philippe; Denizot, M\u00E9lanie","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1d1a8d96a13afa9c54ff26241095b55c0be7ff1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3179960.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21902836/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-432","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Autophagy"],"locations":["Indian Ocean","Europe"],"keyphrases":["ChikV replication","effect of ChikV","pathogenesis of ChikV","capacity of ChikV","viral replication","inhibition of autophagy","percentage of infected cells","stable cells","autophagic process","hallmarks of autophagy","LC3 positive cells","time course of ChikV infection","autophagic machinery","HEK","autophagic protein","RESULTS","viral RNA load","LC3 dots","LC3 distribution","electron microscopy analysis","innate immune host responses","enhanced number of GFP","increasing number of GFP","fluorescence microscopy experiments","innate immune response","RNA interference","important component","genetic inhibition","effect of induction","Chikungunya Virus","host defense elimination of different pathogens","numerous membrane-bound vacuoles characteristic of autophagosomes","punctate staining","exceptional severe physiopathology","Indian Ocean","infants","siRNA","insight","Rapamycin","massive re-emerging outbreak","elderly patients","transcript of Beclin","biochemical reagent","Europe","design of candidate antiviral therapeutics","relationship","knowledge","promoting role","supernatant","BACKGROUND","details","evidence","METHODS","context","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

HIV-1 has recently been shown to package non-lysyl transfer RNAs (tRNAs) in addition to the tRNA(Lys) needed for priming reverse transcription and integration of the HIV-1 genome. By comparing the codon usage of HIV-1 genes with that of its human host, we found that tRNAs decoding codons that are highly used by HIV-1 but avoided by its host are overrepresented in HIV-1 virions. In particular, tRNAs decoding A-ending codons, required for the expression of HIV\u0027s A-rich genome, are highly enriched. Because the affinity of Gag-Pol for all tRNAs is nonspecific, HIV packaging is most likely passive and reflects the tRNA pool at the time of viral particle formation. Codon usage of HIV-1 early genes is similar to that of highly expressed host genes, but codon usage of HIV-1 late genes was better adapted to the selectively enriched tRNA pool, suggesting that alterations in the tRNA pool are induced late in viral infection. If HIV-1 genes are adapting to an altered tRNA pool, codon adaptation of HIV-1 may be better than previously thought.","publish_time":"2011-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Weringh, Anna; Ragonnet-Cronin, Manon; Pranckeviciene, Erinija; Pavon-Eternod, Mariana; Kleiman, Lawrence; Xia, Xuhua","journal":"Mol Biol Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92e14fff3e37477102149550fc8f3ff9d5ffc6f6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3098512.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21216840/; https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msr005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["codon usage of HIV","HIV packaging","codon adaptation of HIV","tRNAs","enriched tRNA pool","adapted codon usage","expressed host genes","late genes","altered tRNA pool","early genes","human host cells","codons","rich genome","viral infection","time of viral particle formation","priming reverse transcription","integration","addition","alterations","non-lysyl transfer RNAs","Pol","expression of HIV\u0027s","replicates","affinity of Gag","virions"],"language":"en"},

Rodents are the most numerous, widespread, and diverse group of mammals on the earth and are reservoirs for many zoonotic viruses responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. A better understanding of virome diversity in rodents would be of importance for researchers and professionals in the field. Therefore, we developed the DRodVir database (http://www.mgc.ac.cn/DRodVir/), a comprehensive, up-to-date, and well-curated repository of rodent-associated animal viruses. The database currently covers 7690 sequences from 5491 rodent-associated mammal viruses of 26 viral families detected from 194 rodent species in 93 countries worldwide. In addition to virus sequences, the database provides detailed information on related samples and host rodents, as well as a set of online analytical tools for text query, BLAST search and phylogenetic reconstruction. The DRodVir database will help virologists better understand the virome diversity of rodents. Moreover, it will be a valuable tool for epidemiologists and zoologists for easy monitoring and tracking of the current and future zoonotic diseases. As a data application example, we further compared the current status of rodent-associated viruses with bat-associated viruses to highlight the necessity for including additional host species and geographic regions in future investigations, which will help us achieve a better understanding of the virome diversities in the two major reservoirs of emerging zoonotic infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2017-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Lihong; Liu, Bo; Wu, Zhiqiang; Jin, Qi; Yang, Jian","journal":"J Genet Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/583aceaef70ddffd05d017a665f4b9d0693028d2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105198.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jgg.2017.04.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1673852717300735; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1673852717300735; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28533016/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["associated animal viruses","rodent-associated mammal viruses","bat-associated viruses","zoonotic viruses responsible","rodent species","future zoonotic diseases","Emerging zoonotic diseases","host rodents","virome diversity of rodents","DRodVir database","better understanding of virome diversity","major reservoirs of emerging zoonotic infectious diseases","current status of rodent","wildlife reservoirs","virome diversities","well-curated repository of rodent","additional host species","animal welfare","significant threat","significant morbidity","future investigations","virus sequences","text query","detailed information","BLAST search","zoologists","geographic regions","tracking","tremendous interests","related samples","set of online analytical tools","viral families","easy monitoring","human health","epidemiologists","diverse group of mammals","earth","necessity","phylogenetic reconstruction","recent years","researchers","importance","mortality","virologists","high proportion of zoonoses","valuable tool","economic stability","professionals","data application example","field","countries"],"language":"en"},

Most of the patients suffered of a respiratory disease that will progress to an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia severely ill patients, develop a systemic inflammatory response with a Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), that is characterized by a sudden increase in several pro-inflammatory cytokines, mainly IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-alfa by activated macrophages (M1 phenotype). Blocking IL-6 with tocilizumab and using respirator equipment seems to be a very important issue in this (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia, but not all patients are referred to such treatments. Low dose radiotherapy (0,5 Gy), is an evidence-based anti-inflammatory treatment, that could modify the immune landscape in the lung affected of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, through macrophages polarization to alternatively activated Macrophages (M2 phenotype). Radiation-induced cancer risk could be assumed due to the very low dose used, the advanced age of the patients and the life-threatening condition of SARS-Cov2 pneumonia. LDRT is a cost-effective non-toxic treatment already available in most general hospitals. This fact allows that it would be used for the large number of patients that will suffer this disease, and that would not receive specific anti-IL-6 treatments in ICUs in low and middle income countries.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lara, Pedro C.; Burgos, Javier; Macias, David","journal":"Clin Transl Radiat Oncol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b909db966133085f42a1521c817b83d93cec1df8.json; document_parses/pdf_json/966f4d1a62862bb96d9c9aad07befcbad068a21f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7193092.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32373721/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405630820300306; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctro.2020.04.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405630820300306","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LDRT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","ill patients","activated Macrophages","Cov2 pneumonia","large number of patients","macrophages polarization","life-threatening condition of SARS","treatments","Low dose radiotherapy","specific anti-IL","respiratory disease","acute respiratory distress syndrome","anti-inflammatory treatment","M2 phenotype","M1 phenotype","systemic inflammatory response","pro-inflammatory cytokines","Cytokine Release Syndrome","cost-effective non-toxic treatment","ICUs","advanced age","middle income countries","sudden increase","ARDS","Gy","lung","TNF-alfa","general hospitals","Radiation-induced cancer risk","evidence","LDRT","CRS","immune landscape","tocilizumab","important issue","respirator equipment","COVID","pandemia","people","fact"],"language":"en"},

This review briefly describes some of the challenges it presents. Dengue is an emerging disease; it is increasing in geographical distribution and severity, despite being significantly underreported. The World Health Organization case definition for the generally more severe manifestation of infection, dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), is controversial. The name DHF is something of a misnomer as the disease infrequently results in frank haemorrhage; the hallmark of DHF is actually plasma leakage. The existence of four closely related dengue virus serotypes contributes to difficulties in diagnosis and to original antigenic sin in the serological response to infection. The existence of multiple serotypes can result in more severe disease upon a second infection and complicates vaccine development. Nevertheless, a safe and effective vaccine is the greatest prospect for stemming the tide of dengue.","publish_time":"2010-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gibbons, Robert V.","journal":"International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16e2ff012b5aa4f065f29068537d18fcda3874b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7135181.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857910002608; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924857910002608; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20696556/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2010.06.019","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs1OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","DHF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tide of dengue","Abstract Dengue virus","related dengue virus serotypes","severe disease","severe manifestation of infection","dengue haemorrhagic fever","hallmark of DHF","emerging disease","common arboviral infection of humans","existence of multiple serotypes","effective vaccine","vaccine development","World Health Organization case definition","difficulties","original antigenic sin","diagnosis","greatest prospect","serological response","subtropical regions","frank haemorrhage","plasma leakage","geographical distribution","severity","misnomer","review","challenges"],"language":"en"},

We examined the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and anger in persons isolated during the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic both at isolation period and at four to six months after release from isolation. We also determined risk factors associated with these symptoms at four to six months. METHODS: Of 14,992 individuals isolated for 2-week due to having contact with MERS patients in 2015, when MERS was introduced to Korea, 1,692 individuals were included in this study. Anxiety symptoms were evaluated with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale and anger was assessed with the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory at four to six months after release from isolation for MERS. RESULTS: Of 1,692 who came in contact with MERS patients, 1,656 were not diagnosed with MERS. Among 1,656, anxiety symptoms showed 7.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.3 to 8.9%) and feelings of anger were present in 16.6% (95% CI, 14.8 to 18.4%) during the isolation period. At four to six months after release from isolation, anxiety symptoms were observed in 3.0% (95%CI, 2.2 to 3.9%). Feelings of anger were present in 6.4% (95% CI, 5.2 to 7.6%). Risk factors for experiencing anxiety symptoms and anger at four to six months after release included symptoms related to MERS during isolation, inadequate supplies (food, clothes, accommodation), social networking activities (email, text, Internet), history of psychiatric illnesses, and financial loss.

Differences in news frequency, framing and information source can impact the public\u0027s interpretation of risk messages and subsequent attitudes and behaviors about a particular threat. The media\u0027s framing of an outbreak is important, as it may affect both perception of risk and the ability to process important health information. Methods To understand how risk communication by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during the 2014 Ebola outbreak was framed and delivered and to what extent primetime broadcast news media mirrored CDC\u0027s framing and authoritative voice, 209 CDC communications and primetime broadcast transcripts issued between July 24 and December 29, 2014 were analyzed and coded by thematic frame and authoritative voice. Dominant frame and voice were determined for each month and for overall period of analysis. Results Medical frame was dominant in CDC (60%), Anderson Cooper 360 (49%), The Rachel Maddow Show (47%) and All In with Chris Hayes (47%). The human interest frame was dominant in The Kelly File (45%), while The O\u0027Reilly Factor coverage was equally split between sociopolitical and medical frames (28%, respectively). Primetime news media also changed dominant frames over time. Dominant authoritative voice in CDC communications was that of CDC officials, while primetime news dominantly featured local and federal (non-CDC) government officials and academic/medical experts. Conclusion Differences in framing and delivery could have led the public to interpret risk in a different way than intended by CDC. Overall, public health agencies should consider adapting risk communication strategies to account for a dynamic news environment and the media\u0027s agenda. Options include adapting communications to short-form styles and embracing the concept of storytelling.","publish_time":"2016-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kott, Anne; Limaye, Rupali J.","journal":"Social Science \u0026 Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0d65cdaec492437ccef105e71ee5d2be2576886.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116921.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953616305366; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27682022/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.09.029; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953616305366","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs2ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Anderson Cooper","Rachel Maddow","Chris Hayes"],"organizations":["CDC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CDC communications","CDC officials","Primetime news media","non-CDC","Dominant authoritative voice","perception of risk","dominant frames","news frequency","public health agencies","media\u0027s framing","adapting risk communication strategies","important health information","extent primetime broadcast news media mirrored CDC\u0027s framing","adapting communications","disease outbreak","medical frames","thematic frame","dynamic news environment","primetime broadcast transcripts","public\u0027s interpretation of risk messages","information source","medical experts","Ebola outbreak","primary transmitters of information","government officials","Disease Control","media\u0027s agenda","Conclusion Differences","overall period of analysis","subsequent attitudes","behaviors","short-form styles","Centers","ability","month","Prevention","delivery","particular threat","Abstract Objective","different way","Options","Kelly File","O\u0027Reilly Factor coverage","concept of storytelling","Methods","Anderson Cooper","Rachel Maddow","Chris Hayes"],"language":"en"},

The recent surge in multidrug-resistant bacteria and the possibility of widespread global virus pandemics necessitate the need for additional preventative and therapeutic options to conventional drugs. Research indicates that pomegranates and their extracts may serve as natural alternatives due to their potency against a wide range of bacterial and viral pathogens. Nearly every part of the pomegranate plant has been tested for antimicrobial activities, including the fruit juice, peel, arils, flowers, and bark. Many studies have utilized pomegranate peel with success. There are various phytochemical compounds in pomegranate that have demonstrated antimicrobial activity, but most of the studies have found that ellagic acid and larger hydrolyzable tannins, such as punicalagin, have the highest activities. In some cases the combination of the pomegranate constituents offers the most benefit. The positive clinical results on pomegranate and suppression of oral bacteria are intriguing and worthy of further study. Much of the evidence for pomegranates\u0027 antibacterial and antiviral activities against foodborne pathogens and other infectious disease organisms comes from in vitro cell-based assays, necessitating further confirmation of in vivo efficacy through human clinical trials.","publish_time":"2013-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Howell, Amy B.; D\u0027Souza, Doris H.","journal":"Evid Based Complement Alternat Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce387fc60565255c55785be208ae0b6b8fbb2ed3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3671682.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23762148/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/606212","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs2OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antimicrobial activities","pomegranate constituents","pomegranate plant","antimicrobial activity","antiviral activities","highest activities","studies","foodborne pathogens","viral pathogens","suppression of oral bacteria","multidrug-resistant bacteria","positive clinical results","human clinical trials","need","additional preventative","possibility of widespread global virus pandemics","therapeutic options","infectious disease organisms","multiple health benefits","pomegranates\u0027 antibacterial","potency","larger hydrolyzable tannins","confirmation of","ellagic acid","wide range of bacterial","punicalagin","conventional drugs","fruit juice","arils","cell-based assays","hundreds of years","extracts","efficacy","recent surge","evidence","various phytochemical compounds","flowers","natural alternatives","cases","combination","bark","study","Research"],"language":"en"},

Both of them are presumed to be widespread in the swine population. Currently, there is no specific treatment for their infections. RNA interference (RNAi) is a sequence-specific RNA degradation mechanism mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA), which represents a possible therapeutic application for the treatment of viral infections. In this study, three siRNA expression plasmids (pS-RepA, pS-RepB and pS-RepC) were generated to target three different coding regions of the Rep protein (Rep) of PCV. These siRNAs were used to inhibit PCV production in a porcine kidney cell line, PK-15 cells. Our results revealed that Rep gene expression was inhibited by pS-RepA, pS-RepB and pS-RepC to different degrees. Moreover, our study also showed that the production of PCV1 and PCV2 was reduced by these siRNAs. pS-RepC, which targets the middle region of Rep gene, proved to be the most efficient siRNA for inhibition of Rep expression and viral production.

From August 2015 to March 2016, we conducted a prospective, cross-sectional, hospital-based study in a provincial hospital. Patients were children \u2264 15 years with fever \u2265 38 \u00B0C and required hospitalization. A total of 600 febrile patients were enrolled. Malaria was the main diagnosis found in 52% (311/600) patients. Blood cultures revealed septicemia in 3% (17/593), among them four cases of typhoid fever. The other causes of fever were heterogeneously distributed between both bacteria and viruses. Severe infections identified by Lambar\u00E9n\u00E9 Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS) were also most often caused by malaria, but children with danger signs did not have more coinfections than others. In 6% (35/600) of patients, no pathogen was isolated. In Gabon, malaria is still the major cause of fever in children, followed by a bacterial and viral disease. Guidelines for both diagnosis and management should be tailored to the spectrum of pathogens and resources available locally.","publish_time":"2020-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fernandes, Jos\u00E9 Francisco; Held, Jana; Dorn, Magdalena; Lalremruata, Albert; Schaumburg, Frieder; Alabi, Abraham; Agbanrin, Maradona Daouda; Kokou, Cosme; Ben Adande, Abel; Esen, Meral; Eibach, Daniel; Adegnika, Ayola Akim; Agnandji, S\u00E9lidji Todagb\u00E9; Lell, Bertrand; Eckerle, Isabella; Henrichfreise, Beate; Hogan, Benedikt; May, J\u00FCrgen; Kremsner, Peter Gottfried; Grobusch, Martin Peter; Mordm\u00FCller, Benjamin","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be5d1a017f86407c335f5c76eb69b85d3b81c110.json; document_parses/pdf_json/03ae4b61aa2d9641f38287806612fc16f58d4299.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7005879.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32034188/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-58204-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs3MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Gabon"],"keyphrases":["children","Malaria","febrile patients","causes of fever","pediatric hospitalization","causes of infections","major cause of fever","Gabon","cases of typhoid fever","current spectrum of pathogens","pediatric populations","febrile diseases","Severe infections","provincial hospital","main diagnosis","hospital-based study","Lambar\u00E9n\u00E9 Organ Dysfunction Score","misdiagnosis","age groups","settings","LODS","danger signs","years","ineffective empirical treatment","epidemiology","management","resources available","total","Blood cultures","septicemia","viral disease","differences","coinfections","Guidelines","bacteria","viruses","tropics"],"language":"en"},

Nanosystems may be useful for the diagnosis and treatment of viral and fungal infections. Commercial diagnostic tests based on nanosystems are currently available. Different methodologies based on nanoparticles (NPs) have been developed to detect specific agents or to distinguish between Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms. Also, biosensors based on nanoparticles have been applied in viral detection to improve available analytical techniques. Several point-of-care (POC) assays have been proposed that can offer results faster, easier and at lower cost than conventional techniques and can even be used in remote regions for viral diagnosis. Nanoparticles functionalized with specific molecules may modulate pharmacokinetic targeting recognition and increase anti-infective efficacy. Quorum sensing is a stimuli-response chemical communication process correlated with population density that bacteria use to regulate biofilm formation. Disabling it is an emerging approach for combating its pathogenicity. Natural or synthetic inhibitors may act as antibiofilm agents and be useful for treating multi-drug resistant bacteria. Nanostructured materials that interfere with signal molecules involved in biofilm growth have been developed for the control of infections associated with biofilm-associated infections.","publish_time":"2018-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Colino, Clara I.; Mill\u00E1n, Carmen Guti\u00E9rrez; Lanao, Jos\u00E9 M.","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/334b38e4803085738b38d29775edea658bfb309b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6032068.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms19061627; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29857492/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs3NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["biofilm-associated infections","nanoparticles","treatment of bacterial infections","treatment of viral","viral diagnosis","fungal infections","control of infections","specific molecules","viral detection","specific agents","biofilm growth","Nanosystems","biofilm formation","nanoparticle-based systems","available analytical techniques","signal molecules","bacterial biofilms","multi-drug resistant bacteria","conventional techniques","antibiofilm agents","multidrug resistant strains","stimuli-response chemical communication process","promising research area","important implications","population density","pharmacokinetic targeting recognition","lower cost","anti-infective efficacy","synthetic inhibitors","Quorum sensing","Commercial diagnostic tests","care","POC","Nanostructured materials","Different methodologies","NPs","Advances","remote regions","emerging approach","pathogenicity","point","assays","Gram-negative microorganisms","results","biosensors"],"language":"en"},

Lysosomotropic agents (LA) such as Chloroquine and Ammonium chloride (NH(4)Cl) are the weak bases and penetrate in lysosome as protonated form and increase the intracellular pH. To investigate the antiviral effect of LA (Chloroquine and NH(4)Cl) on pH dependent endocytosis, HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp) of 1a and 3a genotype were produced and used to infect liver cells. The toxicological effects of Chloroquine and NH(4)Cl were tested in liver cells through MTT cell proliferation assay. For antiviral screening of Chloroquine and NH(4)Cl, liver cells were infected with HCVpp of 3a and 1a genotype in the presence or absence of different concentrations of Chloroquine and NH4Cl and there luciferase activity was determined by using a luminometer. The results demonstrated that Chloroquine and NH(4)Cl showed more than 50% reduction of virus infectivity at 50 \u03BCM and 10 mM concentrations respectively.

Abstract The incidence of community-acquired pneumonia increases with age and is associated with an elevated morbidity and mortality due to the physiological changes associated with aging and a greater presence of chronic disease. Taking into account the importance of this disease from an epidemiological and prognostic point of view, and the enormous heterogeneity described in the clinical management of the elderly, we believe a specific consensus document regarding this patient profile is necessary. The purpose of the present work was to perform a review of the evidence related to the risk factors for the etiology, the clinical presentation, the management and the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in elderly patients with the aim of producing a series of specific recommendations based on critical analysis of the literature.

Common symptoms are chills, fever, sore throat, coughing, sneezing, muscle pains, headache, myalgia, etc. Influenza viruses (IVs) belonging to orthomyxovirus group are of three types (types A, B, and C). IVs are enveloped, segmented, negative-stranded RNA viruses containing eight distinct RNA segments (types A and B) and seven RNA segments (type C). Only type A viruses exhibit different subtypes. Currently, 18 hemagglutination (HA) subtypes (H1 to H18) and 11 neuraminidase (NA) subtypes (N1 to N11) are known in humans and other warm-blooded animals. Flu outbreaks occur as annual epidemics in fall and winter and infrequently, as worldwide pandemics. Annual epidemics are caused by antigenic drift due to mutations in HA and NA antigens, whereas pandemics are caused by antigenic shift due to genetic reassortment among different subtype viruses. The first pandemic of the twenty-first century, declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2009, was caused by an H1N1 virus, derived from quadruple reassortment among swine, avian, and human IVs. Currently, two types of antiinfluenza drugs, based on either blocking the M2 proton channel (amantadine and rimantadine) or inhibiting NA (oseltamivir or Tamiflu by Roche and zanamivir or Relanza by GlaxoSmithKline) are available. The virus is commonly spread by aerosol droplets and by fingertips. Therefore, washing hands and avoiding contact with infected persons are the first lines of defense. Indoor living and closeness of people in an enclosed environment in winter facilitate virus transmission leading to epidemics. Annual vaccination is the best preventative measure. Currently, two types of vaccines (subunit vaccine by injection and live attenuated vaccine by nasal spray) are available and recommended by WHO and Centers for Disease Control.","publish_time":"2014-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nayak, D.","journal":"Reference Module in Biomedical Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a92a7e1de3920f87fd851838411e327729c4fe20.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173425.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128012383000842; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128012383000842","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs4MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Roche"],"organizations":["World Health Organization","NA","GlaxoSmithKline"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["annual epidemics","Influenza viruses","types of vaccines","different subtypes","different subtype viruses","types of antiinfluenza drugs","negative-stranded RNA viruses","winter","distinct RNA segments","inhibiting NA","NA antigens","Annual vaccination","virus transmission","H1N1 virus","human IVs","type C","subunit vaccine","genetic reassortment","quadruple reassortment","antigenic shift","antigenic drift","Flu outbreaks","worldwide pandemics","Disease Control","live attenuated vaccine","febrile viral disease","rimantadine","injection","amantadine","Roche","Tamiflu","oseltamivir","enclosed environment","headache","myalgia","closeness of people","nasal spray","chills","fever","sore throat","sneezing","zanamivir","Relanza","swine","neuraminidase","mutations","H18","infected persons","muscle pains","M2 proton channel","GlaxoSmithKline","best preventative measure","N11","fall","orthomyxovirus group","Common symptoms","century","humans","hands","contact","Indoor living","aerosol droplets","Centers","hemagglutination","World Health Organization","lines of defense","warm-blooded animals","fingertips"],"language":"en"},

Here we applied metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) to characterize the human virome in 492 clinical samples (384 sera, 92 pooled nasal and throat swabs, 10 stools, and 6 cerebrospinal fluid samples) from 386 patients (213 adults and 173 children) presenting with CA sepsis who were recruited from 6 hospitals across Vietnam between 2013 and 2015. Specific monoplex PCRs were used subsequently to confirm the presence of viral sequences detected by mNGS. We found sequences related to 47 viral species belonging to 21 families in 358 of 386 (93%) patients, including viruses known to cause human infections. After PCR confirmation, human viruses were found in 52 of 386 patients (13.4%); picornavirus (enteroviruses [n = 14], rhinovirus [n = 5], and parechovirus [n = 2]), hepatitis B virus (n = 10), cytomegalovirus (n = 9), Epstein-Barr virus (n = 5), and rotavirus A (n = 3) were the most common viruses detected. Recently discovered viruses were also found (gemycircularvirus [n = 5] and WU polyomavirus, Saffold virus, salivirus, cyclovirus-VN, and human pegivirus 2 [HPgV2] [n, 1 each]), adding to the growing literature about the geographic distribution of these novel viruses. Notably, sequences related to numerous viruses not previously reported in human tissues were also detected. To summarize, we identified 21 viral species known to be infectious to humans in 52 of 386 (13.4%) patients presenting with CA sepsis of unknown cause. The study, however, cannot directly impute sepsis causation to the viruses identified.

At present however, there are only three major classes of drugs for treating human nematode infections. Additionally the scientific knowledge on the mechanism of action and the reason for the resistance to these drugs is poorly understood. Commercial incentives to design drugs that are endemic to developing countries are limited therefore, virtual screening in academic settings can play a vital role is discovering novel drugs useful against neglected diseases. In this study we propose to build robust machine learning model to classify and screen compounds active against parasitic nematodes. RESULTS: A set of compounds active against parasitic nematodes were collated from various literature sources including PubChem while the inactive set was derived from DrugBank database. The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was used for model development, and stratified ten-fold cross validation was used to evaluate the performance of each classifier. The best results were obtained using the radial basis function kernel. The SVM method achieved an accuracy of 81.79% on an independent test set. Using the model developed above, we were able to indentify novel compounds with potential anthelmintic activity. CONCLUSION: In this study, we successfully present the SVM approach for predicting compounds active against parasitic nematodes which suggests the effectiveness of computational approaches for antiparasitic drug discovery. Although, the accuracy obtained is lower than the previously reported in a similar study but we believe that our model is more robust because we intentionally employed stringent criteria to select inactive dataset thus making it difficult for the model to classify compounds. The method presents an alternative approach to the existing traditional methods and may be useful for predicting hitherto novel anthelmintic compounds.","publish_time":"2011-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khanna, Varun; Ranganathan, Shoba","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/35fa07c7c7d1803f22859f6647d5d743e7ad7652.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3278842.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-12-s13-s25; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22373185/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs4NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SVM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel compounds","parasitic nematodes","set of compounds active","novel anthelmintic compounds","screen compounds active","novel drugs useful","model development","inactive set","SVM approach","robust machine learning model","SVM method","major classes of drugs","accuracy","similar study","present","independent test set","inactive dataset","alternative approach","best results","developing nations","support vector machine","human nematode infections","potential anthelmintic activity","vital role","algorithm","effectiveness of computational approaches","common causes of morbidity","various literature sources","academic settings","fatality","existing traditional methods","PubChem","antiparasitic drug discovery","mechanism of action","virtual screening","world","countries","reason","stringent criteria","neglected diseases","radial basis function kernel","scientific knowledge","resistance","DrugBank database","BACKGROUND","Commercial incentives","performance","cross validation","classifier","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

A CFTR gene replacement approach would be efficacious regardless of the disease-causing mutation. After the discovery of the CFTR gene in 1989, the in vitro proof-of-concept for gene therapy for CF was quickly established in 1990. In 1993, the first of many gene therapy clinical trials attempted to rescue the CF defect in airway epithelia. Despite the initial enthusiasm, there is still no FDA-approved gene therapy for CF. Here we discuss the history of CF gene therapy, from the discovery of the CFTR gene to current state-of-the-art gene delivery vector designs. While implementation of CF gene therapy has proven more challenging than initially envisioned; thanks to continued innovation, it may yet become a reality.","publish_time":"2018-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cooney, Ashley L.; McCray, Paul B.; Sinn, Patrick L.","journal":"Genes (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e9d01ab9a55093ad1c1277a7845d3254d3ad6fe8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6266271.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/genes9110538; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30405068/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs4OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CF","CFTR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["history of CF gene therapy","implementation of CF gene therapy","CF defect","CFTR gene replacement approach","gene therapy clinical trials","FDA-approved gene therapy","hundreds of CFTR mutations","current state-of-the-art gene delivery vector designs","people","progressive lung disease","autosomal recessive disease","range of disease severities","discovery","multi-organ system disease","\u0394F508 mutation","disease-causing mutation","cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator","childhood","copy","chronic bacterial infection","cAMP-regulated anion channel","concept","thanks","inflammation","airway epithelia","proof","continued innovation","initial enthusiasm","reality"],"language":"en"},

We examined the role of PTX3 in Coronavirus murine hepatitis virus strain 1 (MHV-1)-induced acute lung injury, a previously reported animal model for SARS. PTX3 deficient mice (129/SvEv/C57BL6/J) and their wild type littermates were intranasally infected MHV-1. These mice were also treated with recombinant PTX3. Effects of PTX3 on viral binding and infectivity were determined in vitro. Cytokine expression, severity of lung injury, leukocyte infiltration and inflammatory responses were examined in vivo. In PTX3wild type mice, MHV -1 induced PTX3 expression in the lung and serum in a time dependent manner. MHV-1 infection led to acute lung injury with greater severity in PTX3 deficient mice than that in wild type mice. PTX3 deficiency enhanced early infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages in the lung. PTX3 bound to MHV-1 and MHV-3 and reduced MHV-1 infectivity in vitro. Administration of recombinant PTX3 significantly accelerated viral clearance in the lung; attenuated MHV-1 induced lung injury, and reduced early neutrophil influx and elevation of inflammatory mediators in the lung. Results from this study indicate a protective role of PTX3 in coronaviral infection -induced acute lung injury.","publish_time":"2012-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Bing; Ma, Xuezhong; Zhang, Jianhua; Zhang, Yu; Bai, Xiaohui; Hwang, David M.; Keshavjee, Shaf; Levy, Gary; McGilvray, Ian; Liu, Mingyao","journal":"Lab Invest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/82a0e17a45b388559057d1faa7e2d1bf37d64c02.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e0737ee93afe7b0bf06b1e3f9adf21d541dd10f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3955193.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22732935/; https://doi.org/10.1038/labinvest.2012.92","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Effects of PTX3","acute lung injury","induced lung injury","PTX3 deficient mice","PTX3 deficiency","induced PTX3 expression","severity of lung injury","reduced MHV","protective role of PTX3","Administration of recombinant PTX3","attenuated MHV","Long pentraxin PTX3","intranasally infected MHV","PTX3wild type mice","viral clearance","viral binding","anti-viral effects","coronaviral infection","potential of lethal pandemics of respiratory viral infection","wild type littermates","infectivity","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","underlying mechanisms of SARS","early infiltration of neutrophils","greater severity","leukocyte infiltration","inflammatory responses","Cytokine expression","elevation of inflammatory mediators","reported animal model","serum","neutrophil influx","Coronavirus murine hepatitis virus","SvEv","humoral mediator of innate immunity","C57BL6","study","macrophages","time dependent manner","Results"],"language":"en"},

Here, the results from two proteins are presented where the anomalous signal from serendipitously acquired surface-bound Ca atoms with an anomalous data multiplicity of around 10 was utilized to drive de novo structure determination. In both cases, the Ca atoms were acquired from the crystallization solution, and the data-collection strategy was not optimized to exploit the anomalous signal from these scatterers. The X-ray data were collected at 0.98 \u00C5 wavelength in one case and at 1.74 \u00C5 in the other (the wavelength was optimized for sulfur, but the anomalous signal from calcium was exploited for structure solution). Similarly, using a test case, it is shown that data collected at \u223C1.0 \u00C5 wavelength, where the f\u2032\u2032 value for sulfur is 0.28 e, are sufficient for structure determination using intrinsic S atoms from a strongly diffracting crystal. Interestingly, it was also observed that SHELXD was capable of generating a substructure solution from high-exposure data with a completeness of 70% for low-resolution reflections extending to 3.5 \u00C5 resolution with relatively low anomalous multiplicity.

Most medical schools have geneticists who understand evolution, but few have even one evolutionary biologist to suggest other possible applications. The canyon between evolutionary biology and medicine is wide. The question is whether they offer each other enough to make bridge building worthwhile. What benefits could be expected if evolution were brought fully to bear on the problems of medicine? How would studying medical problems advance evolutionary research? Do doctors need to learn evolution, or is it valuable mainly for researchers? What practical steps will promote the application of evolutionary biology in the areas of medicine where it offers the most? To address these questions, we review current and potential applications of evolutionary biology to medicine and public health. Some evolutionary technologies, such as population genetics, serial transfer production of live vaccines, and phylogenetic analysis, have been widely applied. Other areas, such as infectious disease and aging research, illustrate the dramatic recent progress made possible by evolutionary insights. In still other areas, such as epidemiology, psychiatry, and understanding the regulation of bodily defenses, applying evolutionary principles remains an open opportunity. In addition to the utility of specific applications, an evolutionary perspective fundamentally challenges the prevalent but fundamentally incorrect metaphor of the body as a machine designed by an engineer. Bodies are vulnerable to disease \u2013 and remarkably resilient \u2013 precisely because they are not machines built from a plan. They are, instead, bundles of compromises shaped by natural selection in small increments to maximize reproduction, not health. Understanding the body as a product of natural selection, not design, offers new research questions and a framework for making medical education more coherent. We conclude with recommendations for actions that would better connect evolutionary biology and medicine in ways that will benefit public health. It is our hope that faculty and students will send this article to their undergraduate and medical school Deans, and that this will initiate discussions about the gap, the great opportunity, and action plans to bring the full power of evolutionary biology to bear on human health problems.","publish_time":"2008-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nesse, Randolph M; Stearns, Stephen C","journal":"Evol Appl","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd69df65ac1b519f8032fcc29c7c2506094e0fcf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3352398.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-4571.2007.00006.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25567489/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs0NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["evolutionary research","evolutionary principles","evolutionary insights","evolutionary perspective","evolutionary technologies","evolutionary biologist","application of evolutionary biology","power of evolutionary biology","potential applications of evolutionary biology","areas of medicine","problems of medicine","medical problems","medical researchers","medical education","medical schools","public health","human health problems","possible applications","medical school Deans","aging research","new research questions","doctors","body","utility of specific applications","great opportunity","infectious disease","relevant principles","open opportunity","serial transfer production of live vaccines","population genetics","dramatic recent progress","framework","essential basic science","article","ways","action plans","regulation of bodily defenses","phylogenetic analysis","small increments","incorrect metaphor","faculty","students","gap","psychiatry","addition","reproduction","geneticists","actions","canyon","practical steps","bundles of compromises","hope","discussions","Bodies","epidemiology","bridge","machines","engineer","recommendations","product of","benefits"],"language":"en"},

This is potentially hazardous as immunosuppressive therapy for FBD/asthma could exacerbate disease due to a LRTI.

Isospora) suis is the causative agent of neonatal porcine coccidiosis and one of the main causes of diarrhoea in suckling piglets worldwide. Infection with porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV, Suid herpesvirus 2) causes inclusion body rhinitis in pigs. In a Swiss pig herd (n =2 boars, 7 sows, 2 gilts, 18 finishing pigs, 30 fattening pigs, 54 suckling piglets), an outbreak of PCMV infection with high morbidity in all age categories, characterized by fever, anorexia, reduced general condition, respiratory signs and increased piglet mortality, was diagnosed by histopathology and molecular methods. Five fattening pigs (age~17weeks) additionally showed diarrhoea, not typical for PCMV infections, and one fattener had to be euthanized due to poor condition. Histopathologically, severe fibrinopurulent jejunoileitis with extensive atrophy and fusion of intestinal villi, loss of goblet cells and crypt abscesses associated to C. suis infection were present. In the liver, herpesvirus intranuclear inclusion bodies were observed and PCMV was confirmed by PCR/sequencing. No further infectious causes of diarrhoea (i.e. Rotavirus A; TGEV; PEDV; PCV-2; enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli or Lawsonia intracellularis) were detected in the euthanized fattener. Coproscopically, C. suis oocysts were identified in the faeces from further fatteners with diarrhoea. While C. suis usually produces disease only in suckling piglets, its association with severe intestinal lesions and diarrhoea in ~17-week-old fatteners was surprising. It is supposed that the underlying PCMV infection might have contributed to the presentation of clinical cystoisosporosis in fattening pigs. The interaction mechanisms between these two pathogens are unknown.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Basso, Walter; Marti, Hanna; Hilbe, Monika; Sydler, Titus; Stahel, Anina; B\u00FCrgi, Esther; Sidler, Xaver","journal":"Parasitology International","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1ab371121f26f1468b469e5673ea055eeb8e62ae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108397.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28942051/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.parint.2017.09.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383576917303446; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1383576917303446","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs0ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Isospora"],"organizations":["PCMV","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fattening pigs","suis infection","outbreak of PCMV infection","underlying PCMV infection","suckling piglets","PCMV infections","finishing pigs","main causes of diarrhoea","infectious causes of diarrhoea","suis oocysts","euthanized fattener","severe intestinal lesions","Suid herpesvirus","herpesvirus intranuclear inclusion bodies","porcine cytomegalovirus","general condition","age categories","poor condition","week-old fatteners","fusion of intestinal villi","severe fibrinopurulent jejunoileitis","inclusion body rhinitis","causative agent of neonatal porcine coccidiosis","extensive atrophy","respiratory signs","loss of goblet cells","crypt abscesses","high morbidity","association","increased piglet mortality","enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli","boars","PCV","anorexia","fever","Rotavirus","Lawsonia intracellularis","presentation of clinical cystoisosporosis","histopathology","sows","PEDV","Histopathologically","liver","TGEV","gilts","faeces","weeks","Swiss pig herd","pathogens","Abstract Cystoisospora","disease","interaction mechanisms","molecular methods","Coproscopically","PCR","sequencing"],"language":"en"},

Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Clinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples. Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation. FINDINGS: All nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester. Seven patients presented with a fever. Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed. Fetal distress was monitored in two cases. Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (\u003C1\u00B70 \u00D7 10\u2079 cells per L). Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded. No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies. All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8\u20139 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9\u201310. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus. INTERPRETATION: The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.

Because most viral envelope glycoproteins contain N-linked glycans, inhibition of ER \u03B1-glucosidases with derivatives of 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) or castanospermine (CAST), two well-studied pharmacophores of \u03B1-glucosidase inhibitors, efficiently disrupts the morphogenesis of a broad spectrum of enveloped viruses. Moreover, both DNJ and CAST derivatives have been demonstrated to prevent the death of mice infected with several distinct flaviviruses and filoviruses and suppress the multiplication of several other species of viruses in infected animals. N-Butyl derivative of DNJ (NB-DNJ) and 6 O-bytanoyl prodrug of CAST (Bu-CAST) have been evaluated in human clinical trials for their antiviral activities against human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus, and there is an ongoing trial of treating dengue patients with Bu-CAST.

However, adhering to quarantine is difficult. Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence to increase the likelihood of people adhering to protocols. We conducted a rapid review to identify factors associated with adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. STUDY DESIGN: The study design is a rapid evidence review. METHODS: We searched Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science for published literature on the reasons for and factors associated with adherence to quarantine during an infectious disease outbreak. RESULTS: We found 3163 articles and included 14 in the review. Adherence to quarantine ranged from as little as 0 up to 92.8%. The main factors which influenced or were associated with adherence decisions were the knowledge people had about the disease and quarantine procedure, social norms, perceived benefits of quarantine and perceived risk of the disease, as well as practical issues such as running out of supplies or the financial consequences of being out of work. CONCLUSIONS: People vary in their adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. To improve this, public health officials should provide a timely, clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols; emphasise social norms to encourage this altruistic behaviour; increase the perceived benefit that engaging in quarantine will have on public health; and ensure that sufficient supplies of food, medication and other essentials are provided.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Webster, R.K.; Brooks, S.K.; Smith, L.E.; Woodland, L.; Wessely, S.; Rubin, G.J.","journal":"Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc60897a656ead3032e34e163c5bc34e4d9dc2f6.json; document_parses/pdf_json/225dec977129e5a6dbae0404e46f0294d49b1ead.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194967.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350620300718?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.03.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32334182/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350620300718","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs1NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["quarantine procedure","perceived benefits of quarantine","vexed issue of quarantine","adherence decisions","infectious disease outbreaks","rapid review","social norms","perceived risk","STUDY DESIGN","likelihood of people","protocols","knowledge people","rapid evidence","main factors","public health officials","outbreak of coronavirus","sufficient supplies of food","best available evidence","information","Web of Science","PsycINFO","published literature","clear rationale","reasons","altruistic behaviour","Medline","medication","spotlight","citizens","countries","financial consequences","self-isolate","practical issues","work","essentials","METHODS","articles","CONCLUSIONS","contact","infection","RESULTS","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

Unfortunately, these agents also block NTCP transport of bile acids into hepatocytes, and thus have the potential to cause adverse effects. We aimed to identify small molecules that inhibit HBV entry while maintaining NTCP transporter function. METHODS: We characterized a series of cyclosporine (CsA) derivatives for their anti-HBV activity and NTCP binding specificity using HepG2 cells overexpressing NTCP and primary human hepatocytes. The four most potent derivatives were tested for their capacity to prevent HBV entry, but maintain NTCP transporter function. Their antiviral activity against different HBV genotypes was analysed. RESULTS: We identified several CsA derivatives that inhibited HBV infection with a sub-micromolar IC(50). Among them, SCY446 and SCY450 showed low activity against calcineurin (CN) and cyclophilins (CyPs), two major CsA cellular targets. This suggested that instead, these compounds interacted directly with NTCP to inhibit viral attachment to host cells, and have no immunosuppressive function. Importantly, we found that SCY450 and SCY995 did not impair the NTCP-dependent uptake of bile acids, and inhibited multiple HBV genotypes including a clinically relevant nucleoside analog-resistant HBV isolate. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first example of small molecule selective inhibition of HBV entry with no decrease in NTCP transporter activity. It suggests that the anti-HBV activity can be functionally separated from bile acid transport. These broadly active anti-HBV molecules are potential candidates for developing new drugs with fewer adverse effects. LAY SUMMARY: In this study, we identified new compounds that selectively inhibited hepatitis B virus (HBV) entry, and did not impair bile acid uptake. Our evidence offers a new strategy for developing anti-HBV drugs with fewer side effects.","publish_time":"2016-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shimura, Satomi; Watashi, Koichi; Fukano, Kento; Peel, Michael; Sluder, Ann; Kawai, Fumihiro; Iwamoto, Masashi; Tsukuda, Senko; Takeuchi, Junko S.; Miyake, Takeshi; Sugiyama, Masaya; Ogasawara, Yuki; Park, Sam-Yong; Tanaka, Yasuhito; Kusuhara, Hiroyuki; Mizokami, Masashi; Sureau, Camille; Wakita, Takaji","journal":"J Hepatol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02742f370016c83484a5c9b7ca2aa1264cf20670.json; document_parses/pdf_json/29d880d76f80084969dac74365c4a42febaeea43.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172969.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27890789/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168827816306833; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhep.2016.11.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168827816306833","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs1Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BACKGROUND","NTCP","HBV","CsA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-HBV activity","HBV infection","anti-HBV drugs","NTCP transporter activity","multiple HBV genotypes","different HBV genotypes","active anti-HBV molecules","NTCP transporter function","NTCP transport of bile acids","NTCP binding specificity","NTCP-dependent uptake of bile acids","example of small molecule selective inhibition of HBV entry","relevant nucleoside analog-resistant HBV isolate","low activity","antiviral activity","CsA derivatives","bile acid transport","bile acid uptake","new drugs","new compounds","specific entry inhibitors","fewer adverse effects","inhibited hepatitis B virus","new strategy","small molecules","potent derivatives","immunosuppressive function","SCY450","HepG2 cells","potential candidates","major CsA cellular targets","primary human hepatocytes","sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide","decrease","main target","AIMS","CyPs","CN","calcineurin","cyclophilins","study","sub-micromolar IC","capacity","series of cyclosporine","BACKGROUND","SCY446","viral attachment","agents","LAY SUMMARY","evidence","RESULTS","SCY995","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

A high morbidity has been reported for diarrhea (calves \u2264 35 %; piglets \u2264 50 %) and for respiratory diseases (calves \u2264 80 %; piglets \u2264 40 %). Despite a highly diverse etiology and pathophysiology of these diseases, treatment with antimicrobials is often the first-line therapy. Multi-antimicrobial resistance in pathogens results in international accordance to strengthen the research in novel treatment options. Medicinal plants bear a potential as alternative or additional treatment. Based on the versatile effects of their plant specific multi-component-compositions, medicinal plants can potentially act as \u2018multi-target drugs\u2019. Regarding the plurality of medicinal plants, the aim of this systematic review was to identify potential medicinal plant species for prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases and for modulation of the immune system and inflammation in calves and piglets. RESULTS: Based on nine initial sources including standard textbooks and European ethnoveterinary studies, a total of 223 medicinal plant species related to the treatment of gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases was identified. A defined search strategy was established using the PRISMA statement to evaluate 30 medicinal plant species starting from 20\u2019000 peer-reviewed articles published in the last 20 years (1994\u20132014). This strategy led to 418 references (257 in vitro, 84 in vivo and 77 clinical trials, thereof 48 clinical trials in veterinary medicine) to evaluate effects of medicinal plants and their efficacy in detail. The findings indicate that the most promising candidates for gastrointestinal diseases are Allium sativum L., Mentha x piperita L. and Salvia officinalis L.; for diseases of the respiratory tract Echinacea purpurea (L.) MOENCH, Thymus vulgaris L. and Althea officinalis L. were found most promising, and Echinacea purpurea (L.) MOENCH, Camellia sinensis (L.) KUNTZE, Glycyrrhiza glabra L. and Origanum vulgare L. were identified as best candidates for modulation of the immune system and inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Several medicinal plants bear a potential for novel treatment strategies for young livestock. There is a need for further research focused on gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases in calves and piglets, and the findings of this review provide a basis on plant selection for future studies.

Despite having been discovered in Uganda for almost 60 years, \u003C20 human cases were reported before 2007. The massive epidemics in the Pacific islands associated with the ZIKV Asian lineage in 2007 and 2013 were followed by explosive outbreaks in Latin America in 2015. Although increased mosquito breeding associated with the El Ni\u00F1o effect superimposed on global warming is suspected, genetic changes in its RNA virus genome may have led to better adaptation to mosquitoes, other animal reservoirs, and human. We reviewed the epidemiology, clinical manifestation, virology, pathogenesis, laboratory diagnosis, management, and prevention of this emerging infection. Laboratory diagnosis can be confounded by cross-reactivity with other circulating flaviviruses. Besides mosquito bite and transplacental transmission, the risk of other potential routes of transmission by transfusion, transplantation, sexual activity, breastfeeding, respiratory droplet, and animal bite is discussed. Epidemic control requires adequate clearance of mosquito breeding grounds, personal protection against mosquito bite, and hopefully a safe and effective vaccine.","publish_time":"2016-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, Jasper F.W.; Choi, Garnet K.Y.; Yip, Cyril C.Y.; Cheng, Vincent C.C.; Yuen, Kwok-Yung","journal":"Journal of Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba27ebdba5134579fe9a39aa094677f25651535f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112603.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016344531600061X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26940504/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2016.02.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016344531600061X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV Asian"],"locations":["Uganda","Pacific","Latin America"],"keyphrases":["mosquito bite","increased mosquito breeding","animal bite","adequate clearance of mosquito breeding grounds","Zika virus","dengue","laboratory diagnosis","human cases","severe human diseases","transplacental transmission","animal reservoirs","potential routes of transmission","RNA virus genome","congenital Zika syndrome","ZIKV Asian lineage","sexual activity","personal protection","genetic changes","transfusion","transplantation","breastfeeding","virology","pathogenesis","respiratory droplet","risk","Pacific islands","West Nile","Japanese encephalitis viruses","mild exanthematous febrile infections","global warming","better adaptation","prevention","management","clinical manifestation","Ni\u00F1o effect","Epidemic control","cross-reactivity","rubella","mosquitoes","association","relatives","explosive outbreaks","Latin America","circulating flaviviruses","massive epidemics","epidemiology","years","obscurity","emerging infection","infected individuals"],"language":"en"},

Translation of mRNA 1, which is thought to be equivalent to the viral genomic RNA, results in the synthesis of two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. These polyproteins contain motifs characteristic of papain-like and 3C-like proteinases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, helicases, and metal-binding proteins. In this study, we have produced pp1ab-specific monoclonal antibodies and have used them to detect an intracellular, 105-kDa viral polypeptide that contains the putative RNA polymerase domain. Furthermore, usingtranscleavage assays with bacterially expressed HCV 229E 3C-like proteinase, we have demonstrated that the 105-kDa polypeptide is released from pp1ab by cleavage at the dipeptide bonds Gln-4068/Ser-4069 and Gln-4995/Ala-4996.

The mucosal immune system in the gut must eliminate potential pathogens while maintaining a mutually beneficial relationship with the commensal microbiota. Antibodies derived from the secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) class, act as the first line of antigen-specific immunity in the gut by recognizing both pathogens and commensals. Therefore, the measurement of SIgA levels is an important index in evaluating PEDV infections and immune status. A simple and rapid method for the detection of PEDV-specific SIgA using an immunochromatographic test strip has been developed; incorporating a colloidal gold-labeled anti-SIgA secretory component (SC) mAb probe for the detection of anti-PEDV-specific SIgA in swine. On the strip, a gold-labeled anti-SIgA SC mAb was applied to a conjugate pad; purified PEDV particles and goat anti-mouse antibodies were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane to form the test and control lines, respectively. Results showed that the immunochromatographic test strip had high sensitivity and specificity. When compared with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, kappa value suggesting that the strip could be used to detect PEDV specific SIgA in colostrum samples. Furthermore, the strip assay is rapid and easy to perform with no requirement for professional-level skills or equipment. We found that the immunochromatographic test strip was a rapid, sensitive, and reliable method for the identification of PEDV specific SIgA, indicating its suitability for epidemiological surveillance as well as vaccine immunity when studying PEDV.","publish_time":"2020-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Jianbo; Gao, Ran; Shi, Hongyan; Cong, Guangyi; Chen, Jianfei; Zhang, Xin; Shi, Da; Cao, Liyan; Wang, Xiaobo; Zhang, Jialin; Ji, Zhaoyang; Jing, Zhaoyang; Feng, Li","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/411b38711310416a8e45ba63a0d193a6c991bacf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151449.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2020.113855; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32173373/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093420301075; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093420301075","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","SC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["identification of PEDV specific SIgA","detection of anti-PEDV-specific SIgA","detection of PEDV","PEDV particles","PEDV infections","immunochromatographic test strip","anti-SIgA SC mAb","strip assay","anti-SIgA secretory component","specific immunity","measurement of SIgA levels","rapid method","goat anti-mouse antibodies","gut","mAb probe","secretory immunoglobulin","high sensitivity","reliable method","high mortality","colloidal gold","vaccine immunity","potential pathogens","immune status","mucosal immune system","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","important index","kappa value","Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","class","line of antigen","conjugate pad","suitability","beneficial relationship","epidemiological surveillance","professional-level skills","requirement","nitrocellulose membrane","specificity","colostrum samples","swine","equipment","commensal microbiota","newborn piglets","Results","control lines","commensals"],"language":"en"},

This study aims to investigate its epidemiologic history, and analyze the clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and prognosis of patients infected with 2019-nCoV during this outbreak. METHODS: Clinical data from 137 2019-nCoV-infected patients admitted to the respiratory departments of the respiratory departments of nine tertiary hospitals in Hubei province from December 30, 2019 to January 24, 2020 were retrospectively collected, including general status, clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, imaging characteristics, and treatment regimens. RESULTS: None of the 137 patients (61 males, 76 females, aged 20\u201383 years, median age 57 years) had a definite history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Major initial symptoms included fever (112/137, 81.8%), coughing (66/137, 48.2%), and muscle pain or fatigue (44/137, 32.1%), with other, less typical initial symptoms observed at low frequency, including heart palpitations, diarrhea, and headache. Nearly 80% of the patients had normal or decreased white blood cell counts, and 72.3% (99/137) had lymphocytopenia. Lung involvement was present in all cases, with most chest computed tomography scans showing lesions in multiple lung lobes, some of which were dense; ground-glass opacity co-existed with consolidation shadows or cord-like shadows. Given the lack of effective drugs, treatment focused on symptomatic and respiratory support. Immunoglobulin G was delivered to some critically ill patients according to their conditions. Systemic corticosteroid treatment did not show significant benefits. Notably, early respiratory support facilitated disease recovery and improved prognosis. The risk of death was primarily associated with age, underlying chronic diseases, and median interval from the appearance of initial symptoms to dyspnea. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia present with fever as the first symptom, and most of them still showed typical manifestations of viral pneumonia on chest imaging. Middle-aged and elderly patients with underlying comorbidities are susceptible to respiratory failure and may have a poorer prognosis.","publish_time":"2020-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Kui; Fang, Yuan-Yuan; Deng, Yan; Liu, Wei; Wang, Mei-Fang; Ma, Jing-Ping; Xiao, Wei; Wang, Ying-Nan; Zhong, Min-Hua; Li, Cheng-Hong; Li, Guang-Cai; Liu, Hui-Guo","journal":"Chin Med J (Engl)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3258949ca406a5f503cee042ba1ee54663fb47f9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7147277.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32044814/; https://doi.org/10.1097/cm9.0000000000000744","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs3MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market"],"locations":["China","Hubei"],"keyphrases":["prognosis of patients","nCoV-infected patients","elderly patients","ill patients","majority of patients","respiratory departments","respiratory failure","treatment regimens","nCoV pneumonia present","early respiratory support","typical initial symptoms","clinical manifestations","clinical characteristics","outbreak of pneumonia","appearance of initial symptoms","Major initial symptoms","imaging characteristics","chest imaging","typical manifestations of viral pneumonia","years","Systemic corticosteroid treatment","Clinical data","median age","improved prognosis","fever","poorer prognosis","Hubei province of China","consolidation shadows","median interval","underlying comorbidities","epidemiologic history","Lung involvement","laboratory test results","definite history of exposure","multiple lung lobes","chest computed tomography scans","lesions","low frequency","cases","disease recovery","ground-glass opacity co-","Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market","heart palpitations","Wuhan","tertiary hospitals","white blood cell counts","general status","diarrhea","chronic diseases","cord","lack of effective drugs","significant benefits","headache","novel coronavirus","dyspnea","females","muscle pain","fatigue","BACKGROUND","study","METHODS","conditions","CONCLUSIONS","Immunoglobulin G","risk of death","lymphocytopenia"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study is to determine prospectively the etiology of community-acquired pulmonary infections in hospitalized adults living with HIV. Patients were submitted to an extended microbiological investigation that included molecular methods. The microbiological findings were evaluated according to severity of the disease and pneumococcal vaccine status. Two hundred twenty-four patients underwent the extended microbiological investigation of whom 143 (64%) had an etiology determined. Among the 143 patients with a determined etiology, Pneumocystis jirovecii was the main agent, detected in 52 (36%) cases and followed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis accounting for 28 (20%) cases. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Rhinovirus were diagnosed in 22 (15%) cases each and influenza in 15 (10%) cases. Among atypical bacteria, Mycoplasma pneumoniae was responsible for 12 (8%) and Chlamydophila pneumoniae for 7 (5%) cases. Mixed infections occurred in 48 cases (34%). S pneumoniae was associated with higher severity scores and not associated with vaccine status.

A simple, rapid, specific, and sensitive method is critical for monitoring PEDV on pig farms. In this study, a simple and rapid lateral flow immunoassay detection system that integrates europium (Eu) (III) chelate microparticles was developed to identify PEDV in fecal swabs. This newly developed diagnostic sandwich immunoassay utilizes lateral flow test strips (LFTSs). The fluorescence peak heights of the test line (HT) and the control line (HC) were measured using a fluorescence strip reader, and the HT/HC ratio was used for quantitation. The limit of detection of PEDV with this LFTS was ??ten times the median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID(50)) per mL??. Fecal swab samples were used to determine the cutoff value. Field samples, various PEDV strains and other viruses were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the Eu (III) chelate microparticle-based LFTSs, which were 97.8% and 100%, respectively, with a cutoff value of 0.05, as compared with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In samples from piglets experimentally infected with PEDV, the results were in high agreement with those obtained by RT-PCR. Epidemiological surveillance of PEDV using the LFTSs ??in areas threatened by African swine fever virus?? suggested that the PEDV positive rate on pig farms had significantly decreased, mainly due to the implementation of strict biosecurity measures. The results indicate that the Eu (III) chelate microparticle-based LFTS system is a rapid, sensitive, and reliable method for the identification of PEDV, indicating its suitability for epidemiological surveillance of PEDV infection.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Jianbo; Shi, Hongyan; Cong, Guangyi; Chen, Jianfei; Zhang, Xin; Shi, Da; Cao, Liyan; Wang, Xiaobo; Zhang, Jialin; Ji, Zhaoyang; Jing, Zhaoyang; Feng, Li","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/68f286ab6b62cc731b09a0f0d054437d9729e869.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086788.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-020-04566-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32144545/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","Eu","HT/HC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["monitoring PEDV","identification of PEDV","various PEDV strains","PEDV positive rate","epidemiological surveillance of PEDV infection","microparticle-based LFTSs","rapid lateral flow immunoassay detection system","sensitive method","test line","microparticle-based LFTS system","pig farms","RT-PCR","Field samples","Fecal swab samples","results","cutoff value","lateral flow test strips","developed diagnostic sandwich immunoassay","reliable method","control line","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","limit of detection","African swine fever virus","HC ratio","fecal swabs","fluorescence peak heights","fluorescence strip reader","predominant cause of severe enteropathogenic diarrhea","median tissue culture infectious dose","times","suitability","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","TCID","areas","europium","genus Alphacoronavirus","viruses","member","high agreement","implementation of strict biosecurity measures","sensitivity","study","quantitation","specificity","microparticles","piglets"],"language":"en"},

BACKGROUND: Nurses play an essential role in all phases of disaster management. For nurses to respond competently, they must be equipped with the skills to provide comprehensive and holistic care to the populations affected by or at risk of disasters. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. The review used information from six databases: the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Ovid MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, Scopus and the Education Resources Information Center. Keywords and inclusion and exclusion criteria were identified as strategies to use in this review. RESULTS: Twelve studies were eligible for result extraction, as they listed domains of the core competencies. These domains varied among studies. However, the most common domains were related to communication, planning, decontamination and safety, the Incident Command System and ethics. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of the domains of the core competencies, such as understanding the content and location of the disaster plan, communication during disaster and ethical issues is fundamental for nurses. Including these domains in the planning and provision of training for nurses, such as disaster drills, will strengthen their preparedness to respond competently to disaster cases. Nurses must be involved in future research in this area to explore and describe their fundamental competencies in each domain.","publish_time":"2016-10-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al Thobaity, Abdullelah; Plummer, Virginia; Williams, Brett","journal":"Int Emerg Nurs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb72baf3a35ca0c4d5622c8ddb18d52f718edeab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118449.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755599X1630163X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1755599X1630163X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28029612/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ienj.2016.10.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["the Incident Command System"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Nurses","common domains","core competencies of disaster nursing","disaster plan","disaster drills","disaster cases","fundamental competencies","Scoping review","phases of disaster management","communication","planning","studies","Education Resources Information Center","Allied Health Literature","Ovid MEDLINE","Scopus","ProQuest","ScienceDirect","Cumulative Index","safety","essential role","ethical issues","decontamination","databases","Incident Command System","exclusion criteria","populations","holistic care","result extraction","location","content","preparedness","provision of training","Joanna Briggs Institute methodology","Keywords","inclusion","skills","ethics","area","strategies","future research","BACKGROUND","Knowledge","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","AIM","METHODS","risk of disasters"],"language":"en"},

We find that, for all data sets studied, binary sequences reduced by the purine/pyrimidine classification give reliable phylogeny (almost the same as that from the primary sequences), while the other two result in discrepancies at different levels.

Comparable analytical challenges are encountered in other data-intensive fields involving sequential data, such as signal processing, in which dimensionality reduction (i.e., compression) methods are routinely used to lessen the computational burden of analyses. In this work, we explored the application of dimensionality reduction methods to numerically represent high-throughput sequence data for three important biological applications of virus sequence data: reference-based mapping, short sequence classification and de novo assembly. Leveraging highly compressed sequence transformations to accelerate sequence comparison, our approach yielded comparable accuracy to existing approaches, further demonstrating its suitability for sequences originating from diverse virus populations. We assessed the application of our methodology using both synthetic and real viral pathogen sequences.

ACE is crucial in the control of cardiovascular and renal homeostasis and fertility in mammals. In vertebrates, both transmembrane and soluble ACE, containing one or two active sites, have been characterized. So far, only soluble, single domain ACEs from invertebrates have been cloned, and these have been implicated in reproduction in insects. Furthermore, an ACE-related carboxypeptidase was recently characterized in Leishmania, a unicellular eukaryote, suggesting the existence of ACE in more distant organisms. Interestingly, in silico databank analysis revealed that bacterial DNA sequences could encode putative ACE-like proteins, strikingly similar to vertebrates\u0027 enzymes. To gain more insight into the bacterial enzymes, we cloned the putative ACE from the phytopathogenic bacterium, Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri, named XcACE. The 2 kb open reading frame encodes a 672-amino-acid soluble protein containing a single active site. In vitro expression and biochemical characterization revealed that XcACE is a functional 72 kDa dipeptidyl-carboxypeptidase. As in mammals, this metalloprotease hydrolyses angiotensin I into angiotensin II. XcACE is sensitive to ACE inhibitors and chloride ions concentration. Variations in the active site residues, highlighted by structural modelling, can account for the different substrate selectivity and inhibition profile compared to human ACE. XcACE characterization demonstrates that ACE is an ancestral enzyme, provoking questions about its appearance and structure/activity specialisation during the course of evolution.","publish_time":"2007-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rivi\u00E8re, Guillaume; Michaud, Annie; Corradi, Hazel R.; Sturrock, Edward D.; Ravi Acharya, K.; Cogez, Virginie; Bohin, Jean-Pierre; Vieau, Didier; Corvol, Pierre","journal":"Gene","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/464c9b4c984b9537525601d13f3a30d8eac810d7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127174.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378111907002521; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111907002521","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ACE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["soluble ACE","putative ACE","ACE inhibitors","existence of ACE","human ACE","ACE-related carboxypeptidase","XcACE characterization","Abstract Angiotensin","single active site","bacterial enzymes","active site residues","active sites","mammals","amino-acid soluble protein","ancestral enzyme","vertebrates\u0027 enzymes","biochemical characterization","bacterial DNA sequences","single domain ACEs","kDa dipeptidyl-carboxypeptidase","inhibition profile","phytopathogenic bacterium","activity specialisation","structure","renal homeostasis","appearance","control of cardiovascular","proteins","different substrate selectivity","silico databank analysis","chloride ions concentration","Xanthomonas axonopodis pv","Leishmania","fertility","questions","structural modelling","invertebrates","metallopeptidase","course of evolution","unicellular eukaryote","Variations","distant organisms","expression","metalloprotease","open reading frame","insight","reproduction","insects","citri"],"language":"en"},

In this study, several monoclonal antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein have been generated to examine distribution of the nucleocapsid in virus-infected cells and to study antigenic regions of the protein. Confocal microscopic analysis identified nucleocapsids packaged in vesicles in the perinuclear area indicating viral synthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. The monoclonal antibodies bound to the central and carboxyterminal half of the nucleocapsid protein indicating prominent exposure and immunogenicity of this part of the protein. Antibodies recognised both linear and conformational epitopes. Predictions of antigenicity using mathematical modelling based on hydrophobicity analysis of SARS nucleoprotein could not be confirmed fully. Antibody binding to discontinuous peptides provides evidence that amino acids 274\u2013283 and 373\u2013382 assemble to a structural unit particularly rich in basic amino acids. In addition, amino acids 286\u2013295, 316\u2013325 and 361\u2013367 that represent the epitope recognised by monoclonal antibody 6D11C1 converge indicating a well-structured C-terminal region of the SARS virus nucleocapsid protein and functional relationship of the peptide regions involved. Alternatively, dimerisation of the nucleocapsid protein may result in juxtaposition of the amino acid sequences 316\u2013325 and 361\u2013367 on one nucleoprotein molecule to amino acid 286\u2013295 on the second peptide.

Phosphorylation of Akt occurs early during JUNV infection of Vero cells and is blocked by the PI3K inhibitor, Ly294002. Infection of cells with UV-irradiated JUNV redeemed the pattern of stimulation observed for infectious virus indicating that an early stage of multiplication cycle would be enough to trigger activation. Treatment of cells with chlorpromazine abrogated phosphorylation of Akt upon JUNV infection suggesting virus internalization as responsible for activation. Inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by Ly294002 impaired viral protein synthesis and expression leading to a reduced infectious virus yield without blocking the onset of persistent stage of infection. This impairment is linked to a reduced amount of virus bound to cells probably due to a blockage on the recycling of transferrin cell-receptor, employed by the virus to adsorb to the cell surface. Early Akt activation was also observed in BHK-21 and A549 JUNV infected cells suggesting an important role of PI3K/Akt signalling in JUNV multiplication in vitro.","publish_time":"2009-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Linero, F.

Occupational characteristics, such as interfacing with the public and being in close quarters with other workers, not only put workers at high risk for disease, but also make them a nexus of disease transmission to the community. This can further be exacerbated through presenteeism, the term used to describe the act of coming to work despite being symptomatic for disease. Quantifying the number of workers who are frequently exposed to infection and disease in the workplace, and understanding which occupational groups they represent, can help to prompt public health risk response and management for COVID-19 in the workplace, and subsequent infectious disease outbreaks. METHODS: To estimate the number of United States workers frequently exposed to infection and disease in the workplace, national employment data (by Standard Occupational Classification) maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was merged with a BLS O*NET survey measure reporting how frequently workers in each occupation are exposed to infection or disease at work. This allowed us to estimate the number of United States workers, across all occupations, exposed to disease or infection at work more than once a month. RESULTS: Based on our analyses, approximately 10% (14.4 M) of United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per week. Approximately 18.4% (26.7 M) of all United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per month. While the majority of exposed workers are employed in healthcare sectors, other occupational sectors also have high proportions of exposed workers. These include protective service occupations (e.g. police officers, correctional officers, firefighters), office and administrative support occupations (e.g. couriers and messengers, patient service representatives), education occupations (e.g. preschool and daycare teachers), community and social services occupations (community health workers, social workers, counselors), and even construction and extraction occupations (e.g. plumbers, septic tank installers, elevator repair). CONCLUSIONS: The large number of persons employed in occupations with frequent exposure to infection and disease underscore the importance of all workplaces developing risk response plans for COVID-19. Given the proportion of the United States workforce exposed to disease or infection at work, this analysis also serves as an important reminder that the workplace is a key locus for public health interventions, which could protect both workers and the communities they serve.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baker, Marissa G.; Peckham, Trevor K.; Seixas, Noah S.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e2185cfb12ddc40ee3cadeebbd65985d288e6ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7188235.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0232452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32343747/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Standard Occupational Classification","BLS O"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["number of workers","infection","social workers","majority of exposed workers","number of United States workers","community health workers","high proportions of exposed workers","education occupations","extraction occupations","nexus of disease transmission","increased risk of contracting disease","social services occupations","protective service occupations","subsequent infectious disease outbreaks","administrative support occupations","United States workforce","public health risk response","public health interventions","occupational sectors","compelling public health","high risk","occupational groups","Occupational characteristics","risk response plans","frequent exposure","Standard Occupational Classification","large number of persons","quantifying","month","global spread of COVID","police officers","correctional officers","healthcare sectors","BLS O","patient service representatives","firefighters","plumbers","couriers","national employment data","NET survey measure reporting","septic tank installers","messengers","daycare teachers","workplaces","key locus","management","importance","counselors","elevator repair","construction","analysis","Bureau of Labor Statistics","important reminder","CONCLUSIONS","close quarters","term","INTRODUCTION","RESULTS","analyses","presenteeism","METHODS","week","communities"],"language":"en"},

Viral emergence and reemergence, as a sanitary event, are only the visible part of the iceberg, while the hidden one corresponds to a multitude of complex and interrelated factors, including societal and environmental factors favoring the advent of the state of viral emergence and reemergence. According to the World Health Organization, 60% of the agents recognized as human pathogens come from the animal kingdom, and 75% of the pathogens responsible for emerging and reemerging animal diseases present a potential transgression of interface between interspecies establishing favorable conditions for genetic exchange leading to the emergence of new highly pathogenic variants and strains of which the animal is often the host reservoir. Therefore any public health prophylactic strategy requires a holistic approach to the health problem, taking into account the interaction between the triad elements of the human, animal, and environment. This globalized approach has been realized by the international community through the new recently established concept of \u201COne Health, One World,\u201D making the old bipolar concept of separated human and animal health issues avoided and obsolete. The extreme diversity of emerging and reemerging viral pathogens, the change of human lifestyle, the globalization of travel, business exchanges, and tourism potentiate the risk of emergence of highly pathogenic zoonotic diseases. Promoting intersectorial collaboration will allow to unify the health and safety policies. The cross-cutting ecological and health data at the national and global scales are effective means for sustaining good health in human, animal, and ecosystem (in particular the viral ecology).","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"El Amri, Hamid; Boukharta, Mohamed; Zakham, Fathiah; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha","journal":"Emerging and Reemerging Viral Pathogens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9b091d374eb3d5febb3180df05e65020b9ddb04c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150362.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128194003000272; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128194003000272","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsxMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["animal health issues","health data","good health","health problem","human pathogens","viral pathogens","reemerging animal diseases","state of viral emergence","World Health Organization","animal kingdom","viral etiology","risk of emergence","viral ecology","unpredictable emergence of new zoonotic diseases","public health prophylactic strategy","change of human lifestyle","pathogenic zoonotic diseases","old bipolar concept of separated human","pathogens responsible","reemergence","interrelated factors","environmental factors","holistic approach","established concept","pathogenic variants","globalized approach","extreme diversity of emerging","effective means","potential transgression of interface","global scales","globalization of travel","advent","favorable conditions","hot issue","genetic exchange","tourism","account","triad elements","ecosystem","business exchanges","interaction","multitude of complex","international community","strains","political circles","sanitary event","cross","agents","iceberg","host reservoir","safety policies","intersectorial collaboration"],"language":"en"},

Of the viral structural proteins, the N protein plays a pivot role in assembly process of viral particles as well as viral replication and transcription. The SARS-CoV N proteins expressed in the eukaryotes, such as yeast and HEK293 cells, appeared in the multiple spots on two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE), whereas the proteins expressed in E. coli showed a single 2DE spot. These 2DE spots were further examined by Western blot and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS, and identified as the N proteins with differently apparent pI values and similar molecular mass of 50 kDa. In the light of the observations and other evidences, a hypothesis was postulated that the SARS-CoV N protein could be phosphorylated in eukaryotes. To locate the plausible regions of phosphorylation in the N protein, two truncated N proteins were generated in E. coli and treated with PKC\u03B1. The two truncated N proteins after incubation of PKC\u03B1 exhibited the differently electrophoretic behaviors on 2DE, suggesting that the region of 1\u2013256 aa in the N protein was the possible target for PKC\u03B1 phosphorylation. Moreover, the SARS-CoV N protein expressed in yeast were partially digested with trypsin and carefully analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. In contrast to the completely tryptic digestion, these partially digested fragments generated two new peptide mass signals with neutral loss, and MS/MS analysis revealed two phosphorylated peptides located at the \u201Cdense serine\u201D island in the N protein with amino acid sequences, GFYAEGSRGGSQASSRSSSR and GNSGNSTPGSSRGNSPARMASGGGK. With the PKC\u03B1 phosphorylation treatment and the partially tryptic digestion, the N protein expressed in E. coli released the same peptides as observed in yeast cells. Thus, this investigation provided the preliminary data to determine the phosphorylation sites in the SARS-CoV N protein, and partially clarified the argument regarding the phosphorylation possibility of the N protein during the infection process of SARS-CoV to human host.","publish_time":"2007-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Liang; Shao, Jianmin; Sun, Maomao; Liu, Jinxiu; Xu, Gongjin; Zhang, Xumin; Xu, Ningzhi; Wang, Rong; Liu, Siqi","journal":"Int J Mass Spectrom","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106479.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijms.2007.05.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288628/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1387380607002278; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1387380607002278","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsxMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV N proteins","truncated N proteins","genome of SARS","TOF MS","infection process of SARS","viral structural proteins","PKC\u03B1 phosphorylation treatment","phosphorylation sites","phosphorylation possibility","MALDI-TOF","coli","incubation of PKC\u03B1","yeast cells","plausible regions of phosphorylation","MS analysis","viral replication","tryptic digestion","phosphorylated peptides","eukaryotes","assembly process of viral particles","similar molecular mass","digested fragments","molecular bases","multiple spots","HEK293 cells","new peptide mass signals","neutral loss","apparent pI values","pivot role","amino acid sequences","GFYAEGSRGGSQASSRSSSR","island","dense serine","possible target","Western blot","GNSGNSTPGSSRGNSPARMASGGGK","preliminary data","contrast","coronavirus","human host","observations","evidences","two-dimensional electrophoresis","illness","kDa","hypothesis","challenge","argument","electrophoretic behaviors","light","investigation","transcription","trypsin"],"language":"en"},

FV3 study has provided insights into the replication of other family members, and has served as a model of viral transcription, genome replication, and virus-mediated host-shutoff. Although the broad outlines of FV3 replication have been elucidated, the precise roles of most viral proteins remain unknown. Current studies using knock down (KD) mediated by antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (asMO) and small, interfering RNAs (siRNA), knock out (KO) following replacement of the targeted gene with a selectable marker by homologous recombination, ectopic viral gene expression, and recombinant viral proteins have enabled researchers to systematically ascertain replicative- and virulence-related gene functions. In addition, the application of molecular tools to ecological studies is providing novel ways for field biologists to identify potential pathogens, quantify infections, and trace the evolution of ecologically important viral species. In this review, we summarize current studies using not only FV3, but also other iridoviruses infecting ectotherms. As described below, general principles ascertained using FV3 served as a model for the family, and studies utilizing other ranaviruses and megalocytiviruses have confirmed and extended our understanding of iridovirus replication. Collectively, these and future efforts will elucidate molecular events in viral replication, intrinsic and extrinsic factors that contribute to disease outbreaks, and the role of the host immune system in protection from disease.","publish_time":"2011-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chinchar, V.

We investigated simultaneous outbreaks of FPL between 2014 and 2018 in Australia, New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) where FPL outbreaks had not been reported for several decades. Case data from 989 cats and clinical samples from additional 113 cats were obtained to determine the cause of the outbreaks and epidemiological factors involved. Most cats with FPL were shelter-housed, 9 to 10 weeks old at diagnosis, unvaccinated, had not completed a primary vaccination series or had received vaccinations noncompliant with current guidelines. Analysis of parvoviral VP2 sequence data confirmed that all FPL cases were caused by FPV and not CPV. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that each of these outbreaks was caused by a distinct FPV, with two virus lineages present in eastern Australia and virus movement between different geographical locations. Viruses from the UAE outbreak formed a lineage of unknown origin. FPV vaccine virus was detected in the New Zealand cases, highlighting the difficulty of distinguishing the co-incidental shedding of vaccine virus in vaccinated cats. Inadequate vaccination coverage in shelter-housed cats was a common factor in all outbreaks, likely precipitating the multiple re-emergence of infection events.","publish_time":"2019-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Van Brussel, Kate; Carrai, Maura; Lin, Carrie; Kelman, Mark; Setyo, Laura; Aberdein, Danielle; Brailey, Juliana; Lawler, Michelle; Maher, Simone; Plaganyi, Ildiko; Lewis, Emily; Hawkswell, Adele; Allison, Andrew B.; Meers, Joanne; Martella, Vito; Beatty, Julia A.; Holmes, Edward C.; Decaro, Nicola; Barrs, Vanessa R.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e576c57618f99c0f5073d66ebedee4d80e910e0c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6950618.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31847268/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v11121155","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsyODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FPL","United Arab Emirates","FPV","CPV"],"locations":["Australia","New Zealand"],"keyphrases":["FPL outbreaks","simultaneous outbreaks of FPL","vaccinated cats","FPL cases","FPV vaccine virus","shelter-housed cats","fatal disease of cats","virus movement","distinct FPV","virus lineages present","New Zealand cases","feline parvovirus","CPV","co-incidental shedding of vaccine virus","eastern Australia","UAE outbreak","canine parvovirus","Case data","Feline panleukopenia","Phylogenetic analysis","Analysis of parvoviral VP2 sequence data","Inadequate vaccination coverage","primary vaccination series","United Arab Emirates","difficulty","vaccinations noncompliant","clinical samples","different geographical locations","common factor","cause","lineage of unknown origin","multiple re-emergence of infection events","weeks old","diagnosis","current guidelines","epidemiological factors","Viruses","decades"],"language":"en"},

The virus, SARS-CoV, differs from the previously described human coronaviruses, 229E and OC43. 229E was previously shown to productively infect human monocytes/macrophages, whereas OC43 poorly infected the cells. In this study, we examined whether SARS-CoV could productively infect purified monocytes/macrophages (PM) derived from human donor cells. Unlike 229E-infected cells, which produced viral titers of 103.5 to 106 TCID50/ml, SARS-CoV replicated poorly in PM, producing titers of 101.75 to 102 TCID50/ml. This finding was similar to results reported for OC43-infected cells, with titers ranging from 101.2 to 102.7 TCID50/ml. Of interest, SARS-CoV proteins were detected only in PM that did not produce significant amounts of interferon (IFN)-\u03B1, and in one such case, preliminary electron microscope studies demonstrated that SARS-CoV-like particles could enter the cells, possibly via phagocytosis. These results suggest that SARS-CoV, like human CoV OC43, poorly infects human PM, and production of IFN-\u03B1 by these cells further limits the infection. Given the importance of monocytes/macrophages to the immune response, it is possible that their infection by SARS-CoV and alteration of this infection by IFN-\u03B1 may be important to the course of the infection in humans.","publish_time":"2005-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yilla, Mamadi; Harcourt, Brian H.; Hickman, Carole J.; McGrew, Marcia; Tamin, Azaibi; Goldsmith, Cynthia S.; Bellini, William J.; Anderson, Larry J.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/296b6913fdf7142617fbdba53abdd27a999e75b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114182.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016817020400348X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016817020400348X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjszMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human CoV OC43","SARS-CoV proteins","human PM","OC43-infected cells","human monocytes","human donor cells","infection","E-infected cells","human coronaviruses","IFN-\u03B1","macrophages","TCID50","production of IFN","purified monocytes","viral titers","results","importance of monocytes","cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome","preliminary electron microscope studies","association","alteration","immune response","significant amounts of interferon","course","finding","particles","humans","novel coronavirus","phagocytosis","study"],"language":"en"}]}

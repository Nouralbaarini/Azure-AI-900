We hypothesize that the fivefold difference in the rate of microcephalic neonates between the NE and other regions is partially an effect of the population prior immunity against Dengue viruses (DENV), that cross-react with ZIKV. In this ecological study, we analysed the interaction between dengue fever epidemics from 2001 to 2014 and the 2015/2016 microcephaly epidemic in 400 microregions in Brazil using random-effects models under a Bayesian approach. The estimated effect of the time lag between the most recent large dengue epidemic (\u003E400/100,000 inhabitants) and the microcephaly epidemic ranged from protection (up to 6 years prior) to an increased risk (from 7 to 12 years). This sustained window of protection, larger than described in previous longitudinal studies, is possibly an effect of herd immunity and of multiple exposures to DENV that could boost immunity.","publish_time":"2020-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carvalho, Marilia S\u00E1; Freitas, La\u00EDs Picinini; Cruz, Oswaldo Gon\u00E7alves; Brasil, Patr\u00EDcia; Bastos, Leonardo Soares","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/78b6155e0b5e0d526714e579dd62e54c5f1939aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7000767.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7000767/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzMwMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brazil","Northeast"],"keyphrases":["microcephaly epidemic","recent large dengue epidemic","Brazilian epidemic","effect of herd immunity","Dengue viruses","DENV","population prior immunity","estimated effect","dengue fever epidemics","years","ZIKV","time lag","Zika virus","narrow time","large number of babies","Congenital Zika Syndrome","sustained window of protection","random-effects models","rate of microcephalic neonates","interaction","microregions","multiple exposures","inhabitants","previous longitudinal studies","Northeast region","fivefold difference","Bayesian approach","increased risk","ecological study","research"],"language":"en"},

Influenza A group 1 HA stem-nanoparticles have been demonstrated to confer heterosubtypic protection in animals; however, the protection does not extend to group 2 viruses, due in part to differences in glycosylation between group 1 and 2 stems. Here, we show that introducing the group 2 glycan at Asn38(HA1) to a group 1 stem-nanoparticle (gN38 variant) based on A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) broadens antibody responses to cross-react with group 2 HAs. Immunoglobulins elicited by the gN38 variant provide complete protection against group 2 H7N9 virus infection, while the variant loses protection against a group 1 H5N1 virus. The N38(HA1) glycan thus is pivotal in directing antibody responses by controlling access to group-determining stem epitopes. Precise targeting of stem-directed antibody responses to the site of vulnerability by glycan repositioning may be a step towards achieving cross-group influenza protection.","publish_time":"2020-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boyoglu-Barnum, Seyhan; Hutchinson, Geoffrey B.; Boyington, Jeffrey C.; Moin, Syed M.; Gillespie, Rebecca A.; Tsybovsky, Yaroslav; Stephens, Tyler; Vaile, John R.; Lederhofer, Julia; Corbett, Kizzmekia S.; Fisher, Brian E.; Yassine, Hadi M.; Andrews, Sarah F.; Crank, Michelle C.; McDermott, Adrian B.; Mascola, John R.; Graham, Barney S.; Kanekiyo, Masaru","journal":"Nat Commun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/69069a32e0361f1ade789e992a780e490854775f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7005838.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7005838/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzMyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cross-group influenza protection","antibody responses","complete protection","stem epitopes","heterosubtypic protection","HA stem-nanoparticles","gN38 variant","Precise targeting of stem","HA1","glycan repositioning","H5N1 virus","focus of universal influenza vaccine efforts","H7N9 virus infection","H1N1","site of vulnerability","step","access","Asn38","differences","glycosylation","conserved hemagglutinin","animals","New Caledonia","Immunoglobulins","viruses","stems"],"language":"en"},

Identifying who needs antibiotics is challenging; microbiological confirmation and clinical scores are used but have limitations. In a cross-sectional study nested within a randomized controlled trial, we estimated the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility profiles of group A Streptococcus (GAS) in patients presenting to primary care with a sore throat and fever in northern Thailand. We then evaluated the use of C-reactive protein (CRP) and clinical scores (Centor and FeverPAIN) to identify the presence of GAS. One hundred sixty-nine patients were enrolled, of whom 35 (20.7%) had \u03B2-hemolytic Streptococci (BHS) isolated from throat swab culture, and 11 (6.5%) had GAS. All GAS isolates were sensitive to penicillin G. The median CRP of those without BHS isolation was 10 mg/L (interquartile range [IQR] \u2264 8\u201318), compared with 18 mg/L (IQR 9\u201371, P = 0.0302) for those with GAS and 14 mg/L (IQR \u2264 8\u201338, P = 0.0516) for those with any BHS isolated. However, there were no significant relationships between CRP \u003E 8 mg/L (P = 0.112), Centor \u2265 3 (P = 0.212), and FeverPAIN \u2265 4 (P = 1.000), and the diagnosis of GAS compared with no BHS isolation. Identifying who requires antibiotics for pharyngitis remains challenging and necessitates further larger studies. C-reactive protein testing alone, although imperfect, can reduce prescribing compared with routine care. Targeted CRP testing through clinical scoring may be the most cost-effective approach to ruling out GAS infection.","publish_time":"2019-12-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Greer, Rachel; Althaus, Thomas; Ling, Clare; Intralawan, Daranee; Nedsuwan, Supalert; Thaipadungpanit, Janjira; Wangrangsimakul, Tri; Butler, Christopher; Day, Nicolas; Lubell, Yoel","journal":"Am J Trop Med Hyg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3cc1733c40062f59a5d1e9c7c9fd318c8041c0a2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7008346.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7008346/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzMzMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["G.

Using LAMP and Therascreen to analyze surgically resected tissue samples from patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma, EGFR mutations were observed in 32/59 tumor samples (LAMP) and 33/59 tumor samples (Therascreen). Notably, the LAMP assay identified one tumor as wild-type, which had previously been identified as a deletion mutation in exon 19 via the Therascreen assay (Case X). However, the direct sequencing to confirm the EGFR status of the Case X adhered to the results of the LAMP assay. Further experiments using Case X DNA identified this exon 19 deletion mutation using both methods. In addition, a novel deletion mutation in exon 19 of the EGFR was identified.

The emergence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in 2009 caused a pandemic. Since then it has become a seasonal influenza virus. It causes symptoms ranging from mild to severe illness, which might be fatal, particularly in people with underlying chronic medical conditions, immunocompromised people, the elderly, and pregnant women. OBJECTIVE: Describe the data generated by the influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 surveillance in Saudi Arabia from 2010 to 2016. DESIGN: Retrospective, descriptive. SETTING: Hospitals reporting to the Ministry of Health. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied aggregate data on hospitalized cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in Saudi Arabia between 2010 and 2016. The surveillance system used the case definition proposed by the WHO. The cases were confirmed by performing the real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) on upper respiratory samples. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Suspected and confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases. SAMPLE SIZE: 113 502 suspected H1N1 cases and 17 094 (15.1%) confirmed cases. RESULTS: Most of the reported cases were registered in the Riyadh region. During the period of the study, the highest number of confirmed cases, 9262 (54.2 %), was in 2015. The case fatality rate for confirmed cases was 3.6%. CONCLUSION: Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 showed seasonal trends. The number of suspected influenza cases each year was proportionate to the number of confirmed cases for that year. Riyadh, Jeddah and the Eastern areas (regions with the highest population) reported most of the cases. LIMITATION: Only one strain of H1N1 was tested.

Since the Ebola virus was discovered in 1976, the only available treatments have been medical support or the emergency administration of experimental drugs. The absence of licensed vaccines and drugs against the Ebola virus impedes the prevention of viral infection. In this study, we generated recombinant baculoviruses (rBV) expressing the Sudan virus (SUDV) matrix structural protein (VP40) (rBV-VP40-VP40) or the SUDV glycoprotein (GP) (rBV-GP-GP), and SUDV virus-like particles (VLPs) were produced by co-infection of Sf9 cells with rBV-SUDV-VP40 and rBV-SUDV-GP. The expression of SUDV VP40 and GP in SUDV VLPs was demonstrated by IFA and Western blot analysis. Electron microscopy results demonstrated that SUDV VLPs had a filamentous morphology. The immunogenicity of SUDV VLPs produced in insect cells was evaluated by the immunization of mice. The analysis of antibody responses showed that mice vaccinated with SUDV VLPs and the adjuvant Montanide ISA 201 produced SUDV GP-specific IgG antibodies. Sera from SUDV VLP-immunized mice were able to block infection by SUDV GP pseudotyped HIV, indicating that a neutralizing antibody against the SUDV GP protein was produced. Furthermore, the activation of B cells in the group immunized with VLPs mixed with Montanide ISA 201 was significant one week after the primary immunization. Vaccination with the SUDV VLPs markedly increased the frequency of antigen-specific cells secreting type 1 and type 2 cytokines. To study the therapeutic effects of SUDV antibodies, horses were immunized with SUDV VLPs emulsified in Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant or Freund\u2019s incomplete adjuvant. The results showed that horses could produce SUDV GP-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies. These results showed that SUDV VLPs demonstrate excellent immunogenicity and represent a promising approach for vaccine development against SUDV infection. Further, these horse anti-SUDV purified immunoglobulins lay a foundation for SUDV therapeutic drug research.","publish_time":"2020-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Fangfang; Zhang, Shengnan; Zhang, Ying; Mo, Ruo; Yan, Feihu; Wang, Hualei; Wong, Gary; Chi, Hang; Wang, Tiecheng; Feng, Na; Gao, Yuwei; Xia, Xianzhu; Zhao, Yongkun; Yang, Songtao","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2530bf775255e8026438e91645aba95d0506928e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7019897.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7019897/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzM2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SUDV","IFA","Montanide ISA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rBV-SUDV","SUDV virus","SUDV infection","SUDV glycoprotein","SUDV GP protein","immunogenicity of SUDV VLPs","SUDV GP-specific antibodies","expression of SUDV VP40","SUDV GP pseudotyped HIV","horse anti-SUDV","therapeutic effects of SUDV antibodies","SUDV VLP-immunized mice","produced SUDV GP-specific IgG antibodies","rBV-GP","SUDV therapeutic drug research","rBV-VP40","specific cells","neutralizing antibodies","Sudan virus","Ebola virus infections","co-infection of Sf9 cells","insect cells","immunization of mice","adjuvant Montanide ISA","Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant","Freund\u2019s incomplete adjuvant","horses","neutralizing antibody","prevention of viral infection","activation of B cells","study","analysis of antibody responses","Electron microscopy results","excellent immunogenicity","primary immunization","matrix structural protein","Western blot analysis","emergency administration of experimental drugs","nonhuman primates","severe hemorrhagic fevers","foundation","promising approach","humans","immunoglobulins","medical support","human fatality rates","week","vaccine development","group","IFA","frequency of antigen","absence of licensed vaccines","Sera","recombinant baculoviruses","available treatments","filamentous morphology","particles","cytokines","Vaccination"],"language":"en"},

However, these studies do not directly estimate the causal effects of fluid-restrictive strategies, nor do their analyses properly adjust for time-varying confounding by indication. In this study, we used causal inference techniques to estimate mortality outcomes that would result from imposing a range of arbitrary limits (\u201Ccaps\u201D) on fluid volume administration during the first 24 h of intensive care unit (ICU) care. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study SETTING: ICUs at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, 2008\u20132012 PATIENTS: One thousand six hundred thirty-nine septic patients (defined by Sepsis-3 criteria) 18 years and older, admitted to the ICU from the emergency department (ED), who received less than 4 L fluids administered prior to ICU admission MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III). We employed a dynamic Marginal Structural Model fit by inverse probability of treatment weighting to obtain confounding adjusted estimates of mortality rates that would have been observed had fluid resuscitation volume caps between 4 L\u201312 L been imposed on the population. The 30-day mortality in our cohort was 17%. We estimated that caps between 6 and 10 L on 24 h fluid volume would have reduced 30-day mortality by \u2212 0.6 to \u2212 1.0%, with the greatest reduction at 8 L (\u2212 1.0% mortality, 95% CI [\u2212 1.6%, \u2212 0.3%]).

Typhi) is a highly invasive bacterium that infects the human intestinal mucosa and causes ~ 11.9\u201320.6 million infections and ~ 130,000\u2013223,000 deaths annually worldwide. Oral typhoid vaccine Ty21a confers a moderate level of long-lived protection (5\u20137 years) in the field. New and improved vaccines against enteric pathogens are needed but their development is hindered by a lack of the immunological correlates of protection especially at the site of infection. Tissue resident memory T (T(RM)) cells provide immediate adaptive effector immune responsiveness at the infection site. However, the mechanism(s) by which S. Typhi induces T(RM) in the intestinal mucosa are unknown. Here, we focus on the induction of S. Typhi-specific CD4\u002BT(RM) subsets by Ty21a in the human terminal ileum lamina propria and epithelial compartments. METHODS: Terminal ileum biopsies were obtained from consenting volunteers undergoing routine colonoscopy who were either immunized orally with 4 doses of Ty21a or not. Isolated lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) and intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) CD4\u002BT(RM) immune responses were determined using either S. Typhi-infected or non-infected autologous EBV-B cell lines as stimulator cells. T-CMI was assessed by the production of 4 cytokines [interferon (IFN)\u03B3, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-17A and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03B1] in 36 volunteers (18 vaccinees and 18 controls volunteers). RESULTS: Although the frequencies of LPMC CD103\u002B CD4\u002BT(RM) were significant decreased, both CD103\u002B and CD103\u2212 CD4\u002BT(RM) subsets spontaneously produced significantly higher levels of cytokines (IFN\u03B3 and IL-17A) following Ty21a-immunization. Importantly, we observed significant increases in S. Typhi-specific LPMC CD103\u002B CD4\u002BT(RM) (IFN\u03B3 and IL-17A) and CD103\u2212 CD4\u002BT(RM) (IL-2 and IL-17A) responses following Ty21a-immunization. Further, differences in S. Typhi-specific responses between these two CD4\u002BT(RM) subsets were observed following multifunctional analysis. In addition, we determined the effect of Ty21a-immunization on IEL and observed significant changes in the frequencies of IEL CD103\u002B (decrease) and CD103\u2212 CD4\u002BT(RM) (increase) following immunization. Finally, we observed that IEL CD103\u2212 CD4\u002BT(RM), but not CD103\u002B CD4\u002BT(RM), produced increased cytokines (IFN\u03B3, TNF\u03B1 and IL-17A) to S. Typhi-specific stimulation following Ty21a-immunization. CONCLUSIONS: Oral Ty21a-immunization elicits distinct compartment specific immune responses in CD4\u002BT(RM) (CD103\u002B and CD103\u2212) subsets.

The findings indicate that the burden of mosquito-borne viral infections in DRC is increasing over time and space. The north-western, north-eastern, western and central regions have the highest burden of mosquito-borne viral infections compared to south and eastern highland regions. Yellow fever, chikungunya, dengue, Zika, Rift Valley fever, West Nile and O\u2019nyong\u2019nyong have been reported in the country. These mosquito-borne viruses were found circulating in human, wildlife and domestic animals. Yellow fever and chikungunya outbreaks have been frequently reported. Aedes aegypti and Ae. simpsoni were documented as the main vectors of most of the mosquito-borne viral infections. Heavy rains, human movements, forest encroachment and deforestation were identified as drivers of mosquito-borne viruses occurrence in DRC.

This multicenter retrospective cohort study conducted in the intensive care units (ICUs) of eight medical centers across Taiwan aims to determine the real-world status of corticosteroid treatment in patients with influenza-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and its impact on clinical outcomes. Between October 2015 and March 2016, consecutive ICU patients with virology-proven influenza infections who fulfilled ARDS and received invasive mechanical ventilation were enrolled. The impact of early corticosteroid treatment (\u2265 200 mg hydrocortisone equivalent dose within 3 days after ICU admission, determined by a sensitivity analysis) on hospital mortality (the primary outcome) was assessed by multivariable logistic regression analysis, and further confirmed in a propensity score-matched cohort. RESULTS: Among the 241 patients with influenza-associated ARDS, 85 (35.3%) patients receiving early corticosteroid treatment had similar baseline characteristics, but a significantly higher hospital mortality rate than those without early corticosteroid treatment [43.5% (37/85) vs. 19.2% (30/156), p \u003C 0.001]. Early corticosteroid treatment was independently associated with increased hospital mortality in overall patients [adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) = 5.02 (2.39\u201310.54), p \u003C 0.001] and in all subgroups. Earlier treatment and higher dosing were associated with higher hospital mortality. Early corticosteroid treatment was associated with a significantly increased odds of subsequent bacteremia [adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) = 2.37 (1.01\u20135.56)]. The analyses using a propensity score-matched cohort showed consistent results. CONCLUSIONS: Early corticosteroid treatment was associated with a significantly increased hospital mortality in adult patients with influenza-associated ARDS. Earlier treatment and higher dosing were associated with higher hospital mortality. Clinicians should be cautious while using corticosteroid treatment in this patient group.","publish_time":"2020-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsai, Ming-Ju; Yang, Kuang-Yao; Chan, Ming-Cheng; Kao, Kuo-Chin; Wang, Hao-Chien; Perng, Wann-Cherng; Wu, Chieh-Liang; Liang, Shinn-Jye; Fang, Wen-Feng; Tsai, Jong-Rung; Chang, Wei-An; Chien, Ying-Chun; Chen, Wei-Chih; Hu, Han-Chung; Lin, Chiung-Yu; Chao, Wen-Cheng; Sheu, Chau-Chyun","journal":"Ann Intensive Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4790d0413058bafd13761cfe8c9d7083ed54d595.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7046839.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7046839/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQ0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","ICU"],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["impact of early corticosteroid treatment","Earlier treatment","influenza-associated ARDS","real-world status of corticosteroid treatment","increased hospital mortality","severe influenza patients","treatment of septic shock","higher hospital mortality rate","overall patients","adult patients","higher dosing","consecutive ICU patients","adjusted odds ratio","virology-proven influenza infections","propensity score-matched cohort","increased odds of subsequent bacteremia","ICU admission","multicenter retrospective cohort study","sensitivity analysis","consistent results","multivariable logistic regression analysis","similar baseline characteristics","acute respiratory distress syndrome","intensive care units","ICUs","days","hydrocortisone equivalent dose","use","previous studies","primary outcome","invasive mechanical ventilation","Taiwan","medical centers","analyses","patient group","CONCLUSIONS","clinical outcomes","Clinicians","BACKGROUND","subgroups"],"language":"en"},

PRF is typically stimulated by structural elements within the mRNA that generate mechanical tension between the transcript and ribosome. However, in this work we show that the forces generated by the cotranslational folding of the nascent polypeptide chain can also enhance PRF. Using an array of biochemical, cellular, and computational techniques, we first demonstrate that the Sindbis virus structural polyprotein forms two competing topological isomers during biosynthesis at the ribosome-translocon complex. We then show that the formation of one of these topological isomers is linked to PRF. Coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulations reveal that the translocon-mediated membrane integration of a transmembrane domain upstream from the ribosomal slip-site generates a force on the nascent polypeptide chain that scales with observed frameshifting. Together, our results demonstrate that cotranslational folding of this protein generates a tension that stimulates PRF.

Four hundred thirty-seven respiratory samples were tested by modified shell vial culture method, RV 15 ACE, and AdvanSure. One hundred fourteen samples (26.2%) out of 437 samples were positive by culture, while additional 91 (20.8%) were positive by AdvanSure or RV15. One hundred twelve of 114 culture-positive samples were positive by AdvanSure except 2 samples (1 adenovirus, 1 respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]). Overall, the sensitivities of culture, RV15, and AdvanSure were 74.5%, 89.8%, and 95.1%, respectively.

However, no information has been published regarding the minimum infectious dose (MID) of PEDV in different pig models. The main objective of this study was to determine the oral minimum infectious dose of PEDV in na\u00EFve conventional neonatal piglets and weaned pigs. A U.S. virulent PEDV prototype isolate (USA/IN19338/2013) with known infectious titer was serially ten-fold diluted in virus-negative cell culture medium. Dilutions with theoretical infectious titers from 560 to 0.0056 TCID(50)/ml together with a medium control were orogastrically inoculated (10ml/pig) into 7 groups of 5-day-old neonatal pigs (n = 4 per group) and 7 groups of 21-day-old weaned pigs (n = 6 per group). In 5-day-old pigs, 10ml of inoculum having titers 560\u20130.056 TCID(50)/ml, corresponding to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle threshold (Ct) values 24.2\u201337.6, resulted in 100% infection in each group; 10ml of inoculum with titer 0.0056 TCID(50)/ml (Ct\u003E45) caused infection in 25% of the inoculated pigs. In 21-day-old pigs, 10ml of inoculum with titers 560\u20135.6 TCID(50)/ml (Ct 24.2\u201331.4) resulted in 100% infection in each group while 10ml of inoculum with titers 0.56\u20130.0056 TCID(50)/ml (Ct values 35.3 \u2013\u003E45) did not establish infection in any pigs under study conditions as determined by clinical signs, PCR, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and antibody response. These data reveal that PEDV infectious dose is age-dependent with a significantly lower MID for neonatal pigs compared to weaned pigs. This information should be taken into consideration when interpreting clinical relevance of PEDV PCR results and when designing a PEDV bioassay model. The observation of such a low MID in neonates also emphasizes the importance of strict biosecurity and thorough cleaning/disinfection on sow farms.","publish_time":"2015-10-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thomas, Joseph T.; Chen, Qi; Gauger, Phillip C.; Gim\u00E9nez-Lirola, Luis G.; Sinha, Avanti; Harmon, Karen M.; Madson, Darin M.; Burrough, Eric R.; Magstadt, Drew R.; Salzbrenner, Holly M.; Welch, Michael W.; Yoon, Kyoung-Jin; Zimmerman, Jeffrey J.; Zhang, Jianqiang","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f06d1fd7c4ae1397b0a8f5192e9f0c7dc5e62df.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4594914.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0139266; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26441071/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs0ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","TCID"],"locations":["United States","U.S."],"keyphrases":["day-old pigs","inoculated pigs","day-old neonatal pigs","day-old weaned pigs","PEDV infectious dose","TCID","inoculum","oral minimum infectious dose of PEDV","theoretical infectious titers","PEDV bioassay model","Ct values","clinical relevance of PEDV PCR results","known infectious titer","virulent PEDV prototype isolate","groups","information","na\u00EFve conventional neonatal piglets","clinical signs","study conditions","medium control","virus-negative cell culture medium","different pig models","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","thorough cleaning","cycle threshold","disinfection","histopathology","IN19338","importance of strict biosecurity","age-dependent","immunohistochemistry","USA","fold","polymerase chain reaction","swine population","sow farms","neonates","consideration","United States","antibody response","Dilutions","data","time","main objective","observation"],"language":"en"},

The vaccines currently available on the market elicit only limited protection. Recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replicon particles (VRP) have been used successfully to induce protection against influenza A virus (IAV) in chickens and bluetongue virus in sheep. In this study, VSV VRP expressing the PRRSV envelope proteins GP5, M, GP4, GP3, GP2 and the nucleocapsid protein N, individually or in combination, were generated and evaluated as a potential vector vaccine against PRRSV infection. High level expression of the recombinant PRRSV proteins was demonstrated in cell culture. However, none of the PRRSV antigens expressed from VRP, with the exception of the N protein, did induce any detectable antibody response in pigs before challenge infection with PRRSV. After challenge however, the antibody responses against GP5, GP4 and GP3 appeared in average 2 weeks earlier than in pigs vaccinated with the empty control VRP. No reduction of viremia was observed in the vaccinated group compared with the control group. When pigs were co-vaccinated with VRP expressing IAV antigens and VRP expressing PRRSV glycoproteins, only antibody responses to the IAV antigens were detectable. These data show that the VSV replicon vector can induce immune responses to heterologous proteins in pigs, but that the PRRSV envelope proteins expressed from VSV VRP are poorly immunogenic. Nevertheless, they prime the immune system for significantly earlier B-cell responses following PRRSV challenge infection.","publish_time":"2016-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eck, Melanie; Dur\u00E1n, Margarita Garc\u00EDa; Ricklin, Meret E.; Locher, Samira; Sarraseca, Javier; Rodr\u00EDguez, Mar\u00EDa Jos\u00E9; McCullough, Kenneth C.; Summerfield, Artur; Zimmer, Gert; Ruggli, Nicolas","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3869eb49905ee75dbd6acd2964cb74f69154b2a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4761149.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-016-0318-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26895704/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs0OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Recombinant","PRRSV","VRP","VSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRSV infection","PRRSV antigens","VSV VRP","PRRSV glycoproteins","recombinant PRRSV proteins","PRRSV challenge infection","control VRP","PRRSV envelope proteins GP5","antibody responses","immune responses","IAV antigens","VSV replicon vector","bluetongue virus","heterologous proteins","vaccinated group","earlier B-cell responses","Recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus","respiratory syndrome virus","GP3","GP4","detectable antibody response","significant viral disease of pigs","N protein","control group","nucleocapsid protein N","replicon particles","immune system","cell culture","limited protection","potential vector vaccine","GP2","chickens","High level expression","market","average","sheep","weeks","causative agent","data","influenza","exception","study","vaccines","reduction of viremia","combination"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this article is to review the current knowledge regarding the role of viruses and immune modulation in chronic pulmonary diseases and discuss avenues for future research and therapeutic implications.","publish_time":"2012-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singanayagam, Aran; Joshi, Priya V; Mallia, Patrick; Johnston, Sebastian L","journal":"BMC Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e68aebd19c565fd3b27754c63664a12772593a7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3353868.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22420941/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1741-7015-10-27","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs1MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["major cause of acute exacerbations of chronic pulmonary diseases","Respiratory viruses","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","major cause of morbidity","common cause of acute respiratory infections","role of viruses","virus-induced exacerbations","immune modulation","virus infection","future research","mechanisms of abnormal immune responses","avenues","asthma","cystic fibrosis","development of new therapies","better understanding","host response","potential","therapeutic implications","current knowledge","mortality","article","evidence","impact","aim"],"language":"en"},

Here we review the current state of knowledge about the human antibody response to dengue and identify important knowledge gaps. A large body of work has demonstrated that antibodies can neutralize or enhance DENV infection. Investigators have mainly used mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to study interactions between DENV and antibodies. These studies indicate that antibody neutralization of DENVs is a \u201Cmulti-hit\u201D phenomenon that requires the binding of multiple antibodies to neutralize a virion. The most potently neutralizing mouse MAbs bind to surface exposed epitopes on domain III of the dengue envelope (E) protein. One challenge facing the dengue field now is to extend these studies with mouse MAbs to better understand the human antibody response. The human antibody response is complex as it involves a polyclonal response to primary and secondary infections with 4 different DENV serotypes. Here we review studies conducted with immune sera and MAbs isolated from people exposed to dengue infections. Most dengue-specific antibodies in human immune sera are weakly neutralizing and bind to multiple DENV serotypes. The human antibodies that potently and type specifically neutralize DENV represent a small fraction of the total DENV-specific antibody response. Moreover, these neutralizing antibodies appear to bind to novel epitopes including complex, quaternary epitopes that are only preserved on the intact virion. These studies establish that human and mouse antibodies recognize distinct epitopes on the dengue virion. The leading theory proposed to explain the increased risk of severe disease in secondary cases is antibody dependent enhancement (ADE), which postulates that weakly neutralizing antibodies from the first infection bind to the second serotype and enhance infection of Fc\u03B3R bearing myeloid cells such as monocytes and macrophages. Here we review results from human, animal and cell culture studies relevant to the ADE hypothesis. By understanding how human antibodies neutralize or enhance DENV, it will be possible to better evaluate existing vaccines and develop the next generation of novel vaccines.","publish_time":"2011-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wahala, Wahala M.

CPV and FPV can single or mixed infect cats and cause disease. To diagnose sick animals effectively, an effective virus diagnostic and genome typing method with high sensitivity and specificity is required. RESULTS: In this study, a conserved segment containing one SNP A4408C of parvovirus was used for real-time PCR amplification. Subsequently, data were auto-analyzed and plotted using Applied Biosystems\u00AE High Resolution Melt Software v3.1. Results showed that CPV and FPV can be detected simultaneously in a single PCR reaction. No cross-reactions were observed with canine adenovirus, canine coronavirus, and canine distemper virus. The assay had a detection limit of 4.2 genome copies of CPV and FPV. A total of 80 clinical samples were subjected to this assay, as well as to conventional PCR-sequence assay and virus isolation. Results showed that the percentage of agreement of the assay and other methods are high. CONCLUSIONS: In short, we have developed a diagnostic test for the accurate detection and differentiation of CPV and FPV in fecal samples, which is also cost effective.","publish_time":"2019-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Yaru; Cheng, Yuening; Lin, Peng; Zhang, Hewei; Yi, Li; Tong, Mingwei; Cao, Zhigang; Li, Shuang; Cheng, Shipeng; Wang, Jianke","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce2f322118541b9901f218ce6e49177e5d25dd6c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6511188.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-1898-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31077252/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs1NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CPV","FPV","SNP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FPV","Canine parvovirus","differentiation of CPV","RESULTS","canine distemper virus","genome copies of CPV","canine coronavirus","canine adenovirus","effective virus diagnostic","conventional PCR-sequence assay","feline parvovirus","virus isolation","high sensitivity","cats","single PCR reaction","SNP A4408C of parvovirus","real-time PCR amplification","accurate detection","detection limit","diagnostic test","fecal samples","young animals","sick animals","clinical samples","High Resolution Melt Software v3","causative agents of diarrhea","leucopenia","Applied Biosystems","conserved segment","fever","loss of appetite","dogs","percentage of agreement","depression","study","specificity","methods","BACKGROUND","cross-reactions","cause disease","total","CONCLUSIONS","data"],"language":"en"},

Many clinical trials on COVID-19 have been registered, and we aim to review the study characteristics and provide guidance for future trials to avoid duplicated effort. Methods Studies on COVID-19 registered before March 3rd, 2020 on eight registry platforms worldwide were searched and the data of design, participants, interventions, and outcomes were extracted and analyzed. Results Three hundred and ninety-three studies were identified and 380 (96.7%) were from mainland China, while 3 in Japan, 3 in France, 2 in the US, and 3 were international collaborative studies. Two hundred and sixty-six (67.7%) aimed at therapeutic effect, others were for prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, etc. Two hundred and two studies (51.4%) were randomized controlled trials. Two third of therapeutic studies tested Western medicines including antiviral drugs (17.7%), stem cell and cord blood therapy (10.2%), chloroquine and derivatives (8.3%), 16 (6.0%) on Chinese medicines, and 73 (27.4%) on integrated therapy of Western and Chinese medicines. Thirty-one studies among 266 therapeutic studies (11.7%) used mortality as primary outcome, while the most designed secondary outcomes were symptoms and signs (47.0%). Half of the studies (45.5%) had not started recruiting till March 3rd. Conclusions Inappropriate outcome setting, delayed recruitment and insufficient numbers of new cases in China implied many studies may fail to complete. Strategies and protocols of the studies with robust and rapid data sharing are warranted for emergency public health events, helping the timely evidence-based decision-making.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Ming; Shang, Ya-xi; Tian, Zi-yu; Xiong, Min; Lu, Chun-li; Jiang, Yue; Zhang, Yao; Zhang, Ying-ying; Jin, Xin-yan; Jin, Qiu-bai; Zhang, Ying; Willcox, Merlin L.; Liu, Jian-ping","journal":"Integrative Medicine Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/edb31cf80285adf152e8661be420bfff4cfa898a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imr.2020.100426; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213422020300585; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213422020300585?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs1NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["China","Japan","France"],"keyphrases":["therapeutic studies","Methods Studies","international collaborative studies","COVID","Western medicines","Chinese medicines","future trials","clinical trials","therapeutic effect","controlled trials","integrated therapy of Western","primary outcome","data of design","mainland China","World Health Organization","rapid data sharing","designed secondary outcomes","cord blood therapy","emergency public health events","Conclusions Inappropriate outcome setting","delayed recruitment","insufficient numbers of new cases","guidance","Coronavirus disease","antiviral drugs","stem cell","timely evidence-based decision-making","symptoms","signs","Abstract Background","prevention","participants","interventions","study characteristics","duplicated effort","Japan","protocols","mortality","France","diagnosis","prognosis","chloroquine","Strategies","registry platforms","derivatives","pandemic","Results","Half"],"language":"en"},

These changes include decreases in the volume of the thoracic cavity, reduced lung volumes, and alterations in the muscles that aid respiration. Muscle function on a cellular level in the aging population is less efficient.

Clearance of particles from the lung through the mucociliary elevator is decreased and associated with ciliary dysfunction. Many complex changes in immunity with aging contribute to increased susceptibility to infections including a less robust immune response from both the innate and adaptive immune systems.

In patients with severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction, even relatively avirulent pathogens, that is, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, may compromise borderline cardiac/heart function and present clinically as severe CAP. Alternately, patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae and impaired humoral immunity/splenic dysfunction may present as severe CAP. With the exception of Legionnaire\u0027s disease, influenza, and adenovirus, pathogen virulence is not a key determinant of CAP severity. Methods Diagnostically, patients with severe CAP may be approached based on the pattern of infiltrates on chest x-ray together with the severity of hypoxemia (ie, increased A-a gradient: \u003E35). Results We present the case of an immunocompetent adult who presented with severe CAP during peak influenza season. Direct fluorescent antibody testing of his respiratory secretions was negative for influenza, adenovirus, and other respiratory viruses. Diagnostic bronchoscopy was negative for bacterial and fungal pathogens. The only clues to the cause of his severe CAP was the presence of relative lymphopenia, atypical lymphocytosis and elevated serum transaminases. After influenza and adenovirus were ruled out, cytomegalovirus (CMV) CAP was considered. The diagnosis of CMV CAP was made serologically by demonstrating highly elevated IgM CMV titers. Because the diagnosis was made during the patient\u0027s recovery late in hospitalization, he did not receive CMV antiviral therapy. Conclusion This case should remind clinicians that influenza and adenovirus are diagnostic considerations in patients presenting with severe CAP with diffuse bilateral interstitial infiltrates accompanied by severe hypoxemia in normal hosts. If influenza and adenovirus are ruled out, then CMV CAP, although rare, should be considered, particularly when viral CAP is accompanied by relative lymphopenia, atypical lymphocytosis and increased serum transaminases.","publish_time":"2009-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cunha, Burke A.; Pherez, Francisco; Walls, Nicole","journal":"Heart \u0026 Lung","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9cc1ff1f9844f453de804c26bda98ddda1b11eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112647.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0147956308001039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19486794/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrtlng.2008.05.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147956308001039","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs2MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":["CAP","CMV CAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe CAP","diagnosis of CMV CAP","severe hypoxemia","viral CAP","adenovirus","severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction","patients","key determinant of CAP severity","peak influenza season","CMV antiviral therapy","elevated IgM CMV titers","atypical lymphocytosis","increased serum transaminases","elevated serum transaminases","severity of hypoxemia","immunocompetent host","case","presence of relative lymphopenia","Streptococcus pneumoniae","splenic dysfunction","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","respiratory secretions","pattern of infiltrates","diagnostic considerations","combination of host","avirulent pathogens","immunocompetent adult","respiratory viruses","Diagnostic bronchoscopy","fungal pathogens","diffuse bilateral interstitial infiltrates","impaired humoral immunity","Moraxella catarrhalis","heart function","pathogen virulence","variety","clinicians","Direct fluorescent antibody testing","chest x-ray","exception of Legionnaire\u0027s disease","microbial factors","normal hosts","patient\u0027s recovery","hospitalization","Background Community","cause","cytomegalovirus","Methods","Conclusion","clues","gradient"],"language":"en"},

Materials and methods Fifty-nine patients (31 males, 28 females; mean age: 41 years, range: 25 to 70 years) with confirmed COVID-19 infection performed follow-up thin-section CT of the thorax. After 31.5 days of hospital admission, the results of thin-section CT were analyzed for parenchymal abnormality (ground-glass opacification, interstitial thickening, and consolidation) and evidence of fibrosis (parenchymal band, traction bronchiectasis, and irregular interfaces). Patients were analyzed based on the evidence of fibrosis and divided into two groups, group A (with CT evidence of fibrosis) and group B (without CT evidence of fibrosis). Patient demographics, length of stay (LOS), rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, peak C-reactive protein level, and CT score were compared between the two groups. Results Among the 59 patients, 89.8% (53/59) patients had a typical transition from early phase to advanced phase and advanced phase to dissipating phase. Out of 59 patients, 39% (23/59) patients developed fibrosis (group A), whereas 61% (36/59) patients did not show definite fibrosis (group B). Patients in group A were older (mean age, 45.4 vs. 33.8 years), with longer LOS (19.1 vs. 15.0 days), higher rate of ICU admission (21.7% (5/23) vs. 5.6% (2/36)), higher peak C-reactive protein level (30.7 vs. 18.1 mg/L), and higher maximal CT score (5.2 vs. 4.0) than those in group B. Conclusions Pulmonary fibrosis may develop early in patients with COVID-19 after hospital discharge. Older patients with severe illness during treatment were more prone to develop fibrosis according to thin-section CT results.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wei, Jiangping; Lei, Pinggui; Yang, Hong; Fan, Bing; Qiu, Yingying; Zeng, Bingliang; Yu, Peng; Lv, Jian; Jian, Yinchao; Wan, Chengfeng; Pang, Peipei","journal":"Clinical imaging","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4710827834deafd58ec19392945831f7a1243644.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089970712030156X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S089970712030156X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinimag.2020.05.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425336/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs2Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CT evidence of fibrosis","Older patients","definite fibrosis","section CT results","development of pulmonary fibrosis","Conclusions Pulmonary fibrosis","group B","higher maximal CT score","advanced phase","early phase","years","days of hospital admission","higher rate of ICU admission","hospital discharge","higher peak C-reactive protein level","mean age","confirmed COVID","groups","parenchymal abnormality","parenchymal band","longer LOS","rate of intensive care unit","ground-glass opacification","traction bronchiectasis","treatment","data","interstitial thickening","typical transition","severe illness","consolidation","infection","follow-up","females","length of stay","coronavirus disease","range","irregular interfaces","Patient demographics","methods","Abstract Purpose","Materials","thorax"],"language":"en"},

However, an unexpected dengue outbreak occurred in 2014 in Japan. Given that autochthonous (domestic) dengue cases had not been reported for the past 70 years in Japan, this outbreak was highly unusual and suggests that several environmental factors might have changed in a way that favors vector mosquitoes in the Northeast Asian region. METHODS: A Climate Risk Factor (CRF) index, as validated in previous work, was constructed using climate and non-climate factors. This CRF index was compared to the number of reported dengue cases in Tokyo, Japan where the outbreak was observed in 2014. In order to identify high-risk areas, the CRF index was further estimated at the 5 km by 5 km resolution and mapped for Japan and South Korea. RESULTS: The high-risk areas determined by the CRF index corresponded well to the provinces where a high number of autochthonous cases were reported during the outbreak in Japan. At the provincial-level, high-risk areas for dengue fever were the Eastern part of Tokyo and Kanakawa, the South-Eastern part of Saitama, and the North-Western part of Chiba. While a relatively small number of high-risk areas were identified in South Korea compared with Japan, the high-risk areas in South Korea include popular tourist destinations where international visitors have been increasing. CONCLUSION: The recent dengue outbreak in Japan may signal that the two adjacent non-dengue-endemic countries are also exposed to the risk of temporal and sporadic behavior of dengue fever. It is critical to understand potential high-risk areas for future outbreaks and to set up appropriate prevention activities at the governmental-level.","publish_time":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Jung-Seok; Farlow, Andrew","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/52e898e9b4110cbc6a8beac32cd86672f96489ca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6625070.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-019-7282-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31296193/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs2ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CRF"],"locations":["Northeast Asia","Japan","Tokyo","South Korea","Chiba"],"keyphrases":["Japan","recent dengue outbreak","unexpected dengue outbreak","number of reported dengue cases","potential high-risk areas","small number of high-risk areas","CRF index","adjacent non-dengue-endemic countries","sporadic behavior of dengue fever","South Korea","non-climate factors","high number of autochthonous cases","Tokyo","Climate Risk Factor","sub-tropics","risk of temporal","governmental-level","provincial-level","environmental factors","Northeast Asian region","popular tourist destinations","major public health problem","future outbreaks","vector mosquitoes","disease","provinces","appropriate prevention activities","international visitors","Kanakawa","Saitama","way","METHODS","BACKGROUND","previous work","years","CONCLUSION","resolution","order","RESULTS","Chiba"],"language":"en"},

While each incident is unique, the number and type of response activities are finite; therefore, through comparative analysis, we can learn about commonalities in the response patterns that could improve predictions and expectations regarding the resources and capabilities required to respond to future acute events. In this study, we interviewed representatives from more than 120 local health departments regarding their recent experiences with real-world acute public health incidents, such as infectious disease outbreaks, severe weather events, chemical spills, and bioterrorism threats. We collected highly structured data on key aspects of the incident and the public health response, particularly focusing on the public health activities initiated and community partners engaged in the response efforts. As a result, we are able to make comparisons across event types, create response profiles, and identify functional and structural response patterns that have import for future public health preparedness and response. Our study contributes to clarifying the complexity of public health response systems and our analysis reveals the ways in which these systems are adaptive to the character of the threat, resulting in differential activation of functions and partners based on the type of incident. Continued and rigorous examination of the experiences of health departments throughout the nation will refine our very understanding of what the public health response system is, will enable the identification of organizational and event inputs to performance, and will allow for the construction of rich, relevant, and practical models of response operations that can be employed to strengthen public health systems.","publish_time":"2013-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hunter, Jennifer C.; Yang, Jane E.; Crawley, Adam W.; Biesiadecki, Laura; Arag\u00F3n, Tom\u00E1s J.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cfafca2d4a79e684fdd5291ae3b69245ff13b61c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3827361.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0079457; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24236137/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs3MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["public health systems","public health activities","public health agencies","complexity of public health response systems","health threats","future public health preparedness","response profiles","response efforts","experiences of health departments","real-world acute public health incidents","local health departments","type of response activities","structural response patterns","practical models of response operations","type of incident","future acute events","study","recent experiences","community partners","event types","event inputs","bioterrorism threats","comparative analysis","infectious disease outbreaks","severe weather events","wide range of disease","chemical spills","number","key aspects","identification of organizational","expectations","differential activation of functions","routine","capabilities","predictions","comparisons","ways","core mission","understanding","structured data","rigorous examination","resources","construction of rich","performance","emergency responses","character","representatives","commonalities","result"],"language":"en"},

A copy of the transcription regulatory sequence for ORF6 (TRS6) was inserted between the N protein and 3\u2032-UTR to drive the transcription of the EGFP gene and yield a general purpose expression vector. Successful recovery of PRRSV was obtained using an RNA polymerase II promoter to drive transcription of the full-length virus genome, which was assembled in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). The recombinant virus showed growth replication characteristics similar to those of the wild-type virus in the infected cells. In addition, the recombinant virus stably expressed EGFP for at least 10 passages. EGFP expression was detected at approximately 10 h post infection by live-cell imaging to follow the virus spread in real time and the infection of neighbouring cells occurred predominantly through cell-to-cell-contact. Finally, the recombinant virus generated was found to be an excellent tool for neutralising antibodies and antiviral compound screening. The newly established reverse genetics system for PRRSV could be a useful tool not only to monitor virus spread and screen for neutralising antibodies and antiviral compounds, but also for fundamental research on the biology of the virus.","publish_time":"2013-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Chengbao; Huang, Baicheng; Kong, Ning; Li, Qiongyi; Ma, Yuping; Li, Zhijun; Gao, Jiming; Zhang, Chong; Wang, Xiangpeng; Liang, Chao; Dang, Lu; Xiao, Shuqi; Mu, Yang; Zhao, Qin; Sun, Yani; Almazan, Fernando; Enjuanes, Luis; Zhou, En-Min","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3dede13dfa857e159c3fd7830374e1dc76008f2e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4176086.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24176053/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1297-9716-44-104","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs3MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EGFP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recombinant virus","respiratory syndrome virus","wild-type virus","full-length virus genome","EGFP gene","EGFP expression","neutralising antibodies","transcription regulatory sequence","separate transcription unit","cell imaging","cell-contact","Successful recovery of PRRSV","infection of neighbouring cells","reporter gene","antiviral compounds","excellent tool","useful tool","N protein","infected cells","antiviral compound screening","h post infection","enhanced green fluorescent protein","general purpose expression vector","growth replication characteristics similar","TRS6","real time","established reverse genetics system","fundamental research","promoter","ORF6","RNA polymerase","bacterial artificial chromosome","copy","rescue","biology","addition","passages"],"language":"en"},

In view of that, we propose an evolutionary epidemic model coupled with human behaviors, where individuals have three strategies: vaccination, self-protection and laissez faire, and could adjust their strategies according to their neighbors\u0027 strategies and payoffs at the beginning of each new season of epidemic spreading. We found a counter-intuitive phenomenon analogous to the well-known Braess\u0027s Paradox, namely a better condition may lead to worse performance. Specifically speaking, increasing the successful rate of self-protection does not necessarily reduce the epidemic size or improve the system payoff. The range and degree of the Braess\u0027s Paradox are sensitive to both the parameters characterizing the epidemic spreading and the strategy payoff, while the existence of the Braess\u0027s Paradox is insensitive to the network topologies. This phenomenon can be well explained by a mean-field approximation.

Analysis of the HIV-1 p24 protein and influenza virus matrix protein revealed that the present approach is effective, yielding prediction accuracy of over 80% with respect to experimental data. Subsequently, we applied such a method for prediction of T-cell epitopes in SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) S, N and M proteins.

The raccoon dog quickly colonized new areas after being introduced to the European part of the former Soviet Union. Today it is widespread in Northern and Eastern Europe and is still spreading in Central Europe. Features behind its success include its adaptability, high reproductive potential, omnivory, hibernation in northern areas, multiple introductions with \u003E 9000 individuals from different localities, and tendency to wander enabling gene flow between populations. Firm evidence of the raccoon dog\u2019s negative impact on native fauna, such as a reduction in bird populations, is still scarce. Raccoon dogs may destroy waterfowl nests, although a nest predation study in Latvia did not confirm this. Predator removal studies in Finland suggested that the raccoon dog\u2019s impact on game birds is smaller than expected. However, raccoon dogs may have caused local extinction of frog populations, especially on islands. Raccoon dogs may compete with other carnivores for food, for example for carrion in winter, or for the best habitat patches. In northern Europe potential competitors include the red fox Vulpes vulpes and the badger Meles meles, but studies of their diets or habitat preferences do not indicate severe competition. The raccoon dog is an important vector of diseases and parasites, such as rabies, Echinococcus multilocularis and Trichinella spp. and this is no doubt the most severe consequence arising from the spread of this alien species in Europe.","publish_time":"2011-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kauhala, Kaarina; Kowalczyk, Rafal","journal":"Curr Zool","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9e0df74e9a94c05ea95ffec1df28e3a2bec5f991.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288758/; https://doi.org/10.1093/czoolo/57.5.584","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs3ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe","Soviet Union","Eastern Europe","Central Europe","Latvia","Finland"],"keyphrases":["Raccoon dogs","raccoon dog\u2019s impact","raccoon dog\u2019s negative impact","raccoon dog Nyctereutes procyonoides","Eastern Europe","Central Europe","northern Europe potential competitors","northern areas","native fauna","features","bird populations","badger Meles meles","red fox Vulpes vulpes","habitat preferences","new areas","local extinction of frog populations","severe consequence","severe competition","high reproductive potential","Predator removal studies","best habitat patches","hibernation","omnivory","adaptability","colonization","Finland","multiple introductions","waterfowl nests","tendency","rabies","individuals","parasites","spread","important vector of diseases","game birds","successful expansion","nest predation study","Firm evidence","Trichinella","example","winter","diets","reduction","carnivores","Echinococcus multilocularis","different localities","carrion","food","Latvia","doubt","gene flow","alien species","Soviet Union","history","islands"],"language":"en"},

MATERIAL/METHODS: From 20 January 2020 to 2 February 2020, 6 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, including 1 male and 5 females, were retrospectively reviewed in Zhejiang Hospital. These cases were clinically assessed and classified as common COVID-19. All patients underwent thoracic high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) within 2 days after the onset of symptoms, and their images were viewed by 2 radiologists who were blind to their clinical records. RESULTS: CT images of 6 confirmed patients were collected. Two of the 6 patients (33.3%) had bilateral lung involvements and 4 (66.7%) had single-lung involvement. Two cases (33.3%) had a single lesion, 2 cases (33.3%) had 2 lesions, and 2 cases (33.3%) had multiple lesions. There were 2 cases (33.3%) with focal subpleural distribution and 1 case (16.7%) along the bronchial vascular bundle. Five cases (83.3%) had ground-glass opacities, 4 cases (66.7%) had ground-glass nodules, 1 case (16.7%) had thickened lobular septum, 2 cases (33.3%) had thickened bronchial wall, 2 cases (33.3%) had halo sign, 1 case (16.7%) had crazy-paving sign, and 1 case (16.7%) had tree-in-bud sign. CONCLUSIONS: The imaging manifestations of early-stage COVID-19 are relatively mild, and the imaging findings of some patients are not typical, which can easily lead to missed diagnoses. Thus, suspected cases need to be closely monitored, and epidemiological history and clinical laboratory examination should also be considered during diagnosis.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gao, Lulu; Zhang, Jianjun","journal":"Med Sci Monit","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eec7e78bab5b91a86b0ce39df537a90161d3291a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156878.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.923885; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32246819/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs3ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Zhejiang Hospital"],"keyphrases":["early detection of suspected cases","imaging manifestations of early","stage COVID","confirmed patients","imaging basis","imaging findings","common COVID","halo sign","bud sign","ground-glass nodules","ground-glass opacities","crazy-paving sign","single-lung involvement","CT images","clinical records","bronchial wall","single lesion","multiple lesions","stage coronavirus disease","clinical laboratory examination","bilateral lung involvements","bronchial vascular bundle","thoracic high-resolution computed tomography","HRCT","stratified intervention","days","epidemiological history","study","focal subpleural distribution","blind","onset of symptoms","RESULTS","radiologists","tree","CONCLUSIONS","females","BACKGROUND","aim","lobular septum","Zhejiang Hospital","MATERIAL","METHODS","diagnosis","diagnoses"],"language":"en"},

Pathogenic bacteria (Mannheimia haemolytica (Mh), Pasteurella multocida (Pm), Histophilus somni (Hs), and Mycoplasma bovis) and a range of viruses (bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine coronavirus, bovine parainfluenza virus type 3, bovine viral diarrhea virus and bovine herpesvirus type 1) are associated with this complex. As most of these pathogens can be present in healthy and diseased calves, simple detection of their presence in diseased calves carries low predictive value. In other multi-agent diseases of livestock, quantification of pathogens has added substantially to the predictive value of microbiological diagnosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of two recently developed quantitative PCR (qPCR) kits (Pneumo4B and Pneumo4V) to detect and quantify these bacterial and viral pathogens, respectively. Test efficiencies of the qPCR assays, based on nucleic acid dilution series of target bacteria and viruses, were 93\u2013106% and 91\u2013104%, respectively, with assay detection limits of 10\u201350 copies of nucleic acids. All 44 strains of target bacteria were correctly identified, with no false positive reactions in 135strains of non-target bacterial species. Based on standard curves of log10 CFU versus cycle threshold (Ct) values, quantification was possible over a 5-log range of bacteria. In 92 tracheal aspirate samples, the kappa values for agreement between Pneumo4B and bacterial culture were 0.64-0.84 for Mh, Pm and Hs. In an additional 84 tracheal aspirates, agreement between Pneumo4B or Pneumo 4V and certified diagnostic qPCR assays was moderate (0.57) for M. bovis and high (0.71\u20130.90) for viral pathogens. Thus Pneumo4 kits specifically detected and quantified the relevant pathogens.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pansri, P.; Katholm, J.; Krogh, K. M.; Aagaard, A.

When these cell lines were challenged in vitro with RV Pasteur virus-11 (PV-11) strain, there was reduction in number of RV-specific foci and target gene transcripts indicating inhibitory effect on RV multiplication.

Submission of genomic data to NCBI GenBank is a requirement prior to publication and plays a critical role in making scientific data publicly available. GenBank currently has automatic prokaryotic and eukaryotic genome annotation pipelines but has no viral annotation pipeline beyond influenza virus. Annotation and submission of viral genome sequence is a non-trivial task, especially for groups that do not routinely interact with GenBank for data submissions. We present Viral Annotation Pipeline and iDentification (VAPiD), a portable and lightweight command-line tool for annotation and GenBank deposition of viral genomes. VAPiD supports annotation of nearly all unsegmented viral genomes. The pipeline has been validated on human immunodeficiency virus, human parainfluenza virus 1-4, human metapneumovirus, human coronaviruses (229E/OC43/NL63/HKU1/SARS/MERS), human enteroviruses/rhinoviruses, measles virus, mumps virus, Hepatitis A-E Virus, Chikungunya virus, dengue virus, and West Nile virus, as well the human polyomaviruses BK/JC/MCV, human adenoviruses, and human papillomaviruses. The program can handle individual or batch submissions of different viruses to GenBank and correctly annotates multiple viruses, including those that contain ribosomal slippage or RNA editing without prior knowledge of the virus to be annotated. VAPiD is programmed in Python and is compatible with Windows, Linux, and Mac OS systems. We have created a portable, lightweight, user-friendly, internet-enabled, open-source, command-line genome annotation and submission package to facilitate virus genome submissions to NCBI GenBank.

We evaluate the benefits of rehabilitation treatment in the atypical or complicated cases in order to provide the solution to the condition and avoid complications.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zaldibar-Barinaga, M.

Results. There were differences in the way that Taiwan and mainland China responded to the SARS epidemic, however, both employed techniques of hospital quarantine. After early policy mistakes in both countries HCWs were called heroes. The label \u2018hero\u2019 may not be appropriate for the average HCW when faced with the SARS epidemic, although a number of self-less acts can be found. The label was also politically convenient. Conclusions. A middle ground for reasonable expectations from HCW when treating diseases that have serious risk of infection should be expected. While all should act according to the ethic of beneficence not all persons should be expected to be martyrs for society.","publish_time":"2004-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hsin, Dena Hsin-Chen; Macer, Darryl R.J.","journal":"J Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1bf5c849aed524f5e7112621738a6174f004803f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132465.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445304001410; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445304001410","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["SARS epidemic","mainland China","Taiwan","label","countries HCWs","average HCW","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","analysis of ethical principles","diseases","professional moral duty of health care workers","Descriptive discussion of media reports","reasonable expectations","political decisions","events","particular emphasis","early policy mistakes","middle ground","way","employed techniques of hospital quarantine","number of self-","serious risk of infection","ethic of beneficence","persons","acts","differences","heroes","Objectives","Methods","Results","Conclusions","society"],"language":"en"},

In vitro systems developed so far have limited the growth in knowledge about RCVs by not permitting generation of plaque-cloned virus stocks, reliable isolation of RCVs from rat tissues, or growth of high titered stocks of all isolates. Due to the fact that less than 20% of L2(Percy) cells were becoming infected, sublines were produced and selected for maximal growth of RCVs. Screening of 238 cell sublines yielded L2p.176 cells which were highly susceptible to all RCVs tested; however, susceptibility declined after 30 passages in vitro. Low-passaged L2p.176 cells were used to isolate virus from natural outbreaks and to propagate individual RCV plaques into high titered stocks. Proteins from six RCV isolates were immunoblotted using polyclonal rat and mouse antibodies to sialodacryoadenitis virus and polyclonal monospecific rabbit and goat antibodies against the peplomer (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Proteins of two prototype, one Japanese and three wild type RCVs were examined and found to be similar to those of MHV, although the exact sizes and ratios of protein forms were unique for most RCV isolats. This study reports the development of a continuous cell line which reliably supports RCVs opening an opportunity for further in vivo studies of the biology of these agents. As a first step in the characterization of RCVs, we have shown that RCV proteins are very similar to those of MHV.","publish_time":"1996-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gaertner, Diane J.; Compton, Susan R.; Winograd, Deborah F.; Smith, Abigail L.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b817ceb025fe634b29416cfa932119965bc5de8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168170295012745; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0168170295012745","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs5MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RCV","MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["characterization of RCVs","RCV proteins","maximal growth of RCVs","reliable isolation of RCVs","wild type RCVs","RCV isolates","cells","MHV","proteins of mouse hepatitis virus","cloned virus stocks","sialodacryoadenitis virus","polyclonal rat","growth of high titered stocks","RCV isolats","mouse antibodies","rat tissues","individual RCV plaques","cell sublines","Abstract Rat coronaviruses","goat antibodies","polyclonal monospecific rabbit","continuous cell line","Low-passaged L2p","laboratory rats","ratios of protein forms","generation of plaque","peplomer","exact sizes","nucleocapsid","Japanese","natural outbreaks","biomedical research results","development","studies","Percy","prototype","Screening","knowledge","biology","agents","study","susceptibility","step","opportunity","passages","systems","fact"],"language":"en"},

In the present study we aimed to determine the expression of HAT during squamous cell carcinogenesis. HAT transcript is present in several tissues containing stratified squamous epithelium and decreased expression is observed in carcinomas. We determined that HAT protein is consistently expressed on the cell surface in suprabasal/apical layers of squamous cells in healthy cervical and esophageal epithelia. To assess whether HAT protein is differentially expressed in normal tissue versus tissue in different stages of carcinogenesis, we performed a comprehensive immunohistochemical analysis of HAT protein expression levels and localization in arrays of paraffin embedded human cervical and esophageal carcinomas compared to the corresponding normal tissue. We found that HAT protein is expressed in the non-proliferating, differentiated cellular strata and is lost during the dedifferentiation of epithelial cells, a hallmark of squamous cell carcinogenesis. Thus, HAT expression may potentially be useful as a marker for clinical grading and assessment of patient prognosis in squamous cell carcinomas.","publish_time":"2016-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"DUHAIME, MICHAEL J.; PAGE, KHALIPH O.; VARELA, FAUSTO A.; MURRAY, ANDREW S.; SILVERMAN, MICHAEL E.; ZORATTI, GINA L.; LIST, KARIN","journal":"Journal of Cellular Physiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a7eeb3af118587feca3204e90798b0dc2f15e5b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1f337a6814fe6ed07f436213792bdc9b24581564.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4933652.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.25173; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26297835/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4933652?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs5NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of HAT","HAT expression","HAT transcript","squamous cell carcinomas","hallmark of squamous cell carcinogenesis","comprehensive immunohistochemical analysis of HAT protein expression levels","decreased expression","esophageal carcinomas","cell surface","stratified squamous epithelium","apical layers of squamous cells","corresponding normal tissue","different stages of carcinogenesis","Cancer progression","TTSP Human Airway Trypsin","increased levels of extracellular proteases","esophageal epithelia","extracellular matrix","present study","transmembrane serine protease","dedifferentiation of epithelial cells","assessment of patient prognosis","tissues","arrays of paraffin","localization","clinical grading","suprabasal","receptors","cleaving","type","family","function","non-proliferating","marker","cellular strata","critical roles","growth factors","members","pathways"],"language":"en"},

Background Molecular testing for viral pathogens has resulted in increasing detection of multiple viruses in respiratory secretions of ill children. The clinical impact of multiple virus infections on clinical presentation and outcome is unclear. Objectives To compare clinical characteristics and viral load between children with multiple virus versus single virus illnesses. Patients/methods Eight hundred and ninety\u2010three residual nasal wash samples from children treated for respiratory illness at Children\u2019s Hospital, Seattle, from September 2003 to September 2004 were evaluated by quantitative PCR for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), influenza (Flu), parainfluenza, adenoviruses, and coronaviruses (CoV). Illness severity and patient characteristics were abstracted from medical charts. Results Coinfections were identified in 103 (18%) of 566 virus\u2010positive samples. Adenovirus was most commonly detected in coinfections (52%), followed by CoV (50%). Illnesses with a single virus had increased risk of oxygen requirement (P = 0\u00B702), extended hospital stays (P = 0\u00B7002), and admissions to the inpatient (P = 0\u00B702) or intensive care units (P = 0\u00B704). For Adv and PIV\u20101, multiple virus illnesses had a significantly lower viral load (log(10) copies/ml) than single virus illnesses (4\u00B72 versus 5\u00B76, P = 0\u00B7007 and 4\u00B72 versus 6\u00B79, P \u003C 0\u00B7001, respectively). RSV, Flu\u2010A, PIV\u20103, and hMPV viral loads were consistently high whether or not another virus was detected.

Abstract: To determine the role of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in respiratory tract infections (RTIs) of lung transplant recipients, 60 patients were prospectively enrolled in this study spanning from September 2005 to November 2007. Community\u2010acquired respiratory viruses (CARVs) were identified by polymerase chain reaction and tissue culture in respiratory secretions. Of 112 RTIs, 51 were associated with \u22651 CARV, including 7 HMPV, 13 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 19 parainfluenza virus 1, 2, or 3 (PIV), 16 influenza A or B (FLU), and 3 human rhinoviruses (HRV). Sixteen CARV\u2010RTIs had multiple pathogens. While the standard protocol was to admit all paramyxoviral RTIs for inhaled ribavirin, 16% CARV\u2010RTIs required hospitalization because of the severity of their respiratory compromise, including 25% of HPMV\u2010single\u2010agent RTI, 38% of RSV single\u2010agent RTI, 10% of PIV\u2010single\u2010agent RTI, and 19% of multiple\u2010agent RTIs. None of those with non\u2010CARV RTIs required hospitalization. The incidence of clinically diagnosed acute graft rejection in the first 2 months after an RTI varied from 0 for single\u2010agent HRV to 88% for single\u2010agent RSV (25% for single\u2010agent HMPV). A new diagnosis of chronic graft rejection in the first year after an RTI was made in approximately 25% of the RTIs and did not significantly vary with the etiologic agent. No deaths occurred during this study. In conclusion, HMPV was associated with 6% of the RTIs in lung transplant recipients and its morbidity was similar to the average moribidity of CARVs.","publish_time":"2010-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weinberg, A.; Lyu, D.M.; Li, S.; Marquesen, J.; Zamora, M.R.","journal":"Transpl Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e671c83a983bd01f80b474297c7da8ca7bc57aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169861.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3062.2010.00509.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20456714/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs5ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["A.

This uncommon paediatric epilepsy syndrome is poorly understood, with only a very small minority of cases associated with an underlying genetic or metabolic abnormality. We present a four\u2010year\u2010old girl with genetic cobalamin C deficiency who had a dramatic presentation with Hemiconvulsion\u2010Hemiplegia\u2010Epilepsy. She had febrile focal status epilepticus, with right hemiconvulsive seizures for nearly 10 hours, ultimately requiring a midazolam infusion.

The MBL exerts its function by directly binding to microbial surfaces through its carbohydrate recognition domains, followed by direct opsonization or complement activation via MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP)-1 and -2. Thus, MBL plays a major role in the first-line innate defense against pathogens. We investigated the MBL concentrations in serum during experimental infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infections in chickens. The results showed that the acute phase MBL response to infection with IBV was, to a degree (P \u003C 0.0068), dependent on whether the chickens were inoculated after 12 h of rest (dark) or after 12 h of activity (light). The acute phase response in chickens challenged after 12 h of activity peaked after 4.6 d with an increase of 24%, whereas the acute phase response in chickens challenged after 12 h of rest peaked after 3.1 d with an increase of 51%. The specific antibody titer against IBV was also tested, and a difference (P \u003C 0.0091) between the two experimental groups was found with peak titer values of 6,816 and 4,349. However, the highest value was found in chickens inoculated after 12 h of activity. Thus, an inverse relation exists between the MBL response and the IBV specific antibody response. The ability of MBL to activate the complement cascade was tested in a heterologous system by deposition of human C4 on the chicken MBL/MASP complex. The complement activation was directly associated with the concentration of MBL in serum, indicating neutralization of the virus before the humoral antibody response took over.","publish_time":"2003-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Juul-Madsen, HR; Munch, M; Handberg, KJ; Sorensen, P; Johnson, AA; Norup, LR; Jorgensen, PH","journal":"Poultry Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3497e6136b784520585371711434488d28aa4c9f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ff38214f7139e1f7cf972075cec62d758d1dafb3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0032579119449420; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119449420","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MBL","IBV","MBL/MASP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute phase MBL response","chicken MBL","MBL concentrations","concentration of MBL","ability of MBL","chickens","acute phase response","h of activity","IBV specific antibody response","MBL-associated serine proteases","h of rest","humoral antibody response","acute phase protein family","complement activation","specific antibody titer","collectin family","serum","complement cascade","increase","C-type lectin super family","experimental infectious bronchitis virus","experimental groups","ABSTRACT Mannan-binding lectin","MASP complex","peak titer values","deposition of human C4","carbohydrate recognition domains","heterologous system","direct opsonization","microbial surfaces","infections","line innate defense","member","glycoprotein","neutralization","major role","pathogens","function","inverse relation","dark","results","highest value","degree","light","difference"],"language":"en"},

The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002/2003 has demonstrated human vulnerability to (Coronavirus) CoV epidemics. Neither vaccines nor therapeutics are available against human and animal CoVs. Knowledge of host cell proteins that take part in pivotal virus-host interactions could define broad-spectrum antiviral targets. In this study, we used a systems biology approach employing a genome-wide yeast-two hybrid interaction screen to identify immunopilins (PPIA, PPIB, PPIH, PPIG, FKBP1A, FKBP1B) as interaction partners of the CoV non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1). These molecules modulate the Calcineurin/NFAT pathway that plays an important role in immune cell activation. Overexpression of NSP1 and infection with live SARS-CoV strongly increased signalling through the Calcineurin/NFAT pathway and enhanced the induction of interleukin 2, compatible with late-stage immunopathogenicity and long-term cytokine dysregulation as observed in severe SARS cases. Conversely, inhibition of cyclophilins by cyclosporine A (CspA) blocked the replication of CoVs of all genera, including SARS-CoV, human CoV-229E and -NL-63, feline CoV, as well as avian infectious bronchitis virus. Non-immunosuppressive derivatives of CspA might serve as broad-range CoV inhibitors applicable against emerging CoVs as well as ubiquitous pathogens of humans and livestock.","publish_time":"2011-10-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pfefferle, Susanne; Sch\u00F6pf, Julia; K\u00F6gl, Manfred; Friedel, Caroline C.; M\u00FCller, Marcel A.; Carbajo-Lozoya, Javier; Stellberger, Thorsten; von Dall\u2019Armi, Ekatarina; Herzog, Petra; Kallies, Stefan; Niemeyer, Daniela; Ditt, Vanessa; Kuri, Thomas; Z\u00FCst, Roland; Pumpor, Ksenia; Hilgenfeld, Rolf; Schwarz, Frank; Zimmer, Ralf; Steffen, Imke; Weber, Friedemann; Thiel, Volker; Herrler, Georg; Thiel, Heinz-J\u00FCrgen; Schwegmann-We\u00DFels, Christel; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan; Haas, J\u00FCrgen; Drosten, Christian; von Brunn, Albrecht","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e92488019ca299d19beabb885c7c71b12b535712.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3203193.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22046132/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Calcineurin/NFAT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human CoV","live SARS-CoV","CoV epidemics","feline CoV","CoV non-structural protein","important human","animal CoVs","emerging CoVs","human vulnerability","replication of CoVs","severe SARS cases","broad-range CoV inhibitors applicable","animal pathogens","NFAT pathway","Calcineurin","interaction partners","important role","severe acute respiratory syndrome","pivotal virus-host interactions","Knowledge of host cell proteins","Overexpression of NSP1","hybrid interaction screen","ubiquitous pathogens of humans","immune cell activation","avian infectious bronchitis virus","Non-immunosuppressive derivatives of CspA","long-term cytokine dysregulation","genome-wide yeast","increased signalling","PPIH","late-stage immunopathogenicity","FKBP1A","PPIA","immunopilins","PPIG","PPIB","FKBP1B","infection","systems biology approach","broad-spectrum antiviral targets","neurological disease","induction of interleukin","outbreak","therapeutics","NL","genera","cyclosporine","livestock","vaccines","molecules","Coronaviruses","inhibition of cyclophilins"],"language":"en"},

MERS-CoV infections have been identified in many countries all over the world whereas high level occurrences have been documented in the Middle East and Korea. MERS-CoV is mainly spreading across the geographical region of the Middle East, especially in the Arabian Peninsula, while some imported sporadic cases were reported from the Europe, North America, Africa, and lately Asia. The prevalence of MERS-CoV infections across the Gulf Corporation Council (GCC) countries still remains unclear. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to report the prevalence of MERS-CoV in the GCC countries and to also elucidate on its demographics in the Arabian Peninsula. To date, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 1,797 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection since June 2012, involving 687 deaths in 27 different countries worldwide. Within a time span of 4 years from June 2012 to July 2016, we collect samples form MERS-CoV infected individuals from National Guard Hospital, Riyadh, and Ministry of health Saudi Arabia and other GCC countries. Our data comprise a total of 1550 cases (67.1% male and 32.9% female). The age-specific prevalence and distribution of MERS-CoV was as follow: \u003C20 yrs (36 cases: 3.28%), 20\u201339 yrs (331 cases: 30.15%), 40\u201359 yrs (314 cases: 28.60%), and the highest-risk elderly group aged \u226560 yrs (417 cases: 37.98%). The case distribution among GCC countries was as follows: Saudi Arabia (1441 cases: 93%), Kuwait (4 cases: 0.3%), Bahrain (1 case: 0.1%), Oman (8 cases: 0.5%), Qatar (16 cases: 1.0%), and United Arab Emirates (80 cases: 5.2%). Thus, MERS-CoV was found to be more prevalent in Saudi Arabia especially in Riyadh, where 756 cases (52.4%) were the worst hit area of the country identified, followed by the western region Makkah where 298 cases (20.6%) were recorded. This prevalence update indicates that the Arabian Peninsula, particularly Saudi Arabia, is the hardest hit region regarding the emerging MERS-CoV infections worldwide. GCC countries including Saudi Arabia now have the infrastructure in place that allows physicians and scientific community to identify and immediately respond to the potential risks posed by new outbreaks of MERS-CoV infections in the region. Given the continuum of emergence and the large magnitude of the disease in our region, more studies will be required to bolster capabilities for timely detection and effective control and prevention of MERS-CoV in our region.","publish_time":"2017-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aly, Mahmoud; Elrobh, Mohamed; Alzayer, Maha; Aljuhani, Sameera; Balkhy, Hanan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/07ca288609eac312987db5e4e69de3c5a8b21e2a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5640221.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183850; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29028812/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Gulf Corporation Council","GCC","World Health Organization","National Guard Hospital"],"locations":["Middle East","Korea","Europe","North America","Africa","Asia","Arabian Peninsula","Saudi Arabia","Bahrain","United Arab Emirates"],"keyphrases":["cases of MERS","prevalence of MERS","emerging MERS-CoV infections","distribution of MERS","prevention of MERS","GCC countries","imported sporadic cases","samples form MERS-CoV infected individuals","new outbreaks of MERS","different countries","yrs","geographical region","Ministry of health Saudi Arabia","Arabian Peninsula","hardest hit region","western region Makkah","prevalence update","Riyadh","age-specific prevalence","case distribution","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","World Health Organization","continuum of emergence","worst hit area","National Guard Hospital","effective control","Gulf Corporation Council","capabilities","timely detection","place","Europe","large magnitude","Africa","physicians","country","disease","infrastructure","highest-risk elderly group","global issue of dire concerns","high level occurrences","North America","potential risks","scientific community","current study","studies","United Arab Emirates","time span","years","objective","Asia","deaths","data","total","demographics","Korea","Bahrain","Oman","laboratory","Kuwait","Qatar","female"],"language":"en"},

In large part, this may be attributed to the high variability of viral species and the difficulties in developing broad-spectrum, yet specific, diagnostic assays. To overcome this problem, a novel method for the detection of viruses is described in the current manuscript. The technique relies on the addition of synthetic oligonucleotides to both termini of RNA fragments in a sequence-dependent manner during first- and second-strand DNA synthesis; these oligonucleotides are used subsequently for amplification of the viral nucleic acids of interest. The recognition of the target sequence by the oligonucleotides is mediated by short (6\u20138nt) conserved regions, which facilitates development of broad\u2013spectrum assays. The method has been tested for coronaviruses, although it may be also adopted for other RNA viruses.","publish_time":"2013-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pyrc, Krzysztof; Sto\u017Cek, Karol; Galan, Wojciech; Potempa, Jan","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b74a75e9ddb3b610e15cfb2b72bd45086d12b1a2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113646.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2012.11.039; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093412004314; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093412004314; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23219933/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA viruses","known viruses","new viruses","detection of viruses","novel method","addition of synthetic oligonucleotides","target sequence","spectrum assays","diagnostic assays","termini of RNA fragments","sequence-dependent manner","viral nucleic acids","high variability of viral species","etiological roles","better tools","difficulties","intense efforts","development of broad","human disease","amplification","regions","Abstract","strand DNA synthesis","technique","recognition","problem","current manuscript","coronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

Cancer patients represent a vulnerable population in this pandemic, with data suggesting a higher risk for severe events and unfavorable outcomes. Timely identification of COVID-19 in cancer patients has been thwarted by the lack of outpatient testing for SARS-CoV-2. Chest computed tomography (CT) plays a major role in the identification of COVID-19 pneumonia, with radiologic hallmarks including bilateral, peripheral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation. Cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT) commonly have daily cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) obtained for image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), and such imaging frequently includes the chest. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the CBCTs of an initially asymptomatic patient undergoing IGRT for breast cancer, who developed COVID-19 symptoms during the second week of RT. Lung windows of daily CBCTs were reviewed with Diagnostic Radiology to survey for changes consistent with COVID-19. Diagnostic CTs obtained at the time of recovery were obtained and compared with the CBCTs. Results Five consecutive CBCTs were retrospectively reviewed. Bilateral, peripheral GGOs were noted on the 4th and 5th CBCTs in the two days prior to symptom onset. CBCT on the day of RT resumption demonstrated substantial worsening of the GGO compared with those obtained during the asymptomatic phase. Diagnostic CTs demonstrated bilateral, peripheral GGOs and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, findings suggesting COVID-19 pneumonitis. Repeat diagnostic CT three days later showed improved pulmonary findings and the patient resumed RT without incident. Conclusion Familiarity with typical CT changes of COVID-19 pneumonitis may allow for early detection in cancer patients undergoing CBCT for RT treatment. Prompt review of the lung windows is recommended in order to identify such changes, with the hope that pre-symptomatic diagnosis leads to expedited patient management, improved outcomes, and a reduction of inadvertent COVID-19 dissemination.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Youssef, Irini; Donahue, Bernadine; Flyer, Mark; Thompson, Sharon; Huang, Alice; Gallant, Fleure","journal":"Advances in Radiation Oncology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/257f1d40341b7b4084ff94ff36594e2bfd6eb7d8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452109420301238?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2020.04.029; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2452109420301238","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RT","Diagnostic Radiology"],"locations":["United States","New York City"],"keyphrases":["Cancer patients","Introduction COVID","typical CT changes of COVID","Timely identification of COVID","reduction of inadvertent COVID","peripheral GGOs","breast cancer","Diagnostic CTs","consecutive CBCTs","Lung windows of daily CBCTs","asymptomatic patient","RT treatment","Diagnostic Radiology","improved outcomes","day of RT resumption","changes consistent","IGRT","days","pneumonitis","Chest computed tomography","expedited patient management","improved pulmonary findings","peripheral ground-glass opacities","daily cone","unfavorable outcomes","asymptomatic phase","image-guided radiotherapy","higher risk","pre-symptomatic diagnosis","mediastinal lymphadenopathy","severe events","radiologic hallmarks","New York City","data","substantial worsening","pneumonia","survey","early detection","United States","vulnerable population","Conclusion Familiarity","major role","NYC","pandemic","lack of outpatient testing","hope","week of","SARS-CoV","consolidation","Prompt review","dissemination","order","time of recovery","symptom onset","epicenter","imaging","Results","symptoms","incident","disease","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Unlike conventional mRNA cap methylation, the 2\u0027-O methylation of VSV precedes subsequent G-N-7 methylation. In this study, we found that individual alanine substitutions in two conserved aromatic residues (Y1650 and F1691) in region VI of L protein abolished both G-N-7 and 2\u0027-O methylation. However, replacement of one aromatic residue with another aromatic residue did not significantly affect the methyltransferase activities.

We estimated the percentage change in incident RA associated with ambient mean respiratory viral infections using a generalized linear model, after adjusting for time trend, air pollution, and meteorological data. RESULTS: A total of 24,117 cases of incident RA (mean age 54.7 years, 18,688 [77.5%] women) were analyzed. Ambient respiratory viral infections in the population were associated with a higher number of incident RA over time, and its effect peaked 6 or 7 weeks after exposure. Among the 8 viruses, parainfluenza virus (4.8% for 1% respiratory viral infection increase, 95% CI 1.6 to 8.1, P = .003), coronavirus (9.2%, 3.9 to 14.8, P \u003C .001), and metapneumovirus (44%, 2.0 to 103.4, P = .038) were associated with increased number of incident RA. The impact of these respiratory viral infections remained significant in women (3.8%, 12.1%, and 67.4%, respectively, P \u003C .05) and in older patients (10.7%, 14.6%, and 118.2%, respectively, P \u003C .05). CONCLUSIONS: Ambient respiratory viral infections in the population were associated with an increased number of incident RA, especially in women and older patients, suggesting that respiratory viral infections can be a novel environmental risk factor for the development of RA.

The studies of MERS patients with severe disease and experimentally infected animals showed that robust viral replication and intensive proinflammatory response in lung tissues contribute to high pathogenicity of MERS-CoV. We sought to identify pattern recognition receptor (PRR) signaling pathway(s) that mediates the inflammatory cascade in human macrophages upon MERS-CoV infection. METHODS: The potential signaling pathways were manipulated individually by pharmacological inhibition, small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) depletion, and antibody blocking. The MERS-CoV-induced proinflammatory response was evaluated by measuring the expression levels of key cytokines and/or chemokines. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay, flow cytometry analysis, and Western blotting were applied to evaluate the activation of related PRRs and engagement of adaptors. RESULTS: MERS-CoV replication significantly upregulated C-type lectin receptor (CLR) macrophage-inducible Ca(2\u002B)-dependent lectin receptor (Mincle). The role of Mincle for MERS-CoV-triggered cytokine/chemokine induction was established based on the results of antibody blockage, siRNA depletion of Mincle and its adaptor spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), and Syk pharmacological inhibition. The cytokine and/or chemokine induction was significantly attenuated by siRNA depletion of retinoic acid-inducible-I-like receptors (RLR) or adaptor, indicating that RLR signaling also contributed to MERS-CoV-induced proinflammatory response. CONCLUSIONS: The CLR and RLR pathways are activated and contribute to the proinflammatory response in MERS-CoV-infected macrophages.","publish_time":"2020-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Xiaoyu; Chu, Hin; Wong, Bosco Ho-Yin; Chiu, Man Chun; Wang, Dong; Li, Cun; Liu, Xiaojuan; Yang, Dong; Poon, Vincent Kwok-Man; Cai, Jianpiao; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Zhou, Jie; Yuen, Kwok-Yung","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/45681e44694a425fa14be346700cd8d249fc2f5a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107474.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiz483; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562757/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RLR"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV replication","MERS-CoV infection","high pathogenicity of MERS","studies of MERS patients","induced proinflammatory response","siRNA depletion of Mincle","intensive proinflammatory response","RLR pathways","siRNA depletion of retinoic acid-inducible","Human infection","human macrophages","CLR","infected macrophages","Syk pharmacological inhibition","dependent lectin receptor","role of Mincle","chemokine induction","results of antibody blockage","pattern recognition receptor","upregulated C-type lectin receptor","infected animals","triggered cytokine","antibody blocking","robust viral replication","macrophage-inducible Ca","small interfering ribonucleic acid","adaptor spleen tyrosine kinase","flow cytometry analysis","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay","lung tissues","severe disease","inflammatory cascade","Western blotting","ongoing threat","activation of related PRRs","BACKGROUND","expression levels of key cytokines","engagement of adaptors","public health","CONCLUSIONS","receptors","chemokines","METHODS","potential"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A renewal process model was devised to estimate the R(0) and ascertainment rate of cases, and loss of susceptible individuals was modeled as one minus the sum of initially immune fraction and the fraction naturally infected during the epidemic. To account for the uncertainty of initially immune fraction, we employed a Latin Hypercube sampling (LHS) method. RESULTS: R(0) ranged from 4.7 to 14.8 with the median estimate at 7.2. R(0) was positively correlated with ascertainment rates. Sensitivity analysis indicated that R(0) would become smaller with greater variance of the generation time. DISCUSSION: Estimated R(0) was broadly consistent with published estimate from endemic data, indicating that the vaccination coverage of 86% has to be satisfied to prevent the epidemic by means of mass vaccination.

Within twelve hrs after cell cultures were initiated, cytoplasmic vacuoles appeared in many of the RPTEC. The RPTEC henceforth deteriorated rapidly. Since SV40 induces the formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles, this batch of RPTEC was rejected for the SV40 study. Nevertheless, we sought the likely cause(s) of the deterioration of the RPTEC as part of our technology development efforts. METHODS: Adventitious viruses in the RPTEC were isolated and/or detected and identified by isolation in various indicator cell lines, observation of cytopathology, an immunoflurorescence assay, electron microscopy, PCR, and sequencing. RESULTS: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) was detected in some RPTEC by cytology, an immunofluorescence assay, and PCR. Human Herpesvirus 6B was detected by PCR of DNA extracted from the RPTEC, but was not isolated. Human coronavirus NL63 was isolated and identified by RT-PCR and sequencing, and its replication in a fresh batch of RPTEC and another type of primary human kidney cells was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: At least 3 different adventitious viruses were present in the batch of contaminated RPTEC. Whereas we are unable to determine whether the original RPTEC were pre-infected prior to their separation from other kidney cells, or had gotten contaminated with HCoV-NL63 from an ill laboratory worker during their preparation for commercial sale, our findings are a reminder that human-derived biologicals should always be considered as potential sources of infectious agents. Importantly, HCoV-NL63 replicates to high titers in some primary human kidney cells.","publish_time":"2013-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lednicky, John A; Waltzek, Thomas B; McGeehan, Elizabeth; Loeb, Julia C; Hamilton, Sara B; Luetke, Maya C","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e4387a9c18bca710c7fdc986a6b2f8df671e29b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3716658.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23805916/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-213","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsyOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RPTEC","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["original RPTEC","batch of contaminated RPTEC","fresh batch of RPTEC","Human Herpesvirus","type of primary human kidney cells","Human coronavirus NL63","human-derived biologicals","RT-PCR","PCR of DNA","Cryopreserved primary human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells","HCoV-NL63 replicates","sequencing","SV40 study","different adventitious viruses","formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles","immunoflurorescence assay","commercial sale","commercial supplier","cell cultures","immunofluorescence assay","various indicator cell lines","high titers","observation of cytopathology","preparation","ill laboratory worker","electron microscopy","reminder","studies of Simian virus","findings","BACKGROUND","separation","replication","isolation","potential sources of infectious agents","CONCLUSIONS","CMV","deterioration","cytology","METHODS","technology development efforts","likely cause","RESULTS","Cytomegalovirus","hrs"],"language":"en"},

It is now apparent that M\u03A6 display remarkable plasticity in response to environmental signals to polarize into classically activated M(LPS \u002B IFN-\u03B3) or alternatively activated M(IL-4). However, little is known about how M\u03A6 activation status influences their antigen presentation function to CD8(\u002B) T cell in models of virus infection.

However, as with gene therapy, a major barrier to progress is the lack of methods to achieve and measure efficient delivery for systemic administration. We have developed a positive-readout pharmacodynamic transgenic reporter mouse model allowing noninvasive real-time assessment of siRNA activity. The model combines a luciferase reporter gene under the control of regulatory elements from the lac operon of Escherichia coli. Introduction of siRNA targeting lac repressor results in increased luciferase expression in cells where siRNA is biologically active. Five founder luciferase-expressing and three founder Lac-expressing lines were generated and characterized. Mating of ubiquitously expressing luciferase and lac lines generated progeny in which luciferase expression was significantly reduced compared with the parental line. Administration of isopropyl \u03B2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside either in drinking water or given intraperitoneally increased luciferase expression in eight of the mice examined, which fell rapidly when withdrawn. Intraperitoneal administration of siRNA targeting lac in combination with Lipofectamine 2000 resulted in increased luciferase expression in the liver while control nontargeting siRNA had no effect.

Unlike SARS-CoV that resolved within a year, continued introductions of MERS-CoV present an on-going public health threat. Animal models are needed to evaluate countermeasures against emerging viruses. With SARS-CoV, several animal species were permissive to infection.

An extremely high potential for dissemination resulted in the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020. Despite the worsening trends of COVID-19, no drugs are validated to have significant efficacy in clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients in large-scale studies. Remdesivir is considered the most promising antiviral agent; it works by inhibiting the activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). A large-scale study investigating the clinical efficacy of remdesivir (200 mg on day 1, followed by 100 mg once daily) is on-going. The other excellent anti-influenza RdRp inhibitor favipiravir is also being clinically evaluated for its efficacy in COVID-19 patients. The protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) alone is not shown to provide better antiviral efficacy than standard care. However, the regimen of LPV/RTV plus ribavirin was shown to be effective against SARS-CoV in vitro. Another promising alternative is hydroxychloroquine (200 mg thrice daily) plus azithromycin (500 mg on day 1, followed by 250 mg once daily on day 2\u20135), which showed excellent clinical efficacy on Chinese COVID-19 patients and anti-SARS-CoV-2 potency in vitro.

Avoiding the prescription of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin II type I receptor blockers is advised for COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jean, Shio-Shin; Lee, Ping-Ing; Hsueh, Po-Ren","journal":"J Microbiol Immunol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/96f1671ea74afd2b577fc95195c16f21f7df3782.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f499f11dbb357468962a170977bd580ef7d411bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129535.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1684118220300943?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.034; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1684118220300943; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32307245/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjszMzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Remdesivir"],"organizations":["LPV/RTV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["patients","clinical treatment of COVID","Chinese COVID","excellent clinical efficacy","anti-SARS-CoV","clinical efficacy of remdesivir","treatment of SARS","significant efficacy","day","better antiviral efficacy","worsening trends of COVID","angiotensin","RTV","excellent anti-influenza RdRp inhibitor favipiravir","promising antiviral agent","activity of RNA","regimen of LPV","large-scale study","large-scale studies","promising alternative","dependent RNA polymerase","global coronavirus disease","protease inhibitor lopinavir","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","prescription of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs","enzyme inhibitors","cytoplasm","dissemination","type","ritonavir","polyclonal antibodies","viral genome exposure","ribavirin","standard care","receptor blockers","outbreak","potency","high potential","roles of teicoplanin","hydroxychloroquine","Wuhan","China","azithromycin","investigation","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

A previous one-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) assay for detecting A/H1N1pdm virus (H1pdm rRT-PCR assay) was improved since the former probe had a low melting temperature and low tolerance to viral mutation. To help with the screening of the A/H1N1pdm virus, rRT-PCR assays were also developed for detecting human seasonal A/H1N1 (H1 rRT-PCR assay) and A/H3N2 influenza viruses (H3 rRT-PCR assay). H1pdm, H1, and H3 rRT-PCR assays were evaluated using in vitro-transcribed control RNA, isolated viruses, and other respiratory pathogenic viruses, and were shown to have high sensitivity, good linearity (R(2) = 0.99), and high specificity. In addition, the improved H1pdm rRT-PCR assay could detect two viral strains of A/H1N1pdm, namely, A/Aichi/472/2009 (H1N1)pdm and A/Sakai/89/2009 (H1N1)pdm, which have mutation(s) in the probe-binding region of the hemagglutinin gene, without loss of sensitivity. Using the three rRT-PCR assays developed, 90 clinical specimens collected between May and October 2009 were then tested. Of these, 26, 20, and 2 samples were identified as positive for A/H1pdm, A/H3, and A/H1, respectively, while 42 samples were negative for influenza A viruses. The present results suggest that these highly sensitive and specific H1pdm, H1, and H3 rRT-PCR assays are useful not only for diagnosing influenza viruses, but also for the surveillance of influenza viruses.","publish_time":"2010-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nakauchi, Mina; Yasui, Yoshihiro; Miyoshi, Tatsuya; Minagawa, Hiroko; Tanaka, Tomoyuki; Tashiro, Masato; Kageyama, Tsutomu","journal":"J Virol Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f4b1bd9d8e1b2338551f561d7c3a8a2583380b84.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173154.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093410003897; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093410003897; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2010.10.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21029748/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjszNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H1 rRT-PCR assay","H3 rRT-PCR assays","improved H1pdm rRT-PCR assay","H3N2 influenza viruses","diagnosing influenza viruses","surveillance of influenza viruses","isolated viruses","H1N1pdm virus","specific H1pdm","Pandemic influenza","respiratory pathogenic viruses","previous one-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR","viral mutation","high sensitivity","samples","low tolerance","viral strains","loss of sensitivity","high specificity","low melting temperature","probe-binding region","hemagglutinin gene","transcribed control RNA","good linearity","Sakai","significant outbreaks","Aichi","clinical specimens","addition","present results","screening"],"language":"en"},

This study is an attempt to quantify acute and chronic toxicants including PAH and PCDD/F in conditions relating to unwanted fires. This paper investigates distribution patterns of fire effluents between gas and aerosol phase, and the different particle size-ranges produced under different fire conditions. PVC carpet was selected as the fuel as a precursor for both PAH and PCDD/F. In order to generate fire effluents under controlled fire conditions, the steady-state tube furnace, was chosen as the physical fire model. Fire scenarios included oxidative pyrolysis, well-ventilated and under-ventilated fires. Fire effluent measurements included: carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen chloride, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated dibenzo-dioxins and furans and soot. The distribution patterns between gas and particle phase, and the size-ranges of the particles produced in these fires together with their chemical composition is also reported. Significant quantities of respirable submicron particles were detected, together with a range of PAHs. Lower levels of halogenated dioxins were detected in the fire residue compared with those found in other studies. Nevertheless, the findings do have implications for the health and safety of fire and rescue personnel, fire investigators, and other individuals exposed to the residue from unwanted fires.","publish_time":"2013-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stec, A.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all hospitalized children with 2009 influenza A (H1N1) and 2008\u201309 seasonal influenza at The Children\u0027s Hospital, Denver, Colorado. RESULTS: Of the 307 children identified with 2009 H1N1 infections, the median age was 6 years, 61% were male, and 66% had underlying medical conditions. Eighty children (26%) were admitted to the ICU. Thirty-two (40%) of the ICU patients required intubation and 17 (53%) of the intubated patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Four patients required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Eight (3%) of the hospitalized children died. Admission to the ICU was significantly associated with older age and underlying neurological condition. Compared to the 90 children admitted during the 2008\u201309 season, children admitted with 2009 H1N1 influenza were significantly older, had a shorter length of hospitalization, more use of antivirals, and a higher incidence of ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the 2008\u201309 season, hospitalized children with 2009 H1N1 influenza were much older and had more severe respiratory disease. Among children hospitalized with 2009 H1N1 influenza, risk factors for admission to the ICU included older age and having an underlying neurological condition.

Moreover, DpTV Hel also contains NTPase activity. The ATPase activity of DpTV Hel could be significantly stimulated by dsRNA, and dsRNA could partially rescue the ATPase activity abolishment caused by mutations.

The clinical manifestations vary depending on the incubation period of the virus as well as the immunity of the patients. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is prevalent in Malaysia where the incidence is 3.2%. It has been noted that some G6PD-deficient individuals suffer from more severe clinical presentation of dengue infection. In this study, we aim to investigate the oxidative responses of DENV2-infected monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals. METHODOLOGY: Monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals were infected with DENV2 and infection rate, levels of oxidative species, nitric oxide (NO), superoxide anions (O(2) (\u2212)), and oxidative stress were determined and compared with normal controls. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals exhibited significantly higher infection rates compared to normal controls. In an effort to explain the reason for this enhanced susceptibility, we investigated the production of NO and O(2) (\u2212) in the monocytes of individuals with G6PD deficiency compared with normal controls. We found that levels of NO and O(2) (\u2212) were significantly lower in the DENV-infected monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals compared with normal controls. Furthermore, the overall oxidative stress in DENV-infected monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals was significantly higher when compared to normal controls. Correlation studies between DENV-infected cells and oxidative state of monocytes further confirmed these findings. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Altered redox state of DENV-infected monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals appears to augment viral replication in these cells. DENV-infected G6PD-deficient individuals may contain higher viral titers, which may be significant in enhanced virus transmission. Furthermore, granulocyte dysfunction and higher viral loads in G6PD-deificient individuals may result in severe form of dengue infection.","publish_time":"2014-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-alimi, Abdullah Ahmed; Ali, Syed A.; Al-Hassan, Faisal Muti; Idris, Fauziah Mohd; Teow, Sin-Yeang; Mohd Yusoff, Narazah","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f6b1645fdc27b32ae9fdb4f99dbbb30eb1dfd7f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3953068.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0002711; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24625456/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs0ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Malaysia"],"keyphrases":["monocytes of individuals","DENV-infected G6PD-deficient individuals","G6PD-deificient individuals","DENV-infected monocytes","G6PD deficiency","oxidative state of monocytes","normal controls","DENV-infected cells","higher infection rates","Dengue virus","higher viral loads","redox state of DENV","higher viral titers","levels of oxidative species","oxidative responses of DENV2","overall oxidative stress","severe form of dengue infection","severe clinical presentation of dengue infection","viral replication","enhanced virus transmission","peninsular Malaysia","clinical manifestations","enhanced susceptibility","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","nitric oxide","phosphate dehydrogenase","granulocyte dysfunction","SIGNIFICANCE","Correlation studies","superoxide anions","incubation period","reason","CONCLUSIONS","production","BACKGROUND","METHODOLOGY","Glucose","incidence","immunity","patients","effort","study"],"language":"en"},

Detection and quantification of airborne viruses is essential in order to provide information regarding public health risk assessment. FINDINGS: In this study, an optimized new, simple, low cost method for sampling of airborne viruses using Low Melting Agarose (LMA) plates and a conventional microbial air sampling device has been developed. The use of LMA plates permits the direct nucleic acids extraction of the captured viruses without the need of any preliminary elution step. Molecular detection and quantification of airborne viruses is performed using real-time quantitative (RT-)PCR (Q(RT-)PCR) technique. The method has been tested using Adenoviruses (AdVs) and Noroviruses (NoVs) GII, as representative DNA and RNA viruses, respectively. Moreover, the method has been tested successfully in outdoor experiments, by detecting and quantifying human adenoviruses (HAdVs) in the airborne environment of a wastewater treatment plant. CONCLUSIONS: The great advantage of LMA is that nucleic acids extraction is performed directly on the LMA plates, while the eluted nucleic acids are totally free of inhibitory substances. Coupled with QPCR the whole procedure can be completed in less than three (3) hours.","publish_time":"2011-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ziros, Panos G; Kokkinos, Petros A; Legaki, Euaggelia; Vantarakis, Apostolos","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f62a6a8b129d2104c5db1535b07e090ddf5ca7d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3199808.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21794150/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs1MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LMA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sampling of airborne viruses","quantification of airborne viruses","captured viruses","RNA viruses","airborne environment","use of LMA plates","eluted nucleic acids","direct nucleic acids extraction","great advantage of LMA","low cost method","RT","public health risk assessment","major public health issues","Molecular detection","human adenoviruses","Low Melting Agarose","conventional microbial air sampling device","information","order","NoVs","GII","need","representative DNA","study","Noroviruses","wastewater treatment plant","free of inhibitory substances","HAdVs","preliminary elution step","CONCLUSIONS","outdoor experiments","technique","BACKGROUND","QPCR","procedure","FINDINGS","hours"],"language":"en"},

The 2009 H1N1/2009pdm \u2018swine flu\u2019 pandemic reinforced the need for innovation in pandemic vaccine design. We report on insights gained during rapid development of a pandemic vaccine based on recombinant haemagglutinin (rHA) formulated with Advax\u2122 delta inulin adjuvant (Panblok-H1/Advax). Panblok-H1/Advax was designed and manufactured within 1 month of the pandemic declaration by WHO and successfully entered human clinical testing in under 3 months from first isolation and sequencing of the novel pandemic virus, requiring several major challenges to be overcome. Panblok-H1/Advax successfully induced neutralising antibodies against the pandemic strain, but also induced cross-neutralising antibodies in a subset of subjects against an H1N1 strain (A/Puerto Rico/8/34) derived from the 1918 Spanish flu, highlighting the possibility to use Advax to induce more broadly cross-protective antibody responses. Interestingly, the rHA from H1N1/2009pdm exhibited variants in the receptor binding domain that had a major impact on receptor binding and hemagglutination ability. We used an in silico structural modeling approach to better understand the unusual behavior of the novel hemagglutinin, thereby demonstrating the power of computational modeling approaches for rapid characterization of new pandemic viruses. While challenges remain in ensuring ultrafast vaccine access for the entire population in response to future pandemics, the adjuvanted recombinant Panblok-H1/Advax vaccine proved its utility during a real-life pandemic situation.","publish_time":"2017-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Honda-Okubo, Yoshikazu; Rajapaksha, Harinda; Sajkov, Dimitar; Gordon, David; Cox, Manon M.

As many of us know, emergency departments (EDs) are being overwhelmed by untenable patient volumes and care requirements. As my prior article titled \u201CA Brewing Storm: Our Overwhelmed Emergency Departments\u201D noted, this problem has been well known for many years and, yet, generally ignored by the lay press and public [1]. In 2006, fourteen years ago, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) warned of this in a report titled \u201CHospital-Based Emergency Care: At the Breaking Point.\u201D In that report, the IOM noted that EDs were already overwhelmed and that our patient visits per year were significantly increasing [2]. The report stated that patient visits from 1993 to 2003 had grown from 90.3 million per year to 113.9 million per year [2]. Also, the number of EDs had actually decreased and the patients being seen were reportedly sicker [2]. Disaster preparedness was a significant concern and the report noted that most city hospitals were operating at or near capacity and even a multiple car crash would create havoc in most of these EDs [2]. In the years since that report, our volumes have continued to climb. In 2017, a National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care survey reported ED patient visits reached over 138 million in that year [3]. That was a 21% increase from 113.9 million visits in 2003 and an average annual growth of 1.7% per year. That number represents 42.8% of the entire U.S. population of 329 million [4]. These high volumes and the resulting crowding in the ED do and continue to compromise care. Of note, prior studies have shown that ED crowding is linked to increased patient mortality, decreased patient satisfaction and treatment delays [[5], [6], [7]]. In addition to the daily crowding issues, U.S. disaster preparedness is currently in poor condition. The ED is the frontline medical response to any disaster and, yet, it is already stretched to its limit. Currently, one of the federal government\u0027s strategies to deal with a potentially overwhelming catastrophic disaster that outstrips resources is to engage in \u201Ccrisis standards of care\u201D [8,9]. That is, if overwhelmed, the federal government has advised states to create guidelines for hospitals to allocate scarce resources to save the greatest number of lives [8,9]. Such strategies are to be utilized in only the most dire of situations (e.g., severe pandemic, catastrophic event) in which medical resources are completely outstripped. Our current problem with ED volumes predisposes the system to cross this threshold during a disaster.[truncated]","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mareiniss, Darren P.","journal":"Am J Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/abc479c66b566efe1ef6d444363dc168d521fa4f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102611.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.03.033; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675720301753; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32253132/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675720301753","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs1NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["IOM","National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care"],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["ED patient visits","report","ED volumes","ED crowding","untenable patient volumes","patient satisfaction","care requirements","Disaster preparedness","number of EDs","Overwhelmed Emergency Departments","Hospital-Based Emergency Care","medical resources","crisis standards of care","years","increased patient mortality","overwhelming catastrophic disaster","National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care survey","high volumes","resulting crowding","scarce resources","national crisis","IOM","daily crowding issues","frontline medical response","greatest number of lives","federal government\u0027s strategies","catastrophic event","prior studies","prior article","city hospitals","current problem","Brewing Storm","guidelines","severe pandemic","multiple car crash","capacity","havoc","states","system","significant concern","treatment delays","Breaking Point","average annual growth","addition","threshold","Institute of Medicine","poor condition","dire of situations","lay press","note","patients","population","limit"],"language":"en"},

Global public interest in this new issue largely reflects people\u2019s attention to COVID-19 and their willingness to take precautionary actions. This study aimed to examine global public awareness of COVID-19 using Google Trends. METHODS: Using Google Trends, we retrieved public query data for terms of \u201C2019-nCoV \u002B SARS-CoV-2 \u002B novel coronavirus \u002B new coronavirus \u002B COVID-19 \u002B Corona Virus Disease 2019\u201D between the 31(st) December 2019 and the 24(th) February 2020 in six major English-speaking countries, including the USA, the UK, Canada, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. Dynamic series analysis demonstrates the overall change trend of relative search volume (RSV) for the topic on COVID-19. We compared the top-ranking related queries and sub-regions distribution of RSV about COVID-19 across different countries. The correlation between daily search volumes on the topic related to COVID-19 and the daily number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed. RESULTS: The overall search trend of RSV regarding COVID-19 increased during the early period of observing time and reached the first apex on 31(st) January 2020. A shorter response time and a longer duration of public attention to COVID-19 was observed in public from the USA, the UK, Australia, and Canada, than that in Ireland and New Zealand. A slightly positive correlation between daily RSV about COVID-19 and the daily number of confirmed cases was observed (P \u003C 0.05). People across countries presented a various interest to the RSV on COVID-19, and public awareness of COVID-19 was different in various sub-regions within countries. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that public response time to COVID-19 was different across countries, and the overall duration of public attention was short. The current study reminds us that governments should strengthen the publicity of COVID-19 nationally, strengthen the public\u0027s vigilance and sensitivity to COVID-19, inform public the importance of protecting themselves with enough precautionary measures, and finally control the spread of COVID-19 globally.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Dingtao; Lou, Xiaoqi; Xu, Zhiwei; Meng, Nana; Xie, Qiaomei; Zhang, Man; Zou, Yanfeng; Liu, Jiatao; Sun, Guoping; Wang, Fang","journal":"Journal of global health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db14bb2c2188bf1280b478aee68448214ca6f3c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7182392.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.10.011003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32373339/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs1NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google","UK","RSV"],"locations":["Canada","Ireland","Australia","New Zealand"],"keyphrases":["spread of COVID","publicity of COVID","global public awareness of COVID","public response time","overall duration of public attention","daily RSV","longer duration of public attention","public query data","different countries","new coronavirus","overall search trend of RSV","daily number of people","New Zealand","daily search volumes","sub-regions distribution of RSV","new issue","major English-speaking countries","various sub-regions","novel coronavirus","shorter response time","outbreak of coronavirus disease","Australia","daily number of confirmed cases","USA","Ireland","UK","people\u2019s attention","Chinese people","Canada","Google Trends","RESULTS","topic","SARS-CoV","overall change trend of relative search volume","positive correlation","current study","precautionary measures","precautionary actions","top-ranking related queries","Corona Virus Disease","Dynamic series analysis","health","well-being","terms","governments","nCoV","BACKGROUND","public\u0027s vigilance","sensitivity","stress","willingness","early period","METHODS","importance","CONCLUSIONS","apex"],"language":"en"},

Here, we report an outbreak of FRI caused by HadV\u201014p1 that occurred in 2011 at a primary and middle school in China. DESIGN: The basic information of the outbreak was recored; throat swabs were collected from 17 patients, polymerase chain reaction, A549 cell culture, and sequencing were used to identify the pathogen of the outbreak.. RESULTS: Total of 43 students were infected in this outbreak. Boys were more than girls. We identified 11 HAdV\u2010positive specimens and 6 HAdV isolates. Genetic analysis showed that the complete hexon, fiber, and E1A sequences of isolates were nearly 100% identical with other HAdV\u201014p1 sequences deposited in GenBank. CONCLUSIONS: HadV\u201014p1 has caused outbreaks of pneumonia and mortality among adults in the United States and Europe.

METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the clinical, laboratory characteristics and CT imaging of confirmed cases of COVID-19 from January 22 to February 28, 2020 in Huanggang Central Hospital and The Second Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University. Real time PCR was used to detect the new coronavirus in respiratory samples. Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the expressions of ACE2 in tissues. RESULTS: Among the 194 patients infected with COVID-19, 108 patients were male, with a median age of 48.3 years. The average preclinical period was 7.44 day. Except for 37 severe or critically ill patients, the rest of the 157 patients exhibited mild or moderate symptoms. 190 (97.94%) patients were confirmed during the three times nucleic acid test. The main clinical symptom of the patients were fever, sore throat and cough, which accounted for 146 cases (75.26%), 98 (50.52%) and 86 cases (44.33%), respectively. 30 patients (15.46%) showed liver dysfunction. Imaging examination showed that 141 patients (72.68%) showed abnormal density shadow, while 53 cases (27.32%) had no obvious abnormality in the parenchyma of both lungs. Up to now, 109 cases have been discharged from the hospital, and 9 patients died. The ACE2 expression levels were up-regulated in patients of severe type and critically ill type. CONCLUSION: Clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and CT imaging should be combined for comprehensive analysis to diagnose COVID-19. ACE2 may be the receptor of COVID-19.

Although previous studies have reported that the gut microbiota is changed in calves during diarrhea, less is known about whether rotavirus infection alters the structure of the gut microbiota. Here, we characterized fecal microbial communities and identified possible relationships between the gut microbiota profiles and physiological parameters. Five fecal specimens of rotavirus-infected calves from 1 to 30 days after birth and five fecal specimens of age-matched healthy calves were used for the microbial community analysis using the Illumina MiSeq sequencer. Rotavirus infection was associated with reduced rotavirus infection significantly reduced the richness and diversity of the bacterial community. Weighted unique fraction metric analysis exhibited significant differences in community membership and structure between healthy and rotavirus-infected calves. Based on relative abundance analysis and linear discriminant analysis effect size, we found that the representative genera from Lactobacillus, Subdoligranulum, Blautia, and Bacteroides were closely related to healthy calves, while the genera Escherichia and Clostridium were closely affiliated to rotavirus-infected calves. Furthermore, canonical correlation analysis and Pearson correlation coefficient results revealed that the increased relative abundances of Lactobacillus, Subdoligranulum, and Bacteroides were correlated with normal levels of physiological characteristics such as white blood cells, blood urea nitrogen, serum amyloid protein A, and glucose concentration in serum. These results suggest that rotavirus infection alters the structure of the gut microbiota, correlating changes in physiological parameters.

We utilized a time course of matched virologic, pathological, and transcriptomic data within a novel methodological framework that can detect pathway enrichment among key highly connected network genes. This unbiased approach produced a high-priority list of 4 genes in one pathway out of over 3,500 genes that were differentially expressed following SARS-CoV infection. With these data, we predicted that the urokinase and other wound repair pathways would regulate lethal versus sublethal disease following SARS-CoV infection in mice. We validated the importance of the urokinase pathway for SARS-CoV disease severity using genetically defined knockout mice, proteomic correlates of pathway activation, and pathological disease severity. The results of these studies demonstrate that a fine balance exists between host coagulation and fibrinolysin pathways regulating pathological disease outcomes, including diffuse alveolar damage and acute lung injury, following infection with highly pathogenic respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV.","publish_time":"2013-08-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gralinski, Lisa E.; Bankhead, Armand; Jeng, Sophia; Menachery, Vineet D.; Proll, Sean; Belisle, Sarah E.; Matzke, Melissa; Webb-Robertson, Bobbie-Jo M.; Luna, Maria L.; Shukla, Anil K.; Ferris, Martin T.; Bolles, Meagan; Chang, Jean; Aicher, Lauri; Waters, Katrina M.; Smith, Richard D.; Metz, Thomas O.; Law, G.

While the mechanisms underlying this ability to avoid sickness are not known, deep sequencing studies of bat genomes have uncovered genetic adaptations that may have functional importance in the antiviral response of these animals. Egyptian rousette bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) are the natural reservoir hosts of Marburg virus (MARV). In contrast to humans, these bats do not become sick when infected with MARV. A striking difference to the human genome is that Egyptian rousettes have an expanded repertoire of IFNW genes. To probe the biological implications of this expansion, we synthesized IFN-\u03C94 and IFN-\u03C99 proteins and tested their antiviral activity in Egyptian rousette cells. Both IFN-\u03C94 and IFN-\u03C99 showed antiviral activity against RNA viruses, including MARV, with IFN-\u03C99 being more efficient than IFN-\u03C94. Using RNA-Seq, we examined the transcriptional response induced by each protein. Although the sets of genes induced by the two IFNs were largely overlapping, IFN-\u03C99 induced a more rapid and intense response than did IFN-\u03C94. About 13% of genes induced by IFN-\u03C9 treatment are not found in the Interferome or other ISG databases, indicating that they may be uniquely IFN-responsive in this bat.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pavlovich, Stephanie S.; Darling, Tamarand; Hume, Adam J.; Davey, Robert A.; Feng, Feng; M\u00FChlberger, Elke; Kepler, Thomas B.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5cb8def62783407ecedc5bd589244b0efcb0bc22.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7083018.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32231668/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs2OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFNW","ISG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN-\u03C94","IFN-responsive","IFN-\u03C99 proteins","IFN-\u03C9 treatment","antiviral response","MARV","Egyptian rousette bats","antiviral activity","Egyptian rousettes","Egyptian rousette cells","RNA viruses","humans","intense response","transcriptional response","sets of genes","number of viruses","severe disease","expanded repertoire of IFNW genes","RNA-Seq","overt symptoms of disease","deep sequencing studies of bat genomes","Rousettus aegyptiacus","natural reservoir hosts of Marburg virus","genetic adaptations","human genome","functional importance","sickness","expansion","Interferome","striking difference","ISG databases","mechanisms","ability","biological implications","contrast","animals","IFNs"],"language":"en"},

Canada in general has a well developed public health system and low burden of health which will moderate vulnerability. However, there is significant heterogeneity in health outcomes, and health inequality is particularly pronounced among Aboriginal Canadians. Intervention is needed to prevent, prepare for, and manage climate change effects on Aboriginal health but is constrained by a limited understanding of vulnerability and its determinants. Despite limited research on climate change and Aboriginal health, however, there is a well established literature on Aboriginal health outcomes, determinants, and trends in Canada; characteristics that will determine vulnerability to climate change. In this paper we systematically review this literature, using a vulnerability framework to identify the broad level factors constraining adaptive capacity and increasing sensitivity to climate change. Determinants identified include: poverty, technological capacity constraints, socio-political values and inequality, institutional capacity challenges, and information deficit. The magnitude and nature of these determinants will be distributed unevenly within and between Aboriginal populations necessitating place-based and regional level studies to examine how these broad factors will affect vulnerability at lower levels. The study also supports the need for collaboration across all sectors and levels of government, open and meaningful dialogue between policy makers, scientists, health professionals, and Aboriginal communities, and capacity building at a local level, to plan for climate change. Ultimately, however, efforts to reduce the vulnerability of Aboriginal Canadians to climate change and intervene to prevent, reduce, and manage climate-sensitive health outcomes, will fail unless the broader determinants of socio-economic and health inequality are addressed.","publish_time":"2010-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ford, James D.; Berrang-Ford, Lea; King, Malcolm; Furgal, Chris","journal":"Global Environmental Change","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/afafca911d965fec89b3df5c3cad00011a48c688.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125589.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288342/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959378010000439; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2010.05.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378010000439","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["health inequality","Aboriginal health outcomes","health professionals","climate-sensitive health outcomes","climate change effects","Abstract Climate change","vulnerability of Aboriginal Canadians","low burden of health","biggest health threat","Aboriginal communities","Aboriginal populations","developed public health system","vulnerability framework","moderate vulnerability","limited understanding of vulnerability","adaptive capacity","capacity building","broad level factors","broader determinants of socio-economic","institutional capacity challenges","technological capacity constraints","broad factors","local level","Canada","regional level studies","levels of government","limited research","lower levels","established literature","socio-political values","policy makers","scientists","meaningful dialogue","sectors","place","poverty","trends","sensitivity","collaboration","information deficit","general","characteristics","significant heterogeneity","need","century","study","magnitude","nature","efforts","paper","Intervention"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we explored the anti-HSV effects and mechanisms of myricetin both in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that myricetin possessed anti-HSV-1 and HSV-2 activities with very low toxicity, superior to the effects of acyclovir. Myricetin may block HSV infection through direct interaction with virus gD protein to interfere with virus adsorption and membrane fusion, which was different from the nucleoside analogues such as acyclovir. Myricetin also down-regulate the cellular EGFR/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to further inhibit HSV infection and its subsequent replication. Most importantly, intraperitoneal therapy of myricetin markedly improved mice survival and reduced virus titers in both lungs and spinal cord. Therefore, the natural dietary flavonoid myricetin has potential to be developed into a novel anti-HSV agent targeting both virus gD protein and cellular EGFR/PI3K/Akt pathway.","publish_time":"2020-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Wenmiao; Xu, Cuijing; Hao, Cui; Zhang, Yang; Wang, Zhaoqi; Wang, Shuyao; Wang, Wei","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/444fd0906cab86bd61242d2042554f629f3949d6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111628.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32165083/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354219305674; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104714; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354219305674","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSV","EGFR/PI3K/Akt"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-HSV effects","HSV infection","Abstract Myricetin","mechanisms of myricetin","novel anti-HSV agent","intraperitoneal therapy of myricetin","natural dietary flavonoid myricetin","virus gD protein","virus adsorption","anti-oxidant","effects of acyclovir","reduced virus titers","cellular EGFR","PI3K","Akt pathway","antiviral effects","different biological activities","common dietary flavonoid","improved mice survival","direct interaction","lungs","potential","anti-inflammatory","low toxicity","membrane fusion","spinal cord","nucleoside analogues","subsequent replication","results","study"],"language":"en"},

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common consequence of major disasters. Exceptional epidemic situations also promoted PTSD in the past. Considering that humanity is undergoing the most severe pandemic since Spanish Influenza, the actual pandemic of COVID-19 is very likely to promote PTSD. Moreover, COVID-19 was renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2). With a poor understanding of viruses and spreading mechanisms, the evocation of SARS is generating a great anxiety contributing to promote PTSD. Quarantine of infected patients evolved to quarantine of \u2018infected\u2019 towns or popular districts, and then of entire countries. In the families of cases, the brutal death of family members involved a spread of fear and a loss of certainty, promoting PTSD. In the context of disaster medicine with a lack of human and technical resources, healthcare workers could also develop acute stress disorders, potentially degenerating into chronic PTSD. Globally, WHO estimates 30\u201350% of the population affected by a disaster suffered from diverse psychological distress. PTSD individuals are more at-risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and deaths by suicide \u2013 considering that healthcare workers are already at-risk occupations. We draw attention towards PTSD as a secondary effect of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, both for general population, patients, and healthcare workers. Healthcare policies need to take into account preventive strategy of PTSD, and the related risk of suicide, in forthcoming months.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dutheil, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric; Mondillon, Laurie; Navel, Valentin","journal":"Psychological medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/06d3bc169ac58a7b92aea55eb9275b876fc47332.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7198460.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32326997/; https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291720001336","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs4MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","Healthcare"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PTSD individuals","chronic PTSD","healthcare workers","account preventive strategy of PTSD","severe pandemic","SARS-Cov","Healthcare policies","actual pandemic of COVID","suicide attempt","evocation of SARS","Quarantine of infected patients","families of cases","related risk of suicide","acute stress disorders","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","coronavirus disease","at-risk occupations","spread of fear","general population","thousands of deaths","at-risk of suicidal ideation","context of disaster medicine","Post-traumatic stress disorder","lack of human","brutal death of family members","Spanish Influenza","mechanisms","technical resources","secondary effect","popular districts","towns","common consequence of major disasters","forthcoming months","loss of certainty","poor understanding of viruses","great anxiety","Exceptional epidemic situations","diverse psychological distress","attention","entire countries","humanity","past","world"],"language":"en"},

The web-based software SVMProt (http://jing.cz3.nus.edu.sg/cgi-bin/svmprot.cgi) to some extent assigns protein functional family irrespective of sequence similarity and has been found to be useful for studying distantly related proteins [Cai, C.Z., Han, L.Y., Ji, Z.L., Chen, X., Chen, Y.Z., 2003.

Here 25 novel viral proteins are selected to test the capability of SVMProt for functional family assignment of viral proteins whose function cannot be confidently predicted on by sequence similarity methods at present. These proteins are without a sequence homolog in the Swissprot database, with its precise function provided in the literature, and not included in the training sets of SVMProt. The predicted functional classes of 72% of these proteins match the literature-described function, which is compared to the overall accuracy of 87% for SVMProt functional class assignment of 34582 proteins.

METHODS: Keyword searches were performed in Weibo data collected by The University of Hong Kong\u2019s Weiboscope project. Baseline values were determined for each keyword and reaction values per million posts in the days after outbreak information was released to the public. RESULTS: The results show that the Chinese people reacted significantly to both outbreaks online, where their social media reaction was two orders of magnitude stronger to the H7N9 influenza outbreak that happened in China than the MERS-CoV outbreak that was far away from China. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that social media could be a useful measure of public awareness and reaction to disease outbreak information released by health authorities.","publish_time":"2013-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fung, Isaac Chun-Hai; Fu, King-Wa; Ying, Yuchen; Schaible, Braydon; Hao, Yi; Chan, Chung-Hong; Tse, Zion Tsz-Ho","journal":"Infect Dis Poverty","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d215fd9c30298cb374b6c9cbec60269c91255fcf.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4c7cbcc5bec46c8c956a8f05adab670eb353cc30.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3878123.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/2049-9957-2-31; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24359669/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs4OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google","The University of Hong Kong"],"locations":["Middle East","China"],"keyphrases":["Weibo data","China","H7N9 influenza outbreak","MERS-CoV outbreak","disease outbreak information","social media reaction","online data","RESULTS","social media use","reaction values","outbreak of human infection of avian influenza","wealth of public opinion data","Google query data","posts","useful measure of public awareness","activity levels of influenza","different outbreaks","Twitter trends","Keyword searches","Baseline values","Chinese people\u2019s reactions","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","orders of magnitude stronger","popular microblogging site","epidemiologists","University of Hong Kong\u2019s Weiboscope project","health authorities","internet","days","study","infectious diseases","BACKGROUND","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Because TPCs have recently emerged as novel host factors for Ebola virus entry, we reasoned that Ebola virus entry inhibitors may exert their effects through inhibition of TPCs. Cross-referencing hits from the TPC virtual screen with two recent high throughput anti-Ebola screens yielded approved drugs targeting dopamine and estrogen receptors as common hits. These compounds inhibited endogenous NAADP-evoked Ca2\u002B release from sea urchin egg homogenates, NAADP-mediated channel activity of TPC2 re-routed to the plasma membrane, and PI(3,5)P2-mediated channel activity of TPC2 expressed in enlarged lysosomes. Mechanistically, single channel analyses showed that the drugs reduced mean open time consistent with a direct action on the pore. Functionally, drug potency in blocking TPC2 activity correlated with inhibition of Ebola virus-like particle entry. Our results expand TPC pharmacology through the identification of approved drugs as novel blockers, support a role for TPCs in Ebola virus entry, and provide insight into the mechanisms underlying channel regulation.

RT-PCR followed by internal probe hybridisation or Southern blotting, or nested PCRs are currently the most sensitive methods for their identification. However, none of the published techniques can differentiate satisfactorily rhinoviruses from other picornaviruses. Examination of the restriction maps of sequenced rhinoviruses, revealed a highly conserved BglI restriction site (GCCnnnnnGGC), located exactly in the middle of the 380-bp amplicon generated with the OL26\u2013OL27 primer pair, which has been used extensively in the past to identify picornaviruses. Such a site was either not present, or positioned differently in other picornaviruses of known sequence. It was, therefore, considered that digestion of rhinovirus amplicons with this enzyme would result in two equal length fragments, generating a single 190-bp band in gel electrophoresis. In contrast, either one undigested 380-bp band or a double-band pattern would appear in amplicons from other picornaviruses. To test this hypothesis, Bgl digestions of OL26\u2013OL27 amplicons from cultured and wild-type rhinoviruses, whose identity was confirmed by acid lability, as well as from echo, polio and coxsackie viruses were carried out. All rhinovirus samples were digested successfully generating single bands. Among the other picornaviruses, only 6.6% presented a single band pattern, while the rest were as predicted from the model. With a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity over 90%, the method described, which is rapid and remarkably easy to perform, can be used to distinguish rhinoviruses from other picornaviruses to a considerable extent.","publish_time":"1999-07-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Papadopoulos, N.G.; Hunter, J.; Sanderson, G.; Meyer, J.; Johnston, S.L.","journal":"J Virol Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a4680d5422c0ce9ae5d8e189fc2b2408d371a408.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172259.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093499000452; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093499000452","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs5MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bp band","single band pattern","satisfactorily rhinoviruses","picornaviruses of known sequence","OL27 amplicons","wild-type rhinoviruses","double-band pattern","restriction maps of sequenced rhinoviruses","bp amplicon","single bands","digestion of rhinovirus amplicons","conserved BglI restriction site","rhinovirus samples","Bgl digestions of OL26","OL27 primer pair","internal probe hybridisation","Southern blotting","nested PCRs","identity","enzyme","echo","GCCnnnnnGGC","main cause","equal length fragments","sensitive methods","RT-PCR","gel electrophoresis","polio","coxsackie viruses","majority of asthma exacerbations","Examination","hypothesis","published techniques","acid lability","considerable extent","specificity","identification","middle","sensitivity","contrast","model","past"],"language":"en"},

After sucrose equilibrium centrifugation of high passage virus, a single peak contained both infectious virus and interfering activity. This virus population resembled the original JHM virus in its structural proteins, but it contained an increased proportion of a protein with a molecular weight of 65 \u00D7 103.

Recently, the crystal structure of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) PL1 has been solved, which was similar to that of SARS-CoV PL2(pro), which may antagonize host innate immunity. However, very little is known about whether TGEV PL1 can antagonize host innate immune response. Here, we presented evidence that TGEV PL1 encoded by the replicase gene could suppress the IFN-\u03B2 expression and inhibit the nuclear translocation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). The ability to antagonize IFN-\u03B2 production was dependent on the intact catalytic activity of PL1. Furthermore, TGEV PL1 exerted deubiquitinase (DUB) activity which strongly inhibited the retinoic acid-induced gene I- (RIG-1-) and stimulator of interferon gene- (STING-) dependent IFN expression. Our data collectively suggest that TGEV PL1 can inhibit the IFN-\u03B2 expression and interfere with RIG-1- and STING-mediated signaling through a viral DUB activity. Our study has yielded strong evidence for the TGEV PL1 mechanisms that counteract the host innate immunity.","publish_time":"2017-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Xiaoliang; Tian, Jin; Kang, Hongtao; Guo, Dongchun; Liu, Jiasen; Liu, Dafei; Jiang, Qian; Li, Zhijie; Qu, Juanjuan; Qu, Liandong","journal":"Biomed Res Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8590276b817018ff7fea07592055689f3d325d3a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5672592.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29201911/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/7089091","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs1MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV","IFN"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["TGEV PL1 mechanisms","IFN-\u03B2 expression","TGEV PL1 exerted deubiquitinase","IFN-\u03B2 production","dependent IFN expression","intact catalytic activity of PL1","host innate immunity","MERS-CoV","Sendai virus","SARS-CoV PL2","stimulator of interferon gene","severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV","murine hepatitis virus","replicase gene","STING","viral DUB activity","RIG","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","retinoic acid-induced gene","human coronavirus NL63","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","crystal structure of transmissible gastroenteritis virus","HCoV-NL63","strong evidence","nuclear translocation of interferon regulatory factor","PEDV","MHV","proteases","papain","immune response","CoVs","IRF3","ability","study","data","Coronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

Redox-active disulfides are, by their very nature, more susceptible to reduction than structural disulfides; and conversely, the Cys pairs that form them are more susceptible to oxidation. In this study, we searched for potentially redox-active Cys Pairs by scanning the Protein Data Bank for structures of proteins in alternate redox states. The PDB contains over 1134 unique redox pairs of proteins, many of which exhibit conformational differences between alternate redox states. Several classes of structural changes were observed, proteins that exhibit: disulfide oxidation following expulsion of metals such as zinc; major reorganisation of the polypeptide backbone in association with disulfide redox-activity; order/disorder transitions; and changes in quaternary structure. Based on evidence gathered supporting disulfide redox activity, we propose disulfides present in alternate redox states are likely to have physiologically relevant redox activity.","publish_time":"2009-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fan, Samuel W; George, Richard A; Haworth, Naomi L; Feng, Lina L; Liu, Jason Y; Wouters, Merridee A","journal":"Protein Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec74db66f65c0201ea511463f4b67fde387eafe5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2776962.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19598234/; https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.175; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2776962?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs1NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PDB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disulfide redox-activity","Redox-active disulfides","alternate redox states","redox-active group","relevant redox activity","supporting disulfide redox activity","unique redox pairs of proteins","redox-active Cys Pairs","structural disulfides","disulfide oxidation","structures of proteins","disulfide subproteomes","disulfides present","classes of structural changes","known role of structural stabilization","emerging evidence","Protein Data Bank","regulation of protein function","polypeptide backbone","disorder transitions","association","major reorganisation","zinc","expulsion of metals","stabilizing elements","conformational differences","reduction","quaternary structure","roles","nature","PDB","catalytic functions","study"],"language":"en"},

This impression may be incorrect, because not all cats experimentally exposed to FIPV develop FIP. There is also a belief that the incidence of FIP may be affected by a number of host, virus, and environmental cofactors. However, the contribution of these cofactors to immunity and disease incidence has not been determined. The present study followed 111 random-bred specific pathogen free (SPF) cats that were obtained from a single research breeding colony and experimentally infected with FIPV. The cats were from several studies conducted over the past 5 years, and as a result, some of them had prior exposure to feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) or avirulent FIPVs. The cats were housed under optimized conditions of nutrition, husbandry, and quarantine to eliminate most of the cofactors implicated in FIPV infection outcome and were uniformly challenge exposed to the same field strain of serotype 1 FIPV. Forty of the 111 (36%) cats survived their initial challenge exposure to a Type I cat-passaged field strains of FIPV. Six of these 40 survivors succumbed to FIP to a second or third challenge exposure, suggesting that immunity was not always sustained. Exposure to non-FIP-inducing feline coronaviruses prior to challenge with virulent FIPV did not significantly affect FIP incidence but did accelerate the disease course in some cats. There were no significant differences in FIP incidence between males and females, but resistance increased significantly between 6 months and 1 or more years of age. Genetic testing was done on 107 of the 111 infected cats. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) segregated the 107 cats into three distinct families based primarily on a common sire(s), and resistant and susceptible cats were equally distributed within each family. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on 73 cats that died of FIP after one or more exposures (cases) and 34 cats that survived (controls) demonstrated four significant associations after 100k permutations. When these same cats were analyzed using a sib-pair transmission test, three of the four associations were confirmed although not with genome-wide significance. GWAS was then done on three different age groups of cases to take into account age-related resistance, and different associations were observed. The only common and strong association identified between the various GWAS case configurations was for the 34.7\u201345.8Mb region of chromosome A3. No obvious candidate genes were present in this region.","publish_time":"2014-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pedersen, Niels C.; Liu, Hongwei; Gandolfi, Barbara; Lyons, Leslie A.","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/434de40634a539fc41ac568d5de5ed6f9057ad39.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112829.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242714001998; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242714001998; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2014.09.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25265870/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs1NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIPV","FIP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected cats","incidence of FIP","FIP incidence","susceptible cats","FIP virus","non-FIP","immunity","disease incidence","initial challenge exposure","FIPV infection outcome","passaged field strains of FIPV","prior exposure","different associations","significant associations","feline coronaviruses","Genome-wide association studies","environmental cofactors","impression","years of age","different age groups of cases","feline enteric coronavirus","feline infectious peritonitis","genome-wide significance","strong association","various GWAS case configurations","significant differences","common sire","disease course","present study","account age-related resistance","field strain of serotype","Mb region of chromosome A3","FECV","specific pathogen free","husbandry","optimized conditions of nutrition","SPF","females","single research breeding colony","obvious candidate genes","avirulent FIPVs","sib-pair transmission test","number of host","distinct families","quarantine","MDS","controls","exposures","Multidimensional scaling","result","months","permutations","contribution","belief","Genetic testing","survivors","family"],"language":"en"},

In our study, complete genomic sequencing of DENV-3 strains collected from different geographical locations and isolation years were determined and the sequence diversity as well as selection pressure sites in the DENV genome other than within the E gene were also analyzed. RESULTS: Using maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches, our phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Taiwan\u0027s indigenous DENV-3 isolated from 1994 and 1998 dengue/DHF epidemics and one 1999 sporadic case were of the three different genotypes \u2013 I, II, and III, each associated with DENV-3 circulating in Indonesia, Thailand and Sri Lanka, respectively. Sequence diversity and selection pressure of different genomic regions among DENV-3 different genotypes was further examined to understand the global DENV-3 evolution. The highest nucleotide sequence diversity among the fully sequenced DENV-3 strains was found in the nonstructural protein 2A (mean \u00B1 SD: 5.84 \u00B1 0.54) and envelope protein gene regions (mean \u00B1 SD: 5.04 \u00B1 0.32). Further analysis found that positive selection pressure of DENV-3 may occur in the non-structural protein 1 gene region and the positive selection site was detected at position 178 of the NS1 gene. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that the envelope protein is under purifying selection pressure although it presented higher sequence diversity. The detection of positive selection pressure in the non-structural protein along genotype II indicated that DENV-3 originated from Southeast Asia needs to monitor the emergence of DENV strains with epidemic potential for better epidemic prevention and vaccine development.","publish_time":"2008-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"King, Chwan-Chuen; Chao, Day-Yu; Chien, Li-Jung; Chang, Gwong-Jen J; Lin, Ting-Hsiang; Wu, Yin-Chang; Huang, Jyh-Hsiung","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/84a964d5dde5ffc12076b7c43ac5fff52210ad61.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2413216.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18495043/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-5-63","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs2MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV"],"locations":["Indonesia","Thailand","Sri Lanka","Southeast Asia"],"keyphrases":["positive selection pressure of DENV","DENV genome","sequenced DENV","global DENV","purifying selection pressure","emergence of DENV strains","selection pressure sites","Taiwan\u0027s indigenous DENV","detection of positive selection pressure","selection pressure of different genomic regions","non-structural protein","envelope protein gene regions","complete genomic sequencing of DENV","positive selection site","nonstructural protein","envelope protein of dengue viruses","higher sequence diversity","different genotypes","genetic differences of full-length viral genomes of DENV","highest nucleotide sequence diversity","E gene","NS1 gene","different geographical locations","previous study","mean","SD","epidemic potential","phylogenetic analysis","better epidemic prevention","Bayesian approaches","isolation years","position","maximum likelihood","vaccine development","sporadic case","DHF epidemics","Indonesia","Southeast Asia","Thailand","Sri Lanka","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","evolution","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Its outbreak results in acute illness that may lead to chronic phase. Chikungunya virus (CHV) diagnosis solutions are not easily accessible and affordable in developing countries. Also old approaches are very slow in identifying and controlling the spread of CHV outbreak. The sudden development and advancement of wearable internet of things (IoT) sensors, fog computing, mobile technology, cloud computing and better internet coverage have enhanced the quality of remote healthcare services. IoT assisted fog health monitoring system can be used to identify possibly infected users from CHV in an early phase of their illness so that the outbreak of CHV can be controlled. Fog computing provides many benefits such as low latency, minimum response time, high mobility, enhanced service quality, location awareness and notification service itself at the edge of the network. In this paper, IoT and fog based healthcare system is proposed to identify and control the outbreak of CHV. Fuzzy-C means (FCM) is used to diagnose the possibly infected users and immediately generate diagnostic and emergency alerts to users from fog layer. Furthermore on cloud server, social network analysis (SNA) is used to represent the state of CHV outbreak. Outbreak role index is calculated from SNA graph which represents the probability of any user to receive or spread the infection. It also generates warning alerts to government and healthcare agencies to control the outbreak of CHV in risk prone or infected regions. The experimental results highlight the advantages of using both fog computing and cloud computing services together for achieving network bandwidth efficiency, high quality of service and minimum response time in generation of real time notification as compared to a cloud only model.","publish_time":"2017-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sood, Sandeep K.; Mahajan, Isha","journal":"Computers in Industry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3dcb28bb478093d33a1c63c70a2adf3760659c9e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114341.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287550/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compind.2017.05.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166361516303190; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166361516303190","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs3MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHV","SNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["outbreak of CHV","fog computing","spread of CHV outbreak","state of CHV outbreak","outbreak results","cloud computing services","fog layer","IoT","infected users","Outbreak role index","high quality of service","enhanced service quality","notification service","cloud server","fog health monitoring system","healthcare system","minimum response time","quality of remote healthcare services","healthcare agencies","infected regions","generation of real time notification","network bandwidth efficiency","social network analysis","high mobility","emergency alerts","SNA graph","warning alerts","acute illness","Chikungunya virus","early phase","Abstract Chikungunya","chronic phase","experimental results","better internet coverage","advancement of wearable internet of things","mobile technology","sensors","location awareness","low latency","diagnosis solutions","benefits","diagnostic","risk prone","sudden development","government","advantages","Fuzzy-C means","FCM","developing countries","vector","disease","probability","edge","paper","old approaches","infection","model","areas"],"language":"en"},

It is imperative to develop safe and efficient candidate vaccines to control IBV infection. In the current study, recombinant baculoviruses co-expressing the S1 and N proteins and mono-expressing S1 or N proteins of the GX-YL5 strain of IBV were constructed and prepared into subunit vaccines rHBM-S1-N, rHBM-S1 and rHBM-N. The levels of immune protection of these subunit vaccines were evaluated by inoculating specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens at 14 days of age, giving them a booster with the same dose 14 days later and challenging them with a virulent GX-YL5 strain of IBV 14 days post-booster (dpb). The commercial vaccine strain H120 was used as a control. The IBV-specific antibody levels, as well as the percentages of CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T lymphocytes, were detected within 28 days post-vaccination (dpv). The morbidity, mortality and re-isolation of the virus from the tracheas and kidneys of challenged birds were evaluated at five days post-challenge (dpc). The results showed that the IBV-specific antibody levels and the percentages of CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T lymphocytes were higher in the rHBM-S1-N vaccinated birds compared to birds vaccinated with the rHBM-S1 and rHBM-N vaccines. At 5 dpc, the mortality, morbidity and virus re-isolation rate of the birds vaccinated with the rHBM-S1-N vaccine were slightly higher than those vaccinated with the H120 control vaccine but were lower than those vaccinated with the rHBM-S1 and rHBM-N vaccines. The present study demonstrated that the protection of the recombinant baculovirus co-expressing S1 and N proteins was better than that of recombinant baculoviruses mono-expressing the S1 or N protein. Thus, the recombinant baculovirus co-expressing S1 and N proteins could serve as a potential IBV vaccine and this demonstrates that the bivalent subunit vaccine including the S1 and N proteins might be a strategy for the development of an IBV subunit vaccine.","publish_time":"2018-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuan, Yuan; Zhang, Zhi-Peng; He, Yi-Ning; Fan, Wen-Sheng; Dong, Zhi-Hua; Zhang, Li-Hua; Sun, Xin-Kuan; Song, Li-Li; Wei, Tian-Chao; Mo, Mei-Lan; Wei, Ping","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f923809d6875b38e21636801b4a50f8fbac6aef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6071288.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29954092/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v10070347","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs3MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rHBM-N vaccines","N proteins","subunit vaccines rHBM-S1","N vaccinated birds","IBV subunit vaccine","recombinant baculovirus co-expressing S1","potential IBV vaccine","IBV infection","IBV-specific antibody levels","bivalent subunit vaccine","H120 control vaccine","days post-booster","virulent GX-YL5 strain of IBV","recombinant baculoviruses co-","days post-vaccination","days post-challenge","days of age","commercial vaccine strain H120","recombinant baculoviruses mono","efficient candidate vaccines","virus re-isolation rate","kidneys of challenged birds","levels of immune protection","Avian infectious bronchitis virus","morbidity","CD8","percentages of CD4","mortality","T lymphocytes","dpc","results","specific pathogen-free","causative agent of infectious bronchitis","current study","present study","chickens","SPF","tracheas","development","dpb","strategy","considerable economic losses","dpv","dose"],"language":"en"},

The aim of the present review is to provide an overview of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and, in particular, to deduce from it potential risks and complications for pregnant patients. For this purpose, the available literature on cases of infection in pregnancy during the SARS epidemic of 2002/2003, the MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) epidemic ongoing since 2012, as well as recent publications on cases infected with SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy are reviewed and reported. Based on the literature available at the moment, it can be assumed that the clinical course of COVID-19 disease may be complicated by pregnancy which could be associated with a higher mortality rate. It may also be assumed at the moment that transmission from mother to child in utero is unlikely.

METHODS: We analyzed centralized electronic health records that included dispensation information and diagnosis codes. Information collected on admissions included patient age, sex, admission year and month, and medications dispensed, and were matched with the first 15 discharge diagnosis codes. We divided monthly admission episodes by relevant population denominators to obtain admission rates, and stratified analyses by drug type, age group, and diagnosis codes. RESULTS: Amantadine was used for influenza treatment in the early 2000s but changed with recommendations to avoid its use in 2006, and is now mainly used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease. Oseltamivir usage increased substantially in 2009 and is now commonly used, with almost 40,000 hospitalizations treated with oseltamivir in the years 2012 through 2015, 66% of which was in persons \u226565 years of age. During the entire study period, of the 98,253 admission episodes in which oseltamivir was dispensed, 40,698 (41%) included a diagnosis code for influenza, and 80,283 (82%) included any diagnosis code for respiratory illness. CONCLUSIONS: The amount of oseltamivir used from 2012\u201315 was comparable to a separate ecological estimate of around 13,000 influenza-associated hospitalizations per year on average.

An early report from newly established laboratory\u2010based influenza surveillance in Lao PDR. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 4(2), 47\u201352. Background Prior to 2007, little information was available about the burden of influenza in Laos. We report data from the first laboratory\u2010based influenza surveillance system established in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. Methods Three hospitals in the capital city of Vientiane began surveillance for influenza\u2010like illness (ILI) in outpatients in 2007 and expanded to include hospitalized pneumonia patients in 2008. Nasal/throat swab specimens were collected and tested for influenza and other respiratory viruses by multiplex ID\u2010Tag(TM) respiratory viral panel (RVP) assay on a Luminex\u00AE 100\u00D7 MAP IS instrument (Qiagen, Singapore). Results During January 2007 to December 2008, 287 of 526 (54\u00B76%) outpatients with ILI were positive for at least one respiratory virus. Influenza was most commonly identified, with 63 (12\u00B70%) influenza A and 92 (17\u00B75%) influenza B positive patients identified. In 2008, six of 79 (7\u00B76%) hospitalized pneumonia patients were positive for influenza A and four (5\u00B71%) were positive for influenza B. Children \u003C5 years represented 19% of viral infections in outpatients and 38% of pneumonia inpatients. Conclusion Our results provide the first documentation of influenza burden among patients with febrile respiratory illness and pneumonia requiring hospitalization in Laos. Implementing laboratory\u2010based influenza surveillance requires substantial investments in infrastructure and training. However, continuing outbreaks of avian influenza A/H5N1 in poultry and emergence of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic strain further underscore the importance of establishing and maintaining influenza surveillance in developing countries.","publish_time":"2010-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vongphrachanh, Phengta; Simmerman, James M.; Phonekeo, Darouny; Pansayavong, Vimatha; Sisouk, Thongchanh; Ongkhamme, Somvay; Bryce, Gary T.; Corwin, Andrew; Bryant, Juliet E.","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46f3939764340a0e8274772f0cda101e7e4cb361.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5779283.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20167044/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2009.00120.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs4Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bryant JE"],"organizations":["Vongphrachanh P","Qiagen, Singapore","B.

This study sought to identify the diversity and prevalence of coronaviruses in bats in the Australasian region. We identified four different genotypes of coronavirus, three of which (an alphacoronavirus and two betacoronaviruses) are potentially new species, having less than 90% nucleotide sequence identity with the most closely related described viruses. We did not detect any SARS-like betacoronaviruses, despite targeting rhinolophid bats, the putative natural host taxa. Our findings support the virus-host co-evolution hypothesis, with the detection of Miniopterus bat coronavirus HKU8 (previously reported in Miniopterus species in China, Hong Kong and Bulgaria) in Australian Miniopterus species. Similarly, we detected a novel betacoronavirus genotype from Pteropus alecto which is most closely related to Bat coronavirus HKU9 identified in other pteropodid bats in China, Kenya and the Philippines. We also detected possible cross-species transmission of bat coronaviruses, and the apparent enteric tropism of these viruses. Thus, our findings are consistent with a scenario wherein the current diversity and host specificity of coronaviruses reflects co-evolution with the occasional host shift.","publish_time":"2016-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, C.

Thus, sPLA2-IID is involved in immune suppression, sPLA2-IIE in metabolic regulation and hair follicle homeostasis, sPLA2-IIF in epidermal hyperplasia, and sPLA2-III in male reproduction, anaphylaxis, colonic diseases, and possibly atherosclerosis.

Although canine CV has been identified and characterized in southern China in recent years, its epidemiology in other regions of China and its precise molecular characteristics have not been examined. In this study, we examined 141 fecal specimens collected from domestic dogs with or without diarrhea in Heilongjiang province, Northeastern China, during 2014 to 2016. A total of 18 out of 141 samples were found to be positive for canine CV by real-time quantitative PCR. In the diarrhea samples, canine CV was detected in coinfections with canine parvovirus 2. More importantly, two different canine CV strains were detected in one sample. Five canine CV genomes were successfully amplified. Sequence analysis showed that there were two unique amino acid changes in the Rep protein (N39S in the K1 strain, and T71A in the XF16 strain). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that canine CV could be divided into four genotypes, and specific nucleotide mutations could be used for confirming the four genotypes. Moreover, recombination analysis revealed that a total of eight recombination events were found in five genomic sequences. Molecular evolution analysis showed that the canine CV has been under purifying selection. This study provides evidence that at least three genotypes of canine CV are co-circulating in China. Continuous epidemiological surveillance is therefore necessary to understand their importance for the evolution of canine CV.

Objectives We developed a sensitive, specific, and quantitative real-time PCR assay based on the TaqMan method for HBoV detection and quantification in respiratory specimens. Study design Three individual real-time PCR assays were designed to amplify HBoV NS1, NP-1, and VP1 genes. For clinical evaluation, 506 nasal aspirates obtained from patients with acute respiratory tract infections during December 2006 to May 2007 were tested. Results Each assay had a broad dynamic range (50\u00D7107 to 5\u00D7107 copies of plasmid DNA) and high inter- and intra-assay reproducibility. The detection limit of each assay was 10 genome copies per reaction, and no crossreactivity with other major respiratory viruses or bacteria was detected. Clinical evaluation revealed that 11 (2.1%) of 506 patients diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infections, pneumonia, bronchitis, pharyngitis, or sinusitis had HBoV detected by all three assays, with viral loads ranging from 8.2\u00D7104 to 8.1\u00D7109 copies/ml of specimen. Conclusions The three assays for HBoV diagnosis and quantification are highly sensitive, specific real-time tools for the reliable epidemiological and pathogenetic study of HBoV infection.","publish_time":"2008-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choi, Jang-Hoon; Chung, Yoon-Seok; Kim, Ki-Soon; Lee, Wan-Ji; Chung, Il Yup; Oh, Hee-Bok; Kang, Chun","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b221e7b8f465cd5a840579983c6c2da5e6318ad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108235.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18378492/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138665320800070X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S138665320800070X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2008.02.010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs5MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HBoV detection","HBoV diagnosis","HBoV NS1","respiratory specimens","patients","respiratory illness","quantitative real-time PCR assay","pathogenetic study of HBoV infection","acute respiratory tract infections","upper respiratory tract infections","major respiratory viruses","individual real-time PCR assays","quantification","specific real-time tools","intra-assay reproducibility","genome copies","clinical evaluation","copies of plasmid DNA","Study design","detection limit","TaqMan method","bronchitis","pneumonia","nasal aspirates","pharyngitis","crossreactivity","Abstract Background Human bocavirus","NP","reaction","broad dynamic range","bacteria","sinusitis","Conclusions","VP1 genes","viral loads","Objectives","parvovirus"],"language":"en"},

In particular, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae possess well-characterized CEACAM1-binding adhesins. CEACAM1 is typically involved in cell-cell attachment, epithelial differentiation, neovascularisation and regulation of T-cell proliferation, and is one of the few CEACAM family members with homologues in different mammalian lineages. However, it is unknown whether bacterial adhesins of human pathogens can recognize CEACAM1 orthologues from other mammals. RESULTS: Sequence comparisons of the amino-terminal Ig-variable-like domain of CEACAM1 reveal that the highest sequence divergence between human, murine, canine and bovine orthologues is found in the \u03B2-strands comprising the bacteria-binding CC\u0027FG-face of the Ig-fold. Using GFP-tagged, soluble amino-terminal domains of CEACAM1, we demonstrate that bacterial pathogens selectively associate with human, but not other mammalian CEACAM1 orthologues. Whereas full-length human CEACAM1 can mediate internalization of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in transfected cells, murine CEACAM1 fails to support bacterial internalization, demonstrating that the sequence divergence of CEACAM1 orthologues has functional consequences with regard to bacterial recognition and cellular invasion. CONCLUSIONS: Our results establish the selective interaction of several human-restricted bacterial pathogens with human CEACAM1 and suggest that co-evolution of microbial adhesins with their corresponding receptors on mammalian cells contributes to the limited host range of these highly adapted infectious agents.","publish_time":"2010-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Voges, Maike; Bachmann, Verena; Kammerer, Robert; Gophna, Uri; Hauck, Christof R","journal":"BMC Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ed3ca15292f7b5c1ace98e0cece9a60609d8138.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2871271.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2180-10-117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20406467/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs5Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Moraxella"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["murine CEACAM1","full-length human CEACAM1","domain of CEACAM1","mammalian CEACAM1 orthologues","bacterial adhesins of human pathogens","sequence divergence of CEACAM1 orthologues","human-restricted bacterial pathogens","bacterial internalization","human mucosa","well-characterized CEACAM1-binding adhesins","bacterial recognition","soluble amino-terminal domains of CEACAM1","cell-cell attachment","variety of Gram-negative bacterial pathogens","mammalian cells","cell proliferation","bovine orthologues","internalization of Neisseria gonorrhoeae","highest sequence divergence","Sequence comparisons","amino-terminal Ig-variable","Ig-fold","RESULTS","Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule","different mammalian lineages","transfected cells","related glycoprotein","co-evolution of microbial adhesins","cellular receptor","cellular invasion","bacteria-binding CC\u0027FG-face","regard","functional consequences","Haemophilus influenzae","neovascularisation","epithelial differentiation","homologues","Moraxella catarrhalis","meningitidis","limited host range","regulation of T","corresponding receptors","CEACAM family members","selective interaction","adapted infectious agents","\u03B2-strands","BACKGROUND","immunoglobulin","CONCLUSIONS","GFP","mammals"],"language":"en"},

We focus on the host\u2013pathogen dynamics of four emerging viruses associated with bats: Hendra, Nipah, Ebola, and Marburg viruses. Spillover of bat infections to humans and domestic animals often coincides with pulses of viral excretion within bat populations, but the mechanisms driving such pulses are unclear. Three hypotheses dominate current research on these emerging bat infections. First, pulses of viral excretion could reflect seasonal epidemic cycles driven by natural variations in population densities and contact rates among hosts. If lifelong immunity follows recovery, viruses may disappear locally but persist globally through migration; in either case, new outbreaks occur once births replenish the susceptible pool. Second, epidemic cycles could be the result of waning immunity within bats, allowing local circulation of viruses through oscillating herd immunity. Third, pulses could be generated by episodic shedding from persistently infected bats through a combination of physiological and ecological factors. The three scenarios can yield similar patterns in epidemiological surveys, but strategies to predict or manage spillover risk resulting from each scenario will be different. We outline an agenda for research on viruses emerging from bats that would allow for differentiation among the scenarios and inform development of evidence-based interventions to limit threats to human and animal health. These concepts and methods are applicable to a wide range of pathogens that affect humans, domestic animals, and wildlife.","publish_time":"2016-08-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Plowright, Raina K.; Peel, Alison J.; Streicker, Daniel G.; Gilbert, Amy T.; McCallum, Hamish; Wood, James; Baker, Michelle L.; Restif, Olivier","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46605a285131acb104ba6ed5a7b15a23839bdb49.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4973921.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27489944/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0004796","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emerging viruses","Marburg viruses","emerging bat infections","pulses of viral excretion","infected bats","local circulation of viruses","Spillover of bat infections","humans","bat populations","domestic animals","lifelong immunity","wildlife","scenarios","seasonal epidemic cycles","oscillating herd immunity","result of waning immunity","biology of pathogens","current research","reservoir hosts","spillover risk","wide range of pathogens","natural variations","population densities","threats","contact rates","births","based interventions","strategies","development of evidence","combination of physiological","Nipah","Ebola","Hendra","epidemiological surveys","similar patterns","case","new outbreaks","methods","limited knowledge","mechanisms","pathogen dynamics","episodic shedding","animal health","ecological factors","combatting zoonoses","hypotheses","differentiation","recovery","susceptible pool","Progress","migration","concepts","agenda"],"language":"en"},

Their mechanical properties allow them to aggregate and to compete with pathogens for nutrients, space and attachment to host cells. Consequently, they can directly antagonize pathogens and thus exert beneficial effects without directly affecting the metabolism of the host. An overview of the probiotics with such traits, tested up to date in clinical trials for the prevention or treatment of URTIs and otitis, is presented in this review. Their mechanical properties in the respiratory tract as well as at other locations are also cited. Species with interesting in vitro properties towards pharyngeal cells or against common respiratory pathogens have also been included. The potential safety risks of the cited species are then discussed. This review could be of help in the screening of probiotic strains with specific mechanical properties susceptible to have positive effects in clinical trials against URTIs.","publish_time":"2012-08-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Popova, M.; Molimard, P.; Courau, S.; Crociani, J.; Dufour, C.; Le Vacon, F.; Carton, T.","journal":"J Appl Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43e2cfbc39a597d2a3b90bc0c12819aab9eabc8f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166318.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22788970/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2012.05394.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjszOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Probiotics"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Clinical trials","Probiotics","beneficial effects","common respiratory pathogens","specific mechanical properties susceptible","positive effects","upper respiratory tract infections","treatment of URTIs","otitis","cited species","review","host","pharyngeal cells","different locations","screening of probiotic strains","therapeutic agents","prevention","human health","live micro\u2010organisms","ability","help","potential safety risks","space","attachment","date","traits","nutrients","body","metabolism","overview"],"language":"en"},

Apriori-like algorithms generate exponential number of candidate itemsets including the itemsets that do not exist in the database. These algorithms require multiple scans of database for counting the support of candidate FT itemsets. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, which mines FT frequent itemsets using frequent pattern growth approach (FT-PatternGrowth). FT-PatternGrowth adopts a divide-and-conquer technique and recursively projects transactional database into a set of smaller projected transactional databases and mines FT frequent itemsets in each projected database by exploring only locally frequent items. This mines the complete set of FT frequent itemsets and substantially reduces those candidate itemsets that do not exist in the database. FT-PatternGrowth stores the transactional database in a highly condensed much smaller data structure called frequent pattern tree (FP-tree). The support of candidate itemsets are counted directly from the FP-tree without scanning the original database multiple times. This improves the processing speed of algorithm. Our experiments on benchmark databases indicates mining FT frequent itemsets using FT-PatternGrowth is highly efficient than Apriori-like algorithms.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bashir, Shariq","journal":"Expert Systems with Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/279b0d759797da6f427f04800f956804cef11194.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126664.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417419307638; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2019.113046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288329/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0957417419307638","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mining FT frequent itemsets","mines FT frequent itemsets","FT-PatternGrowth","complete set of FT frequent itemsets","support of candidate FT itemsets","exact matching frequent itemsets","support of candidate itemsets","frequent pattern tree","exponential number of candidate itemsets","projected database","frequent pattern growth approach","multiple scans of database","original database multiple times","set of smaller projected transactional databases","FP-tree","Previous algorithms","benchmark databases","Apriori heuristic","Abstract Mining fault tolerant","novel algorithm","smaller data structure","processing speed of algorithm","experiments","technique","divide","paper"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we exposed tracheal organ cultures from rats to 95% oxygen and 1 ppm ozone, alone and in combination, to determine (1) whether epithelial responses to ozone similar to those observed in vivo occur in airways separated from systemic physiologic, secretory, and inflammatory reactions; (2) whether concentrations of oxygen sufficient to potentially cause oxidant injury result in morphologic epithelial alterations similar to those that occur in ozone toxicity; and (3) if the combined oxidant insult of oxygen and ozone results in more severe damage to the tracheal epithelium than occurs with ozone in air. Tracheal organ cultures were exposed to filtered air and 5% carbon dioxide; filtered air, 5% carbon dioxide, and 1 ppm ozone; 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide; or 95% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide, and 1 ppm ozone for 96 hr. Light- and quantitative electron-microscopic evaluation showed that epithelia to 1 ppm ozone in air exhibited loss of ciliated cells and ciliated cell damage. The epithelia exposed to 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide were pseudostratified, columnar, ciliated, and hyperplastic. Epithelia exposed to 95% oxygen plus 1 ppm ozone were stratified and nonciliated or very sparsely ciliated. The predominant cell types in epithelia exposed to oxygen plus ozone were serous cells and metaplastic cells, and focal aggregates of adherent necrotic cells were present.

The clinical spectrum of MERS-CoV infection in humans ranges from an asymptomatic or mild respiratory illness to severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure; overall mortality is around 35.7%. Bats harbour several betacoronaviruses that are closely related to MERS-CoV but more research is needed to establish the relationship between bats and MERS-CoV. The seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies is very high in dromedary camels in Eastern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. MERS-CoV RNA and viable virus have been isolated from dromedary camels, including some with respiratory symptoms. Furthermore, near-identical strains of MERS-CoV have been isolated from epidemiologically linked humans and camels, confirming inter-transmission, most probably from camels to humans. Though inter-human spread within health care settings is responsible for the majority of reported MERS-CoV cases, the virus is incapable at present of causing sustained human-to-human transmission. Clusters can be readily controlled with implementation of appropriate infection control procedures. Phylogenetic and sequencing data strongly suggest that MERS-CoV originated from bat ancestors after undergoing a recombination event in the spike protein, possibly in dromedary camels in Africa, before its exportation to the Arabian Peninsula along the camel trading routes. MERS-CoV serosurveys are needed to investigate possible unrecognized human infections in Africa. Amongst the important measures to control MERS-CoV spread are strict regulation of camel movement, regular herd screening and isolation of infected camels, use of personal protective equipment by camel handlers and enforcing rules banning all consumption of unpasteurized camel milk and urine.","publish_time":"2015-11-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Omrani, Ali S.; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A.; Memish, Ziad A.","journal":"Pathogens and Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aea77148a52e6ebafa7162a57b19805da03a447c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4809235.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/20477724.2015.1122852; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26924345/; https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/20477724.2015.1122852?needAccess=true","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsxNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Eastern Africa","Arabian Peninsula","Africa"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV spread","MERS-CoV serosurveys","MERS-CoV RNA","CoV infection","CoV antibodies","seroprevalence of MERS","majority of reported MERS-CoV cases","dromedary camels","clinical spectrum of MERS","identical strains of MERS","human transmission","isolation of infected camels","inter-human spread","camel handlers","sustained human","camel trading routes","Eastern Africa","respiratory symptoms","humans ranges","Arabian Peninsula","inter-transmission","linked humans","Bats","strict regulation of camel movement","consumption of unpasteurized camel milk","possible unrecognized human infections","mild respiratory illness","viable virus","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","implementation of appropriate infection control procedures","severe pneumonia","regular herd screening","multi-organ failure","health care settings","rules","personal protective equipment","recombination event","spike protein","bat ancestors","overall mortality","urine","present","exportation","relationship","sequencing data","important measures","novel enzootic betacoronavirus","research","betacoronaviruses","Clusters"],"language":"en"},

Cell surface iodination identified virus-specific proteins expressed on BALB/cv primary mammary tumor cells grown in culture. In contrast to (C3H)MMTV-producing cell lines which expressed MMTV gp52, BALB/cV tumor cells lacked gp52 and expressed instead a 68K, env-related protein.

The expression of 68K env was restricted to mammary tissues of BALB/cV mice that also expressed other MMTV proteins. Biochemical analysis established that 68K env was not modified by N-linked glycosylation. 125I-labeled 68K env was rapidly released into the media of tumor cell cultures and was recovered both in the form of a soluble protein and in a 100,000 g pellet.

In 14/192 cases (7%) HBoV was the sole isolate and in 10/192 (5%) it was part of a mixed viral infection. HBoV was the third most common pathogen detected after respiratory syncytial virus (45/192; 23%) and rhinovirus (24/192; 12%). It occurred more often in infants aged 1\u201312 months (P = 0.002).

Only scarce information is available about the diversity of viruses present in the faeces of pigs. Here we describe a protocol, which was optimized for the purification of the total fraction of viral particles from pig faeces. The genomes of the purified DNA and RNA viruses were simultaneously amplified by PCR and subjected to deep sequencing followed by bioinformatic analyses. The efficiency of the method was monitored using a process control consisting of three bacteriophages (T4, M13 and MS2) with different morphology and genome types. Defined amounts of the bacteriophages were added to the sample and their abundance was assessed by quantitative PCR during the preparation procedure. RESULTS: The procedure was applied to a pooled faecal sample of five pigs. From this sample, 69,613 sequence reads were generated. All of the added bacteriophages were identified by sequence analysis of the reads. In total, 7.7% of the reads showed significant sequence identities with published viral sequences. They mainly originated from bacteriophages (73.9%) and mammalian viruses (23.9%); 0.8% of the sequences showed identities to plant viruses. The most abundant detected porcine viruses were kobuvirus, rotavirus C, astrovirus, enterovirus B, sapovirus and picobirnavirus. In addition, sequences with identities to the chimpanzee stool-associated circular ssDNA virus were identified. Whole genome analysis indicates that this virus, tentatively designated as pig stool-associated circular ssDNA virus (PigSCV), represents a novel pig virus. CONCLUSION: The established protocol enables the simultaneous detection of DNA and RNA viruses in pig faeces including the identification of so far unknown viruses. It may be applied in studies investigating aetiology, epidemiology and ecology of diseases.

The aim of this work was to evaluate this new vaccine that uses a conserved viral antigen, in calves, natural hosts for BRSV. Calves, free of colostral or natural anti-BRSV antibodies, were vaccinated with NSRS either intramuscularly, or both intramuscularly and intranasally using Montanide\u2122 ISA71 and IMS4132 as adjuvants and challenged with BRSV. All vaccinated calves developed anti-N antibodies in blood and nasal secretions and N-specific cellular immunity in local lymph nodes. Clinical monitoring post-challenge demonstrated moderate respiratory pathology with local lung tissue consolidations for the non-vaccinated calves that were significantly reduced in the vaccinated calves. Vaccinated calves had lower viral loads than the non-vaccinated control calves.

We observe an increasing trend in published BCMs, frequently coupled to (re)emergence events, and propose a categorization by distinguishing how information translates into preventive actions. Behaviour is usually captured by introducing information as a dynamic parameter (76/178) or by introducing an economic objective function, either with (26/178) or without (37/178) imitation. Approaches using information thresholds (29/178) and exogenous behaviour formation (16/178) are also popular. We further classify according to disease, prevention measure, transmission model (with 81/178 population, 6/178 metapopulation and 91/178 individual-level models) and the way prevention impacts transmission. We highlight the minority (15%) of studies that use any real-life data for parametrization or validation and note that BCMs increasingly use social media data and generally incorporate multiple sources of information (16/178), multiple types of information (17/178) or both (9/178). We conclude that individual-level models are increasingly used and useful to model behaviour changes. Despite recent advancements, we remain concerned that most models are purely theoretical and lack representative data and a validation process.","publish_time":"2016-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Verelst, Frederik; Willem, Lander; Beutels, Philippe","journal":"J R Soc Interface","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f0c490d80ef3e7032010a057baa96d4d45ababc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5221530.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28003528/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2016.0820","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjsyNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRISMA"],"locations":["Cochrane"],"keyphrases":["information thresholds","individual-level models","multiple sources of information","multiple types of information","transmission model","real-life data","infectious disease transmission","published BCMs","behavioural change models","model behaviour changes","way prevention impacts transmission","lack representative data","social media data","exogenous behaviour formation","prevention measure","validation process","PRISMA statement","selection","systematic search","papers","Cochrane collaboration guidelines","metapopulation","parametrization","studies","increasing trend","categorization","humans","economic objective function","emergence events","recent advancements","period","preventive actions","dynamic parameter","Approaches","minority","imitation"],"language":"en"},

In this study, a near full-length genome sequence of a virus named RS3X (formerly classified as bovine rhinovirus type 1), isolated from infected cattle from the UK in the 1960s, was obtained and analyzed. Compared to other closely related Aphthoviruses, major differences were detected in the leader protease (L(pro)), P1, 2B, and 3A proteins. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that RS3X was a member of the species bovine rhinitis A virus (BRAV). Using different codon-based and branch-site selection models for Aphthoviruses, including BRAV RS3X and foot-and-mouth disease virus, we observed no clear evidence for genomic regions undergoing positive selection. However, within each of the BRV species, multiple sites under positive selection were detected. The results also suggest that the probability (determined by Recombination Detection Program) for recombination events between BRVs and other Aphthoviruses, including foot-and-mouth disease virus was not significant. In contrast, within BRVs, the probability of recombination increases.

Therefore, a rapid, sensitive, and field-deployable detection of ASFV is important for disease surveillance and control. Herein, we developed a Cas12a-mediated portable paper assay to rapidly and precisely detect ASFV. We identified a robust set of crRNAs that recognized the highly conserved region of essential ASFV genes. The Cas12a-mediated detection assay showed low tolerance for mismatch mutations, and no cross-reactivity against other common swine pathogens. We further developed a paper-based assay to allow instrument-free detection of ASFV. Specifically, we applied gold nanoparticle\u2013antibody conjugate to engineer homemade strips and combined it with Cas12a-mediated ASFV detection. This portable paper, instrument-free diagnostics, faithfully detected ASFV in swine samples, showing comparable sensitivity to the traditionally instrument-dependent qPCR method.

We studied exhaled air and particle dispersion through an oronasal mask attached to a human-patient simulator (HPS) during noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV). Methods Airflow was marked with intrapulmonary smoke for visualization. Therapy with inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) was started at 10 cm H2O and gradually increased to 18 cm H2O, whereas expiratory positive airway pressure was maintained at 4 cm H2O. A leakage jet plume was revealed by a laser light sheet and images captured by video. Smoke concentration in the plume was estimated from the light scattered by smoke particles. Findings A jet plume of air leaked through the mask exhaust holes to a radial distance of 0.25 m from the mask during the application of IPAP at 10 cm H2O with some leakage from the nasal bridge. The leakage plume exposure probability was highest about 60 to 80 mm lateral to the median sagittal plane of the HPS. Without nasal bridge leakage, the jet plume from the exhaust holes increased to a 0.40-m radius from the mask, whereas exposure probability was highest about 0.28 m above the patient. When IPAP was increased to 18 cm H2O, the vertical plume extended to 0.45 m above the patient with some horizontal spreading along the ward ceiling.

Chloroquine is a clinically approved drug effective against malaria. We tested chloroquine phosphate for its antiviral potential against SARS-CoV-induced cytopathicity in Vero E6 cell culture. Results indicate that the IC50 of chloroquine for antiviral activity (8.8\u00B11.2\u03BCM) was significantly lower than its cytostatic activity; CC50 (261.3\u00B114.5\u03BCM), yielding a selectivity index of 30. The IC50 of chloroquine for inhibition of SARS-CoV in vitro approximates the plasma concentrations of chloroquine reached during treatment of acute malaria. Addition of chloroquine to infected cultures could be delayed for up to 5h postinfection, without an important drop in antiviral activity. Chloroquine, an old antimalarial drug, may be considered for immediate use in the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV infections.","publish_time":"2004-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Keyaerts, Els; Vijgen, Leen; Maes, Piet; Neyts, Johan; Ranst, Marc Van","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a37310720a8f5c49c5cd7f8e198f30768a61ecf2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092815.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X0401839X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X0401839X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs0MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IC50 of chloroquine","chloroquine phosphate","Addition of chloroquine","SARS-CoV","plasma concentrations of chloroquine","treatment of SARS","antiviral activity","inhibition of SARS","CoV infections","antiviral potential","treatment of acute malaria","cytostatic activity","\u03BCM","approved drug effective","effective inhibitor","old antimalarial drug","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","induced cytopathicity","replication","Vero E6 cell culture","important drop","prevention","CC50","immediate use","h postinfection","amino-quinoline","infected cultures","selectivity index","Results"],"language":"en"},

Animal models are extremely important in understanding this interface as well as in bridging the gap between basic science discoveries and clinical medicine. The complex nature of pharmacological and toxicological research involving exposure to xenobiotic and therapeutic compounds necessitates the use of animal models to better understand how these compounds interact with multiple organ systems and cell types. As genomics has expanded, we have become increasingly aware of the impact an individual\u2019s genetic makeup influences these responses. Novel methods have emerged that allow for the rapid development of animal models containing mutant alleles, allowing investigators to model these complex genetic interactions in a dramatically shortened timeline. In this chapter, we emphasize the methods and approaches that can be used in gene targeting, screening strategies, and a variety of genetically modified model organisms. The goal is to provide toxicologists an up to date review on the creation of genetically engineered animal models, which can be used to model genetic susceptibility to disease.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Veith, A.

We examined multiple antibodies to infectious agents and food antigens as well as protein markers of inflammation in well-characterized individuals with a recent onset of psychosis (N =106), persistent schizophrenia (N =261), and controls (N =233). Linear regression methods were used to calculate the association between the markers in both patient groups in comparison with controls adjusting for demographic factors. For the recent onset group, significant associations were found for IgG antibodies to measles (t =8.31, p \u003C.001), gliadin (t =5.90, p \u003C.001), bovine casein (t =4.74, p \u003C.001), human coronavirus (t =2.89, p =.004), Toxoplasma gondii (t =2.20, p =.029), and the group D retroviruses, Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (t =3.97, p \u003C.001) and murine leukemia virus (t =3.27, p =.001).

In 2012, the cattle industry decided that more information was needed on risk factors for mortality in both veal herds and herds of origin to enable implementation of risk mitigating measures. Routinely collected data were available from seven different data sources and contained information from 2.4 million white veal calves that were fattened in the period between 1 January 2011 and 30 June 2014. Survival analysis techniques (Kaplan-Meier), multilevel Poisson and multilevel Logistic regression models were applied to analyse the data. Two different models were assembled in which risk factors for veal calf mortality in respectively veal herds and herds of origin were identified. Univariable and multivariable regression techniques were used to detect risk factors significantly associated with mortality of veal calves during the fattening period. During the study period, the mean mortality was 4.9% per production cycle. The probability to die was highest during the first weeks after arrival in the veal herds and declined thereafter. Important risk factors included a veal herds with a higher use of antimicrobials, hair colour as proxy for breed, certain countries of origin, veal herd management with a limited amount of supplied feed and a not having an all-in / all-out system. A higher body weight at arrival in the veal herd was associated with lower mortality as well as veal calves that were fed an above median amount of milk, roughage and concentrates. From the calves that were fattened during the study period, observations of 1.1 million calves originated from the Netherlands and were available to study risk factors for veal calf mortality associated with the herd of origin. Important risk factors included purchase, herds with high mortality rates in the quarter in which the calf was born, fast growth in herd size, high cattle replacement rates and a higher antibiotic use in the quarter of birth. Calves that originated from herds that were certified BVD-free, Salmonella-unsuspected or Paratuberculosis-unsuspected, had a lower odds to die during the subsequent fattening period in a veal herd. Veal calf mortality was influenced by risk factors at the herd of origin as well as at veal herds. Adequate collaboration between the different industries is necessary to optimize veal calf management leading to a reduction in veal calf mortality during the fattening period.","publish_time":"2018-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Santman-Berends, I.M.G.A.; de Bont-Smolenaars, A.J.G.; Roos, L.; Velthuis, A.G.J.; van Schaik, G.","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/463fe530f1f727668d91c0780fda922c6263ed8d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125930.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30086854/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587718301946; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2018.05.013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587718301946","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Netherlands"],"keyphrases":["veal herds","mortality of veal calves","veal calf mortality","veal herd management","veal calf management","white veal calves","farm mortality of Dutch veal calves","herds of origin","lower mortality","study risk factors","Important risk factors","mean mortality","herd of origin","high mortality rates","study period","herd size","subsequent fattening period","implementation of risk mitigating measures","different models","certain countries of origin","different data sources","higher antibiotic use","higher use of antimicrobials","information","different industries","arrival","high cattle replacement rates","multilevel Logistic regression models","higher body weight","multivariable regression techniques","multilevel Poisson","Salmonella-unsuspected","Paratuberculosis-unsuspected","lower odds","cattle industry","quarter of birth","Survival analysis techniques","Kaplan-Meier","hair colour","purchase","proxy","breed","reduction","fast growth","certified BVD-free","weeks","Netherlands","Adequate collaboration","gradual increase","milk","roughage","supplied feed","Univariable","observations","production cycle","all-out system","concentrates","probability","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

A major thrust in vaccine research focuses on developing formulations with virus-like features towards enhancing antigen presentation and immune processing. Herein, a facile approach to formulate synthetic virus-like particles (sVLPs) is demonstrated by exploiting the phenomenon of protein corona formation induced by the high-energy surfaces of synthetic nanoparticles. Using an avian coronavirus spike protein as a model antigen, sVLPs were prepared by incubating 100 nm gold nanoparticles in a solution containing an optimized concentration of viral proteins. Following removal of free proteins, antigen-laden particles were recovered and showed morphological semblance to natural viral particles under nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy. As compared to inoculation with free proteins, vaccination with the sVLPs showed enhanced lymphatic antigen delivery, stronger antibody titers, increased splenic T-cell response, and reduced infection-associated symptoms in an avian model of coronavirus infection. Comparison to a commercial whole inactivated virus vaccine also showed evidence of superior antiviral protection by the sVLPs. The study demonstrates a simple yet robust method in bridging viral antigens with synthetic nanoparticles for improved vaccine application; it has practical implications in the management of human viral infections as well as in animal agriculture.","publish_time":"2016-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Hui-Wen; Huang, Chen-Yu; Lin, Shu-Yi; Fang, Zih-Syun; Hsu, Chen-Hsuan; Lin, Jung-Chen; Chen, Yuan-I; Yao, Bing-Yu; Hu, Che-Ming J.","journal":"Biomaterials","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e7204f7030a9956a95b58d84d283d85229cc117.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112462.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961216304045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27552321/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0142961216304045; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.08.018","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sVLPs","viral antigens","natural viral particles","model antigen","synthetic virus","antigen-laden particles","inactivated virus vaccine","vaccine research","antigen presentation","optimized concentration of viral proteins","viral infectious threats","improved vaccine application","management of human viral infections","development of vaccine technology","high-energy surfaces of synthetic nanoparticles","avian model of coronavirus infection","removal of free proteins","enhanced lymphatic antigen delivery","avian coronavirus spike protein","nm gold nanoparticles","reduced infection-associated symptoms","phenomenon of protein corona formation","nanoparticle tracking analysis","stronger antibody titers","increasing effort","splenic T-cell response","practical implications","features","solution","vaccination","morphological semblance","robust method","developing formulations","transmission electron microscopy","evidence of superior antiviral protection","immune processing","major thrust","ongoing battle","study","Comparison","inoculation","facile approach","animal agriculture"],"language":"en"},

The IHR(2005) require countries to assess the ability of their national structures, capacities, and resources to meet the minimum requirements for surveillance and response. This report describes the results of the assessment undertaken in Uganda. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional assessment using the protocol developed by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The data collection tools were adapted locally and administered to a convenience sample of HR(2005) stakeholders, and frequency analyses were performed. RESULTS: Ugandan national laws relevant to the IHR(2005) existed, but they did not adequately support the full implementation of the IHR(2005). Correspondingly, there was a designated IHR National Focal Point (NFP), but surveillance activities and operational communications were limited to the health sector. All the districts (13/13) had designated disease surveillance offices, most had IDSR technical guidelines (92%, or 12/13), and all (13/13) had case definitions for infectious and zoonotic diseases surveillance. Surveillance guidelines were available at 57% (35/61) of the health facilities, while case definitions were available at 66% (40/61) of the health facilities. The priority diseases list, surveillance guidelines, case definitions and reporting tools were based on the IDSR strategy and hence lacked information on the IHR(2005). The rapid response teams at national and district levels lacked food safety, chemical and radio-nuclear experts. Similarly, there were no guidelines on the outbreak response to food, chemical and radio-nuclear hazards. Comprehensive preparedness plans incorporating IHR(2005) were lacking at national and district levels. A national laboratory policy existed and the strategic plan was being drafted. However, there were critical gaps hampering the efficient functioning of the national laboratory network. Finally, the points of entry for IHR(2005) implementation had not been designated. CONCLUSIONS: The assessment highlighted critical gaps to guide the IHR(2005) planning process. The IHR(2005) action plan should therefore be developed to foster national and international public health security.","publish_time":"2010-12-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wamala, Joseph F; Okot, Charles; Makumbi, Issa; Natseri, Nasan; Kisakye, Annet; Nanyunja, Miriam; Bakamutumaho, Barnabas; Lutwama, Julius J; Sreedharan, Rajesh; Xing, Jun; Gaturuku, Peter; Aisu, Thomas; Da Silveira, Fernando; Chungong, Stella","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb0ba244ebf7524d9303edd3c52946f08560f597.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3005581.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21143831/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-10-s1-s9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjsxMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response","World Health Organisation","IHR National Focal Point"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Surveillance guidelines","designated IHR National Focal Point","national structures","surveillance activities","health facilities","national laboratory network","national laboratory policy","health sector","zoonotic diseases surveillance","designated disease surveillance offices","case definitions","International Health Regulations","context of Integrated Disease Surveillance","Ugandan national laws relevant","IDSR technical guidelines","World Health Organisation","outbreak response","international public health security","district levels","rapid response teams","IDSR strategy","results","critical gaps","implementation","radio-nuclear experts","radio-nuclear hazards","descriptive cross-sectional assessment","food safety","reporting tools","strategic plan","action plan","priority diseases list","data collection tools","NFP","protocol","efficient functioning","resources","operational communications","stakeholders","ability","capacities","minimum requirements","Comprehensive preparedness plans","CONCLUSIONS","information","convenience sample of HR","points of entry","frequency analyses","METHODS","districts","planning process","countries","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Of these patients, 729 were positive for RSV-A (51.2%, 373/729) or RSV-B (48.8%, 356/729), but none was infected with both viruses. Two seasonal peaks in total RSV were detected at the changes from winter to spring and from summer to autumn. RSV-B was dominant in 2013 and RSV-A in 2015, whereas RSV-A and RSV-B cocirculated in 2014. The clinical presentations of 645 RSV-positive patients were analyzed. Bronchiolitis, dyspnea, coryza, vomiting, poor appetite, and diarrhea occurred more frequently in RSV-A-positive than RSV-B-positive patients, whereas chill, headache, myalgia, debility, and rash etc. were more frequent in RSV-B-positive than RSV-A-positive patients, suggesting specific clinical characteristics for RSV-A and RSV-B. Coinfectons with other pathogens were common and diverse. Bronchiolitis, fever (\u2265 38\u00B0C), and poor appetite were more frequent in patients with single RSV infections than in coinfected patients, suggesting the key pathogenic activity of RSV.

GAAPs regulate Ca(2\u002B) levels and fluxes from the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum, confer resistance to a broad range of apoptotic stimuli, promote cell adhesion and migration via the activation of store-operated Ca(2\u002B) entry, are essential for the viability of human cells, and affect orthopoxvirus virulence. GAAPs are oligomeric, multi-transmembrane proteins that are resident in Golgi membranes and form cation-selective ion channels that may explain the multiple functions of these proteins. Residues contributing to the ion-conducting pore have been defined and provide the first clues about the mechanistic link between these very different functions of GAAP. Although GAAPs are naturally oligomeric, they can also function as monomers, a feature that distinguishes them from other virus-encoded ion channels that must oligomerize for function.

Four lipophilic ester derivatives of EGCG, namely EGCG-O-tetrastearate, EGCG-O-tetraeicosapentaenoate, EGCG-O-tetradocosahexaenoate, and EGCG-O-octabutyrate, were prepared and evaluated for their antioxidant and antiviral activities in vitro. Incorporation of fatty acids, especially the long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), into EGCG resulted in increased peroxyl radical scavenging activity, as measured by ORAC (oxygen radical absorbance capacity) assay, and metal chelation capacity. However, the esters exhibited decreased reducing power. Antiviral activities of EGCG derivatives were remarkably higher than the parent EGCG molecule, which showed relatively weak effects. The EGCG\u2013PUFA esters were 1700-fold more effective in inhibiting hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease than the positive control embelin.

Sequence analysis reveals of the S1 gene of JX17 the highest nucleotide identity of 98.15% with that of GI-7 genotype TW2575/98 strain. Furthermore, whole genome analysis among JX17 and other 18 IBV strains demonstrates that JX17 has the highest nucleotide identity of 95.94% with GI-19 genotype YX10 strain. Among all genes of JX17 except the S1 gene, the N gene and 3\u2019 UTR have the highest identity to GI-13 genotype 4/91 strain and the rest genes are the most identical to GI-19 genotype YX10 strain.

Previous studies represent view either by simple pictorial description of a scene, or by rather sophisticated mathematical methods. Both hinder proper allocation of a premium for different view obstruction levels for high-rise high-density urban environments. View obstruction level and the applicable premium are useful information for stakeholders of the property market for making optimum decisions. Accordingly, there is a need to develop a simple parameter for assessing view obstruction level. While view is difficult to define, reference is made to law cases which often settle view disputes by the extent of daylight obstruction. Shading mask is typically used to assess availability of daylight outside a residential unit and hence is an ideal parameter for assessing view obstruction. Computation of shading mask values (SMK) is a very complex task that needs meticulous site surveys, 3D drafting skills, and computer simulations. They are too effort intensive for stakeholders. This paper summarizes the relevant considerations and the case studies conducted to establish the average angle of unobstructed sky (\u03B8) as a simple parameter to represent mean SMK for assessing view obstruction. Correlation analysis of mean SMK of 708 case study residential units determined by the detailed computer simulation method and the corresponding angle of unobstructed sky showed that the latter can be used to assess view obstruction adequately close to simulation predictions. Given average angle of unobstructed sky can easily be determined based on the geometrical primitives of a residential unit, this can enable future allocation of a premium for different view obstruction levels for stakeholders.","publish_time":"2012-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fung, Y.

Piet Herdewijn (Hol\u00FD Award) used evolutionary pressure to select DNA polymerases that accept nucleoside analogs.

These topics were discussed further in other presentations \u2013 a cure seems to be a distant prospect but there are exciting developments for reducing HIV transmission. TDF-containing vaginal rings and GSK-744, as a long-lasting injection, offer great hope. There were three mini-symposia. Although therapy with TDF/FTC gives excellent control of HBV replication, there are only a few patients who achieve a functional cure. Myrcludex, an entry inhibitor, is active against both HBV and HDV. The recent progress with HBV replication in cell cultures has transformed the search for new antiviral compounds. The HBV capsid protein has been recognized as key player in HBV DNA synthesis. Unexpectedly, compounds which enhance capsid formation, markedly reduce HBV DNA synthesis.

Recently, the enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli was characterized using a HPLC assay to monitor the formation of products from 11 peptide substrates covering the cleavage sites found in the SARS viral genome. This protease easily dissociated into inactive monomer and the deduced K d of the dimer was 100\u03BCM. In order to detect enzyme activity, the assay needed to be performed at micromolar enzyme concentration. This makes finding the tight inhibitor (nanomolar range IC50) impossible. In this study, we prepared a peptide with fluorescence quenching pair (Dabcyl and Edans) at both ends of a peptide substrate and used this fluorogenic peptide substrate to characterize SARS main protease and screen inhibitors. The fluorogenic peptide gave extremely sensitive signal upon cleavage catalyzed by the protease. Using this substrate, the protease exhibits a significantly higher activity (k cat=1.9s\u22121 and K m =17 \u03BC M) compared to the previously reported parameters. Under our assay condition, the enzyme stays as an active dimer without dissociating into monomer and reveals a small K d value (15nM). This enzyme in conjunction with fluorogenic peptide substrate provides us a suitable tool for identifying potent inhibitors of SARS protease.","publish_time":"2004-06-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuo, Chih-Jung; Chi, Ya-Hui; Hsu, John T.-A; Liang, Po-Huang","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3638847901276b68bc15b506fcdb986c4ac1dcb4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134607.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X04008526; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X04008526","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs0MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fluorogenic peptide substrate","Abstract SARS main protease","potent inhibitors of SARS protease","peptide substrates","enzyme activity","anti-SARS drugs","SARS viral genome","micromolar enzyme concentration","life cycle of SARS coronavirus","HPLC assay","assay condition","cleavage sites","screen inhibitors","d value","inactive monomer","higher activity","active dimer","suitable tool","key target","nanomolar range IC50","Dabcyl","fluorescence quenching pair","tight inhibitor","formation of products","sensitive signal","Edans","conjunction","Escherichia coli","cat","nM","\u03BCM","order","reported parameters","study"],"language":"en"},

Disease is mostly limited to the upper airways and is self-limiting, but a small percentage can progress to lower respiratory tract infections as bronchiolitis and pneumonia.

The most important etiologic agents of severe lower respiratory illness are bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae and viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus. Efficacious vaccines are available against the two bacteria and the influenza virus. Viruses are much more important in mild upper and middle respiratory tract infections and in bronchiolitis in children, whereas bacteria are the main cause of pneumonia, especially in adults. Clinical syndromes overlap considerably, and there is increasing evidence of bacterial-viral co-infections and of bacterial pneumonia being secondary to viral respiratory tract infection.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Doorn, H.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) represent a family of zoonotic viruses with wide variety of animal hosts, including birds and humans. The infections caused by coronaviruses vary from mild to severe, depending on the viral species and the host. Since the coronaviruses exhibit extraordinary large RNA genome, also the rate of homologous recombination is high, which in turn contributes to the genetic diversity and interspecies host-switches of CoVs. The emergence of novel CoVs has been rich during the last decades, and wild birds seem to serve as reservoirs for a variety of CoV strains. We examined the CoVs circulating among wild birds in Finland. Materials and methods: Samples (cloacal swab, tracheal swab, oropharyngeal swab, or tissue) representing 61 bird species were collected during 2010-2013, and examined by RT-PCR targeting the RdRp gene for the presence of CoV RNA. Results: Altogether 51/939 (5.4%) of the examined birds were found positive by RT-PCR. Diverse gamma- and deltacoronavirus sequences were detected. Discussion: Gamma- and deltacoronaviruses circulate among wild birds in Finland. The number of CoV-positive birds detected each year varies greatly.","publish_time":"2017-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hepojoki, Satu; Lindh, Erika; Vapalahti, Olli; Huovilainen, Anita","journal":"Infect Ecol Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/10f63acdd41437902fb627803c57d57dec2c4716.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6369310.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/20008686.2017.1408360; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30788065/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ3LmNzdjs0MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1684789,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:49Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xxdQVNgCOFOVG6VdcWlARA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_47.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CoV RNA"],"locations":["Finland"],"keyphrases":["wild birds","examined birds","positive birds","Migratory birds","number of CoV","number of zoonotic viruses","cloacal swab","oropharyngeal swab","tracheal swab","family of zoonotic viruses","variety of CoV strains","presence of CoV RNA","emergence of novel CoVs","RT-PCR","Finland","wide variety of animal hosts","Diverse gamma","viral species","bird species","interspecies host-switches","extraordinary large RNA genome","Samples","RdRp gene","genetic diversity","tissue","deltacoronaviruses","reservoirs","rate of homologous recombination","turn","methods","ability","distant geographic locations","Materials","deltacoronavirus sequences","Introduction","humans","decades","year","Discussion","infections","Results"],"language":"en"},

To investigate the occurrence of STEC among grazing dromedaries from Kenya, E. coli isolated from fecal matter collected from 163 dromedaries on a large ranch were screened for the presence of stx1 and stx2. STEC strains were isolated and serotyped. Isolates were subjected to PCR for the subtyping of stx genes and for the detection of eae and ehx. In addition, whole genome sequencing (WGS) was carried out to detect further virulence genes and to determine the multilocus sequence types (MLST). Antimicrobial resistance profiles were determined by disk diffusion. STEC was isolated from 20 (12.3%) of the fecal samples. Thereof, nine (45%) isolates were STEC O156:H25, three (15%) isolates typed STEC O43:H2. The remaining isolates occurred as single serotypes or were O non-typeable. Eleven (55%) of the isolates harboured stx2a, nine (45%) eae, and 14 (70%) ehx, respectively. WGS revealed the presence of iss in 16 (80%), subAB in four (20%) and astA in two (10%) of the isolates, Furthermore, espA, tccP, nleA, nleB, tccP, and tir were found exclusively among STEC O156:H25. Eleven different sequence types (ST) were detected. The most prominent was ST300/ST5343, which comprised STEC O156:H25. All STEC isolates were pan susceptible to a panel of 16 antimicrobial agents. Overall, the results indicate that dromedary camels in Kenya may be reservoirs of STEC, including serotypes possessing virulence markers associated to disease in humans, such as STEC O156:H25. STEC in camels may represent a health hazard for humans with close contact to camels or to consumers of camel derived foodstuffs, such as unpasteurised camel milk.","publish_time":"2019-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baschera, Melinda; Cernela, Nicole; Stevens, Marc J.A.; Liljander, Anne; Jores, J\u00F6rg; Corman, Victor Max; N\u00FCesch-Inderbinen, Magdalena; Stephan, Roger","journal":"One Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c93f00ba900315d3b2ac23258d8ab75d63d366cf.json; document_parses/pdf_json/baa537985930872fc2fd9fe0865ab810cf978b6f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6416407.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2019.100087; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352771418300648; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30911597/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771418300648","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs0ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Shiga","Escherichia coli","E. coli"],"organizations":["STEC","WGS"],"locations":["Kenya"],"keyphrases":["STEC isolates","STEC O156","reservoirs of STEC","occurrence of STEC","STEC strains","STEC O43","remaining isolates","H25","humans","Kenya","tccP","dromedary camels","virulence genes","WGS","ehx","multilocus sequence types","different sequence types","bloody diarrhoea","Escherichia coli","single serotypes","grazing dromedaries","virulence markers","antimicrobial agents","presence of stx1","presence of iss","fecal matter","detection of eae","fecal samples","O non-typeable","unpasteurised camel milk","subtyping of stx genes","Antimicrobial resistance profiles","consumers of camel derived foodstuffs","cause gastrointestinal illnesses","HC","close contact","haemorrhagic colitis","health hazard","nleB","disease","nleA","panel","PCR","espA","ST5343","tir","haemolytic uremic syndrome","disk diffusion","Shiga toxin","HUS","addition","genome sequencing","large ranch","MLST","results","ST300","stx2a","subAB","astA"],"language":"en"},

Presently, the GWAS Catalog includes \u003E 2800 human studies. Of these, only a minority have investigated the susceptibility to infectious diseases or the response to therapies for the treatment or prevention of infections. Despite their limited application in the field, GWASs have provided valuable insights by pinpointing associations to both innate and adaptive immune response loci, as well as novel unexpected risk factors for infection susceptibility. Herein, we discuss some issues and caveats of GWASs for infectious diseases, we review the most recent findings ensuing from these studies, and we provide a brief summary of selected GWASs for infections in non-human mammals. We conclude that, although the general trend in the field of complex traits is to shift from GWAS to next-generation sequencing, important knowledge on infectious disease-related traits can be still gained by GWASs, especially for those conditions that have never been investigated using this approach. We suggest that future studies will benefit from the leveraging of information from the host\u0027s and pathogen\u0027s genomes, as well as from the exploration of models that incorporate heterogeneity across populations and phenotypes. Interactions within HLA genes or among HLA variants and polymorphisms located outside the major histocompatibility complex may also play an important role in shaping the susceptibility and response to invading pathogens.","publish_time":"2017-09-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mozzi, Alessandra; Pontremoli, Chiara; Sironi, Manuela","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8388a6b2a13edf94c16b7cc931aba71223de0dcf.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a5f1bec6c50bd7278f4770d4425a32ecdcd2cd11.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d6b964a23365d0162ba9fe01b6b59be0ba1d8d54.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106304.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2017.09.028; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134817303349; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28951201/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134817303349","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs1MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GWAS","HLA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious diseases","caveats of GWASs","complex diseases","human studies","field of complex traits","future studies","infectious disease-related traits","brief summary of selected GWASs","infection susceptibility","Genome-wide association studies","major histocompatibility complex","important knowledge","adaptive immune response loci","HLA genes","HLA variants","important role","prevention of infections","genetic factors","GWAS Catalog","non-human mammals","novel unexpected risk factors","pinpointing associations","polymorphisms","valuable insights","generation sequencing","therapies","heterogeneity","host\u0027s","leveraging of information","treatment","general trend","populations","pathogen\u0027s genomes","Interactions","limited application","issues","exploration of models","recent findings","phenotypes","pathogens","minority","conditions","approach"],"language":"en"},

The ability of a virus to modulate the immune response can have a pivotal effect on the course of disease and the fate of the infected host. In this study, we sought to understand the immunological basis for the fatal encephalitis following infection with the murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-JHM, in contrast with the more attenuated MHV-A59. Distinct glial cell cytokine and chemokine response patterns were observed within 3 days after infection, became progressively more polarized during the course of infection and with the infiltration of leukocytes. In the brain, MHV-JHM infection induced strong accumulation of IFN\u03B2 mRNA relative to IFN\u03B3 mRNA. This trend was reversed in MHV-A59 infection and was accompanied by increased CD8 T cell infiltration into brain compared to MHV-JHM infection. Increased apoptosis appeared to contribute to the diminished presence of CD8 T cells in MHV-JHM-infected brain with the consequence of a lower potential for IFN\u03B3 production and antiviral activity. MHV-JHM infection also induced sustained mRNA accumulation of the innate immune response products interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1. Furthermore, high levels of macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03B1, MIP-1\u03B2, and MIP-2 mRNA were observed at the onset of MHV-JHM infection and correlated with a marked elevation in the number of macrophages in the brain on day 7 compared to MHV-A59 infection. These observations indicate that differences in the severity of viral encephalitis may reflect the differential ability of viruses to stimulate innate immune responses within the CNS and subsequently the character of infiltrating leukocyte populations.","publish_time":"2004-01-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rempel, Julia D.; Murray, Shannon J.; Meisner, Jeffrey; Buchmeier, Michael J.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e7be8a150296b55701950588570b7a56af1df56.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126141.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682203007189; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682203007189","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV-JHM infection","MHV-A59 infection","course of infection","onset of MHV","attenuated MHV-A59","IFN\u03B3 mRNA","infected brain","MIP","sustained mRNA accumulation","innate immune response products interleukin","innate immune responses","fatal encephalitis","increased CD8 T cell infiltration","severity of viral encephalitis","Abstract Viral encephalitis","strong accumulation of IFN\u03B2 mRNA relative","chemokine response patterns","IFN\u03B3 production","course of disease","infiltration of leukocytes","infected host","Increased apoptosis","diminished presence of CD8 T cells","mouse hepatitis virus","differential ability of viruses","Distinct glial cell cytokine","murine coronavirus","lower potential","consequence","inflammatory protein","CNS","pivotal effect","global health concern","antiviral activity","number of macrophages","marked elevation","high levels of macrophage","fate","differences","contrast","character of infiltrating leukocyte populations","immunological basis","days","observations","trend","study"],"language":"en"},

Taken together, the Central European PEDV strains showed rather low virulence under experimental conditions, and pre-inoculation of sows led to a solid protection of their offspring.

To establish a foundation for evaluation of the immune function, cheetah peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) were stimulated by a panel of six mitogens, and responses compared with those of domestic cat PBM. Individual responses in both species were variable, but evenly distributed throughout the range of stimulation for each mitogen. Proliferation by PBM from domestic cats occured within the same range as that of the cheetahs. However, a significantly lower response to peanut agglutinin (PNA) was observed with domestic cat PBM. Although responses varied between animals, certain individual cheetahs were consistent responders. The decreased values could not be explained by lack of IL-2 responsiveness since exogenous IL-2 significantly enhanced mitogen-stimulated proliferation in 11 of 12 cheetahs tested. The phenotypic distribution of domestic cat and cheetah lymphocyte subpopulations was similar as assessed by immunofluorescence staining for surface immunoglobulin (sIg) and cytotoxic T (Tc) cells (using a specific monoclonal antibody, FT2). Values for B cells (31.2% sIg\u002B) and Tc (28.7% FT2 \u002B) were slightly higher in domestic cats as compared with cheetah PBM (13.3% sIg\u002B; 19.0% FT2\u002B). Even though no species-specific deficits were detected, a significant negative correlation between PHA-stimulated proliferation and percent FT2\u002B (Tc) cheetah cells was observed. This indicates that proliferation can be used indirectly to assess relative numbers of functional T helper cells in cheetahs. Our studies suggest that these aspects of the cheetah\u0027s immune system are comparable with the domestic cat, and establish a basis for in vitro assays evaluating antigen-specific responses.","publish_time":"1991-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miller-Edge, M.; Worley, M.","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c8cd1309905bf4fc1c0c19a7a290cbc65f7f0e53.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016524279190125V; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/016524279190125V","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PBM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["domestic cat PBM","cheetah cells","cheetah PBM","domestic cats","B cells","phenotypic distribution of domestic cat","Tc","Individual responses","certain individual cheetahs","PHA-stimulated proliferation","percent FT2","enhanced mitogen-stimulated proliferation","cheetah peripheral blood mononuclear cells","apparent susceptibility of cheetahs","immune system deficits","antigen-specific responses","immune function","cheetah lymphocyte subpopulations","cheetah\u0027s immune system","lack of IL","relative numbers of functional T helper cells","cytotoxic T","exogenous IL","species-specific deficits","range of stimulation","decreased values","specific monoclonal antibody","Abstract Lack of genetic variability","Acinonyx jubatus","PNA","significant negative correlation","immunofluorescence staining","surface immunoglobulin","animals","coronavirus infection","consistent responders","lower response","peanut agglutinin","aspects","speculation","assays","responsiveness","evaluation","basis","foundation","variable","panel","mitogens","studies"],"language":"en"},

The crystal structure at 3.38 \u00C5 resolution of SARS-CoV nsp14 in complex with its cofactor nsp10 adds to the uniqueness of CoVs among RNA viruses: The MTase domain presents a new fold that differs sharply from the canonical Rossmann fold.","publish_time":"2017-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ferron, Fran\u00E7ois; Subissi, Lorenzo; Silveira De Morais, Ana Theresa; Le, Nhung Thi Tuyet; Sevajol, Marion; Gluais, Laure; Decroly, Etienne; Vonrhein, Clemens; Bricogne, G\u00E9rard; Canard, Bruno; Imbert, Isabelle","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e02eafe4f4b0a23ce3454c773a3f9b9e4309f526.json; document_parses/pdf_json/90a8e1eac089a7ef7f283bf1d9aa1c9eca7fe924.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5777078.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29279395/; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1718806115; https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/2/E162.full.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs2NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rossmann"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA viruses","RNA synthesis","CoV nsp14","low-fidelity nsp12 viral RNA polymerase","RNA cap guanine N7-methyltransferase","association of nsp14","uniqueness of CoVs","CoVs code","proofreading pathway","MTase domain","new fold","\u00C5 resolution of SARS","viral genetic stability","low mutation rates","canonical Rossmann fold","ExoN excises nucleotide mismatches","bifunctional enzyme","cofactor nsp10","complex","severe acute respiratory syndrome","inactivation","antiviral compound ribavirin","crystal structure","monophosphate","large genomes","exoribonuclease","activities","end","limited efficacy","Coronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

Evidence on vaccine development costs for such diseases is scarce. Our goal was to estimate the minimum cost for achieving vaccine research and development preparedness targets in a portfolio of 11 epidemic infectious diseases, accounting for vaccine pipeline constraints and uncertainty in research and development preparedness outcomes. METHODS: We assembled a pipeline of 224 vaccine candidates from preclinical through to phase 2 for 11 priority epidemic infectious diseases. We used a linear regression model to identify drivers of development costs from preclinical through to end of phase 2a. Drawing from published estimates of vaccine research and development probabilities of success, we simulated costs for advancing these 224 vaccine candidates through to the end of phase 2a. We combined these findings to determine minimum costs for progressing at least one vaccine through to the end of phase 2a per epidemic infectious disease by means of a stochastic optimisation model. FINDINGS: The cost of developing a single epidemic infectious disease vaccine from preclinical trials through to end of phase 2a is US$31\u201368 million (US$14\u2013159 million range), assuming no risk of failure. We found that previous licensure experience and indirect costs are upward drivers of research and development costs. Accounting for probability of success, the average cost of successfully advancing at least one epidemic infectious disease vaccine through to the end of phase 2a can vary from US$84\u2013112 million ($23 million\u2013$295 million range) starting from phase 2 to $319\u2013469 million ($137 million\u2013$1\u00B71 billion range) starting from preclinical. This cost includes the cumulative cost of failed vaccine candidates through the research and development process. Assuming these candidates and funding were made available, progressing at least one vaccine through to the end of phase 2a for each of the 11 epidemic infectious diseases would cost a minimum of $2\u00B78\u20133\u00B77 billion ($1\u00B72 billion\u2013$8\u00B74 billion range). INTERPRETATION: Our analysis provides new evidence on vaccine research and development pipelines and associated costs for 11 epidemic infectious diseases, highlighting both funding needs and research and development gaps for achieving vaccine research and development preparedness targets.

The TGEV membrane (M) protein is a decisive protein for the proliferation of viral proteins, and is associated with virus assembly and budding. To identify the cellular proteins that interact with the TGEV M protein, yeast two-hybrid screening was employed, and seven cellular proteins were identified M-binding partners. Using the GST pull-down approach and a CO-IP assay, the M protein was found to interact with porcine intestinal cells via eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4-alpha (EIF4A2), an essential component of the cellular translational machinery. Additionally, confocal microscopy revealed that EIF4A2 and M were colocalized in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the function of EIF4A2 in intestinal cells during TGEV infection was examined. A knockdown of EIF4A2 by siRNA markedly decreased M protein proliferation and TGEV replication in target cells. Thus demonstrating that EIF4A2 plays a significant role in TGEV replication. The present study provides mechanistic insight into the interaction between the TGEV M protein and intestinal cells which contributes to the understanding of coronavirus replication and may be useful for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for TGEV infection.","publish_time":"2019-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Zhenhui; Yang, Yang; Wang, Li; Wang, Kai; Ran, Ling; Xie, Yilu; Huang, LeiShi; Yang, Zhou; Yuan, Peng; Yu, Qiuhan","journal":"Research in Veterinary Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd90be0889655b15519305753b9433e3ce66a5c0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111847.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2018.12.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528818304508; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034528818304508; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30583231/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs3MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV","GST"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TGEV replication","TGEV infection","TGEV membrane","protein proliferation","decisive protein","knockdown of EIF4A2","function of EIF4A2","cellular proteins","porcine intestinal cells","target cells","understanding of coronavirus replication","enteropathogenic coronavirus","proliferation of viral proteins","cellular translational machinery","Abstract Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus","eukaryotic translation initiation factor","alpha","CO-IP assay","development of novel therapeutic strategies","essential component","interaction","siRNA","GST pull-down approach","high morbidity","mechanistic insight","mortality","sucking piglets","pigs","yeast","significant role","present study","hybrid screening","diarrhea","virus assembly","binding partners","budding","confocal microscopy","cytoplasm"],"language":"en"},

To overcome the barrier presented by the nuclear membrane and gain access to the nucleus, virally encoded proteins have evolved ways to appropriate components of the nuclear transport machinery. By binding karyopherins, or the nuclear pore complex, viral proteins influence their own transport as well as the transport of key cellular regulatory proteins. This review covers how viral proteins can interact with different components of the nuclear import machinery and how this influences viral replicative cycles. We also highlight the effects that viral perturbation of nuclear transport has on the infected host and how we can exploit viruses as tools to study novel mechanisms of protein nuclear import. Finally, we discuss the possibility that drugs targeting these transport pathways could be repurposed for treating viral infections.","publish_time":"2019-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tessier, Tanner M.; Dodge, Mackenzie J.; Prusinkiewicz, Martin A.; Mymryk, Joe S.","journal":"Cells","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c8f9c5d7e30e601b4ea6e3c42696177c57aa1c47.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6627039.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181773/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells8060559","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs3MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nuclear transport machinery","Protein nuclear transport","viral perturbation of nuclear transport","viral proteins","nuclear membrane","transport pathways","nuclear import machinery","viral infections","nuclear pore complex","transport of key cellular regulatory proteins","novel mechanisms of protein nuclear import","encoded proteins","influences viral replicative cycles","cellular pathways","appropriate components","different components","integral process","critical role","viruses","tools","nucleus","access","effects","binding karyopherins","infected host","possibility","drugs","barrier","review"],"language":"en"},

The chemical composition of the essential oil was analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A micro-well dilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) values of the essential oil and its major constituents. A model of Streptococcus pyogenes infection in mice was used to determine its in vivo activities. Lung and blood samples were obtained to assess bacterial cell counts. Toxicity evaluation of the essential oil and its components was completed by performing biochemical analysis of the serum, particularly monitoring aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, urea and creatinine. The essential oil exhibited potent antibacterial activity, whereas the two major constituents were less potent. The essential oil exhibited MIC values between 20 and 80 \u03BCg/ml, while the values of the two constituents were between 130 and 200 \u03BCg/ml. Scanning electron microscopy results demonstrated that the essential oil inhibited biofilm formation and altered its architecture. Survival curves indicated that the essential oil led to a reduction in the viability of different bacteria. The essential oil also induced significant leakage of potassium ions from S. pyogenes. The essential oil (100 \u03BCg/mouse) and grandisol (135 \u03BCg/mouse) significantly reduced the number of viable bacterial cells in the lungs (P\u003C0.01). However, intake of 100 \u03BCg/mouse of essential oil or grandisol 135 \u03BCg/mouse once or twice each day for 9 days did not produce any toxic effects in the mice.

This limits large-scale population testing and hinders the effort to identify and isolate infected individuals. OBJECTIVE: Herein, we developed and evaluated multi-stage group testing schemes that test samples in groups of various pool sizes in multiple stages. Through this approach, groups of negative samples can be eliminated with a single test, avoiding the need for individual testing and achieving considerable savings of resources. STUDY DESIGN: We designed and parameterized various multi-stage testing schemes and compared their efficiency at different prevalence rates using computer simulations. RESULTS: We found that three-stage testing schemes with pool sizes of maximum 16 samples can test up to three and seven times as many individuals with the same number of test kits for prevalence rates of around 5% and 1%, respectively. We propose an adaptive approach, where the optimal testing scheme is selected based on the expected prevalence rate. CONCLUSION: These group testing schemes could lead to a major reduction in the number of testing kits required and help improve large-scale population testing in general and in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eberhardt, J.N.; Breuckmann, N.P.; Eberhardt, C.S.","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3c4398f6b45ab207d73f7f7eeafc22078180b67.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7177109.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388468/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301244?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301244; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104382","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["individual testing","number of testing kits","multi-stage group testing schemes","optimal testing scheme","parameterized various multi-stage testing schemes","number of test kits","single test","groups of various pool sizes","groups of negative samples","different prevalence rates","pool sizes of maximum","limits large-scale population","expected prevalence rate","adaptive approach","infected individuals","efficiency","help","need","major reduction","computer simulations","multiple stages","considerable savings of resources","effort","SARS-CoV","critical shortage","current COVID","context","CONCLUSION","STUDY DESIGN","pandemic","BACKGROUND","countries","times","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

When the relationship is nonlinear, linear modeling techniques do not capture the nonlinear information content. Statistical learning (SL) techniques with kernels are capable of addressing nonlinear problems without making parametric assumptions. However, these techniques do not produce findings relevant for epidemiologic interpretations. A simulated case-control study was used to contrast the information embedding characteristics and separation boundaries produced by a specific SL technique with logistic regression (LR) modeling representing a parametric approach. The SL technique was comprised of a kernel mapping in combination with a perceptron neural network. Because the LR model has an important epidemiologic interpretation, the SL method was modified to produce the analogous interpretation and generate odds ratios for comparison. RESULTS: The SL approach is capable of generating odds ratios for main effects and risk factor interactions that better capture nonlinear relationships between exposure variables and outcome in comparison with LR. CONCLUSIONS: The integration of SL methods in epidemiology may improve both the understanding and interpretation of complex exposure/disease relationships.","publish_time":"2011-01-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heine, John J; Land, Walker H; Egan, Kathleen M","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5303b7430b20a5e665f7cadd07ae77baa5687e73.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3045299.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-12-37; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21272346/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs4OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SL","LR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SL approach","nonlinear relationships","specific SL technique","integration of SL methods","nonlinear problems","interpretation of complex exposure","nonlinear information content","odds ratios","exposure variables","important epidemiologic interpretation","analogous interpretation","LR model","linear modeling techniques","comparison","parametric approach","logistic regression","covariate interactions","disease relationships","epidemiologic interpretations","parametric assumptions","risk factor interactions","standard regression analyses","main effects","group associations","kernels","outcome","separation boundaries","combination","kernel mapping","response variable","perceptron neural network","epidemiology","findings relevant","understanding","Statistical learning","simulated case-control study","characteristics","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Pestiviruses are a group of virus species of the genus Pestivirus under the family Flaviviridae that can infect a wide variety of artiodactylous hosts, including swine and ruminants. Two classic types of pestiviruses, bovine viral diarrhea virus and classical swine fever virus, are important causative agents of mild-to-severe disease in bovine and swine hosts, respectively, and cause tremendous economic losses in these industries. Recent reports revealed that bats and rodents could also act as natural hosts of pestiviruses and an atypical porcine pestivirus, which cause disease in piglets, showed a close genetic relationship with a specific bat pestivirus, RaPestV-1. This study aimed to describe the detection and characterization of novel pestiviruses from bats and rodents in different locations by analyzing the available bat and rodent virome data from throughout China. Two bat pestivirus species and four rodent pestivirus species that are distinct from other known viruses were identified and sequenced. These viruses were identified from two bat species and four rodent species in different Chinese provinces. There were two distinct lineages present in these viruses, that differ from artiodactylous pestivirus. These findings expand our understanding of the genetic diversity of pestiviruses in bats and rodents and suggest the presence of a diverse set of pestiviruses in non-artiodactylous hosts. This study may provide new insight for the prevention of future viral disease outbreaks originating from bats and rodents.","publish_time":"2018-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Zhiqiang; Liu, Bo; Du, Jiang; Zhang, Junpeng; Lu, Liang; Zhu, Guangjian; Han, Yelin; Su, Haoxiang; Yang, Li; Zhang, Shuyi; Liu, Qiyong; Jin, Qi","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1dc7422f1716cf0750c974a86d1c5ac0b48d810.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6207626.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30405596/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.02562","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs5MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["bat pestivirus species","Bats","rodents","rodent pestivirus species","bat species","artiodactylous pestivirus","rodent species","natural hosts of pestiviruses","specific bat pestivirus","swine hosts","genus Pestivirus","group of virus species","genetic diversity of pestiviruses","diverse set of pestiviruses","classic types of pestiviruses","characterization of novel pestiviruses","atypical porcine pestivirus","non-artiodactylous hosts","available bat","known viruses","important zoonotic viruses","wide variety of artiodactylous hosts","bovine viral diarrhea virus","classical swine fever virus","severe disease","study","rodent virome data","prevention of future viral disease outbreaks","different locations","close genetic relationship","different Chinese provinces","distinct lineages present","important causative agents of mild","intermediate reservoirs","piglets","presence","new insight","family Flaviviridae","detection","understanding","tremendous economic losses","industries","China","Recent reports","RaPestV","ruminants","findings"],"language":"en"},

Gene therapy has the potential to meet this goal and the discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) has lead to a new class of highly selective therapeutics. However, initial enthusiasm is reduced due to safety concerns associated with virus-based delivery vectors that are used for in vivo delivery. Viral vectors for siRNA delivery into target cells are used because of their high target specificity and delivery efficacy (endosomal escape). Recent discoveries suggest that a specialized form of nano-sized lipid vesicles called exosomes can incorporate and transport functional RNAs into target cells and may serve as an attractive alternative. Evidence is accumulating that most pluricellular organisms sustain exosome-based communications via inter-cellular exchange of mRNA and miRNAs between cells. We discovered that viruses have found ways to exploit this communication pathway and we argue here that adaptations of exosomes imposed by viruses maybe exploited for superior delivery of RNA in vivo. We discuss recent discoveries in exosome biogenesis their physical properties, targeting and delivery strategies and how the knowledge of exosome production in virus infected cells could propel their entry into clinical settings.","publish_time":"2013-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koppers-Lalic, Danijela; Hogenboom, Marye M.; Middeldorp, Jaap M.; Pegtel, D.

The properties of the viral formulation, such as successful inactivation, preservation of hemagglutinin (HA) binding ability, fusion capacity and the potential to stimulate a Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) reporter cell line were then assessed and compared to the properties of the untreated virus. Inactivation with BPL resulted in undetectable infectivity levels, while FA-treated virus retained very low infectious titers. Hemagglutination and fusion ability were highly affected by those treatments that conferred higher inactivation, with BPL-treated virus binding and fusing at a lower degree compared to FA-inactivated samples. On the other hand, BPL-inactivated virus induced higher levels of activation of TLR7 than FA-inactivated virus. The alterations caused by BPL or FA treatments were virus strain dependent. This data shows that the inactivation procedures should be tailored on the virus strain, and that many other elements beside the concentration of the inactivating agent, such as incubation time and temperature, buffer and virus concentration, have to be defined to achieve a functional product.","publish_time":"2019-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Herrera-Rodriguez, Jos\u00E9; Signorazzi, Aurora; Holtrop, Marijke; de Vries-Idema, Jacqueline; Huckriede, Anke","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4482ed524bb82507ebcdc34c663fdd90d40dce5e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115651.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30765167/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X19301847; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.01.086; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X19301847","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs0NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BPL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus inactivation","FA-inactivated virus","BPL-inactivated virus","virus concentration","FA-treated virus","untreated virus","BPL-treated virus binding","live influenza virus","FA-inactivated samples","FA treatments","higher inactivation","different influenza virus strains","successful inactivation","inactivation procedures","effect of inactivation","production of inactivated vaccines","available inactivated influenza vaccines","TLR7","binding ability","fusion ability","production process","maximal concentration","properties","higher levels of activation","fusion capacity","undetectable infectivity levels","reporter cell line","incubation time","preservation of hemagglutinin","\u03B2-propiolactone","temperature","buffer","lower degree","inactivating agent","vast majority","low infectious titers","potential","receptor","viral formulation","egg","optimization","Toll","reagents","elements","Recommendations","formaldehyde","step","alterations","hand","manufacturers","Hemagglutination","data","functional product"],"language":"en"},

This study examined the experiences of frontline health care professionals in an Australian hospital during the outbreak, with a focus on participant views on information, training and preparedness, to inform future outbreak preparedness planning. Study design Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 healthcare professionals involved in Ebola preparedness planning, at a hospital in Australia. Methods The data were systematically coded to discover key themes in participants\u0027 accounts of Ebola preparedness. Results Three key themes identified were: 1) the impact of high volumes of\u2014often inconsistent\u2014information, which shaped participants\u0027 trust in authority; 2) barriers to engagement in training, including the perceived relative risk Ebola presented; and finally, 3) practical and environmental impediments to preparedness. Conclusions These clinicians\u0027 accounts of Ebola preparedness reveal a range of important factors which may influence the relative success of outbreak preparedness and provide guidance for future responses. In particular, they illustrate the critical importance of clear communication and guidelines for staff engagement with, and implementation of training. An important outcome of this study was how individual assessments of risk and trust are produced via, and overlap with, the dynamics of communication, training and environmental logistics. Consideration of the dynamic ways in which these issues intersect is crucial for fostering an environment that is suitable for managing an infectious threat such as Ebola.","publish_time":"2017-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Broom, J.; Broom, A.; Bowden, V.","journal":"Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f68306bbf533e9680d9665da84996e2ba1ea32b6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118746.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350616303900; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350616303900; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28159021/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2016.11.008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs0OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["West Africa","Australia","Ebola"],"keyphrases":["Ebola preparedness planning","Ebola outbreak","participants\u0027 accounts of Ebola preparedness","clinicians\u0027 accounts of Ebola preparedness","future outbreak preparedness planning","relative success of outbreak preparedness","perceived relative risk Ebola","implementation of training","information","participants\u0027 trust","key themes","healthcare professionals","staff engagement","Australian hospital","dynamics of communication","future responses","environmental impediments","environmental logistics","important outcome","Study design Semi-structured interviews","individual assessments of risk","range of important factors","critical importance of clear communication","experiences of frontline health care professionals","guidelines","West Africa","participant views","guidance","hospitals","challenges","focus","authority","barriers","Conclusions","potential emergence","issues","dynamic ways","contagious diseases","impact of high volumes","infectious threat","Abstract Objectives","Consideration","data","Results","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Pyridoxylidenephloroglucinol is synthesized by Knoevenagel condensation of the vitamin B(6) aldehyde pyridoxal with phloroglucinol. Pyridoxylidenephloroglucinol rearranges to light-yellow (4\u2032RS)-1\u2032,4\u2032-dihydrobananin by refluxing in 5 M hydrochloric acid. Air oxidation subsequently forms BN in the heat which immediately yields orange-yellow (4\u2032RS)-4\u2032-chloro-1\u2032,4\u2032-dihydrobananin by 1,4-addition of hydrogen chloride. This intermediate could be isolated but, interestingly, not a BN hydrochloride. Brown BN is finally achieved by base-catalyzed elimination of hydrogen chloride from (4\u2032RS)-4\u2032-chloro-1\u2032,4\u2032-dihydrobananin. Regarding possible biological activities, it was demonstrated that BN acts as zinc (Zn(2\u002B)) chelator. Therefore, a target of interest could be the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) zinc finger HIV-1 RNA-binding nucleocapsid protein p7 (NCp7). Through suggested zinc ejection from HIV-1 genomic RNA \u03C8-element-binding and HIV-1\u2013RNA-duplex packaging NCp7 by BN, thus rendering NCp7 functionally obsolete, it is deduced that HIV-1 replication and effective infectious virion encapsidation could be inhibited by BN. Furthermore, theoretical and structural considerations propose that BN is converted into bananin 5\u2032-monophosphate (BNP) by the cell type-ubiquitous human enzyme pyridoxal kinase (EC 2.7.1.35). Together with the putative antilentiviral retinoid vitamin A\u2013vitamin B(6) conjugate analogue B6RA (Kesel, A. J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2003, 300, 793), BNP is postulated to serve as effector in a system of protein target sequences RX(D/E) of RNA virus components. Human immunodeficiency Retroviridae (HIVs) could possibly be influenced by B6RA and BNP. In addition, candidate targets of B6RA and BNP could be adsorption, transcription and/or viral RNA replication of an interestingly wide RNA virus selection including Picornaviridae (poliovirus, human coxsackievirus, hepatitis A virus), Flaviviridae (yellow fever virus, Dengue virus, West Nile virus, Kunjin virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, hepatitis C virus), Togaviridae (rubella virus), Coronaviridae (human coronavirus, human SARS-associated coronavirus), Rhabdoviridae (rabies virus), Paramyxoviridae (human parainfluenza virus, measles virus, human respiratory syncytial virus), Filoviridae (Marburg virus, Ebola virus), Bornaviridae (Borna disease virus), Bunyaviridae (Hantaan virus), Arenaviridae (Lassa virus), and Reoviridae (human rotavirus).

This shared niche provides the opportunity for virus\u2013virus interactions which have the potential to affect individual infection risks and in turn influence dynamics of infection at population scales. However, quantitative evidence for interactions has lacked suitable data and appropriate analytical tools. Here, we expose and quantify interactions among respiratory viruses using bespoke analyses of infection time series at the population scale and coinfections at the individual host scale. We analyzed diagnostic data from 44,230 cases of respiratory illness that were tested for 11 taxonomically broad groups of respiratory viruses over 9 y. Key to our analyses was accounting for alternative drivers of correlated infection frequency, such as age and seasonal dependencies in infection risk, allowing us to obtain strong support for the existence of negative interactions between influenza and noninfluenza viruses and positive interactions among noninfluenza viruses. In mathematical simulations that mimic 2-pathogen dynamics, we show that transient immune-mediated interference can cause a relatively ubiquitous common cold-like virus to diminish during peak activity of a seasonal virus, supporting the potential role of innate immunity in driving the asynchronous circulation of influenza A and rhinovirus. These findings have important implications for understanding the linked epidemiological dynamics of viral respiratory infections, an important step towards improved accuracy of disease forecasting models and evaluation of disease control interventions.","publish_time":"2019-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nickbakhsh, Sema; Mair, Colette; Matthews, Louise; Reeve, Richard; Johnson, Paul C.

A virus from the family Coronaviridae has been identified as the cause, but the pathogenesis is still unclear. Methods Post-mortem tissue samples from six patients who died from SARS in February and March, 2003, and an open lung biopsy from one of these patients were studied by histology and virology. Only one full autopsy was done. Evidence of infection with the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and human metapneumovirus was sought by reverse-transcriptase PCR and serology. Pathological samples were examined by light and electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Findings All six patients had serological evidence of recent infection with SARS-CoV. Diffuse alveolar damage was common but not universal. Morphological changes identified were bronchial epithelial denudation, loss of cilia, and squamous metaplasia. Secondary bacterial pneumonia was present in one case. A giant-cell infiltrate was seen in four patients, with a pronounced increase in macrophages in the alveoli and the interstitium of the lung. Haemophagocytosis was present in two patients. The alveolar pneumocytes also showed cytomegaly with granular amphophilic cytoplasm. The patient for whom full autopsy was done had atrophy of the white pulp of the spleen. Electron microscopy revealed viral particles in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells corresponding to coronavirus. Interpretation SARS is associated with epithelial-cell proliferation and an increase in macrophages in the lung. The presence of haemophagocytosis supports the contention that cytokine dysregulation may account, at least partly, for the severity of the clinical disease. The case definition of SARS should acknowledge the range of lung pathology associated with this disease.

IBV causes substantial worldwide economic losses in the poultry industry. Vaccination with live-attenuated viral vaccines, therefore, are of critical importance. Live-attenuated viral vaccines, however, exhibit the potential for reversion to virulence and recombination with virulent field strains. Therefore, alternatives such as subunit vaccines are needed together with the identification of suitable adjuvants, as subunit vaccines are less immunogenic than live-attenuated vaccines. Several glycan-based adjuvants directly targeting mammalian C-type lectin receptors were assessed in vitro using chicken bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DCs). The \u03B2-1-6-glucan, pustulan, induced an up-regulation of MHC class II (MHCII) cell surface expression, potentiated a strong proinflammatory cytokine response, and increased endocytosis in a cation-dependent manner. Ex vivo co-culture of peripheral blood monocytes from IBV-immunised chickens, and BM-DCs pulsed with pustulan-adjuvanted recombinant IBV N protein (rN), induced a strong recall response. Pustulan-adjuvanted rN induced a significantly higher CD4\u002B blast percentage compared to either rN, pustulan or media. However, the CD8\u002B and TCR\u03B3\u03B4\u002B blast percentage were significantly lower with pustulan-adjuvanted rN compared to pustulan or media. Thus, pustulan enhanced the efficacy of MHCII antigen presentation, but apparently not the cross-presentation on MHCI. In conclusion, we found an immunopotentiating effect of pustulan in vitro using chicken BM-DCs. Thus, future in vivo studies might show pustulan as a promising glycan-based adjuvant for use in the poultry industry to contain the spread of coronaviridiae as well as of other avian viral pathogens.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Larsen, Frederik T; Guldbrandtsen, Bernt; Christensen, Dennis; Pitcovski, Jacob; Kj\u00E6rup, Rikke B; Dalgaard, Tina S","journal":"Vaccines","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32429204/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8020226","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs1NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","MHC","MHCI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Pustulan-adjuvanted rN","viral vaccines","attenuated vaccines","immunopotentiating effect of pustulan","subunit vaccines","pustulan-adjuvanted recombinant IBV N protein","chicken BM-DCs","IBV-immunised chickens","poultry industry","blast percentage","glycan-based adjuvants","avian viral pathogens","media","strong recall response","strong proinflammatory cytokine response","promising glycan-based adjuvant","efficacy of MHCII antigen presentation","cross-presentation","identification of suitable adjuvants","contagious avian coronavirus","chicken bone marrow-derived dendritic cells","increased endocytosis","co-culture of peripheral blood monocytes","virulence","recombination","cell surface expression","use","mammalian C-type lectin receptors","substantial worldwide economic losses","higher CD4","virulent field strains","regulation of MHC class","reversion","TCR\u03B3\u03B4","potential","cation-dependent manner","Infectious bronchitis virus","spread of coronaviridiae","CD8","studies","Vaccination","conclusion","glucan","alternatives","critical importance"],"language":"en"},

Complete recovery and rapid yet safe return to participation are critical for competitive athletes. Alterations in thermoregulation, metabolism, fluid homeostasis, muscle strength, and endurance, as well as potential complications for the athlete and others, must be considered. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The PubMed database was searched (1970-2013) for all English-language articles related to febrile illness in sport, using the keywords fever, febrile, body temperature, thermoregulation, infection, illness, disease, exercise, athlete, sport, performance, return to play, metabolism, hydration, and dehydration. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical review. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4. RESULTS: Limited data confirm that febrile illness is correlated with alterations in the body\u2019s thermoregulatory system, with increases in metabolic rate, and with effects in fluid homeostasis. Human and animal studies demonstrate a decrease in muscle strength and endurance secondary to muscle catabolism in febrile illness. However, indirect evidence suggests that regular exercise enhances the immune response. No strong clinical research has been published on return to play during or following acute febrile illness, excluding mononucleosis and myocarditis. CONCLUSION: Fever is correlated with an increase in insensible fluid losses, dehydration, metabolic demands, and dysregulation of body temperature. Fever can have detrimental effects on the musculoskeletal system, including decreasing strength and endurance, generalized muscle catabolism, and increase in perceived fatigue.

The livestock industry is faced with the double constraint of limiting its use of natural resources and antimicrobials while ensuring its economic sustainability. In this context, reliable methods are needed to evaluate the effect of the prevention of endemic animal diseases on the productivity of livestock production systems. In this study, an epidemiological and productivity model was used to link changes in Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD) incidence with the productivity of the beef and dairy cattle sectors in France. Cattle production parameters significantly affected by BRD were selected through literature review. Previous field study results and national cattle performance estimates were used to infer growth performances, mortality rates and carcass quality in the cattle affected and not affected by BRD. A steady-state deterministic herd production model was used to predict the productivity of the dairy and beef sector and their defined compartments (breeding-fattening, feedlot young bulls, and feedlot veal) in case of BRD incidence reduction by 20%, 50% or 100%. Results suggested that BRD should be controlled at a priority in beef breeding farms as eradication of BRD in beef calves would increase the whole beef sector\u2019s productivity by 4.7\u20135.5% while eradication in other production stages would result in lower productivity gain in their respective sectors. However, the analysis performed at compartment level showed that, in both the beef and dairy sector, young bull and veal feedlot enterprises derive more economic benefits from BRD eradication for their own compartment (increase in productivity of 8.7\u201312.8% for beef young bulls) than the breeding farms (increase in productivity of 5.1\u20136% for beef calves), which may limit the investments in BRD control.","publish_time":"2017-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Delabouglise, Alexis; James, Andrew; Valarcher, Jean-Fran\u00E7ois; Haggl\u00FCnd, Sara; Raboisson, Didier; Rushton, Jonathan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef3260e6249c01ae263e65c11e59fe0279f70277.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5716546.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29206855/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0189090","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs2NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BRD"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["beef sector\u2019s productivity","eradication of BRD","BRD eradication","productivity model","beef calves","BRD control","beef breeding farms","beef young bulls","productivity of livestock production systems","lower productivity gain","dairy cattle sectors","Cattle production parameters","case of BRD incidence reduction","increase","feedlot young bulls","feedlot veal","dairy sector","production stages","veal feedlot enterprises","breeding-fattening","livestock industry","national cattle performance estimates","steady-state deterministic herd production model","impact of livestock farming","economic benefits","Previous field study results","respective sectors","economic sustainability","compartment level","growth performances","changes","defined compartments","mortality rates","carcass quality","prevention of endemic animal diseases","antimicrobials","environment","Bovine Respiratory Disease","priority","use of natural resources","effect","double constraint","public health","France","reliable methods","context","analysis","literature review","investments","Concerns"],"language":"en"},

However, there is no benchmark to compare the occurrence of hospital outbreaks across hospitals. Methods We implemented proactive infection control measures with an emphasis on timely education of health care workers and hospitalized patients at Queen Mary Hospital, a teaching hospital. Our benchmarked performance (outbreak episodes per 1 million patient discharges and 1 million patient-days) was compared with those of other regional public hospitals without these additional proactive measures in place between 2010 and 2014. Results During the study period, Queen Mary Hospital had 1 hospital outbreak resulting in 1.48 and 0.45 outbreak episodes per 1 million patient discharges and patient-days, respectively, values significantly lower than the corresponding overall rates in the 7 acute regional hospitals (24.26 and 6.70 outbreak episodes per 1 million patient discharges and patient-days, respectively; P \u003C .001) and that of all 42 public hospitals in Hong Kong (41.62 and 8.65 outbreak episodes per 1 million patient discharges and patient-days, respectively; P \u003C .001).

Using three different lectins that specifically recognize this structure, we establish that nucleolin (NCL), a protein implicated in cancer, contains 9-O-Ac-Sia. Surprisingly, antibodies against the glycolipid 9-O-Ac-Sia GD3 also detected 9-O-Ac-Sia NCL. NCL is present on the surface of pre-B ALL cells as a sialoglycoprotein that is partly 9-O-acetylated and conversely, 9-O-Ac-Sia-containing structures other than NCL are present on these cells as well. Interestingly, NCL and the 9-O-Ac-Sia signal had less co-localization on normal pre-B cells. We also investigated regulation of NCL on the cell surface and found that sialidase treatment increased the percentage of cells positive for cell surface NCL, suggesting that sialylation of NCL promotes internalization. Treatment of pre-B ALL cells with the chemotherapy drug vincristine also increased the percentage of cells with surface NCL and correlated with increased 9-O-Ac-Sia expression. All tested leukemia cells including primary samples expressed NCL, suggesting it as a possible therapeutic target.

In a computational study, we proposed that ion channel activity can be explained by either of two similar ETM homopentameric transmembrane \u03B1-helical bundles, related by a \u223C50\u00B0 rotation of the helices. Later, we tested this prediction, using site-specific infrared dichroism of a lysine-flanked isotopically labeled ETM peptide from the virus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS, reconstituted in lipid bilayers. However, the data were consistent with the presence of a kink at the center of the ETM \u03B1-helix, and it did not fit completely either computational model. Herein, we have used native ETM, without flanking lysines, and show that the helix orientation is now consistent with one of the predicted models. ETM only produced one oligomeric form, pentamers, in the lipid-mimic detergent dodecylphosphocholine and in perfluorooctanoic acid. We thus report the correct backbone model for the pentameric \u03B1-helical bundle of ETM.

Earlier we have shown that transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) are released from different sides of porcine and murine epithelial cells, respectively. To study the release of these viruses from the same cells, we constructed a porcine LLC-PK1 cell line stably expressing the recombinant MHV receptor cDNA (LMR cells). The MHV and TGEV receptor glycoproteins were shown by immunofluorescence to appear at the surface of the cells and to be functional so that the cells were susceptible to both MHV and TGEV infection. Both coronaviruses entered polarized LMR cells only through the apical surface. Remarkably, while the cells remained susceptible to TGEV for long periods, infectability by MHV decreased with time after plating of the cells onto filters. This was not due to a lack of expression of the MHV receptor, since this glycoprotein was still abundant on the apical surface of these cells. TGEV and MHV appeared to exit LMR cells from opposite sides. Whereas TGEV was released preferentially at the apical membrane, MHV was released preferentially at the basolateral surface. These results show that vesicles containing the two coronaviruses are targeted differently in LMR cells. We propose that the viruses are sorted at the Golgi complex into different transport vesicles that carry information directing them to one of the two surface domains. The apical release of TGEV and the basolateral release of MHV might be factors contributing to the difference in virus spread found between TGEV and MHV in their respective natural hosts, the former causing mainly a localized enteric infection, the latter spreading through the body to other organs.","publish_time":"1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rossen, J.W.A.; Bekker, C.P.J.; Strous, G.J.A.M.; Horzinek, M.

However, until recently, experimental methodologies have been unable to directly visualize the nanoscale details of biological membranes, particularly in intact living cells. Numerous models explaining membrane organization have been proposed, but testing those models has required indirect methods; the desire to directly image proteins and lipids in living cell membranes is a strong motivation for the advancement of technology. The development of super-resolution microscopy has provided powerful tools for quantification of membrane organization at the level of individual proteins and lipids, and many of these tools are compatible with living cells. Previously inaccessible questions are now being addressed, and the field of membrane biology is developing rapidly. This chapter discusses how the development of super-resolution microscopy has led to fundamental advances in the field of biological membrane organization. We summarize the history and some models explaining how proteins are organized in cell membranes, and give an overview of various super-resolution techniques and methods of quantifying super-resolution data. We discuss the application of super-resolution techniques to membrane biology in general, and also with specific reference to the fields of actin and actin-binding proteins, virus infection, mitochondria, immune cell biology, and phosphoinositide signaling. Finally, we present our hopes and expectations for the future of super-resolution microscopy in the field of membrane biology.","publish_time":"2015-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Curthoys, Nikki M.; Parent, Matthew; Mlodzianoski, Michael; Nelson, Andrew J.; Lilieholm, Jennifer; Butler, Michael B.; Valles, Matthew; Hess, Samuel T.","journal":"Curr Top Membr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad0fc006610e4c2d418a88fc5457c09104f3773a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5584789.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1063582315000095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26015281/; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.ctm.2015.03.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1063582315000095","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs4MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["field of membrane biology","development of super-resolution microscopy","field of biological membrane organization","future of super-resolution microscopy","quantification of membrane organization","application of super-resolution techniques","overview of various super-resolution techniques","methods of quantifying super-resolution data","living cell membranes","immune cell biology","image proteins","Numerous models","actin-binding proteins","level of individual proteins","lipids","nanoscale details of biological membranes","intact living cells","powerful tools","fields of actin","indirect methods","numerous cellular functions","virus infection","mitochondria","strong motivation","fundamental advances","desire","specific reference","expectations","immense number of human diseases","advancement of technology","phosphoinositide","experimental methodologies","hopes","chapter","history","inaccessible questions"],"language":"en"},

The medical community is still getting to know behavior of this virus and the consequences from a population point of view. All this knowledge is extremely dynamic, so some behaviors are still not well established. Otorhinolaryngologists have a central role in the management of this situation, in which they must assess the patient, avoid contamination to and by health professionals and other patients. Thus, the recommendations of the Brazilian Association of Otorhinolaryngology and Cervical-Facial Surgery (ABORL-CCF) have the main objective of reducing the spread of the new coronavirus during otorhinolaryngological care and assisting in the management of these patients. METHODS: Review of the main recommendations of national and international scientific societies, decisions by government agencies and class councils. The topics will be related to the general aspects of COVID-19, personal protective equipment, care in patient assistance, endoscopic exam routines and the management of sinonasal, otological and pediatric evaluations related to COVID-19. RESULTS: The use of personal protective equipment is considered crucial in routine ENT care. We recommend postponing appointments, exams and elective surgeries to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Similarly, we recommend changing routines in several areas of otolaryngology. Additionally, guidance is provided on the use of telemedicine resources during the pandemic period. CONCLUSIONS: We are still at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and scientific evidence is still scarce and incomplete, so these ABORL-CCF recommendations for otorhinolaryngologists may be updated based on new knowledge and the pattern of the new coronavirus spread.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lavinsky, Joel; Kosugi, Eduardo Macoto; Baptistella, Eduardo; Roithman, Renato; Dolci, Eduardo; Ribeiro, Thais Knoll; Rossini, Bruno; Romano, Fabrizio Ricci; Maunsell, Rebecca Christina Kathleen; Mitre, Edson Ibrahim; Imamura, Rui; Hachya, Adriana; Chone, Carlos Takahiro; Watanabe, Luciana Miwa Nita; Fornazieri, Marco Aur\u00E9lio; Lessa, Marcus Miranda; Sant\u2019Anna, Geraldo Druck","journal":"Braz J Otorhinolaryngol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1dfd487bdc1c8945bfb71d76b91608792e964a77.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151294.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32371055/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjorl.2020.04.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs4NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spread of COVID","new coronavirus","rapid spread","new knowledge","ABORL-CCF recommendations","general aspects of COVID","use of personal protective equipment","main recommendations of national","otorhinolaryngological care","management of sinonasal","pandemic period","novel coronavirus","Otorhinolaryngologists","patients","routine ENT care","scientific evidence","patient assistance","main objective","international scientific societies","endoscopic exam routines","use of telemedicine resources","decisions","government agencies","Cervical-Facial Surgery","elective surgeries","Brazilian Association of Otorhinolaryngology","otological","pediatric evaluations","consequences","postponing appointments","exams","class councils","Review","pattern","central role","population","health professionals","contamination","great impact","METHODS","RESULTS","behaviors","areas of otolaryngology","situation","beginning","medical community","topics","guidance","INTRODUCTION","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The success of any disease programme is based on a functional laboratory network. Health laboratory services are an integral component of the health system. Efficiency and effectiveness of both clinical and public health functions including surveillance, diagnosis, prevention, treatment, research and health promotion are influenced by reliable laboratory services. The establishment of the African Regional polio laboratory for the Polio Eradication Initiative (PEI) has contributed in supporting countries in their efforts to strengthen laboratory capacity. On the eve of the closing of the program, we have shown through this article, examples of this contribution in two countries of the African region: C\u00F4te d\u2019Ivoire and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Methods Descriptive studies were carried out in C\u00F4te d\u2019Ivoire (RCI) and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) from October to December 2014. Questionnaires and self-administered and in-depth interviews and group discussions as well as records and observation were used to collect information during laboratory visits and assessments. Results The PEI financial support allows to maintain the majority of the 14 (DRC) and 12 (RCI) staff involved in the polio laboratory as full or in part time members. Through laboratory technical staff training supported by the PEI, skills and knowledge were gained to reinforce laboratories capacity and performance in quality laboratory functioning, processes and techniques such as cell culture. In the same way, infrastructure was improved and equipment provided. General laboratory quality standards, including the entire laboratory key elements was improved through the PEI accreditation process. Conclusion The Polio Eradication Initiative (PEI) is a good example of contribution in strengthening public health laboratories systems in the African region. It has established strong Polio Laboratory network that contributed to the strengthening of capacities and its expansion to surveillance of other viral priority diseases such as measles, yellow fever, Influenza, MERS-CoV and Ebola. This could serve as lesson and good example of laboratory based surveillance to improving diseases prevention, detection and control in our middle and low income countries as WHO and partners are heading to polio eradication in the world.","publish_time":"2016-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gumede, Nicksy; Coulibaly, Sheick Oumar; Yahaya, Ali Ahmed; Ndihokubwayo, Jean-Bosco; Nsubuga, Peter; Okeibunor, Joseph; Dosseh, Annick; Salla, Mbaye; Mihigo, Richard; Mkanda, Pascal; Byabamazima, Charles","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e2d03364184d2b96209a7c7a0666ab510fc073c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115515.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.05.055; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X16303814; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27646028/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X16303814","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs4NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DRC","Conclusion The Polio Eradication Initiative"],"locations":["Democratic Republic of Congo","Ebola"],"keyphrases":["laboratory capacity","laboratory visits","Health laboratory services","African Regional polio laboratory","good example of laboratory","strong Polio Laboratory network","quality laboratory functioning","reliable laboratory services","functional laboratory network","General laboratory quality standards","laboratory technical staff training","entire laboratory key elements","Polio Eradication Initiative","surveillance","health promotion","health system","public health functions","public health laboratories systems","diseases prevention","PEI financial support","PEI accreditation process","C\u00F4te d\u2019Ivoire","diagnosis","laboratories capacity","good example of contribution","Democratic Republic of Congo","RCI","DRC","viral priority diseases","low income countries","strengthening of capacities","processes","Influenza","yellow fever","measles","control","techniques","treatment","performance","integral component","group discussions","in-depth interviews","expansion","detection","research","partners","MERS-CoV","information","effectiveness","knowledge","establishment","Conclusion","disease programme","critical role","observation","records","Questionnaires","Ebola","cell culture","majority","Methods Descriptive studies","skills","examples","assessments","lesson","efforts","closing","way","infrastructure","equipment","success","Efficiency","article","Abstract Background","world","time members"],"language":"en"},

As the crisis evolves and persists, it will be increasingly important for the research community to conduct investigations that address the mental health consequences of COVID-19. The causes of mental health effects in the context of COVID-19 are multifactorial and likely include biological, behavioral, and environmental determinants. We argue that the COVID-19 crisis significantly threatens our basic human need for human connection, which might serve as a crucial environmental factor that could underlie the overall insult to our mental health. Furthermore, \u201Cbrain styles,\u201D which we have previously conceptualized as \u201Cbiotypes\u201D that are informed by a neural taxonomy, might interact with the universal threat to our need for human connection to explain the mental health consequences of COVID-19 from a precision psychiatry perspective. The goal of this commentary is to inspire research on the mental health consequences of COVID-19 from an individualized, brain-based perspective that honors the profound threat that the virus poses to our basic human motivations.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hagerty, Sarah L.; Williams, Leanne M.","journal":"Brain Behav Immun Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/38ff626c33940792f6638693c991cb2af5c922a1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7204757.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666354620300430; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666354620300430?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32382727/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100078","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs4ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mental health consequences of COVID","collective mental health","causes of mental health effects","context of COVID","Abstract COVID","human connection","basic human need","basic human motivations","virus","crisis","brain-based perspective","profound threat","universal threat","research community","environmental determinants","brain styles","precision psychiatry perspective","crucial environmental factor","investigations","significant threats","overall insult","commentary","mitigation strategies","neural taxonomy","goal","biotypes"],"language":"en"},

However, there have been no vaccines approved in the world to date. In this study, we analyzed the biological characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, Pro330-Leu650 (SARS-CoV-2-SPL), using biostatistical methods. SARS-CoV-2-SPL possesses a receptor-binding region (RBD) and important B (Ser438-Gln506, Thr553-Glu583, Gly404-Aps427, Thr345-Ala352, and Lys529-Lys535) and T (9 CD4 and 11 CD8 T cell antigenic determinants) cell epitopes. High homology in this region between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV amounted to 87.7%, after taking the biological similarity of the amino acids into account and eliminating the receptor-binding motif (RBM). The overall topology indicated that the complete structure of SARS-CoV-2-SPL was with RBM as the head, and RBD as the trunk and the tail region. SARS-CoV-2-SPL was found to have the potential to elicit effective B and T cell responses.

For this purpose, various samples of whole bacteria, fungi, pollen, media contaminated with viruses, and proteins were treated with an aliquot of methanolic tetramethylammonium hydroxide prior to thermal introduction into the ion source of a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Molecular and fragment ions, consistent with fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and steroids (non-methylated and methylated), generated during electron ionization (70 eV) of the volatile hydrolysates were subsequently detected. The varying distributions and relative intensities of these ions were used to discriminate between the different biological samples. More specifically, it was found that polyunsaturated FAMEs and steroids could be used to differentiate eukaryotic cells from prokaryotic cells since the latter do not generally synthesize either of these lipid membrane constituents. Further discrimination of the different eukaryotic samples was made based on the detection of ergosterol for fungi, cholesterol for the viral media, and C18:3Me for pollen. Multivariate statistical analysis was employed to evaluate and compare the large set of mass spectra generated during the study and to build a trained model for predicting the class membership of test samples entered as unknowns. Of 132 different samples subjected to the model as unknowns, 131 were correctly classified into their proper biological categories.

The purpose of this study, which was based on Ajzen\u0027s theory of planned behavior (TPB), was to determine the extent to which personal attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived control influence nurses\u0027 intention and volunteering to care for SARS patients. After the SARS outbreak, a total of 750 staff nurses (response rate 90%) at one hospital completed a questionnaire assessing their intention to provide care to SARS patients. Overall, 42.7% of nurses had a positive intention to provide care to SARS patients, and 25.4% of nurses would volunteer to care for SARS patients. Four factors explaining 35% of the variance in nurses\u0027 intention to care for SARS patients were self-efficacy (\u03B2 = 0.39, p \u003C 0.001), attitude (\u03B2 = 0.25, p \u003C 0.001), years of working in the study hospital (\u03B2 = \u22120.15, p \u003C 0.001), and receiving resources from the hospital (\u03B2 = 0.13, p \u003C 0.001).

The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated to be an important class of RNA molecules that regulate many biological processes, including host-pathogen interactions. However, the role of host lncRNAs in the response to T. gondii infection remains largely unknown. METHODS: We applied a microarray approach to determine the differential expression profiles of both lncRNAs and mRNAs in the human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells after T. gondii infection. The Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed to reveal the potential functions of T. gondii-induced genes. Based on the co-expression networks of lncRNAs and immune-related genes, the role of NONSHAT022487 on the regulation of UNC93B1 related immune signaling was investigated by the knockdown and over-expression of lncRNA in human macrophage derived from the PMA-induced promonocytic cell line THP-1. RESULTS: Our data showed that 996 lncRNAs and 109 mRNAs in HFF cells were significantly and differentially expressed following T. gondii infection (fold change \u2265 5, P \u003C 0.05). The results from the GO and KEGG pathway analyses indicated that the mRNAs with differential expression were mainly involved in the host immune response. Remarkably, we identified a novel lncRNA, NONSHAT022487, which suppresses the expression of the immune-related molecule UNC93B1. After T. gondii infection, NONSHAT022487 impaired the secretion of the cytokines IL-12, TNF-\u03B1, IL-1\u03B2 and IFN-\u03B3 by downregulating UNC93B1 expression in human macrophage cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified infection-induced lncRNA expression as a novel mechanism by which the Toxoplasma parasite regulates host immune signaling, which advances our understanding of the interaction of T. gondii parasites and host cells.

Overall, 19 (2.9%) out of 645 diarrheic samples from 19 herds (6.9%) tested positive for BToVs by either RT-PCR or nested PCR. A comparison of the nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) sequences of a part of the BToV M gene (409bp) among the BToVs showed the Korean BToVs to have comparatively higher sequence homology to the Japanese and Dutch BToVs than to the American and Italian BToVs. Generally, the Korean BToV strains clustered with the Japanese and Dutch BToV strains.

These results suggest that the BToV infections are sporadic in diarrheic calves in South Korea, and the Korean BToV strains are more closely related to the Japanese and Dutch BToVs than to the American and Italian BToVs.","publish_time":"2008-01-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Su-Jin; Oh, Eun-Hee; Park, Sang-Ik; Kim, Ha-Hyun; Jeong, Young-Ju; Lim, Guem-Ki; Hyun, Bang-Hun; Cho, Kyoung-Oh","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d3b6840c1dcd17a5d76835c28a9298416accffe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117412.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113507003409; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113507003409","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["North America","Europe","South Korea","Japan"],"keyphrases":["Korean BToV strains","Dutch BToV strains","Italian BToV strains","BToV infections","Korean BToVs","BToV membrane","known BToV strains","Dutch BToVs","Italian BToVs","RT-PCR","nested PCR","Japanese","diarrheic samples","diarrheic calves","diarrheic fecal samples","prevalence","Korean native beef calf herds","genetic diversity","genetic characterization","South Korea","higher sequence homology","nt","amino acid","total","North America","primer pairs specific","nucleotide","sequences","separate major branch","bovine torovirus","Europe","study","bp","comparison","results"],"language":"en"},

Similar clinical manifestations, transmission vectors, geographical distribution, and seasonal correlation often result in misdiagnosis of chikungunya infections as dengue cases and vice versa. In this study, we developed a rapid and accurate laboratory confirmative method to simultaneously detect, quantify, and differentiate DENV serotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4 and CHIKV. This SYBR Green I\u2013based one-step multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay is highly sensitive and specific for CHIKV and DENV. Melting temperature analysis of PCR amplicons was used to serotype DENV and to differentiate from CHIKV. The detection limit of the assay was 20, 10, 50, 5, and 10 RNA copies/reaction for DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4, and CHIKV, respectively. Our assay did not cross-react with a panel of viruses that included other flaviviruses, alphaviruses, influenza viruses, human enteroviruses, and human coronaviruses. The feasibility of using this assay for clinical diagnosis was evaluated in DENV- and CHIKV-positive patient sera. Accordingly, the assay sensitivity for DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4, and CHIKV was 89.66%, 96.67%, 96.67%, 94.12%, and 95.74%, respectively, with 100% specificity. These findings confirmed the potential of our assay to be used as a rapid test for simultaneous detection and serotyping of DENV and CHIKV in clinical samples.","publish_time":"2015-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Huixin; Parimelalagan, Mariya; Lai, Yee Ling; Lee, Kim Sung; Koay, Evelyn Siew-Chuan; Hapuarachchi, Hapuarachchige C.; Ng, Lee Ching; Ho, Phui San; Chu, Justin Jang Hann","journal":"The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c64c6977d787ab930cc9af19a0de5f382863407.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106138.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoldx.2015.06.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26455921/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525157815001567; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525157815001567","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV","CHIKV","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DENV serotypes","assay sensitivity","CHIKV-positive patient sera","real-time RT-PCR assay","dengue virus","Chikungunya virus","clinical diagnosis","clinical samples","Similar clinical manifestations","human enteroviruses","influenza viruses","human coronaviruses","dengue cases","panel of viruses","rapid test","simultaneous detection","detection limit","misdiagnosis of chikungunya infections","temperature analysis of PCR amplicons","geographical distribution","transmission vectors","based one-step","alphaviruses","important arbovirus diseases of global health significance","seasonal correlation","flaviviruses","accurate laboratory confirmative method","reaction","SYBR Green","RNA copies","findings","potential","feasibility","study","specificity"],"language":"en"},

The quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is a new tool for measuring frequency changes associated with antigen\u2013antibody interactions. In this study, the QCM biosensor and ProLinker\u2122 B were used to rapidly diagnosis CPV infection. ProLinker\u2122 B enables antibodies to be attached to a gold-coated quartz surface in a regular pattern and in the correct orientation for antigen binding. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were used to set a cut-off value using reference CPVs (two groups: one CPV-positive and one CPV-negative). The ROC curves overlapped and the point of intersection was used as the cut-off value. A QCM biosensor with a cut-off value of \u2212205Hz showed 95.4% (104/109) sensitivity and 98.0% (149/152) specificity when used to test 261 field fecal samples compared to PCR. In conclusion, the QCM biosensor described herein is eminently suitable for the rapid diagnosis of CPV infection with high sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, it is a promising analytical tool that will be useful for clinical diagnosis, which requires rapid and reliable analyses.","publish_time":"2015-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Yong Kwan; Lim, Seong-In; Choi, Sarah; Cho, In-Soo; Park, Eun-Hye; An, Dong-Jun","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b4028cf2aed4166e54dd30db86f37eddb14caa3a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119597.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25813597/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2015.03.015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093415001056; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093415001056","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CPV","QCM","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis CPV infection","rapid diagnosis of CPV infection","QCM biosensor","clinical diagnosis","CPV-positive","CPV-negative","cut-off value","accurate diagnosis","ROC curves","ProLinker","specificity","new tool","high sensitivity","antigen binding","quartz crystal microbalance","promising analytical tool","clinical signs of canine parvovirus","gold-coated quartz surface","regular pattern","frequency changes","correct orientation","shedding","groups","reference CPVs","antibody interactions","point of intersection","field fecal samples","PCR","Receiver","characteristics","antibodies","study","reliable analyses","Hz","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Objectives An external quality assessment (EQA) program for the molecular detection of MERS-CoV was organized by the National Center for Clinical Laboratories (NCCL). Study design MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs) encapsulating specific RNA sequences of MERS-CoV were prepared as positive specimens. The assessment panel, which comprised of three negative and seven positive samples with different concentrations of VLPs, was distributed to 56 laboratories from 16 provinces, municipalities, or autonomous regions for molecular detection. Results Among the received data sets, three employed an in-house-developed real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay and the others applied various commercial rRT-PCR kits. Overall, the majority of laboratories (46/56, 82.1%) could achieve 100% accuracy for MERS-CoV detection, but three laboratories (5.4%) still had room for improvement. Consequently, all negative samples were identified correctly, reaching 100% specificity. The false-negative rate was 3.1%, and most of the false-negative results were obtained from samples with relatively low concentration, indicating an urgent need to improve detection in weak-positive specimens. Conclusions The majority of participants possessed reliable diagnostic capacity for the detection of MERS-CoV. Moreover, EQA is indispensable because it can help enhance the diagnostic capability for the surveillance of MERS-CoV infections and allow comparison of the results among different laboratories.","publish_time":"2016-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Lei; Hao, Mingju; Zhang, Kuo; Zhang, Rui; Lin, Guigao; Jia, Tingting; Zhang, Dong; Chang, Le; Xie, Jiehong; Li, Jinming","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f0a4a2736bd9838bf06dd0b208986282269529f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106428.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2015.12.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653215007830; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26702992/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653215007830","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsxMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Center for Clinical Laboratories","EQA"],"locations":["Middle East","China"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV detection","molecular detection of MERS","surveillance of MERS","CoV infections","different laboratories","negative samples","majority of laboratories","positive samples","Clinical Laboratories","false-negative results","false-negative rate","specific RNA sequences of MERS","EQA","weak-positive specimens","reliable diagnostic capacity","different concentrations of VLPs","diagnostic capability","majority of participants","assessment panel","various commercial rRT-PCR kits","external quality assessment","reliable diagnosis of suspected cases","imported case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","particles","real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction","program","comparison","assay","urgent need","municipalities","autonomous regions","China","National Center","Study design MS2 virus","low concentration","Objectives","NCCL","provinces","house","received data sets","Conclusions","accuracy","Abstract Background","room","improvement","specificity"],"language":"en"},

In recent years, this has led to perceiving population health outcomes as an emergent property of a dynamic and open, complex adaptive system. The current paper explores these themes further and applies the principles of systems approach and complexity science (i.e. systems science) to conceptualize social determinants of health inequalities. The conceptualization can be done in two steps: viewing health inequalities from a systems approach and extending it to include complexity science. Systems approach views health inequalities as patterns within the larger rubric of other facets of the human condition, such as educational outcomes and economic development. This anlysis requires more sophisticated models such as systems dynamic models. An extension of the approach is to view systems as complex adaptive systems, i.e. systems that are \u0027open\u0027 and adapt to the environment. They consist of dynamic adapting subsystems that exhibit non-linear interactions, while being \u0027open\u0027 to a similarly dynamic environment of interconnected systems. They exhibit emergent properties that cannot be estimated with precision by using the known interactions among its components (such as economic development, political freedom, health system, culture etc.). Different combinations of the same bundle of factors or determinants give rise to similar patterns or outcomes (i.e. property of convergence), and minor variations in the initial condition could give rise to widely divergent outcomes. Novel approaches using computer simulation models (e.g. agent-based models) would shed light on possible mechanisms as to how factors or determinants interact and lead to emergent patterns of health inequalities of populations.","publish_time":"2015-08-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jayasinghe, Saroj","journal":"Int J Equity Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3b1f22e16b5f9f5961e135d3a79eaad57061aa2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4549102.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-015-0205-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26303914/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsxNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["systems science","social systems","systems dynamic models","principles of systems approach","Systems approach views health inequalities","complex adaptive systems","dynamic environment of interconnected systems","health system","social determinants of health inequalities","emergent patterns of health inequalities of populations","perceiving population health outcomes","sophisticated models","emergent property","educational outcomes","divergent outcomes","complexity science","similar patterns","computer simulation models","agent-based models","rise","dynamic adapting subsystems","economic development","novel conceptualization","emergent properties","property of convergence","human condition","bundle of factors","Novel approaches","initial condition","non-linear interactions","known interactions","political freedom","lead","larger rubric","minor variations","facets","light","possible mechanisms","components","culture","themes","precision","steps","Different combinations","current paper","anlysis","recent years","extension"],"language":"en"},

To relieve this burden, we are in search of an inexpensive material that can adsorb pathogens from drinking water. In this pursuit, we have studied the natural carbohydrate, chitosan. To impart virus removal features, chitosan has been functionalized with a quaternary amine to form quaternized chitosan N-[(2-hydroxyl-3-trimethylammonium) propyl] chitosan (HTCC). HTCC can be electrospun into nanofibers with the non-ionogenic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), creating a high surface area mat. High surface area is a major requirement for effective adsorption processes. HTCC is antiviral and antimicrobial, making it a good material for water purification. However, HTCC dissolves in water. We have explored the parameters to crosslink the nanofibers with glutaraldehyde. We have imparted water stability so there is a maximum of 30% swelling of the fibers after 6h in water. The water stable fibers retain their ability to adsorb virus, as shown for an enveloped and nonenveloped virus.

Nine out of ten evaluated flavonoids blocked HCMV replication at concentrations that were significantly lower than those producing cytotoxicity against growing or stationary phase host cells. Baicalein was the most potent inhibitor in this series (IC50 =0.4\u20131.2\u03BCM), including positive control ganciclovir. Baicalein and genistein were chosen as model compounds to study the antiviral mechanism(s) of action for this series. Both flavonoids significantly reduced the levels of HCMV early and late proteins, as well as viral DNA synthesis. Baicalein reduced the levels of HCMV immediate-early proteins to nearly background levels while genistein did not. The antiviral effects of genistein, but not baicalein, were fully reversible in cell culture. Pre-incubation of concentrated virus stocks with either flavonoid did not inhibit HCMV replication, suggesting that baicalein did not directly inactivate virus particles. Baicalein functionally blocked epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase activity and HCMV nuclear translocation, while genistein did not. At 24h post infection HCMV-infected cells treated with genistein continued to express immediate-early proteins and efficiently phosphorylate IE1-72. However, HCMV induction of NF-\u03BAB and increases in the levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins\u2014events that are associated with immediate-early protein functioning \u2013 were absent. The data suggested that the primary mechanism of action for baicalein may be to block HCMV infection at entry while the primary mechanism of action for genistein may be to block HCMV immediate-early protein functioning.","publish_time":"2005-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Evers, David L.; Chao, Chih-Fang; Wang, Xin; Zhang, Zhigang; Huong, Shu-Mei; Huang, Eng-Shang","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8462c3c42ff0552402d2785a7530d59600e4f06.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114262.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354205001701; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354205001701","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsxODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Baicalein","HCMV infection","levels of HCMV immediate-early proteins","HCMV immediate-early protein functioning","HCMV nuclear translocation","HCMV induction of NF","evaluated flavonoids blocked HCMV replication","antiviral effects of genistein","antiviral mechanism","primary mechanism of action","h post infection HCMV-infected cells","antiviral activity","late proteins","levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins","series","likely biochemical mechanisms of action","certain dietary flavonoids","cell culture","virus particles","blocked epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase activity","stationary phase host cells","Pre-incubation of concentrated virus stocks","human cytomegalovirus","concentrations","cytotoxicity","events","entry","model compounds","\u03BCM","IC50","potent inhibitor","\u03BAB","positive control ganciclovir","viral DNA synthesis","data","IE1"],"language":"en"},

In a previously published audit, we demonstrated that one-third of patients admitted to a dedicated isolation room in Tayside were not thought to be an infection risk by experienced healthcare staff. Since this audit, Tayside\u0027s isolation facilities have moved from a small peripheral \u2018fever\u2019 hospital to a large central teaching hospital site. At the time of this move, and using the above audit data, we designed and implemented a guideline for general practitioners and hospital doctors regarding the admission of patients to an isolation bed. The aim of this study was to compare the use of isolation beds before and after the move to the new facilities, which we anticipated would increase the demand for isolation. The results show that by all three criteria used, the utilization of isolation beds has deteriorated following the move, mainly due to the increased admission of general medical \u2018boarders\u2019 and low-risk infection patients. At a time when hospital-acquired infections are increasing, NHS trusts should ensure that dedicated isolation beds are used appropriately.","publish_time":"2005-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Damji, S.; Barlow, G.

We provide a brief history of the Chinese healthcare system since 1949 as context for the current healthcare; examine the factors that led to recent efforts to reestablish community-based care in China; and identify the challenges associated with attaining a sustainable and quality community healthcare system. Methods Based on literature review and publicly available data in China, the paper will present a historical case study analysis of health policy change of CHOs in China and provide policy evaluation, and the paper provided policy suggestions. Results We find that the government\u0027s recent efforts to emphasize the significance of community healthcare services in China have started to change patterns of healthcare use, but many problems still inhibit the development of CHOs, including unsustainable governmental roles, issues of human resource inadequacy and laggard GP practice, poorly designed payment schemes, patient\u0027s trust crisis and continue to inhibit the development of community-based primary care. Conclusions Additional policy efforts to help CHOs\u2019 development are needed. Recent government investments in public health and primary care alone are not sufficient and could not be sustainable. It will not until long-term self-sustaining mechanisms to relieve an omnipotent government are established, including competent community doctors (GP) system, supportive social insurance reimbursement, appropriate financial incentives to providers, better transparency and accountability, as well as a more regulated referral system, a legitimate, sustainable and quality community health system could be attained.","publish_time":"2011-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Hufeng; Gusmano, Michael K.; Cao, Qi","journal":"Health Policy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/53a7b62173e65ffc66609a603cfde43cfa267e40.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132422.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168851010001971; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168851010001971; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2010.07.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20685005/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsyNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["China","quality community healthcare system","development of community","quality community health system","community-based care","Chinese healthcare system","recent health reform efforts","significance of community healthcare services","paper","development of CHOs","government\u0027s recent efforts","current healthcare","competent community doctors","public health","policy evaluation","Conclusions Additional policy efforts","policy suggestions","primary care","Recent government investments","regulated referral system","patterns of healthcare use","historical case study analysis of health policy change of CHOs","omnipotent government","laggard GP practice","appropriate financial incentives","supportive social insurance reimbursement","issues of human resource inadequacy","designed payment schemes","providers","unsustainable governmental roles","better transparency","patient\u0027s trust crisis","available data","context","literature review","brief history","problems","factors","long-term self-sustaining mechanisms","accountability","Abstract Objectives","Methods","challenges"],"language":"en"},

Despite the effort of scientific studies related to this virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is still a public health concern. MERS-CoV infection has a high mortality rate, and to date, no therapeutic or vaccine has been discovered, that is effective in treating or preventing the disease. In this review, we summarize our understanding of the molecular and biological events of compounds acting as MERS-CoV inhibitors, the outcomes of existing therapeutic options and the various drugs undergoing clinical trials. Currently, several therapeutic options have been employed, such as convalescent plasma (CP), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), monoclonal antibodies and repurposing of existing clinically approved drugs. However, these therapeutic options have drawbacks, thus the need for an alternative approach. The requirement for effective therapeutic treatment has brought the necessity for additional MERS treatments. We suggest that antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) may be used as alternative therapeutic agents against MERS-CoV infection. In addition, we propose the feasibility of developing effective agents by repurposing the existing and clinically approved anti-coronavirus and anti-viral peptide drugs.","publish_time":"2017-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mustafa, Sabeena; Balkhy, Hanan; Gabere, Musa N.","journal":"J Infect Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/715f7c1e1785a66d1fb9961d4585b687448fe97c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102797.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28864360/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034117302125; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2017.08.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034117302125","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsyNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV infection","MERS-CoV inhibitors","alternative therapeutic agents","effective therapeutic treatment","outcomes of existing therapeutic options","additional MERS treatments","approved drugs","effective agents","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","anti-coronavirus","various drugs","pathogenic respiratory virus","anti-viral peptide drugs","alternative approach","intravenous immunoglobulin","necessity","biological events of compounds","high mortality rate","CP","IVIG","monoclonal antibodies","date","understanding","need","convalescent plasma","clinical trials","AMPs","effort of scientific studies","feasibility","mechanisms","requirement","drawbacks","public health concern","antimicrobial peptides","vaccine","immune responses","review","disease"],"language":"en"},

While many infectious causes of diarrhea have been established, approximately 40% of all diarrhea cases are of unknown etiology. In an effort to identify novel viruses that may be causal agents of diarrhea, we used high throughput mass sequencing to analyze stool samples collected from patients with acute diarrhea. RESULTS: Sequences with limited similarity to known picornaviruses were detected in a stool sample collected in Australia from a child with acute diarrhea. Using a combination of mass sequencing, RT-PCR, 5\u0027 RACE and 3\u0027 RACE, a 6383 bp fragment of the viral genome was sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that this virus was highly divergent from, but most closely related to, members of the genus Kobuvirus. We have tentatively named this novel virus klassevirus 1. We also detected klassevirus 1 by RT-PCR in a diarrhea specimen collected from a patient in St. Louis, United States as well as in untreated sewage collected in Barcelona, Spain. CONCLUSION: Klassevirus 1 is a previously undescribed picornavirus that is globally widespread and present on at least three continents. Further investigations to determine whether klassevirus 1 is a human pathogen are needed.","publish_time":"2009-06-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Holtz, Lori R; Finkbeiner, Stacy R; Zhao, Guoyan; Kirkwood, Carl D; Girones, Rosina; Pipas, James M; Wang, David","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/049294a884d39102b06a634ba0f4bd3185fcc478.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2706813.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-6-86; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19552824/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsyODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Klassevirus"],"locations":["Australia","St. Louis","United States","Spain"],"keyphrases":["acute diarrhea","diarrhea specimen","diarrhea cases","infectious causes of diarrhea","causal agents of diarrhea","novel virus klassevirus","RT-PCR","RACE","combination of mass sequencing","stool samples","high throughput mass sequencing","novel viruses","leading infectious cause of death","picornaviruses","Australia","untreated sewage","United States","Sequences","limited similarity","bp fragment","child","patients","undescribed picornavirus","viral genome","Barcelona","Spain","RESULTS","Louis","unknown etiology","deaths","genus Kobuvirus","members","continents","Phylogenetic analysis","effort","human pathogen","BACKGROUND","year","CONCLUSION","investigations"],"language":"en"},

The attention to the high diversity of CoVs hosted by bats has increased during the last decade due to the high number of human infections caused by two zoonotic Beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, that cause several respiratory diseases. Among coronaviruses, two Alpha-CoV strains (HuCoV-229E and HuCoV-NL63) cause mild respiratory disease that can change to severe disease in children, elderly and individuals affected by illnesses. Phylogenetic analysis conducted on bat Alpha-CoV strains revealed their evolutive correlation to human strains, suggesting their origin in bats. The genome of CoVs is characterized by a high frequency of mutations and recombination events, increasing their ability to switch hosts and their zoonotic potential. In this study, three strains of Alpha-CoV genera detected in Italian bats (Pipistrellus kuhlii) were fully sequenced by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and characterized. The complete genome analysis showed the correlation of the Italians strains with a Chinese strain detected in 2013 and, based on CoV molecular species demarcation, two new Alpha-CoV species were established. The analysis of a fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) showed the correlation of the Italian strains with CoVs that was only detected in the bat Pipistrellus genera (Pipistrellus kuhlii and Pipistrellus Pipistrellus) in European countries.","publish_time":"2019-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Sabato, Luca; Lelli, Davide; Faccin, Francesca; Canziani, Sabrina; Di Bartolo, Ilaria; Vaccari, Gabriele; Moreno, Ana","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ab854e488ea41f8d1187bce92b235ff1d6f0618.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114869.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30447246/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170218305859; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2018.11.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170218305859","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsyOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Next Generation Sequencing"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Pipistrellus Pipistrellus","strains of Alpha","bat Alpha-CoV strains","CoV genera","SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","human strains","Italian strains","new Alpha-CoV species","Pipistrellus kuhlii","Italians strains","genome of CoVs","bat Pipistrellus genera","CoV molecular species demarcation","high diversity of CoVs","bat species","zoonotic Beta-CoVs","Italian bats","evolutive correlation","Phylogenetic analysis","complete genome analysis","high number of human infections","cause mild respiratory disease","high frequency of mutations","HuCoV-NL63","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","severe disease","zoonotic potential","respiratory diseases","Abstract Coronaviruses","recombination events","RdRp","individuals","ability","children","fragment","European countries","hosts","Chinese strain","decade","attention","origin","Generation Sequencing","NGS","illnesses","study","main reservoir"],"language":"en"},

It is mainly epidemic in Asia with an estimated 69,000 cases occurring per year. However, no approved agents are available for the treatment of JEV infection, and existing vaccines cannot control various types of JEV strains. Drug repurposing is a new concept for finding new indication of existing drugs, and, recently, the concept has been used to discover new antiviral agents. Identifying host proteins involved in the progress of JEV infection and using these proteins as targets are the center of drug repurposing for JEV infection. In this study, based on the gene expression data of JEV infection and the phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) data, we identified 286 genes that participate in the progress of JEV infection using systems biology methods. The enrichment analysis of these genes suggested that the genes identified by our methods were predominantly related to viral infection pathways and immune response-related pathways. We found that bortezomib, which can target these genes, may have an effect on the treatment of JEV infection. Subsequently, we evaluated the antiviral activity of bortezomib using a JEV-infected mouse model. The results showed that bortezomib can lower JEV-induced lethality in mice, alleviate suffering in JEV-infected mice and reduce the damage in brains caused by JEV infection. This work provides an agent with new indication to treat JEV infection.","publish_time":"2018-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lv, Bo-Min; Tong, Xin-Yu; Quan, Yuan; Liu, Meng-Yuan; Zhang, Qing-Ye; Song, Yun-Feng; Zhang, Hong-Yu","journal":"Molecules","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/84785c6c2c5a963376b6314c430402e4fe3654e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6320907.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules23123346; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30567313/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjszMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JEV"],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["treatment of JEV infection","progress of JEV infection","JEV-infected mice","gene expression data of JEV infection","JEV-infected mouse model","lower JEV-induced lethality","viral infection pathways","various types of JEV strains","genes","new concept","new antiviral agents","new indication of existing drugs","antiviral activity of bortezomib","center of drug repurposing","Japanese encephalitis virus","existing vaccines","immune response-related pathways","host proteins","approved agents","systems biology methods","phenome-wide association study","suffering","zoonotic disease","PheWAS","targets","damage","brains","effect","Asia","cases","work","results","year","enrichment analysis"],"language":"en"},

However, it remains elusive whether or not a pathogen-derived protein can function as a cytosolic pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). In this study, we demonstrate that delivering the membrane gene of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) into HEK293T, HEK293ET, and immobilized murine bone marrow-derived macrophage (J2-M\u03C6) cells significantly upregulates beta interferon (IFN-\u03B2) production. Both NF-\u03BAB and TBK1-IRF3 signaling cascades are activated by M gene products. M protein rather than M mRNA is responsible for M-mediated IFN-\u03B2 induction that is preferentially associated with the activation of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) adaptor proteins MyD88, TIRAP, and TICAM2 but not the RIG-I signaling cascade. Blocking the secretion of M protein by brefeldin A (BFA) failed to reverse the M-mediated IFN-\u03B2 induction. The antagonist of both TLR2 and TLR4 did not impede M-mediated IFN-\u03B2 induction, indicating that the driving force for the activation of IFN-\u03B2 production was generated from inside the cells. Inhibition of TRAF3 expression by specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) did not prevent M-mediated IFN-\u03B2 induction. SARS-CoV pseudovirus could induce IFN-\u03B2 production in an M rather than M(V68A) dependent manner, since the valine-to-alanine alteration at residue 68 in M protein markedly inhibited IFN-\u03B2 production. Overall, our study indicates for the first time that a pathogen-derived protein is able to function as a cytosolic PAMP to stimulate type I interferon production by activating a noncanonical TLR signaling cascade in a TRAF3-independent manner.","publish_time":"2016-02-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yi; Liu, Li","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/358d351a51c6f7f9ddb86ea3fb468c7fdc601e3d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4752600.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26861016/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01872-15","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjszNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mediated IFN-\u03B2 induction","inhibited IFN-\u03B2 production","activation of IFN","pathogen-derived protein","interferon production","pathogen-derived RNAs","cytosolic pathogen","cytosolic PAMP","cells","study","SARS-CoV pseudovirus","TRAF3-independent manner","immobilized murine bone marrow-derived macrophage","beta interferon","stranded RNA","noncanonical TLR","molecular pattern","gene products","Inhibition of TRAF3 expression","specific small interfering RNA","intracellular pattern recognition receptors","membrane gene of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","synthetic analogs of double","HEK293ET","J2-M\u03C6","DNAs","adaptor proteins MyD88","cascades","PRRs","TIRAP","HEK293T","driving force","TBK1-IRF3","TICAM2","valine","dsRNA","siRNA","residue","cytoplasm","type","time","NF-\u03BAB","alanine alteration","TLR4","endolysosome","Toll","brefeldin","mRNA","poly","antagonist","TLR2","V68A","RIG","secretion","BFA"],"language":"en"},

Methods This prospective observational cohort study enrolled 63 ventilated adult patients with ARDS; 50 as septic and 13 as non-septic, and followed them for 28 days in intensive care units at a university hospital in Taiwan. Serial serum sTREM-1 levels and cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1, on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 14 were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The association between biomarkers and clinical infectious diagnosis/outcome in ARDS was explored. Results Serum sTREM-1 and cytokine levels could not differentiate septic from non-septic ARDS. Serum log sTREM-1 and inflammatory cytokine levels were correlated positively (r = 0.325 for IL-1\u03B2; r = 0.247 for IL-8; r = 0.480 for tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1). As prognostic factors, higher serum sTREM-1 level on day 1 and increasing levels over time, especially in the first 5 days, were independent predictors of mortality on day 28, using a multivariate Cox regression model. Serum sTREM-1 levels remained stable or even increased in the non-surviving patients, but decreased in the survivors. Conclusion Serum sTREM-1 level might not be a reliable marker for infection in ARDS patients. However, as an inflammatory marker, initial serum sTREM-1 level and its trend over time, especially in the first 5 days, could be predictive of short-term mortality. A progressive decline in serum sTREM-1 levels during follow-up indicates a favorable outcome, whereas persistently elevated sTREM-1 indicates a poor prognosis and should lead to a re-evaluation of therapy.","publish_time":"2010-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Ming-Tzer; Wei, Yu-Feng; Ku, Shih-Chi; Lin, Chih-An; Ho, Chao-Chi; Yu, Chong-Jen","journal":"Journal of the Formosan Medical Association","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e38d4710ae273e9f1255994f9db03c8b408fdece.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929664610601258; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0929-6646(10)60125-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21126652/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0929664610601258","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs0MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["higher serum sTREM","initial serum sTREM","Serum log sTREM","Results Serum sTREM","Conclusion Serum sTREM","Serial serum sTREM","elevated sTREM","ARDS patients","non-septic ARDS","days","inflammatory cytokine levels","inflammatory marker","non-surviving patients","Purpose Serum soluble triggering receptor","tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","ventilated adult patients","good marker","reliable marker","infection","time","detector of acute inflammatory response","favorable outcome","prognostic factors","independent predictors of mortality","predictive of short-term mortality","acute respiratory distress syndrome","microbial products","prospective observational cohort study","clinical infectious diagnosis","myeloid cells","intensive care units","university hospital","biomarkers","Background","follow-up","cytokines","diagnosing sepsis","association","Methods","pneumonia","multivariate Cox regression model","progressive decline","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","Taiwan","poor prognosis","interleukin","trend","re-evaluation of therapy","survivors"],"language":"en"},

The parents of cases and controls were asked questions about different gastroenteritis risk factors. The quality of the drinking water used by the participants was investigated for microbial indicators as well as for four zoonotic bacterial pathogens (Campylobacter spp, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp and Yersinia spp) and two enteric parasites (Cryptosporidium spp and Giardia spp). From 134 stool specimen analysed, viruses were detected in 82 cases (61%), while 28 (21%) were found with at least one of the bacteria investigated, and five cases were infected by parasites. Campylobacteriosis was the main bacterial infection (n = 15), followed by Salmonella sp (n = 7) and E. coli O157:H7 (n = 5) among cases with bacterial gastroenteritis. No significant difference was found between cases and controls regarding the quality of water consumed; the frequency of faecal contamination of private wells was also similar between cases and controls. Considering the total cases (including those with a virus), no link was found between severe gastroenteritis and either being in contact with animals or living in a municipality with the highest animal density (4th quartile).

The resulting siRNA nanoparticles were prepared using a solvent displacement method that offers the advantage of forming small nanoparticles without using shear forces. The nanoparticles were characterized with regard to particle size, zeta-potential, and degradation at pH 7.4 using dynamic and static light scattering. SiRNA release studies were performed and correlated to the nanoparticle degradation. In vitro knockdown of firefly luciferase reporter gene was used to assess the potential of the nanoparticles as siRNA carriers in a human lung epithelial cell line, H1299 luc. The amine-modified-PVA\u2013PLGA/siRNA nanoparticles form 150\u2013200 nm particles with zeta-potentials of \u002B15\u2013\u002B20 mV in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Break down of the nanoparticles was seen within 4 h in PBS with sustained release of siRNA. These nanoparticles have achieved 80\u201390% knockdown of a luciferase reporter gene with only 5 pmol anti-luc siRNA, even after nebulization. Hence we conclude that amine-modified-PVA\u2013PLGA/siRNA nanoparticles could be a promising siRNA carrier for pulmonary gene delivery due to their fast degradation and potent gene knockdown profile.","publish_time":"2008-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nguyen, Juliane; Steele, Terry W.J.; Merkel, Olivia; Reul, Regina; Kissel, Thomas","journal":"Journal of Controlled Release","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2b3a3e3956afd65a8fa11d3867da3e58f8915514.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125568.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168365908003428; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365908003428; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2008.06.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18619502/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs0MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PBS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["resulting siRNA nanoparticles","siRNA carriers","encapsulating siRNA","potential siRNA carrier","small nanoparticles","promising siRNA carrier","sustained release of siRNA","SiRNA release studies","biodegradable polyester nanoparticles","pmol anti-luc siRNA","pulmonary gene delivery","PVA","PLGA","knockdown of firefly luciferase reporter gene","potent gene knockdown profile","fast degradation","PBS","tertiary-amine","nanoparticle degradation","H1299 luc","zeta-potentials","human lung epithelial cell line","backbones","advantage","polyvinyl alcohol","particle size","nm particles","phosphate buffered saline","mV","lactide-co-glycolide","solvent displacement method","regard","static light scattering","shear forces","nebulization"],"language":"en"},

Two categories of methods were available: those estimating the initial reproduction number, and those estimating a time dependent reproduction number. We implemented five methods as an R library, developed sensitivity analysis tools for each method and provided numerical illustrations of their use. A comparison of the performance of the different methods on simulated datasets is reported.

A total of 1812 participants recruited. All were aware of MERS-CoV, yet the perception and practice around MERS-CoV varied widely between countries. Over two thirds were either \u201Cnot concerned\u201D or \u201Cslightly concerned\u201D about contracting MERS-CoV; believing that they were under Allah\u2019s (God\u2019s) protection (40%) was the most cited reason.

However, it fails to eradicate HIV-1 infection. The high cost of life-long highly active antiretroviral therapy and the emergence of drug resistance among HIV-1-infected individuals have brought renewed pressure for the discovery of novel antivirals and alternative medicines. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a complementary and alternative medicine, and serves as a rich resource for new drug development. Despite the almost 100 plant-derived compounds that are in clinical trials, few target HIV-1 infection. In this study, we discovered that Sanguisorba officinalis extract (SOE) has anti-HIV-1 properties. Using a cell-based assay and single-cycle luciferase reporter viruses pseudotyped with envelopes from HIV-1 or control viruses, we found that SOE exhibited significant inhibitory ability against both CCR5 and CXCR4 tropic HIV-1 (ADA and HXB2), with respective IC50 values of 1.91 \u00B1 0.16 \u03BCg/mL and 3.70 \u00B1 0.53 \u03BCg/mL. SOE also inhibited simian immunodeficiency virus infection but failed to block vesicular stomatitis virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and influenza H5N1 pseudoviruses. Furthermore, we showed that SOE had no effect on postentry events of HIV-1 replication. Because SOE pretreatment with the virus but not with cell lines expressing viral receptors showed the maximal inhibitory activity, we can state that SOE probably blocks entry by acting on the viral envelope directly. In addition, SOE was able to inhibit reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistant viruses (K103N, Y188L, and K103N/Y188L/G190A) and a protease inhibitor resistant strain (PI-2840). Our findings demonstrate SOE as a novel and specific entry inhibitor, which sheds light on the discovery of anti-HIV-1 drugs from traditional herbal medicines.","publish_time":"2013-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liang, Jianguo; Chen, Jianping; Tan, Zhiwu; Peng, Jie; Zheng, Xiao; Nishiura, Kenji; Ng, Jenny; Wang, Zhiyu; Wang, Dongmei; Chen, Zhiwei; Liu, Li","journal":"Journal of Food and Drug Analysis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b71faa49acdaf565c600311c424cdaa4206eb44.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4151571.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1021949813000987; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1021949813000987","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs5ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SOE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["target HIV","SOE pretreatment","discovery of anti-HIV","CXCR4 tropic HIV","postentry events of HIV","simian immunodeficiency virus infection","human immunodeficiency virus","vesicular stomatitis virus","reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistant viruses","K103N","Y188L","active antiretroviral therapy","specific entry inhibitor","control viruses","alternative medicines","\u03BCg","protease inhibitor resistant strain","discovery of novel antivirals","traditional herbal medicines","Traditional Chinese medicine","viral receptors","cell lines","viral envelope","single-cycle luciferase reporter viruses","emergence of drug resistance","maximal inhibitory activity","significant inhibitory ability","cell-based assay","new drug development","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","CCR5","envelopes","drugs","light","renewed pressure","influenza H5N1 pseudoviruses","HXB2","clinical trials","ADA","TCM","HAART","G190A","Sanguisorba officinalis extract","rich resource","infected individuals","respective IC50 values","associated morbidity","effect","plant-derived compounds","high cost of life","mortality","introduction","replication","study","addition","findings","properties"],"language":"en"},

In order to analyze the antigenicity and receptor-binding ability of SARS-CoV S protein, we expressed the S protein in Escherichia coli using a pET expression vector. After the isopropyl-\u03B2-d-thiogalactoside induction, S protein was expressed in the soluble form and purified by nickel-affinity chromatography to homogeneity. The amount of S protein recovered was 0.2\u20130.3mg/100ml bacterial culture. The S protein was recognized by sera from SARS patients by ELISA and Western blot, which indicated that recombinant S protein retained its antigenicity. By biotinylated ELISA and Western blot using biotin-labeled S protein as the probe, we identified 130-kDa and 140-kDa proteins in Vero cells that might be the cellular receptors responsible for SARS-CoV infection.

Studies using nonliving delivery mechanisms have shown that providing both protein antigen and DNA encoding the antigen to an individual induces an improved, more protective immune response but rarely, if ever, are both delivered simultaneously. Here, non-replicating bacterial minicells derived from a commensal E. coli strain are shown to effectively induce antigen-specific immune responses after simultaneous protein and DNA delivery.

Forecasting and predicting airborne virus spread are important to make time for developing strategies and to minimise the damage of the disease. To predict the airborne spread of the disease a modelling approach is important since field experiments using sensors are ineffective because of the rarefied concentrations of virus in the air. The simulation of airborne spread during past outbreaks required improvement both for farmers and for policy decision makers. In this study a free license computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code was used to simulate airborne virus spread. Forecasting data from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) was directly connected in the developed model for real-time forecasting for 48 h in three-hourly intervals. To reduce computation time, scalar transport for airborne virus spread was simulated based on a database for the CFD computed airflow in the investigated area using representative wind conditions. The simulation results, and the weather data were then used to make a database for a web-based forecasting system that could be accessible to users.","publish_time":"2014-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seo, Il-hwan; Lee, In-bok; Hong, Se-woon; Noh, Hyun-seok; Park, Joo-hyun","journal":"Biosyst Eng","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4fb4cc5ef64acc5906187263078847a1f198fefd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185436.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1537511014001792; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362790/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1537511014001792; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.10.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CFD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spread of disease","airborne virus spread","simulation of airborne spread","airborne dispersion","various causes of disease spread","mouth disease","real-time forecasting","rarefied concentrations of virus","database","important factor","web-based forecasting system","livestock farms","computation time","simulation results","weather data","CFD computed airflow","substantial economic damage","Livestock infectious diseases","investigated area","free license computational fluid dynamics","modelling approach","farmers","sensors","field experiments","improvement","code","past outbreaks","scalar transport","study","foot","FMD","representative wind conditions","Korea Meteorological Administration","related industries","developed model","policy decision makers","KMA","strategies","indirect contact","preventive measures","hourly intervals","users"],"language":"en"},

This article attempts to survey current trends and to highlight upcoming techniques in the future of bone healing.","publish_time":"2005-10-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheung, Catherine","journal":"Clin Podiatr Med Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d764a8ac026577c9e8db42df61ee2954b319d73.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118872.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891842205000479; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0891842205000479","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["bone substitutes","bone repair surgeries","future of bone healing","bone grafting procedures","aiding fracture repair","growth factors","potential","significant role","stem cell research","upcoming techniques","current trends","advent of possibilities","surgeons","fractures","United States","article"],"language":"en"},

However, a variety of factors, including confounding environmental variables, rare genetic variants requiring extremely large cohorts, the temporal dynamics of infections, and ethical limitation on human studies, have made the identification and dissection of variant host genes and pathways difficult within human populations. This difficulty has led to the development of a variety of experimental approaches used to identify host genetic contributions to disease responses. In this chapter, we describe the history of genetic associations within the human population, the development of experimentally tractable systems, and the insights these specific approaches provide. We conclude with a discussion of recent advances that allow for the investigation of the role of complex genetic networks that underlie host responses to infection, with the goal of drawing connections to human infections. In particular, we highlight the need for robust animal models with which to directly control and assess the role of host genetics on viral infection outcomes.","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ferris, Martin T.; Heise, Mark T.","journal":"Advances in Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ac2452e7b3463270f4c19ca10892b1a80ab7661.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128000984000040; https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-800098-4.00004-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24373313/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128000984000040","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host genetic variation","host responses","host genetic contributions","role of host genetics","role of complex genetic networks","human infections","critical role","role of viral variants","key role","rare genetic variants","human studies","human populations","history of genetic associations","dissection of variant host genes","virus-induced disease responses","development","disease severity","viral infection outcomes","variety of experimental approaches","specific approaches","variety of factors","temporal dynamics of infections","confounding environmental variables","large cohorts","pathways difficult","identification","ethical limitation","goal of drawing connections","investigation","need","insights","tractable systems","robust animal models","discussion of recent advances","chapter","difficulty"],"language":"en"},

As recent history has shown the virus has a high pandemic potential, among other reasons, due to its ability to spread by air, hence the identification, investigation, containment, and treatment of viral diseases should be considered of paramount importance. In this sense, the bioinformatics research has focused on finding fast and efficient algorithms that can identify highly toxic antiviral peptides and to serve as a first filter, so that trials in the laboratory are substantially reduced. The work presented here contributes to this effort through the use of an algorithm already published by this team, called polarity index method, which identifies with high efficiency antiviral peptides from the exhaustive analysis of the polar profile, using the linear sequence of the peptide. The test carried out included all peptides in APD2 Database and 60 antiviral peptides identified by Kumar and co-workers (Nucleic Acids Res 40:W199\u2013204, 2012), to build its AVPpred algorithm. The validity of the method was focused on its discriminating capacity so we included the 15 sub-classifications of both Databases.

The role of RNase L in viral encephalomyelitis was explored based on its functions in inhibiting translation, inducing apoptosis, and propagating the IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 pathway through RNA degradation intermediates. Infection of RNase L deficient (RL(\u2212/\u2212)) mice with a sub-lethal, demyelinating mouse hepatitis virus variant revealed that the majority of mice succumbed to infection by day 12 p.i. However, RNase L deficiency did not affect overall control of infectious virus, or diminish IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 expression in the CNS. Furthermore, increased morbidity and mortality could not be attributed to altered proinflammatory signals or composition of cells infiltrating the CNS. The unique phenotype of infected RL(\u2212/\u2212) mice was rather manifested in earlier onset and increased severity of demyelination and axonal damage in brain stem and spinal cord without evidence for enhanced neuronal infection. Increased tissue damage coincided with sustained brain stem infection, foci of microglia infection in grey matter, and increased apoptotic cells. These data demonstrate a novel protective role for RNase L in viral induced CNS encephalomyelitis, which is not reflected in overall viral control or propagation of IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 mediated signals. Protective function is rather associated with cell type specific and regional restriction of viral replication in grey matter and ameliorated neurodegeneration and demyelination.","publish_time":"2009-10-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ireland, Derek D.

Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are not translated into proteins and play an important role in many biological and pathological processes such as inflammation, viral infection, and mitochondrial damage. However, whether ncRNAs participate in TGEV-induced inflammation in porcine intestinal epithelial cells is largely unknown. RESULTS: In this study, the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology was used to analyze the profiles of mRNAs, miRNAs, and circRNAs in Mock- and TGEV-infected intestinal porcine epithelial cell-jejunum 2 (IPEC-J2) cell line. A total of 523 mRNAs, 65 microRNAs (miRNAs), and 123 circular RNAs (circRNAs) were differentially expressed. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed differentially expressed mRNAs were linked to inflammation-related pathways, including NF-\u03BAB, Toll-like receptor, NOD-like receptor, Jak-STAT, TNF, and RIG-I-like receptor pathways. The interactions among mRNA, miRNA, and circRNA were analyzed. The data showed that ssc_circ_009380 and miR-22 might have interaction relationship. Dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-22 directly bound to ssc_circ_009380. We also observed that overexpression of miR-22 led to a reduction of p-I\u03BAB-\u03B1 and accumulation of p65 in nucleus in TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells. In contrast, inhibition of miR-22 had the opposite effects. Moreover, silencing of ssc_circ_009380 inhibited accumulation of p65 in nucleus and phosphorylation of I\u03BAB-\u03B1. CONCLUSIONS: The data revealed that differentially expressed mRNAs and ncRNAs were primarily enriched in inflammation-related pathways and ssc_circ_009380 promoted activation of NF-\u03BAB pathway by binding miR-22 during TGEV-induced inflammation.

This chapter presents the most important principles of prophylactic and therapeutic, and oral application of immunoglobulins. Because of the production conditions today about 20\u201340% of newborn farm animals (cattle, pigs, horses, goats, sheep) exhibit failure of passive transfer (FPT). The direct consequence of this is an increased susceptibility to diseases during the first weeks of life, which necessitates the wide use of antibiotics. As a further consequence, an increasing antibiotic-resistance of diarrheal strains of bacteria has become a fact. An alternative to using antibiotic is oral application of immunoglobulin products in the periods of greatest risk that is within the first days of life and in the postweaning period. Air-dried egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY), cow colostrum and swine serum, which can be produced on a large scale, provide the greatest chance for mass application. The most important protective role is played by specific antibodies against antigens present in the neonate\u0027s environment. The chapter discusses application of xenogenic antibodies. There are several indications for the application of cow colostrum to foals, lambs and kids, such as lack of, or low quality of maternal colostrum, mastitis, twins or multiple fetuses, and so on. Serum produced from the blood of slaughtered swine allows the large-scale production of immunoglobulins. An important problem with oral administration is proteolysis of the immunoglobulins by digestive enzymes, while another problem is caused by inactivation of antibody activity because of low pH.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stefaniak, T.","journal":"Biology of Growing Animals","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f8e7efae9fdae4f596b7cdb573ae5dee7eec4e70.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1877182309700955; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877182309700955","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["oral application of immunoglobulins","application of cow colostrum","application of xenogenic antibodies","mass application","chapter","oral application of immunoglobulin products","important problem","specific antibodies","oral administration","large-scale production of immunoglobulins","swine serum","low quality of maternal colostrum","important principles of prophylactic","important protective role","greatest chance","low pH","days of life","weeks of life","direct consequence","production conditions","control of intestinal diseases","increasing antibiotic-resistance","periods of greatest risk","blood of slaughtered swine","Air-dried egg yolk immunoglobulin","pigs","sheep","mastitis","proteolysis","cattle","horses","goats","exhibit failure of passive transfer","diarrheal strains of bacteria","antigens present","twins","lambs","dietary supplementation","foals","inactivation of antibody activity","newborn farm animals","FPT","lack","kids","increased susceptibility","digestive enzymes","neonate\u0027s environment","multiple fetuses","large scale","Publisher Summary","alternative","indications","wide use of antibiotics","postweaning period","fact"],"language":"en"},

Their use allows better management of often-finite resources to counter changes in soils that result from essential practices for crop production. Organic amendments provide macro- and micronutrients, including carbon for the restoration of soil physical and chemical properties. Challenges from the use of organic amendments arise from the presence of heavy metals and the inability to control the transformations required to convert the organic forms of N and P into the minerals available to crops, and particularly to minimize the losses of these nutrients in forms that may present a threat to human health. Animal manure and sewage biosolids, the organic amendments in greatest abundance, contain components that can be hazardous to human health, other animals and plants. Pathogens pose an immediate threat. Antibiotics, other pharmaceuticals and naturally produced hormones may pose a threat if they increase the number of zoonotic disease organisms that are resistant to multiple antimicrobial drugs or interfere with reproductive processes. Some approaches aimed at limiting N losses (e.g. covered liquid or slurry storage, rapid incorporation into the soil, timing applications to minimize delay before plant uptake) also tend to favor survival of pathogens. Risks to human health, through the food chain and drinking water, from the pathogens, antibiotics and hormonal substances that may be present in organic amendments can be reduced by treatment before land application, such as in the case of sewage biosolids.

However, biogeography has rarely been integrated into human or veterinary medicine nor routinely leveraged for global health management. Here we review the theory and application of biogeography to the research and management of human infectious diseases, an integration we refer to as \u2018pathogeography\u2019. Pathogeography represents a promising framework for understanding and decomposing the spatial distributions, diversity patterns and emergence risks of human infectious diseases into interpretable components of dynamic socio\u2010ecological systems. Analytical tools from biogeography are already helping to improve our understanding of individual infectious disease distributions and the processes that shape them in space and time. At higher levels of organization, biogeographical studies of diseases are rarer but increasing, improving our ability to describe and explain patterns that emerge at the level of disease communities (e.g. co\u2010occurrence, diversity patterns, biogeographic regionalisation). Even in a highly globalized world most human infectious diseases remain constrained in their geographic distributions by ecological barriers to the dispersal or establishment of their causal pathogens, reservoir hosts and/or vectors. These same processes underpin the spatial arrangement of other taxa, such as mammalian biodiversity, providing a strong empirical \u2018prior\u2019 with which to assess the potential distributions of infectious diseases when data on their occurrence is unavailable or limited. In the absence of quality data, generalized biogeographic patterns could provide the earliest (and in some cases the only) insights into the potential distributions of many poorly known or emerging, or as\u2010yet\u2010unknown, infectious disease risks. Encouraging more community ecologists and biogeographers to collaborate with health professionals (and vice versa) has the potential to improve our understanding of infectious disease systems and identify novel management strategies to improve local, global and planetary health.","publish_time":"2018-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Murray, Kris A.; Olivero, Jes\u00FAs; Roche, Benjamin; Tiedt, Sonia; Gu\u00E9gan, Jean\u2010Francois","journal":"Ecography (Cop.)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/226f1915807d7a47dec679f19990623796034f77.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7163494.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32313369/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.03625","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["management of human infectious diseases","potential distributions of infectious diseases","infectious disease risks","understanding of infectious disease systems","understanding of individual infectious disease distributions","emergence risks of human infectious diseases","spatial distributions","diversity patterns","geographic distributions","biogeographic patterns","biodiversity management","global health management","application of biogeography","biogeographical studies of diseases","ecological systems","novel management strategies","level of disease communities","processes","planetary health","health professionals","pathogeography","ecological barriers","biogeographic regionalisation","mammalian biodiversity","spatial arrangement","absence of quality data","interpretable components of dynamic socio","co\u2010occurrence","establishment","speciation","dispersal","research","causal pathogens","reservoir hosts","fundamental component","higher levels of organization","globalized world","biogeographers","taxa","invasive species","dimension of modern biology","integration","veterinary medicine","insights","community ecologists","promising framework","cases","vectors","space","Analytical tools","theory","ability","time"],"language":"en"},

While the sharing economy may contribute to addressing sustainability issues, its actual economic, social and environmental impacts remain poorly understood. Advancing more sustainably promising forms of sharing and leveraging its benefits, while circumventing its pitfalls, is becoming increasingly important in the era of Covid-19 and climate crisis, economic downturn and uncertainty, and loss of social connectedness, particularly in anonymous urban environments. The ways to capitalise on strengths of the sharing economy are still poorly understood. In particular, the roles and perspectives of users, businesses and municipal governments in institutionalising the sharing economy in various geographical contexts are essential to examine. This volume seeks to advance the research field by focusing on four research areas: 1) understanding the sharing economy conceptually; 2) user perspectives on the sharing economy; 3) business perspective on the sharing economy; and 4) urban governance perspective on the sharing economy. The twenty articles in this volume discuss sustainability implications of the sharing economy from different perspectives, in various geographical contexts, and drawing on a range of disciplines. The volume makes a significant contribution by bringing in empirical findings from emerging and developing economies, including Brazil, China, Indonesia, Poland, the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam, thereby supplementing more frequently discussed perspectives from high-income countries. The volume also outlines the course for future research.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mont, Oksana; Palgan, Yuliya Voytenko; Bradley, Karin; Zvolska, Lucie","journal":"Journal of Cleaner Production","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8beee74c83d3c097080b9d29d4e70b75f5e7a3ba.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.122215; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652620322629?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959652620322629","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brazil","China","Indonesia","Philippines","South Korea","Thailand","Vietnam"],"keyphrases":["Abstract Sharing economy platforms","promising forms of sharing","volume","different perspectives","perspectives of users","user perspectives","discussed perspectives","various geographical contexts","research field","future research","research areas","urban governance perspective","economic downturn","sustainability implications","sustainability issues","business perspective","loss of social connectedness","anonymous urban environments","uncertainty","Poland","production","climate crisis","municipal governments","empirical findings","Brazil","economies","South Korea","Philippines","businesses","consumption systems","Vietnam","Thailand","cities","China","Indonesia","significant contribution","roles","environmental impacts","era of Covid","world","high-income countries","benefits","articles","course","strengths","pitfalls","range of disciplines","ways"],"language":"en"},

In our former work, the effects of the air cleaner on removing the uniformly distributed particles were numerically investigated. Based on those results, this work further explores the performances of the air cleaner in the reduction of two nonuniform particle distributions generated by smoking and coughing. The Lagrangian discrete trajectory model combined with the Eulerian fluid method is employed to simulate the airflow pattern and particle transport in a room. In general, the results show that the particle fates have been resulted from the interaction between the emitting source and the air cleaner. And the position of the air cleaner is a key parameter affecting the particle concentration, for which a shorter distance between the air cleaner and the human body corresponds to a lower concentration. Besides, the air velocity emitted from the human mouth and the orientation of the air cleaner can also influence the transport of particles.","publish_time":"2016-08-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Lin; Jin, Xinming; Yang, Lijun; Du, Xiaoze; Yang, Yongping","journal":"Build Simul","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f55a6f6b406877615f8e54fd1709a3a07bfc3a2a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12273-016-0310-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32218898/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["air velocity","Air cleaners","indoor air quality","particle concentration","particle transport","particle fates","transport of particles","nonuniform particle distributions","fine particles","distributed particles","results","work","human mouth","human body","lower concentration","gaseous contaminants","reduction","key parameter","Lagrangian discrete trajectory model","Eulerian fluid method","shorter distance","smoking","airflow pattern","emitting source","orientation","interaction","coughing","room","effects","performances","position"],"language":"en"},

The dictionary-based approach has been adopted to process abbreviations, but it cannot handle ad hoc abbreviations, and it is impossible to cover all abbreviations. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes an automatic abbreviation expansion method called LMAAE (Language Model-based Automatic Abbreviation Expansion). In this method, the abbreviation is firstly divided into blocks; then, expansion candidates are generated by restoring each block; and finally, the expansion candidates are filtered and clustered to acquire the final expansion result according to the language model and clustering method. Through restrict the abbreviation to prefix abbreviation, the search space of expansion is reduced sharply. And then, the search space is continuous reduced by restrained the effective and the length of the partition. In order to validate the effective of the method, two types of experiments are designed. For standard abbreviations, the expansion results include most of the expansion in dictionary. Therefore, it has a high precision. For ad hoc abbreviations, the precisions of schema matching, knowledge fusion are increased by using this method to handle the abbreviations. Although the recall for standard abbreviation needs to be improved, but this does not affect the good complement effect for the dictionary method.","publish_time":"2019-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Du, Xiaokun; Zhu, Rongbo; Li, Yanhong; Anjum, Ashiq","journal":"Future Gener Comput Syst","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/68e4d8ce02ce0fbbf81ef369620ef3b220be6f51.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103364.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X18326529; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167739X18326529; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287562/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2019.01.016","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["automatic abbreviation expansion method","expansion candidates","expansion results","dictionary method","standard abbreviations","search space of expansion","clustering method","final expansion result","Language Model","dictionary-based approach","biomedical big data analysis","biomedical domain","various data sets","LMAAE","significant obstacles","precisions of schema matching","paper","knowledge fusion","good complement effect","blocks","types of experiments","length","partition","drawbacks","recall","high precision","order"],"language":"en"},

Scope of review Current knowledge on the molecular background and the implication of histo-blood group glycans in the prevention and therapy of infectious and non-communicable diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, is presented. Major conclusions Glycan-based histo-blood groups are associated with intestinal microbiota composition, the risk of various diseases as well as therapeutic success of, e.g., vaccination. Their potential as prebiotic or anti-microbial agents, as disease biomarkers and vaccine targets should be further investigated in future studies. For this, recent and future technological advancements will be of particular importance, especially with regard to the unambiguous structural characterization of the glycan portion in combination with information on the protein and lipid carriers of histo-blood group-active glycans in large cohorts. General significance Histo-blood group glycans have a unique linking position in the complex network of genes, oncodevelopmental biological processes, and disease mechanisms.

In addition, several reverse genetic systems for RNA viruses such as members of Coronaviridae and Flaviviridae could be established based on BAC constructs. Transfection into susceptible eukaryotic cells of virus DNA cloned as a BAC allows reconstitution of recombinant viruses. In this paper, we provide an overview on the strategies that can be used for the generation of virus BAC vectors and also on systems that are currently available for various virus species.

As such, they can contribute to the spread of numerous infectious diseases, including influenza and SARS. The range of contamination of the droplets is largely determined by their size. However, major uncertainties on the drop size distributions persist. Here, we report direct observation of the physical mechanisms of droplet formation at the exit of the mouth during sneezing. Specifically, we use high-speed imaging to directly examine the fluid fragmentation at the exit of the mouths of healthy subjects. We reveal for the first time that the breakup of the fluid into droplets continues to occur outside of the respiratory tract during violent exhalations. We show that such breakup involves a complex cascade of events from sheets, to bag bursts, to ligaments, which finally break into droplets. Finally, we reveal that the viscoelasticity of the mucosalivary fluid plays an important role in delaying fragmentation by causing the merger of the droplet precursors that form along stretched filaments; thereby affecting the final drop size distribution farther downstream.

Therefore the main purpose of the present study was to investigate the anticancer effects of glycyrrhizinic acid in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The MTT assay was used to evaluate the anticancer effects while a clonogenic assay was used to study its effects on colony formation tendency. Flow cytometry was used to study the effects on cell cycle phase distribution and apoptosis. Western blot assay was used to study changes in protein expression of the m-TOR/PI3K/Akt pathway. RESULTS: The results indicated that glycyrrhizinic acid caused significant (p \u003C 0.01). The growth inhibitory effects MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. The growth inhibitory effects of glycyrrhizinic acid exhibited concentration-dependent as well as time-dependent growth inhibitory trend. Different doses of glycyrrhizinic acid had a tendency to significantly (p \u003C 0.01) inhibit the colony formation tendency of MCF-7 cells. As compared to the control group, glycyrrhizinic acid-treated cells showed a high percentage of apoptotic cells. Cells treated with a 10, 50 and 100 \u00B5M dose of glycyrrhizinic acid led to a 24.3%, 41.5% and 82.1% increase in the sub-G1 phase (apoptotic) cells.

Despite the long history of wastewater research, comprehensive understanding of the role and behavior of HRPs during wastewater treatment is still limited owing to the complexity of the community. In recent decades, the rapid development of molecular tools, especially the wide application of next generation sequencing technologies, helps to unravel the community composition, structure, and dynamic variation in wastewater. Overall, this chapter mainly focuses on biological HRPs, including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, helminth, biotoxins, antibiotic resistance genes and antibiotic resistant bacteria in wastewater. The characteristics, classification, fates, functions, and health implications of these HRPs are introduced in detail. Moreover, the biogeography of HRPs is a research hotspot in recent years, and available information is also summarized in this chapter. Finally, we also propose the future research needs of HRPs in wastewater after the comprehensive summary of the existing research reports. This chapter is wished to be helpful for beginners to quickly understand the biological HRPs in wastewater.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jia, Shuyu; Zhang, Xuxiang","journal":"High-Risk Pollutants in Wastewater","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe88e94bea58822814eb13557d72015544298ff2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153338.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128164488000034; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128164488000034","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["biological HRPs","behavior of HRPs","wastewater treatment","biogeography of HRPs","long history of wastewater research","future research needs of HRPs","chapter","research hotspot","existing research reports","antibiotic resistant bacteria","comprehensive understanding","comprehensive summary","recent years","recent decades","human health","health implications","Abstract Biological high-risk pollutants","community composition","antibiotic resistance genes","helminth","biotoxins","wide application","viruses","role","rapid development of molecular tools","fates","functions","protozoa","structure","limited owing","dynamic variation","generation sequencing technologies","available information","serious threat","major sources","characteristics","classification","complexity","beginners","natural environment"],"language":"en"},

Because vaccines or antiviral drugs for the treatment of this disease are not available, monitoring the SFTS circulation in animals and controlling the tick-mammal cycle are important for preventing SFTS. Monoclonal antibodies against the recombinant nucleoprotein of SFTSV were generated to develop a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) for the detection of antibodies against SFTSV infection in cattle. The specificity and sensitivity of cELISA was assessed by comparing the results of this assay to those of an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The results of the cELISA using 416 field bovine serum samples and laboratory-immunized positive sera showed 98.1% consistency with those of the IFA.

This approach provides sequence information of the diagnostic regions of detected organisms that is considerably more informative over that provided from other microarray techniques.","publish_time":"2009-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Baochuan; Malanoski, Anthony P.","journal":"DNA Microarrays for Biomedical Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c8863bd543b53a71b7f748031ae00dacb8270884.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7176175.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19381976/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-59745-538-1_15","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsxODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["density of probes","sequence information","Hybridization","various microarrays","Resequencing microarrays","Microarray technology","series of perfect matched probes","absence information","viral pathogens","target organism\u2019s nucleotide sequence","high-density re-sequencing microarrays","microarray techniques","analysis of microbial pathogens","strain-specific single nucleotide polymorphism","great potential","confirmatory presence","SNP","diagnostic regions of detected organisms","detection","time ranges","data","virulence markers","assay completion","variation","approach","purpose","success"],"language":"en"},

Even if the efficacy of this combination is under evaluation, clinicians have begun to use it largely. As these medications are known to prolong QT interval, we analyzed serial electrocardiograms (ECG) performed in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia and treated with HCQ \u002B AZ. 50 consecutive patients received the combination of HCQ (600mg/d for 10 days) and AZ (500mg Day 1 and 250mg daily days 2 to 5). Twelve-lead ECG were performed before treatment, at Day 3, 5 and at discharge. Median age of patients was 68 years, 55.2% were males. Main comorbidities were hypertension (37%) and diabetes (17%). Mean QTc was 408 ms at baseline and rose up to 437 ms at Day 3 and to 456 ms at Day 5. 38 patients (76 %) presented short term modifications of QTc (\u003E 30 ms). Treatment discontinuation was decided in 6 patients (12%) leading to QTc normalization in 5 of them. No death, no cardiac arrhythmic event were observed in this cohort. Our report confirms that a short duration treatment with HCQ \u002B AZ modifies QTc interval. Treatment has to be stopped for QTc modifications in 12% of patients. Nevertheless, in inpatients hospitalized for COVID-19, we did not observe any clinically relevant consequence of these transitory modifications. In conclusion, when patients are treated with HCQ\u002BAZ, cardiac monitoring should be regularly performed and hospital settings allow to do it in safe conditions.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Voisin, Olivier; Lorc\u2019h, Erwan le; Mah\u00E9, Annabelle; Azria, Philippe; Borie, Marie-Fran\u00E7oise; Hubert, Sidonie; M\u00E9nage, Elodie; Guillerm, Jean-Christophe; Mourad, Jean-Jacques","journal":"Mayo Clinic Proceedings","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1103bdb4a28f5440dfcafbaee7794f974cd5ca95.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.05.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025619620304754; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025619620304754?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsyMzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCQ   AZ","HCQ","AZ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["combination of HCQ","QTc modifications","consecutive patients","QTc interval","Mean QTc","Median age of patients","QTc normalization","COVID","short term modifications of QTc","Treatment discontinuation","short duration treatment","transitory modifications","combination of hydroxychloroquine","QT interval","cardiac monitoring","lead ECG","daily days","cardiac arrhythmic event","serial electrocardiograms","years","azithromycin","baseline","hypertension","death","evaluation","Abstract","candidate drugs","relevant consequence","report","pneumonia","intense attention","Main comorbidities","hospital settings","cohort","medications","efficacy","clinicians","safe conditions","diabetes","males","inpatients","discharge","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

This species is currently considered as the main EBLV-1 reservoir. Multievent capture-recapture models were used to determine the factors influencing bat rabies transmission as this method accounts for imperfect detection and uncertainty in disease states. Considering the period of study, analyses revealed that survival and recapture probabilities were not affected by the serological status of individuals, confirming the capacity of bats to be exposed to lyssaviruses without dying. Five bats have been found with EBLV-1 RNA in the saliva at the start of the study, suggesting they were caught during virus excretion period. Among these bats, one was interestingly recaptured one year later and harbored a seropositive status. Along the survey, some others bats have been observed to both seroconvert (i.e. move from a negative to a positive serological status) and serorevert (i.e. move from a positive to a negative serological status). Peak of seroprevalence reached 34% and 70% in site A and B respectively. On one of the 2 sites, global decrease of seroprevalence was observed all along the study period nuanced by oscillation intervals of approximately 2\u20133 years supporting the oscillation infection dynamics hypothesized during a previous EBLV-1 study in a Myotis myotis colony. Seroprevalence were affected by significantly higher seroprevalence in summer than in spring. The maximum time observed between successive positive serological statuses of a bat demonstrated the potential persistence of neutralizing antibodies for at least 4 years. At last, EBLV-1 serological status transitions have been shown driven by age category with higher seroreversion frequencies in adults than in juvenile. Juveniles and female adults seemed indeed acting as distinct drivers of the rabies virus dynamics, hypothesis have been addressed but their exact role in the EBLV-1 transmission still need to be specified.","publish_time":"2017-11-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robardet, Emmanuelle; Borel, Christophe; Moinet, Marie; Jouan, Doroth\u00E9e; Wasniewski, Marine; Barrat, Jacques; Bou\u00E9, Franck; Montch\u00E2tre-Leroy, Elodie; Servat, Alexandre; Gimenez, Olivier; Cliquet, Florence; Picard-Meyer, Evelyne","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51f9ab9c7010dae7a662a33f0fd32e91a2001523.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5693283.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0006048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29149215/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsyMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["European Bat Lyssavirus"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["negative serological status","serological status transitions","serological status of individuals","period of study","study period","previous EBLV","main EBLV","higher seroprevalence","seropositive status","successive positive serological statuses","bat rabies transmission","serotine bat","Peak of seroprevalence","capacity of bats","longitudinal serological surveys of European Bat Lyssavirus type","rabies virus dynamics","years","global decrease of seroprevalence","virus excretion period","oscillation infection dynamics","Myotis myotis colony","female adults","oscillation intervals","recapture probabilities","higher seroreversion frequencies","potential persistence of neutralizing antibodies","Multievent capture-recapture models","method accounts","imperfect detection","uncertainty","age category","maternity colonies","Eptesicus serotinus","distinct drivers","analyses","maximum time","disease states","hypothesis","survival","factors","saliva","serorevert","sites","start","RNA","exact role","summer","spring","North-East of France","Juveniles","reservoir","species","lyssaviruses"],"language":"en"},

Among them, many service operations, which require customers to travel and visit a place indoor, become almost infeasible to run in a crowded city like Hong Kong. Motivated by a recent reported real case on an innovative service operation in Hong Kong, we build analytical models to explore how logistics and technologies together can transform the \u201Cstatic service operations\u201D to become the \u201Cbring-service-near-your-home\u201D mobile service operations. We also highlight how the government may provide the subsidy to support the above mentioned mobile service operation (MSO) to make it financially viable. We specifically show that the government may adopt the fixed-cost-subsidy (FCS) scheme, operations-cost-subsidy (OCS) scheme or safety-technology-support (STS) scheme to help. We further uncover that the OCS scheme would bring a larger consumer surplus than the FCS scheme and is hence more preferable. In the extended models, we first study the case when service fee cannot be changed because of corona virus outbreak (CVO). We then explore the feasibility of adopting MSO in the long run as a financially self-sustainable service operation and derive the analytical conditions under which MSO is a win-win business model for both the service provider and consumers.

In addition, individuals were encouraged to adopt personal health measures such as social isolation. Information regarding the disease and recommended avoidance measures were distributed through a variety of channels including social media, news websites, and emails. Previous research suggests that the vast amount of available information can be confusing, potentially resulting in overconcern and information overload. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the impact of online information on the individual-level intention to voluntarily self-isolate during the pandemic. Using the protection-motivation theory as a framework, we propose a model outlining the effects of cyberchondria and information overload on individuals\u2019 perceptions and motivations. METHODS: To test the proposed model, we collected data with an online survey (N=225) and analyzed it using partial least square-structural equation modeling. The effects of social media and living situation were tested through multigroup analysis. RESULTS: Cyberchondria and information overload had a significant impact on individuals\u2019 threat and coping perceptions, and through them on self-isolation intention. Among the appraisal constructs, perceived severity (P=.002) and self-efficacy (P=.003) positively impacted self-isolation intention, while response cost (P\u003C.001) affected the intention negatively. Cyberchondria (P=.003) and information overload (P=.003) indirectly affected self-isolation intention through the aforementioned perceptions. Using social media as an information source increased both cyberchondria and information overload. No differences in perceptions were found between people living alone and those living with their families. CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19, frequent use of social media contributed to information overload and overconcern among individuals. To boost individuals\u2019 motivation to adopt preventive measures such as self-isolation, actions should focus on lowering individuals\u2019 perceived response costs in addition to informing them about the severity of the situation.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Farooq, Ali; Laato, Samuli; Islam, A K M Najmul","journal":"J Med Internet Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7205033.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/19128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32330115/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsyNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["information overload","information source","available information","self-isolation intention","social isolation","impact of online information","individuals\u2019 perceptions","effects of social media","self-isolate","self-efficacy","individuals\u2019 motivation","effects of cyberchondria","frequent use of social media","individuals\u2019 threat","coping perceptions","aforementioned perceptions","individual-level intention","lowering individuals\u2019 perceived response costs","preventive measures","perceived severity","COVID","pandemic","addition","overconcern","coronavirus disease","situation","personal health measures","recommended avoidance measures","significant impact","online survey","proposed model","protection-motivation theory","movement restrictions","governments","actions","placed areas","quarantine","data","news websites","variety of channels","square-structural equation modeling","framework","appraisal constructs","study","motivations","spread","emails","RESULTS","Previous research","multigroup analysis","METHODS","OBJECTIVE","BACKGROUND","differences","people","CONCLUSIONS","families"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: International passengers arriving at 18 U.S. airports from Asia, Europe, South America, and Canada were assigned to one of three states: not infected, infected with PI, infected with other respiratory illness. Passengers passed through layered screening then exited the model. 80% screening effectiveness was assumed for symptomatic passengers; 6% asymptomatic passengers. RESULTS: In the first 100 days of a global pandemic, U.S. airport screening would evaluate over 17 M passengers with 800 K secondary screenings. 11,570 PI infected passengers (majority asymptomatic) would enter the U.S. undetected from all 18 airports. Foreign airport departure screening significantly decreased the false negative (infected/undetected) passengers. U.S. attack rates: no screening (26.9%\u201330.9%); screening (26.4%\u201330.6%); however airport screening results in 800 K\u20131.8 M less U.S. PI cases; 16 K\u201335 K less deaths (2% fatality rate). Antiviral medications for travel contact prophylaxis (10 contacts/PI passenger) were high \u2013 8.8 M. False positives from all 18 airports: 100\u2013200/day. CONCLUSIONS: Foreign shore exit screening greatly reduces numbers of PI infected passengers. U.S. airport screening identifies 50% infected individuals; efficacy is limited by the asymptomatic PI infected. Screening will not significantly delay arrival of PI via international air transport, but will reduce the rate of new US cases and subsequent deaths.","publish_time":"2009-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Malone, John D.; Brigantic, Robert; Muller, George A.; Gadgil, Ashok; Delp, Woody; McMahon, Benjamin H.; Lee, Russell; Kulesz, Jim; Mihelic, F.

Examining past investments can help prioritize limited future resources to either build on Canada\u2019s existing strengths or fill gaps where needed, while simultaneously informing the investments of research funders in other countries. METHODS: Administrative data were analyzed covering all 1584 global health research grants awarded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) to 927 unique principal investigators from 2000 to 2016, totalling C$341 million. Existing metadata associated with each grant was supplemented by additional qualitative coding. Descriptive time-series analyses of global health research grant data were conducted using various measures related to each grant\u2019s recipient (e.g., province, university, sex, distribution) and subject matter (e.g., research theme, area, focus). RESULTS: CIHR\u2019s total annual global health research funding increased sharply from $3.6 million in FY2000/2001 to $30.3 million in FY2015/2016, with the largest share of research funding now focused on health equity\u2014representing nearly 50% of CIHR\u2019s global health research funding. Past grants have concentrated on infectious disease and public health research. One third of CIHR\u2019s global health grant funding went to 20 principal investigators. Only 42.2% of global health research funding came from CIHR\u2019s open investigator-driven competitions, with the rest coming from strategic priority-driven competitions. CONCLUSION: Global health research has seen steady increases in funding from CIHR\u2019s open competitions when preceded by investment in strategic competitions, which suggests the level of a national research funding agency\u2019s strategic investments in global health research may determine the size of the field in their country. The greatest concentration of past investment lies in health equity research, followed by infectious disease research. Future analyses of research funding would benefit from an internationally accepted keyword classification scheme and more granular administrative data.

HuNoVs have recently been isolated from pet dogs in Europe (M. Summa, C.-H. von Bonsdorff, and L. Maunula, J Clin Virol 53:244\u2013247, 2012, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2011.12.014), raising concerns about potential zoonotic infections. With 31% of United Kingdom households owning a dog, this could prove to be an important transmission route. To examine this risk, canine tissues were studied for their ability to bind to HuNoV in vitro. In addition, canine stool samples were analyzed for the presence of viral nucleic acid, and canine serum samples were tested for the presence of anti-HuNoV antibodies. The results showed that seven different genotypes of HuNoV virus-like particles (VLPs) can bind to canine gastrointestinal tissue, suggesting that infection is at least theoretically possible. Although HuNoV RNA was not identified in stool samples from 248 dogs, serological evidence of previous exposure to HuNoV was obtained in 43/325 canine serum samples. Remarkably, canine seroprevalence for different HuNoV genotypes mirrored the seroprevalence in the human population. Though entry and replication within cells have not been demonstrated, the canine serological data indicate that dogs produce an immune response to HuNoV, implying productive infection. In conclusion, this study reveals zoonotic implications for HuNoV, and to elucidate the significance of this finding, further epidemiological and molecular investigations will be essential.","publish_time":"2015-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Caddy, Sarah L.; de Rougemont, Alexis; Emmott, Edward; El-Attar, Laila; Mitchell, Judy A.; Hollinshead, Michael; Belliot, Gael; Brownlie, Joe; Le Pendu, Jacques; Goodfellow, Ian","journal":"J Clin Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb76fcd0194eeda7dc70702dacad97492a497bea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4432062.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.02778-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25832298/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["C.-H. von Bonsdorff","L.

Opportunistic infectious agents that cause diarrhea in patients with HIV span the array of protozoa, fungi, viruses, and bacteria. With global use of ART, the incidence of diarrhea because of opportunistic infections has decreased; however, the incidence of noninfectious diarrhea has increased. The etiology of noninfectious diarrhea in patients with HIV is multifactorial and includes ART-associated diarrhea and gastrointestinal damage related to HIV infection (i.e., HIV enteropathy). A basic algorithm for the diagnosis of diarrhea in patients with HIV includes physical examination, a review of medical history, assessment of HIV viral load and CD4\u002B T cell count, stool microbiologic assessment, and endoscopic evaluation, if needed. For patients with negative diagnostic results, the diagnosis of noninfectious diarrhea may be considered. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of noninfectious diarrhea are primarily supportive; however, the use of many unapproved agents is based on unstudied and anecdotal information. In addition, these agents can be associated with treatment-limiting adverse events (AEs), such as drug\u2013drug interactions with ART regimens, abuse liability, and additional gastrointestinal AEs. Currently, crofelemer, an antisecretory agent, is the only therapy approved in the USA for the symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in patients with HIV on ART.","publish_time":"2015-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dikman, Andrew E.; Schonfeld, Emily; Srisarajivakul, Nalinee C.; Poles, Michael A.","journal":"Dig Dis Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e136fdfc76cd52435cf224414e8a59fa3eaf227.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4499110.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-015-3615-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25772777/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of diarrhea","incidence of diarrhea","diagnosis of noninfectious diarrhea","treatment of noninfectious diarrhea","incidence of noninfectious diarrhea","experience diarrhea","ART-associated diarrhea","etiology of noninfectious diarrhea","HIV infection","HIV enteropathy","symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea","half of patients","assessment of HIV viral load","ART regimens","global use of ART","Opportunistic infectious agents","unapproved agents","additional gastrointestinal AEs","microbiologic assessment","drug interactions","gastrointestinal damage","antiretroviral therapy","opportunistic infections","abuse liability","T cell count","CD4","review of medical history","human immunodeficiency virus","physical examination","adherence","negative diagnostic results","quality of life","array of protozoa","fungi","viruses","USA","Pharmacologic options","antisecretory agent","endoscopic evaluation","adverse events","basic algorithm","anecdotal information","crofelemer","bacteria"],"language":"en"},

We dynamic detected the SARS-CoV-2 in eye sample of one COVID-19 patient with obstruction of common lacrimal ducts. METHODS Besides the routine examination, nasopharyngeal and eye swab were continuously measured by polymerase chain reaction assay and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Gene detection was performed for drug use guidance, and flow cytometry was performed to analyse the lymphocyte subsets. RESULTS Nasopharyngeal swabs were positive for 22 days, but eye swabs were still continuously positive for 2 weeks after nasopharyngeal swabs turned negative. The low level of lymphocyte and the high level IL-6 lasted for almost 4 weeks, then became near normal. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) confirmed the existing of SARS-CoV-2, HSV1 and HHV6B virus nucleic acid. The gene detection for drug use guidance showed the genetic locus ABCB1 (3435T\u003EC) rs1045642 belonged to type CC and it mean the efficiency of lopinavir-ritonavir would be significantly decreased.

Aged rats underwent unilateral femoral marrow ablation and treatment with PTH or vehicle for four weeks. Both femurs from each rat were analyzed by X-ray and pQCT, then analyzed either by microCT, histology or biomechanical testing. Marrow ablation alone induced transient bone formation of low abundance that persisted over four weeks, while marrow ablation followed by PTH induced bone formation of high abundance that also persisted over four weeks. Our data confirms that the osteo-inducive effect of marrow ablation and the additive effect of marrow ablation, followed by PTH, occurs in aged rats. Our observations open new avenues of investigations in the field of tissue regeneration. Local marrow ablation, in conjunction with an anabolic agent, might provide a new platform for rapid site-directed bone growth in areas of high bone loss, such as in the hip and wrist, which are subject to fracture.","publish_time":"2012-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Qing; Miller, Christopher; Bible, Jesse; Li, Jiliang; Xu, Xiaoqing; Mehta, Nozer; Gilligan, James; Vignery, Agn\u00E8s; Scholz, Jodi A Carlson","journal":"Cells","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4a64ef9057367aec43ce6b8a40e9bb0c9587fdf4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3901151.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/cells1041168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24710549/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PTH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Mechanical ablation of bone marrow","Local marrow ablation","additive effect of marrow ablation","unilateral femoral marrow ablation","osteo-inducive effect of marrow ablation","PTH treatment","weeks","transient bone growth","PTH induced bone formation of high abundance","aged rats","transient bone formation of low abundance","areas of high bone loss","young rats","rapid site","new platform","observations open new avenues of investigations","months","conjunction","microCT","anabolic agent","administration of parathyroid hormone","field of tissue regeneration","vehicle","increased cortical thickness","wrist","pQCT","histology","biomechanical testing","hip","X-ray","fracture","data","femurs","study"],"language":"en"},

The assay is based on the 5\u2032 nuclease activity of the Thermus flavus (Tfl) polymerase and a fluorogenic probe which generates fluorescence when it is cleaved. The fluorogenic probe, also called TaqMan\u2122 probe (Perkin Elmer, Foster City, USA), is an oligonucleotide designed to bind between the two PCR primers to the target cDNA and is labeled with a reporter and a quencher dye. In the intact probe, the quencher dye suppresses the fluorescence of the reporter dye by F\u00F6rster-type energy transfer. During the polymerase extension steps the Tfl exonuclease activity cleaves the hybridised probe resulting in the generation of fluorescent emission of the reporter dye. The threshold cycle (C(T) value) indicates the increase of reporter fluorescence and is directly related to the initial amount of target cDNA or RNA, respectively. Fluorescence is monitored in real time after each cycle by a Perkin-Elmer ABI Prism\u00AE 7700 Sequence Detector. After completion of amplification, the C(T) values of the samples are calculated back to a standard curve, generated by amplification of diluted standard molecules. The one-tube RT-PCR described below allows precise quantitation, is highly sensitive, rapid (no separate reverse transcription step and no post-amplification steps), easy to handle, allows for a high sample throughput, shows a very good reproducibility, and can be executed with a low risk of contamination. The design of the primers\u2013probe combination enables the detection of all known FCoV strains and is also useful for the detection of canine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine respiratory coronavirus.","publish_time":"1999-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gut, Marco; M.

We examined the effect of these factors in a population-based sample of adults with ILI. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study in community-dwelling Australian adults nested within an influenza vaccine effectiveness trial. On presentation with ILI, participants were swabbed for a range of respiratory viruses and asked to return a questionnaire collecting details of household members with or without similar symptoms. We used logistic and Poisson regression to assess the key characteristics of household transmission. RESULTS: 258 participants from multi-occupancy households experienced 279 ILI episodes and returned a questionnaire. Of these, 183 were the primary case in the household allowing assessment of factors associated with transmission. Transmission was significantly associated in univariate analyses with female sex (27% vs. 13%, risk ratio (RR) = 2.13 (1.08, 4.21)) and the presence of a child in the house (33% vs. 17%, RR = 1.90 (1.11, 3.26)). The secondary household attack proportion (SHAP) was 0.14, higher if influenza was isolated (RR = 2.1 (1.0, 4.5)). Vaccinated participants who nonetheless became infected with influenza had a higher SHAP (Incidence RR = 5.24 (2.17, 12.6)). CONCLUSIONS: The increased SHAP in households of vaccinated participants who nonetheless had confirmed influenza infection supports the hypothesis that in years of vaccine mismatch, not only is influenza vaccine less protective for the vaccine recipient, but that the population\u2019s immunity is also lower.","publish_time":"2012-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"McCaw, James M; Howard, Peter F; Richmond, Peter C; Nissen, Michael; Sloots, Theo; Lambert, Stephen B; Lai, Michael; Greenberg, Michael; Nolan, Terry; McVernon, Jodie","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/415ccc587d634fc429ac080cf06694f78621ef73.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3538067.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23231698/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-12-345","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Household transmission of influenza","influenza infection","influenza vaccine effectiveness trial","key characteristics of household transmission","households of vaccinated participants","vaccine recipient","higher SHAP","ILI episodes","Incidence RR","details of household members","increased SHAP","years of vaccine mismatch","secondary household attack proportion","questionnaire","Australian adults","assessment of factors","demographic characteristics","multi-occupancy households","population-based sample of adults","community","hypothesis","prospective cohort study","Poisson regression","univariate analyses","illness","population\u2019s immunity","female sex","RESULTS","similar symptoms","primary case","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","range of respiratory viruses","presence","child","METHODS","risk ratio","presentation"],"language":"en"},

In Beijing, family clusters are the main mode of human-human transmission accounting for 57.6% of the total confirmed cases. METHOD: We present the epidemiological and clinical features of the clusters of three large and one small families. RESULT: Our results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted quickly through contact with index case, and a total of 22/24 infections were observed. Among those infected, 20/22 had mild symptoms and only two had moderate to severe clinical manifestations. Children in the families generally showed milder symptoms. The incubation period varied from 2 to 13 days, and the shedding of virus from the upper respiratory tract lasted from 5 to over 30 days. A prolonged period of virus shedding (\u003E30 days) in upper respiratory tract was observed in 6/24 cases. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted quickly in the form of family clusters. While the infection rate is high within the cluster, the disease manifestations, latent period, and virus shedding period varied greatly. We therefore recommend rigorously testing contacts even during the no-symptom phase and consider whether viral shedding has ceased before stopping isolation measures for an individual.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Rui; Han, Bing; Song, Meihua; Wang, Lin; Conlon, Christopher P.; Dong, Tao; Tian, Di; Zhang, Wei; Chen, Zhihai; Zhang, Fujie; Shi, Mang; Li, Xingwang","journal":"J Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eccb276e9011194273b0c57314d905e24ac5b93f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/900b85c7ec86df13438f56316108bda6e56b9c9b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7177072.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445320302292; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320302292?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32335171/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.018","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["shedding of virus","prolonged period of virus shedding","days","SARS-CoV","latent period","viral shedding","incubation period","upper respiratory tract","form of family clusters","severe clinical manifestations","total confirmed cases","disease manifestations","clinical features","mild symptoms","milder symptoms","small families","main mode of human","human transmission accounting","isolation measures","symptom phase","infection rate","index case","Beijing","discovery","results","China","global pandemic","individual","Children","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","contacts","METHOD","infections"],"language":"en"},

LKT binding induces activation, and subsequent cytolysis, of these cells. It is well known that active viral infection greatly increases the susceptibility of cattle to pasteurellosis. To better understand the mechanism by which this occurs, we investigated the effects of experimental in vivo infection of cattle with bovine herpes virus-1 (BHV-1) on the ex vivo interaction of bovine leukocytes with the M. haemolytica LKT. In this study, we demonstrated that active BHV-1 infection increased the expression of the \u03B22-integrin CD11a/CD18 (as defined by the mAb BAT75) on bovine peripheral blood neutrophils, enhanced the binding of LKT to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) leukocytes and peripheral blood neutrophils, and increased the killing of BAL leukocytes and peripheral blood leukocytes by LKT. In addition, BHV-1 greatly increased the number of BAL, resulting in many more LKT-responsive cells being present in the lungs.

Our study introduces a novel approach to identification of contributors to EMS environment contamination and development of infection control strategies, using a bacteriophage surrogate for pathogenic organisms. Methods Bacteriophage \u03A6X174 was used to trace cross-contamination and evaluate current disinfection practices and a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) wipe intervention within emergency response vehicles. Prior to EMS calls, 2 surfaces were seeded with \u03A6X174. On call completion, EMS vehicle and equipment surfaces were sampled before decontamination, after decontamination per current practices, and after implementation of the intervention. Results Current decontamination practices did not significantly reduce viral loads on surfaces (P = .3113), but H2O2 wipe intervention did (P = .0065). Bacteriophage spread to 56% (27/48) of sites and was reduced to 54% (26/48) and 40% (19/48) with current decontamination practices and intervention practices, respectively.

METHODS: We have assayed the concentration of IFN-\u03B1, a subtype of IFN-I as well as other cytokines in the sera of SFTS patients and the healthy population with CBA (Cytometric bead array) assay. RESULTS: The results showed that IFN-\u03B1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03B1), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferon-\u03B3 (IFN-\u03B3), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-1\u03B1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, interferon-inducible protein (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) were significantly higher in SFTS patients than in healthy persons (p \u003C 0.05); the concentrations of IFN-\u03B1, IFN-\u03B3, G-CSF, MIP-1\u03B1, IL-6, and IP-10 were significant higher in severe SFTS patients than in mild SFTS patients (p \u003C 0.05).

Puerarin (PR), a major isoflavonoid isolated from the Chinese herb Gegen, possesses many pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, and anti-viral activities. This study was conducted with both PEDV-infected African green monkey kidney cells (Vero) and neonatal pigs to determine the effect of PR on PEDV infection and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms by using proteomic analyses. Twenty-four piglets fed a milk replacer were randomly allocated into one of three groups (Control, PEDV, and PEDV \u002B PR). After a 5-day period of adaption, piglets (n = 8/group) in the PEDV \u002B PR were orally administered with PR (0.5 mg/kg body weight) between days 5 and 9, whereas piglets in the other two groups received the same volume of liquid milk replacer. On day 9, piglets were orally administered with either sterile saline or PEDV (Yunnan province strain) at 10(4.5) TCID(50) (50% tissue culture infectious dose) per pig. On day 12 of the trial, jugular vein blood and intestinal samples were collected. In addition, Vero cells were assigned randomly into three groups (Control, PEDV, PEDV \u002B PR). Cells in the PEDV and PEDV \u002B PR groups were infected with PEDV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01, while cells in the control group were treated with the same volume of sterile saline. One hour later, cells in the Control and PEDV groups were cultured in serum-free DMEM, while cells in the PEDV \u002B PR group were supplemented with PR. After 36 h of culture, cells were harvested. PR attenuated the reductions in cell proliferation in vitro and growth performance in PEDV-infected piglets, and inhibited PEDV replication and the expression of several cytokines (including IL-8) both in vitro and in vivo. Proteomic analyses identified that the abundances of 29 proteins in the ileum were altered by PEDV infection and restored to the control level by PR. Pathway analyses revealed that PR restored the expression of several interferon-stimulated genes and selectively upregulated the expression of guanylate-binding proteins. Western blot analyses showed that PR supplementation inhibited the PEDV-induced NF-\u03BAB activation. Collectively, these results indicate that PR could exert antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects in piglets infected with PEDV and have the potential to be an effective antiviral feed additive.","publish_time":"2020-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Mengjun; Zhang, Qian; Yi, Dan; Wu, Tao; Chen, Hongbo; Guo, Shuangshuang; Li, Siyuan; Ji, Changzheng; Wang, Lei; Zhao, Di; Hou, Yongqing; Wu, Guoyao","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3764e2f18cef061b768d8bb66b8dda32d94cef79.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7055472.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7055472/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQ2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Puerarin"],"organizations":["PEDV   PR","PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV groups","PEDV infection","PEDV-infected piglets","PR groups","inhibited PEDV replication","PR supplementation","effect of PR","PEDV-infected African green monkey kidney cells","PEDV-induced NF-\u03BAB activation","Vero cells","control group","control level","proteomic analyses","Pathway analyses","expression of guanylate","Western blot analyses","volume of sterile saline","multiplicity of infection","volume of liquid milk replacer","day period of adaption","anti-inflammatory effects","pharmacological activities","binding proteins","h of culture","anti-viral activities","effective antiviral feed additive","tissue culture infectious dose","growth performance","swine industry","jugular vein blood","Chinese herb Gegen","cell proliferation","enormous economic losses","trial","major isoflavonoid","neonatal pigs","intestinal samples","Yunnan province strain","underlying mechanisms","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","serum-free DMEM","reductions","interferon-stimulated genes","abundances","potential","ileum","recent years","cytokines","days","body weight","Puerarin","addition","results","hour","study","TCID"],"language":"en"},

However, the causal pathogen is typically unknown at the point when anti-infective therapeutics must be initiated. Physicians synthesize information from diverse data streams to make appropriate decisions. Artificial intelligence (AI) excels at finding complex relationships in large volumes of data. We aimed to evaluate the abilities of experienced physicians and AI to answer this question at patient admission: is it a viral or a bacterial pneumonia? METHODS: We included patients hospitalized for CAP and recorded all data available in the first 3-h period of care (clinical, biological and radiological information). For this proof-of-concept investigation, we decided to study only CAP caused by a singular and identified pathogen. We built a machine learning model prediction using all collected data. Finally, an independent validation set of samples was used to test the pathogen prediction performance of: (i) a panel of three experts and (ii) the AI algorithm. Both were blinded regarding the final microbial diagnosis. Positive likelihood ratio (LR) values \u003E 10 and negative LR values \u003C 0.1 were considered clinically relevant. RESULTS: We included 153 patients with CAP (70.6% men; 62 [51\u201373] years old; mean SAPSII, 37 [27\u201347]), 37% had viral pneumonia, 24% had bacterial pneumonia, 20% had a co-infection and 19% had no identified respiratory pathogen. We performed the analysis on 93 patients as co-pathogen and no-pathogen cases were excluded. The discriminant abilities of the AI approach were low to moderate (LR\u002B = 2.12 for viral and 6.29 for bacterial pneumonia), and the discriminant abilities of the experts were very low to low (LR\u002B = 3.81 for viral and 1.89 for bacterial pneumonia).

However, molecular mechanisms that restrict viral propagation and protect from severe disease are unclear. Here we show that macrophages take up HSV-1 via endocytosis and transport the virions into multivesicular bodies (MVBs). In MVBs, acid ceramidase (aCDase) converts ceramide into sphingosine and increases the formation of sphingosine-rich intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). Once HSV-1 particles reach MVBs, sphingosine-rich ILVs bind to HSV-1 particles, which restricts fusion with the limiting endosomal membrane and prevents cellular infection. Lack of aCDase in macrophage cultures or in Asah1(\u2212/\u2212) mice results in replication of HSV-1 and Asah1(\u2212/\u2212) mice die soon after systemic or intravaginal inoculation. The treatment of macrophages with sphingosine enhancing compounds blocks HSV-1 propagation, suggesting a therapeutic potential of this pathway. In conclusion, aCDase loads ILVs with sphingosine, which prevents HSV-1 capsids from penetrating into the cytosol.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lang, Judith; Bohn, Patrick; Bhat, Hilal; Jastrow, Holger; Walkenfort, Bernd; Cansiz, Feyza; Fink, Julian; Bauer, Michael; Olszewski, Dominik; Ramos-Nascimento, Ana; Duhan, Vikas; Friedrich, Sarah-Kim; Becker, Katrin Anne; Krawczyk, Adalbert; Edwards, Michael J.; Burchert, Andreas; Huber, Magdalena; Friebus-Kardash, Justa; G\u00F6thert, Joachim R.; Hardt, Cornelia; Probst, Hans Christian; Schumacher, Fabian; K\u00F6hrer, Karl; Kleuser, Burkhard; Babiychuk, Eduard B.; Sodeik, Beate; Seibel, J\u00FCrgen; Greber, Urs F.; Lang, Philipp A.; Gulbins, Erich; Lang, Karl S.","journal":"Nat Commun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0c0b8b911613511a56c06d11185a55de24eb829.json; document_parses/pdf_json/cb1b098e091c3d41279e8cf754f901388cde8b86.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7067866.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7067866/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQ5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["replication of HSV","sphingosine-rich ILVs","formation of sphingosine","MVBs","Lack of aCDase","Asah1","particles","treatment of macrophages","cellular infection","viral propagation","mice results","rich intraluminal vesicles","herpes simplex virus type","important protective functions","limiting endosomal membrane","ceramide","compounds","severe disease","fusion","virions","macrophage cultures","acid ceramidase","multivesicular bodies","therapeutic potential","molecular mechanisms","capsids","penetrating","endocytosis","conclusion","intravaginal inoculation","pathway","cytosol"],"language":"en"},

The clinical significance of Mycobacterium monacense is not yet fully understood. Here, we report the first isolation of Mycobacterium monacense from the blood culture of a patient in China with severe pneumonia. CASE PRESENTATION: On June 26, 2018, a 38-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit with breathing difficulty. One day prior, he was discovered with his face immersed in a small pond (non-chlorinated water) and with limb convulsions. He had undergone craniocerebral surgery after trauma 5 years earlier, which left him with epilepsy as a sequela. Bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacity was found in the lungs on chest X ray and chest CT image at admission. The result of the HIV serology test of the patient was negative. The patient was diagnosed with severe pneumonia. Drug-susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida glabrata were isolated in the BALF, and yellow-pigmented colonies were isolated from blood cultures of the patient. The strain isolated from blood was identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as Mycobacteria monacense, which is a rapidly growing mycobacterium (RGM). The patient was treated with a combination of cefoperazone sulbactam, linezolid and voriconazole for 10 days, and the symptoms improved. During the one-year follow-up time, the patient did not relapse. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first case of M. monacense isolated from blood cultures in a patient with severe pneumonia, which provided evidence that the environmental microorganism possessed pathogenic characteristics.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuan, Chenyan; Lu, Huixia; Yang, Congshan; Gao, Wei; Wang, Hailiang; Wu, Guoqiu","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c45510df090d58f32704cf69eb032f72aea9ac76.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7068891.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7068891/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzUwMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Klebsiella"],"organizations":["Int J Syst Evol","Jpn J Infect Dis"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["isolation of Mycobacterium monacense","growing mycobacterium","blood cultures","Mycobacteria monacense","clinical significance of Mycobacterium monacense","severe pneumonia","known mycobacterial species Mycobacterium monacense","growing non-tuberculous mycobacterium","Jpn J","J Hand Surg","New Microbes New","lung infections","Lung India","CASE PRESENTATION","Int J Syst Evol Microbiol","chest X ray","chest CT image","non-chlorinated water","lungs","Candida glabrata","immunosuppressed patients","linezolid","intensive care unit","BALF","small pond","evidence","Drug-susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae","China","HIV serology test","S rDNA sequencing","Bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacity","yellow-pigmented colonies","voriconazole","environmental microorganism","breathing difficulty","combination of cefoperazone sulbactam","admission","Reischl","Hogardt","pathogenic characteristics","limb convulsions","craniocerebral surgery","trauma","years","Shojaei","Ann Lab Med","days","result","BACKGROUND","Taieb","Romero","skin","year follow-up time","year-old man","face","Therese","RGM","day prior","epilepsy","sequela","symptoms","CONCLUSIONS","strain"],"language":"en"},

A substantial proportion occurs intrapartum and is avoidable with better care. At a low-resource tertiary hospital, this study assessed the quality of intrapartum care and adherence to locally-tailored clinical guidelines. METHODS: A non-participatory, structured, direct observation study was held at Mnazi Mmoja Hospital, Zanzibar, Tanzania, between October and November 2016. Women in active labour were followed and structure, processes of labour care and outcomes of care systematically recorded. Descriptive analyses were performed on the labour observations and compared to local guidelines and supplemented by qualitative findings. A Poisson regression analysis assessed factors affecting foetal heart rate monitoring (FHRM) guidelines adherence. RESULTS: 161 labouring women were observed. The nurse/midwife-to-labouring-women ratio of 1:4, resulted in doctors providing a significant part of intrapartum monitoring. Care during labour and two-thirds of deliveries was provided in a one-room labour ward with shared beds. Screening for privacy and communication of examination findings were done in 50 and 34%, respectively. For the majority, there was delayed recognition of labour progress and insufficient support in second stage of labour. While FHRM was generally performed suboptimally with a median interval of 105 (interquartile range 57\u2013160) minutes, occurrence of an intrapartum risk event (non-reassuring FHR, oxytocin use or poor progress) increased assessment frequency significantly (rate ratio 1.32 (CI 1.09\u20131.58)). CONCLUSIONS: Neither international nor locally-adapted standards of intrapartum routine care were optimally achieved. This was most likely due to a grossly inadequate capacity of birth attendants; without whom innovative interventions at birth are unlikely to succeed. This calls for international and local stakeholders to address the root causes of unsafe intrafacility care in low-resource settings, including the number of skilled birth attendants required for safe and respectful births.","publish_time":"2020-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Housseine, Natasha; Punt, Marieke C.; Mohamed, Ali Gharib; Said, Said Mzee; Maal\u00F8e, Nanna; Zuithoff, Nicolaas P.

Degrees of severity were established, based on whether intubation and mechanical ventilation was necessary. SETTING: A 2500-bed medical center in southern Taiwan. PATIENTS: Forty-four patients exhibited symptoms that met the modified World Health Organization (WHO) definition of SARS. These included of three subgroups: health-care workers (n=16), relatives (n=14), and patients already admitted for other ailments (n=14). Of these, 20 eventually required mechanical ventilation. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Laboratory analyses showed statistically significant differences between intubated and nonintubated patients in white blood cell count, neutrophil percentage, and C-reactive protein level as well as in age and underlying malignancy. Risk factors for SARS patients who had been healthy prior to their illness included old age, high peak fever grade, increased neutrophil count, increased neutrophil percentage, and close or prolonged contact with a SARS patient. CONCLUSIONS: Old age, high white blood cell counts, high peak grade fever, and close or prolonged contact with a SARS patient increase the risk of intubation in previous healthy SARS patients.","publish_time":"2004-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yi-Hsi; Lin, An-Shen; Chao, Tung-Ying; Lu, Sheng-Nan; Liu, Jien-Wei; Chen, Shun-Sheng; Lin, Meng-Chih","journal":"Intensive Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/648edea6424ed4befb37edf94b1a20520e292108.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7079822.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079822/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzU1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","World Health Organization"],"locations":["southern Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["outbreak of SARS","SARS outbreak","previous healthy SARS patients","definition of SARS","nonintubated patients","previous health patients","mechanical ventilation","neutrophil percentage","neutrophil count","old age","risk of intubation","risk factors","high peak fever grade","high peak grade fever","high white blood cell counts","prolonged contact","southern Taiwan","bed medical center","health-care workers","modified World Health Organization","significant differences","Laboratory analyses","chest ward","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","C-reactive protein level","illness","symptoms","RESULTS","OBJECTIVE","retrospective case series","CONCLUSIONS","DESIGN","MEASUREMENTS","subgroups","infectious disease","SETTING","underlying malignancy","relatives","ailments","Degrees of severity"],"language":"en"},

Since its description in 2004, isothermal helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) has been successfully applied in the development of novel molecular-based technologies for rapid, sensitive, and selective detection of viruses and bacteria. In this review, we highlight relevant analytical systems using this simple nucleic acid amplification methodology that takes place at a constant temperature and that is readily compatible with microfluidic technologies. Different strategies for monitoring HDA amplification products are described. In addition, we present technological advances for integrating sample preparation, HDA amplification, and detection.

What has a stronger influence on the decision to be vaccinated: the cognitive estimation of risk or the feeling of risk? Based on data collected during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic we tested the relative influence of the cognitive and affective aspects of risk on estimation of the individual willingness to be vaccinated. In doing so we also focused on fear. The results indicate that the feeling of risk had a significant effect on the willingness to be vaccinated. In contrast, the classic, cognitive estimation of a risk was no longer a significant predictor when the feeling of risk was also used to predict the willingness to be vaccinated. A highly felt risk to become infected with influenza A (H1N1) substantially increased the willingness to be vaccinated. A highly felt risk regarding the vaccination, on the other hand, decreased the willingness to be vaccinated. Fear of the vaccination significantly decreased the willingness to be vaccinated even when fear of the spreading disease was also very high. The implications of the results for crisis communications will also be discussed.","publish_time":"2012-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Betsch, C.; Schmid, P.","journal":"Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0cf46ffec79a535a18962df940ed15d08c39a5ce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7080000.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7080000/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzYyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["feeling of risk","cognitive estimation of risk","vaccination","affective aspects of risk","influenza pandemic","individual willingness","H1N1","pandemic influenza virus","vague fear","contrast","results","relative influence","significant effect","significant predictor","stronger influence","individuals knowledge","likely infection","serious health consequences","classic","implications","crisis communications","spreading disease","decision","choice","hand","data"],"language":"en"},

During the last few years, specifically functionalised magnetic particles were developed. Together with an appropriate buffer system, they allow for the quick and efficient purification directly after their extraction from crude cell extracts. Centrifugation steps were avoided. In addition, the new approach provided for an easy automation of the entire process and the isolation of nucleic acids from larger sample volumes. This review describes traditional methods and methods based on magnetic particles for nucleic acid purification. The synthesis of a variety of magnetic particles is presented in more detail.

The application of internal controls to validate the entire process of these assays is necessary to prevent false-negative results caused by unexpected inhibition or inefficient extraction. In the present study, we describe a strategy to produce a stable internal control for rRT-PCR by packaging foreign RNA into influenza virions using plasmid-based reverse genetics technology. The envelope structure of influenza virus can effectively protect RNA segments from RNase digestion, which provides an advantage for its routine use as an internal control. Utilizing this approach, we successfully generated a recombinant influenza virus (rPR8-HCV) containing the 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032 UTR) of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA genome. After inactivation and purification, the rPR8-HCV particles were demonstrated to be RNase resistant and stable at 4 \u00B0C for at least 252 days in human plasma, with no degradation even after being frozen and thawed multiple times. These results were reproducible in the COBAS TaqMan HCV test for 164 days. Moreover, the chimeric influenza virus particles could be easily produced in embryonated eggs and were noninfectious after inactivation treatment. Additionally, this strategy could also be adapted for real-time clinical applications of other RNA targets, providing a universal approach with broad clinical applications in rRT-PCR assays.","publish_time":"2015-10-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xueliang; Liu, Fen; Jiang, Lingli; Bao, Yun; Xiao, Yanqun; Wang, Hualiang","journal":"Appl Microbiol Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1521e960269ff578998fb4abf303a20e24541268.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7080162.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7080162/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzY3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recombinant influenza virus","chimeric influenza virus particles","rRT-PCR assays","rPR8-HCV particles","RNA targets","RNA segments","RNA genome","influenza virions","envelope structure of influenza virus","hepatitis C virus","stable internal control","packaging foreign RNA","real-time clinical applications","days","strategy","COBAS TaqMan HCV test","broad clinical applications","application of internal controls","universal approach","RNase digestion","RNase resistant","human plasma","inactivation treatment","false-negative results","reverse genetics technology","various human specimens","Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","plasmid","unexpected inhibition","entire process","UTR","degradation","viral pathogens","advantage","embryonated eggs","routine use","purification","inefficient extraction","thawed multiple times","untranslated region","present study"],"language":"en"},

The presence of HIV infection further aggravates this scenario, requiring a reliable collection method, with better performance in the microbiological/molecular techniques to be used. We evaluated the performance of two methods for sample collection, mini bronchoalveolar lavage (Mini-BAL) and endotracheal aspirate (ETA), for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in critically ill patients. METHODS: This prospective study involved 26 HIV positive ICU internalized patients, with presumptive PTB who required mechanical ventilation. Two samples were obtained prospectively from 26 HIV ICU patients with presumptive PTB by Mini-BAL and ETA. The samples were processed for smear microscopy, L\u00F6wenstein-Jensen medium and the BACTEC Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube 960 system\u00AE. We define as confirmed PTB patients with positive MTB culture. Furthermore, all samples obtained through the Mini-BAL were analyzed by Xpert\u00AE MTB/RIF. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that the respiratory samples obtained by Mini-BAL were able to increase MTB detection in critically ill patients with presumptive PTB. The Mini-BAL allowed 30% increased recovery and guaranteed enough sample volume for processing in all methods. In addition, the larger volume of the samples obtained with this technique enabled the Xpert\u00AE MTB/RIF molecular test for diagnosis of TB. CONCLUSIONS: The Mini-BAL showed be an acceptable alternative to ETA in this population, since these critically ill and often-immunocompromised patients are more likely to develop complications related to invasive procedures.","publish_time":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Neves, Cynthia Pessoa; Costa, Allyson Guimar\u00E3es; Safe, Izabella Picinin; de Souza Brito, Alexandra; Jesus, Jaquelane Silva; Kritski, Afranio Lineu; Lacerda, Marcus Vinicius Guimar\u00E3es; Viveiros, Miguel; Cordeiro-Santos, Marcelo","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d8f16b9a51bdc4e41c71608e054cdbe33b3c0ec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7081705.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7081705/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzY5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","ETA","BACTEC Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube","MTB/RIF","PTB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Mini-BAL","ill patients","presumptive PTB","HIV ICU patients","confirmed PTB patients","MTB detection","immunocompromised patients","HIV positive ICU internalized patients","mini bronchoalveolar lavage","ETA","methods","respiratory samples","positive MTB culture","sample collection","sample volume","Xpert","RESULTS","RIF molecular test","diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis","detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis","presence of HIV infection","better performance","diagnosis of TB","molecular techniques","larger volume","reliable collection method","L\u00F6wenstein-Jensen medium","BACTEC Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube","prospective study","system","smear microscopy","scenario","intensive care unit","acceptable alternative","increased recovery","endotracheal aspirate","complications","population","challenges","BACKGROUND","processing","mechanical ventilation","clinical state","invasive procedures","addition","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Cattle nasally shedding RBCV at the beginning of the epizootic experienced characteristic primary immune responses with specific antibodies for hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) and spike (S) glycoproteins. Virus shedding in nasal secretions of the majority of the cattle ceased between days 7 and 14 with the appearance of HE- and S-specific antibodies. Nasal samples and lung tissues from 9 of the 10 fatal cases had high titers of RBCV, but these cattle had only IgM responses to RBCV infections. Cattle remaining negative in RBCV isolation tests entered this epizootic with antibodies against HE and S. Protection against respiratory tract disease was apparently associated with high level of opsonic and virus-neutralizing IgG2. The HE and S glycoproteins were recognized earliest by the bovine immune system while the N protein induced antibody responses during the later stage of initial infection and the early stage of reinfection.

The family Nodaviridae, whose members are non-enveloped, positive-stranded bipartite RNA viruses, is comprised of the genera Alphanodavirus and Betanodavirus, whose members predominantly infect insects and fish, respectively. The alphanodaviruses can also infect suckling mice and suckling hamsters, resulting in paralysis and death. Pigs near the site of isolation of the Nodamura virus (NoV), an alphanodavirus, have been reported to have high levels of NoV neutralizing antibody, suggesting that they may be part of the natural host range of this virus. Betanodaviruses are the causative agents of viral nervous necrosis, which occurs in several species of fish. However, little is known regarding the mechanism of infection of these viruses. Whether betanodaviruses can infect hosts other than fish remains unclear. In this study, we examined the possibility that a betanodavirus, redspotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV), can infect human cell lines and showed that this virus can attach to the cells but cannot penetrate them, although human cells can support the replication of the betanodavirus when viral RNAs are transfected. The betanodavirus in its present form cannot infect human cells.","publish_time":"2007-09-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adachi, K.; Ichinose, T.; Watanabe, K.; Kitazato, K.; Kobayashi, N.","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5bbc500a75b6515ebf771226b13743d125cdcc41.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086817/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozc1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human cells","Nodamura virus","host ranges of viruses","redspotted grouper nervous necrosis virus","members","bipartite RNA viruses","Betanodaviruses","species of fish","causative agents of viral nervous necrosis","zoonotic transmission of animal viruses","human cell lines","suckling hamsters","suckling mice","viral RNAs","genera Alphanodavirus","natural host range","possible emergence of infectious agents","RGNNV","replication","site of isolation","humans","possibility","present form","family Nodaviridae","paralysis","hosts","determination","insects","high levels","antibody","death","Pigs","alphanodaviruses","mechanism of infection","study"],"language":"en"},

Analysis of codon usage can reveal much about the molecular evolution of TTSuV1. In this study, synonymous codon usage patterns and the key determinants in the coding region of 29 available complete TTSuV1 genome sequences were examined. By calculating the nucleotide content and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) of TTSuV1 coding sequences, we found that the preferentially used codons were mostly those ending with A or C nucleotides; less-used codons were mostly codons ending with U or G nucleotides, and these were mainly affected by composition constraints. Although there was a variation in codon usage bias among different TTSuV1 genomes, the codon usage bias and GC content in the TTSuV1 coding region was lower, which was mainly determined by the base composition in the third codon position and the effective number of codons (ENC) value. Moreover, the results of correspondence analysis (COA) indicated that the codon usage patterns of TTSuV1 isolated from different countries varied greatly and had significant differences. In addition, Spearman\u2019s rank correlation analysis and an ENC plot revealed that apart from mutation pressure, which was critical in determining the codon usage pattern, other factors were involved in shaping the evolution of codon usage bias in TTSuV1, such as natural selection. Those results suggested that synonymous codon usage patterns of TTSuV1 genomes were the result of interaction between mutation pressure and natural selection. The information from this study not only provides important insights into the synonymous codon usage pattern of TTSuV1, but also helps to identify the main factors affecting codon usage by this virus.","publish_time":"2012-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Zhicheng; Dai, Wei; Wang, Yang; Lu, Chengping; Fan, Hongjie","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27e9373516e9a1f67fbc5e8d85ef78c476ce6da8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086873.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086873/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozc2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Spearman"],"organizations":["GC","COA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Analysis of codon usage","synonymous codon usage pattern of TTSuV1","synonymous codon usage patterns of TTSuV1 genomes","relative synonymous codon usage","evolution of codon usage bias","codon position","TTSuV1 coding region","TTSuV1 coding sequences","different TTSuV1 genomes","molecular evolution of TTSuV1","available complete TTSuV1 genome sequences","effective number of codons","results of correspondence analysis","study","mutation pressure","novel virus","GC content","different countries","nucleotide content","ENC plot","Spearman\u2019s rank correlation analysis","main factors","Torque teno sus virus","G nucleotides","C nucleotides","base composition","composition constraints","RSCU","key determinants","result of interaction","important insights","COA","addition","variation","swine population","recent years","value","significant differences","information"],"language":"en"},

The leader-coding sequences at the 5\u0027-end of genomic RNA are at least 72 nucleotides in length and are joined to the viral mRNAs by a unique mechanism. Utilizing a leader-specific cDNA probe, we have detected several free leader RNA species ranging from 70 to 82 nucleotides in length. The predominant leader RNA was approximately 75 nucleotides. In addition, larger distinct leader-containing RNAs were also detected ranging from 130 to 250 nucleotides in length. The 70\u201382-nucleotide leader-related RNAs were present in both the cytosol and membrane fractions of infected cells. They were also detected only in the small RNA fractions but not associated with the replicative-intermediate RNA. These data suggest that the leader RNAs were associated with the membrane-bound transcription complex but at least part of them were dissociated from the RNA template. We have also identified a temperature-sensitive mutant, which synthesizes only leader RNA but not mRNAs at nonpermissive temperature, indicating that leader RNA synthesis is distinct from the transcription of mRNAs. These data support the leader-primed mechanism for coronavirus transcription and suggest that one or more free leader RNAs are used as primers of mRNA synthesis.","publish_time":"1985-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baric, Ralph S.; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Razavi, Mahmood K.; Lai, Michael M.C.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/acb5f1a150a07ca259285e3558c2c9a1869fd6af.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168170285900383; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0168170285900383","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["leader RNA synthesis","predominant leader RNA","free leader RNA species","free leader RNAs","RNA template","identical stretch of leader RNA sequences","leader-primed mechanism","larger distinct leader","leader-coding sequences","nucleotide leader-related RNAs","small RNA fractions","end of genomic RNA","replicative-intermediate RNA","nucleotides","leader-specific cDNA probe","transcription of mRNAs","viral mRNAs","length","coronavirus transcription","data","membrane-bound transcription complex","nonpermissive temperature","murine coronavirus","membrane fractions of infected cells","unique mechanism","primers of mRNA synthesis","temperature-sensitive mutant","MHV","cytosol","cytoplasm","Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus","replicates","addition"],"language":"en"},

Among them is dengue virus, the etiologic agent of the mosquito-borne dengue disease, one of the most important emerging infectious pathologies of nowadays. Dengue fever may cause potentially deadly hemorrhagic symptoms and is endemic in the tropical and sub-tropical world, being also a serious threat to temperate countries in the developed world. Effective diagnostics for dengue should be able to discriminate among the four antigenically related dengue serotypes and fulfill the requirements for successful decentralized (point-of-care) testing in the harsh environmental conditions found in most tropical regions. The accurate identification of circulating serotypes is crucial for the successful implementation of vector control programs based on reliable epidemiological predictions. This paper briefly summarizes the limitations of the main conventional techniques for biomolecular diagnosis of dengue disease and critically reviews some of the most relevant biosensors and rapid diagnostic tests developed, implemented and reported so far for point-of-care testing of dengue infections. The invaluable contributions of microfluidics and nanotechnology encompass the whole paper, while evaluation concerns of rapid diagnostic tests and foreseen technological improvements in this field are also overviewed for the diagnosis of dengue and other infectious and tropical diseases as well.","publish_time":"2011-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Teles, Fernando S\u00E9rgio Rodrigues Ribeiro","journal":"Analytica Chimica Acta","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c50d8102d5e703fcdc829585396d002de2bff8ce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094386.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003267010015321; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2010.12.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21241843/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003267010015321","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsxMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Dengue fever","dengue virus","related dengue serotypes","biomolecular diagnosis of dengue disease","care testing of dengue infections","accurate rapid diagnostic tests","tropical regions","tropical diseases","sub-tropical world","evaluation concerns of rapid diagnostic tests","identification of infectious pathogens","point","paper","developed world","accurate identification of circulating serotypes","enormous technological improvements","important emerging infectious pathologies","successful implementation of vector control programs","detection","development of simple","main conventional techniques","requirements","harsh environmental conditions","temperate countries","deadly hemorrhagic symptoms","serious threat","reliable epidemiological predictions","etiologic agent","nanotechnology","limitations","past decades","mosquito","relevant biosensors","invaluable contributions of microfluidics","Effective diagnostics","field"],"language":"en"},

The main cause of the MS is yet to be revealed, but the most probable theory is based on the molecular mimicry that concludes some infections in the activation of T cells against brain auto-antigens that initiate the disease cascade. OBJECTIVES: The Purpose of this research is the prediction of the auto-antigen potency of the myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) in multiple sclerosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: As there wasn\u2019t any tertiary structure of PLP available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and in order to characterize the structural properties of the protein, we modeled this protein using prediction servers. Meta prediction method, as a new perspective in silico, was performed to fi nd PLPs epitopes. For this purpose, several T cell epitope prediction web servers were used to predict PLPs epitopes against Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA). The overlap regions, as were predicted by most web servers were selected as immunogenic epitopes and were subjected to the BLASTP against microorganisms. RESULTS: Three common regions, AA(58-74), AA(161-177), and AA(238-254) were detected as immunodominant regions through meta-prediction. Investigating peptides with more than 50% similarity to that of candidate epitope AA(58-74) in bacteria showed a similar peptide in bacteria (mainly consistent with that of clostridium and mycobacterium) and spike protein of Alphacoronavirus 1, Canine coronavirus, and Feline coronavirus. These results suggest that cross reaction of the immune system to PLP may have originated from a bacteria or viral infection, and therefore molecular mimicry might have an important role in the progression of MS. CONCLUSIONS: Through reliable and accurate prediction of the consensus epitopes, it is not necessary to synthesize all PLP fragments and examine their immunogenicity experimentally (in vitro). In this study, the best encephalitogenic antigens were predicted based on bioinformatics tools that may provide reliable results for researches in a shorter time and at a lower cost.","publish_time":"2017-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zamanzadeh, Zahra; Ataei, Mitra; Nabavi, Seyed Massood; Ahangari, Ghasem; Sadeghi, Mehdi; Sanati, Mohammad Hosein","journal":"Iran J Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/620df0595486589bbc677f72cc78f2d158b9810c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5582249.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28959348/; https://doi.org/10.15171/ijb.1356","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsxMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PLP","Protein Data Bank","Human Leukocyte Antigens"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prediction servers","accurate prediction","meta-prediction","bacteria","T cell epitope prediction web servers","Meta prediction method","consensus epitopes","PLP fragments","reliable results","immunogenic epitopes","common regions","myelin proteolipid protein","Protein Data Bank","spike protein of Alphacoronavirus","candidate epitope AA","brain auto-antigens","molecular mimicry","fi nd PLPs epitopes","Purpose","Multiple sclerosis","immunodominant regions","overlap regions","tertiary structure of PLP available","Human Leukocyte Antigens","best encephalitogenic antigens","common autoimmune disease","Canine coronavirus","immune system","Feline coronavirus","disease cascade","activation of T cells","auto-antigen potency","central nervous system","shorter time","mycobacterium","infections","CONCLUSIONS","important role","new perspective","cross reaction","bioinformatics tools","order","silico","progression of","clostridium","PDB","researches","similarity","similar peptide","HLA","viral infection","lower cost","CNS","study","structural properties","BACKGROUND","probable theory","METHODS","main cause","OBJECTIVES","BLASTP","immunogenicity","MATERIALS","microorganisms","peptides"],"language":"en"},

Here, we report that H. cordata water extracts (HCWEs) inhibit the infection of HSV-1, HSV-2, and acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 mainly via blocking viral binding and penetration in the beginning of infection. HCWEs also suppress HSV replication. Furthermore, HCWEs attenuate the first-wave of NF-\u03BAB activation, which is essential for viral gene expressions. Further analysis of six compounds in HCWEs revealed that quercetin and isoquercitrin inhibit NF-\u03BAB activation and additionally, quercetin also has an inhibitory effect on viral entry. These results indicate that HCWEs can inhibit HSV infection through multiple mechanisms and could be a potential lead for development of new drugs for treating HSV.","publish_time":"2015-02-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hung, Pei-Yun; Ho, Bing-Ching; Lee, Szu-Yuan; Chang, Sui-Yuan; Kao, Chuan-Liang; Lee, Shoei-Sheng; Lee, Chun-Nan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/238d2be0d4db41b5460bd3a50a0a374549c189aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4314066.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0115475; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25643242/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsxODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Houttuynia"],"organizations":["HSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HSV infection","infection of HSV","HSV replication","acyclovir-resistant HSV","HCWEs","resistant HSV strains","anti-HSV effects","beginning of infection","NF-\u03BAB activation","Houttuynia cordata","development of new drugs","quercetin","wave of NF","viral entry","viral binding","cordata water extracts","results","viral gene expressions","development of drug","multiple mechanisms","molecular mechanisms","common latent virus","Herpes simplex virus","Extensive use of acyclovir","humans","potential lead","ACV","isoquercitrin","certain severe diseases","inhibitory effect","penetration","natural herbal medicine","urgent need","compounds","analysis"],"language":"en"},

Fourteen 6\u201324h old male colostrums-fed Holstein calves, received either three doses of C. difficile (1.4\u00D7108 \u00B13.5\u00D7108 cfu) (n =8) or sterile culture broth (n =6).

PCR-ribotyping was used to compare inoculated and recovered isolates. Diarrhea was observed in all control calves and 3/8 of inoculated calves (p =0.03), but it did not occur in calves that tested positive for C. difficile toxins. Fecal toxins were identified only from two controls. PCR-ribotyping confirmed the presence of C. difficile PCR-ribotype 077 in samples of all inoculated calves, but not from controls.

The critical importance of using PPE properly is highlighted by 2 potentially fatal viral infections, severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013associated coronavirus and Ebola virus, where HCP became infected while caring for patients due to errors in the use of PPE. However, PPE in dealing with less dangerous, but highly infectious organisms is important as well. This work proposes a framework to test and evaluate PPE with a focus on gown design. METHODS: An observational study identified issues with potential for contamination related to gown use. After redesigning the existing gown, a high-fidelity patient simulator study with 40 HCP as participants evaluated the gown redesign using 2 commonly performed tasks. Variables of interest were nonadherence to procedural standards, use problems with the gown during task performance, and usability and cognitive task load ratings of the standard and redesigned gowns. RESULTS: While no differences were found in terms of nonadherence and use problems between the current and the redesigned gown, differences in usability and task load ratings suggested that the redesigned gown is perceived more favorably by HCP. CONCLUSIONS: This work proposes a framework to guide the evaluation of PPE. The results suggest that the current design of the PPE gown can be improved in usability and user satisfaction. Although our data did not find an increase in adherence to protocol when using the redesigned gown, it is likely that higher usability and lower task load could result in higher adherence over longer periods of use.","publish_time":"2019-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Drews, Frank A; Mulvey, Diane; Stratford, Kristina; Samore, Matthew H; Mayer, Jeanmarie","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/06b07a6407734edcb3af57da5fe2898ba61d1df8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6761366.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31517973/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciz520","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE","HCP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PPE gown","gown use","use of PPE","gown design","existing gown","gown redesign","HCP","evaluation of PPE","higher usability","lower task load","cognitive task load ratings","task performance","redesigned gowns","longer periods of use","patients","higher adherence","problems","differences","infectious organisms","current design","framework","RESULTS","observational study","healthcare personnel","terms of nonadherence","high-fidelity patient simulator study","severe acute respiratory syndrome","associated coronavirus","contact","Ebola virus","body fluids","potential","fatal viral infections","issues","droplet","goal of personal protective equipment","participants","contamination","procedural standards","protocol","airborne transmission","increase","METHODS","errors","focus","Variables","BACKGROUND","user satisfaction","CONCLUSIONS","critical importance","tasks","data"],"language":"en"},

The new suspected cases of COVID-19 data were collected from 20 January 2020 to 9 February 2020. We used the lagged series of SMSI to predict new suspected COVID-19 case numbers during this period. To avoid overfitting, five methods, namely subset selection, forward selection, lasso regression, ridge regression, and elastic net, were used to estimate coefficients. We selected the optimal method to predict new suspected COVID-19 case numbers from 20 January 2020 to 9 February 2020. We further validated the optimal method for new confirmed cases of COVID-19 from 31 December 2019 to 17 February 2020. The new suspected COVID-19 case numbers correlated significantly with the lagged series of SMSI. SMSI could be detected 6\u20139 days earlier than new suspected cases of COVID-19.

The subset selection method also significantly correlated with the new confirmed COVID-19 cases after validation.

While cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, has an extensive antimicrobial spectrum, its ability to affect respiratory viruses has not been studied in detail. OBJECTIVES: Here, we evaluate the ability of CPC to disrupt influenza viruses in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The virucidal activity of CPC was evaluated against susceptible and oseltamivir- resistant strains of influenza viruses. The effective virucidal concentration (EC) of CPC was determined using a hemagglutination assay and tissue culture infective dose assay. The effect of CPC on viral envelope morphology and ultrastructure was evaluated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The ability of influenza virus to develop resistance was evaluated after multiple passaging in sub-inhibitory concentrations of CPC. Finally, the efficacy of CPC in formulation to prevent and treat influenza infection was evaluated using the PR8 murine influenza model. RESULTS: The virucidal effect of CPC occurred within 10 minutes, with mean EC(50) and EC(2log) ranging between 5 to 20 \u03BCg/mL, for most strains of influenza tested regardless of type and resistance to oseltamivir. Examinations using TEM showed that CPC disrupted the integrity of the viral envelope and its morphology. Influenza viruses demonstrated no resistance to CPC despite prolonged exposure. Treated mice exhibited significantly increased survival and maintained body weight compared to untreated mice. CONCLUSIONS: The antimicrobial agent CPC possesses virucidal activity against susceptible and resistant strains of influenza virus by targeting and disrupting the viral envelope. Substantial virucidal activity is seen even at very low concentrations of CPC without development of resistance. Moreover, CPC in formulation reduces influenza-associated mortality and morbidity in vivo.","publish_time":"2017-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Popkin, Daniel L.; Zilka, Sarah; Dimaano, Matthew; Fujioka, Hisashi; Rackley, Cristina; Salata, Robert; Griffith, Alexis; Mukherjee, Pranab K.; Ghannoum, Mahmoud A.; Esper, Frank","journal":"Pathog Immun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c28b246499550a272954111f550f0c8d2ac750cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5605151.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28936484/; https://doi.org/10.20411/pai.v2i2.200","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CPC","EC","TEM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ability of CPC","virucidal activity of CPC","efficacy of CPC","virucidal effect of CPC","antimicrobial agent CPC","influenza infection","low concentrations of CPC","ability of influenza virus","sub-inhibitory concentrations of CPC","oseltamivir- resistant strains of influenza viruses","influenza-associated mortality","PR8 murine influenza model","Substantial virucidal activity","viral envelope morphology","development of resistance","respiratory viruses","effective virucidal concentration","broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent","formulation","mean EC","TEM","extensive antimicrobial spectrum","hemagglutination assay","untreated mice","tissue culture infective dose assay","ultrastructure","maintained body weight","increased survival","multiple passaging","transmission electron microscopy","continued need","minutes","integrity","type","strategies","morbidity","prolonged exposure","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","METHODS","cetylpyridinium chloride","BACKGROUND","Examinations","\u03BCg","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

However, data on nosocomial influenza is usually collected during outbreaks only and clinical information of nosocomial influenza is sparsely available. OBJECTIVES: To systematically analyse the distribution of nosocomial and community-acquired influenza and epidemiological characteristics in a tertiary care unit in two consecutive seasons. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective observational study was conducted to identify and characterise cases of nosocomial and community-acquired influenza at Freiburg University hospital from 1 January 2013 to 30 April 2014. A validated multiplex RT-PCR to detect influenza virus and other respiratory pathogens was used throughout. Clinical information was retrieved from the hospital-based information system. RESULTS: Overall, 218 patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza were included (179 in the first, 39 patients in the second season). A rate of 20% of nosocomial influenza was observed throughout. A fatal outcome was recorded for 9% of nosocomial cases, which were mainly associated with influenza virus A(H1N1)pdm09. Nosocomial influenza occurred in all age groups, but fatalities were only observed in patients \u226518 years. Patients with nosocomial influenza were significantly older, underwent therapy for blood malignancies and immunosuppressive regimens more frequently, and received solid organ transplantation more often compared to community-acquired patients. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the different distribution of virus subtypes and epidemiological properties between both influenza seasons, the rate of nosocomial cases remained similar. Systematic detection and targeted prevention measures seem mandatory to minimize nosocomial influenza.","publish_time":"2015-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huzly, Daniela; Kurz, Sven; Ebner, Winfried; Dettenkofer, Markus; Panning, Marcus","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/845460d73500b5dec4e5de24aca37f16080d80e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185613.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2015.10.016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653215007015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26540462/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653215007015","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Freiburg University"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus","influenza seasons","clinical information of nosocomial influenza","cases of nosocomial","distribution of nosocomial","rate of nosocomial cases","patients","community","different distribution of virus subtypes","hospital-based information system","epidemiological characteristics","epidemiological properties","consecutive seasons","STUDY DESIGN","retrospective observational study","Freiburg University hospital","considerable morbidity","tertiary care unit","targeted prevention measures","therapy","important public health threat","blood malignancies","mortality","outbreaks","immunosuppressive regimens","Systematic detection","validated multiplex RT-PCR","age groups","solid organ transplantation","fatalities","respiratory pathogens","H1N1","pdm09","CONCLUSIONS","laboratory","BACKGROUND","data","fatal outcome","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS","years"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this study was to examine the availability, target cell types and efficiency of RNAi in the mouse seminiferous epithelium. METHODS: The experimental model was based on transgenic mice expressing EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein). RNAi was induced by in vivo transfection of plasmid vectors encoding for short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting EGFP. shRNAs were transfected in vivo by microinjection into the seminiferous tubules via the rete testis followed by square wave electroporation. As a transfection reporter, expression of red fluorescent protein (HcRed 1) was used. Cell types, the efficiency of both transfections and RNAi were all evaluated. RESULTS: Sertoli cells were the main transfected cells. A reduction of about 40% in the level of EGFP protein was detected in cells successfully transfected both in vivo and in vitro. However, the efficiency of in vivo transfection was low. CONCLUSION: In adult seminiferous epithelial cells, in vivo post-transcriptional gene silencing mediated by RNAi via shRNA is efficient in Sertoli cells. Similar levels of RNAi were detected both in vivo and in vitro. This also indicates that Sertoli cells have the necessary silencing machinery to repress the expression of endogenous genes via RNAi.","publish_time":"2008-07-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gonz\u00E1lez-Gonz\u00E1lez, Emilio; L\u00F3pez-Casas, Pedro P; del Mazo, Jes\u00FAs","journal":"Reprod Biol Endocrinol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17b8edaf62be1b907bf750a94c4b881f3db1f7be.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2483279.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18620581/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1477-7827-6-29","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EGFP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["efficiency of RNAi","Sertoli cells","main transfected cells","Similar levels of RNAi","adult seminiferous epithelial cells","level of EGFP protein","expression of red fluorescent protein","seminiferous tubules","green fluorescent protein","transfection reporter","shRNAs","mouse seminiferous epithelium","transfection of plasmid vectors","target cell types","post-transcriptional gene silencing","necessary silencing machinery","expression of endogenous genes","investigation of gene function","rete testis","short hairpin RNAs","transgenic mice","valuable tool","availability","experimental model","square wave electroporation","HcRed","CONCLUSION","RNA interference","BACKGROUND","microinjection","RESULTS","transfections","study","METHODS","purpose","reduction"],"language":"en"},

Within the first 24 h of life, 36 calves were experimentally challenged with C. parvum oocysts at one of four possible magnitudes of oral exposure (1 \u00D7 10(3), 1 \u00D7 10(4), 1 \u00D7 10(5), and 1 \u00D7 10(6) oocysts), and 7 control calves were sham dosed. Fecal shedding occurred in 33 (91.7 %) experimentally challenged calves and in none of the control calves. There was a difference in the log-total number of oocysts counted per gram of feces dry weight among the four exposure groups; calves with the lowest magnitude of exposure (1 \u00D7 10(3) oocysts) shed less than the other three groups. At higher magnitudes of exposure, there was more variability in the range of fecal oocyst shedding. There was an inverse relationship between the log-total amount of oocysts counted per gram of feces dry weight and the number of days to the onset of fecal shedding per calf, i.e., the more time that elapsed to the onset of fecal shedding, the fewer oocysts that were shed. The pattern of fecal shedding over time for all calves shedding oocysts was curvilinear; the number of oocysts increased with time, reached a peak, and declined. Therefore, the dynamics of oocyst shedding can be influenced in part by limiting exposure among calves and delaying the onset of fecal oocyst shedding.","publish_time":"2013-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zambriski, Jennifer A.; Nydam, Daryl V.; Bowman, Dwight D.; Bellosa, Mary L.; Burton, Alexandra J.; Linden, Thomas C.; Liotta, Janice L.; Ollivett, Theresa L.; Tondello-Martins, Leonardo; Mohammed, Hussni O.","journal":"Parasitol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd7e59a86292a2a29e9c77d54547e8bc45ea607d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088138.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23315189/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00436-012-3258-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["onset of fecal shedding","pattern of fecal shedding","onset of fecal oocyst shedding","range of fecal oocyst shedding","dynamics of oocyst shedding","parvum oocysts","control calves","fewer oocysts","dairy calves","time","exposure groups","log-total number of oocysts","probability of Cryptosporidium parvum fecal oocyst","different magnitudes of exposure","higher magnitudes of exposure","possible magnitudes of oral exposure","lowest magnitude of exposure","gram of feces dry weight","number of days","factors","variability","calf","inverse relationship","difference","h of life","objective","peak"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the timing of surges in clinical demand and the best- and worst-case scenarios of local COVID-19\u2013induced strain on hospital capacity, and thus inform clinical operations and staffing demands and identify when hospital capacity would be saturated. DESIGN: Monte Carlo simulation instantiation of a susceptible, infected, removed (SIR) model with a 1-day cycle. SETTING: 3 hospitals in an academic health system. PATIENTS: All people living in the greater Philadelphia region. MEASUREMENTS: The COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model (CHIME) (http://penn-chime.phl.io) SIR model was used to estimate the time from 23 March 2020 until hospital capacity would probably be exceeded, and the intensity of the surge, including for intensive care unit (ICU) beds and ventilators. RESULTS: Using patients with COVID-19 alone, CHIME estimated that it would be 31 to 53 days before demand exceeds existing hospital capacity. In best- and worst-case scenarios of surges in the number of patients with COVID-19, the needed total capacity for hospital beds would reach 3131 to 12 650 across the 3 hospitals, including 338 to 1608 ICU beds and 118 to 599 ventilators. LIMITATIONS: Model parameters were taken directly or derived from published data across heterogeneous populations and practice environments and from the health system\u0027s historical data. CHIME does not incorporate more transition states to model infection severity, social networks to model transmission dynamics, or geographic information to account for spatial patterns of human interaction. CONCLUSION: Publicly available and designed for hospital operations leaders, this modeling tool can inform preparations for capacity strain during the early days of a pandemic.

CD8 T cells play an important role in controlling diseases caused by other coronaviruses and in mediating vaccine-induced protective immunity in corresponding animal models. The spike protein, a main surface antigen of SARS-CoV, is one of the most important antigen candidates for vaccine design. Overlapping peptides were used to identify major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted epitopes in mice immunized with vectors encoding codon-optimized SARS-CoV spike protein. CD8 T-cell responses were mapped to two H-2b-restricted epitopes (S436\u2013443 and S525\u2013532) and one H-2d-restricted epitope (S366\u2013374). The identification of these epitopes will facilitate the evaluation of vaccine strategies in murine models of SARS-CoV infection. Furthermore, codon and promoter optimizations can greatly enhance the overall immunogenicity of spike protein in the context of replication-defective human and simian adenoviral vaccine carriers. The optimized recombinant adenoviral vaccine vectors encoding spike can generate robust antigen-specific cellular immunity in mice and may potentially be useful for control of SARS-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2005-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhi, Yan; Kobinger, Gary P.; Jordan, Heather; Suchma, Katie; Weiss, Susan R.; Shen, Hao; Schumer, Gregory; Gao, Guangping; Boyer, Julie L.; Crystal, Ronald G.; Wilson, James M.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c82d1b207db5a5a4d15150de1fa30088a16cff25.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111773.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682205000620; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682205000620","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjszNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["control of SARS","codon-optimized SARS-CoV spike protein","CoV infection","murine models of SARS","SARS-associated coronavirus","main surface antigen of SARS","mediating vaccine","vaccine design","optimized recombinant adenoviral vaccine vectors","evaluation of vaccine strategies","b-restricted epitopes","simian adenoviral vaccine carriers","overall immunogenicity of spike protein","mice","important antigen candidates","d-restricted epitope","CD8 T cells","robust antigen-specific cellular immunity","protective immunity","important role","CD8 T-cell responses","corresponding animal models","new type of coronavirus","defective human","context of replication","causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome","major histocompatibility complex class","S436","promoter optimizations","diseases","S366","coronaviruses","S525","peptides","identification"],"language":"en"},

Meanwhile, the virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) has also caused sporadic outbreaks in waterfowl. The individual vaccines against both diseases are available, however, there is no bivalent or combined vaccine for either disease. Here, we constructed a recombinant NDV-vectored vaccine candidate that expresses the pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E) genes from DTMUV, designated as aGM/prM \u002B E. The foreign prM and E proteins were stably expressed in aGM/prM \u002B E and exhibited similar pathogenicity but higher growth kinetics than those of the parental virus. The aGM/prM \u002B E carries a fusion cleavage site in accordance with avirulent viruses that have been frequently isolated from waterfowl, and induced remarkably (p \u003C 0.001) higher NDV-specific hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers than commercially available live NDV vaccines (LaSota strain). The aGM/prM \u002B E also elicited significantly higher (p \u003C 0.05) virus neutralization (VN) titers than commercially available DTMUV inactivated vaccines (HB strain). The aGM/prM \u002B E not only provided complete protection against NDV challenge but also reduced the gross lesions on ovarian folliculi and provided 80% protection against DTMUV in ducks. We note that the aGM/prM \u002B E vaccine can prevent challenged ducks from shedding of NDV and DTMUV. Our results suggest that the candidate vaccine aGM/prM \u002B E would help decrease NDV and DTMUV transmissions in waterfowl raising areas in China.","publish_time":"2018-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Minhua; Dong, Jiawen; Li, Linlin; Lin, Qiuyan; Sun, Junying; Liu, Zhicheng; Shen, Haiyan; Zhang, Jianfeng; Ren, Tao; Zhang, Chunhong","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f7f8c3a6f0bc371e5a2f9a32940b7eab3ca84904.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117350.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29685222/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113518301196; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113518301196; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2018.03.027","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjszODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NDV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["foreign prM","E proteins","candidate vaccine aGM","NDV challenge","shedding of NDV","waterfowl","available live NDV vaccines","DTMUV transmissions","available DTMUV inactivated vaccines","recombinant NDV-vectored vaccine candidate","higher NDV-specific hemagglutination inhibition","combined vaccine","virus neutralization","parental virus","titers","individual vaccines","areas","virulent Newcastle disease virus","China","emerged Duck Tembusu virus","higher growth kinetics","HB strain","LaSota strain","challenged ducks","complete protection","fusion cleavage site","similar pathogenicity","envelope","avirulent viruses","pre-membrane","considerable economic loss","accordance","VN","gross lesions","ovarian folliculi","genes","bivalent","diseases","sporadic outbreaks","results"],"language":"en"},

CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 7-month old infant presented initially with fever, cough and coryza, and subsequently developed Koplik\u2019s spots followed by a typical morbilliform skin rash. There was significant contact history with a household relative who had recently been diagnosed with measles. On examination, a 2.5 cm area of erythema and induration was seen at the previous BCG inoculation site, in addition to the widespread maculopapular rash. No other clinical features of KD were present. Measles virus was isolated from the throat swab and measles antibodies (IgM) were present in the serum. The patient recovered completely with oral vitamin A and supportive therapy, and had normal echocardiography examination on follow up.

In proliferating mammalian cells, a canonical dilysine motif at the C-terminus of Sac1 is required for coatomer complex-I (COP-I)-binding and continuous retrieval to the ER. Starvation triggers accumulation of Sac1 at the Golgi. The mechanism responsible for Golgi retention of Sac1 is unknown. Here we show that the first of the two transmembrane regions in human SAC1 (TM1) functions in Golgi localization. A minimal construct containing only TM1 and the adjacent flanking sequences is concentrated at the Golgi. Transplanting TM1 into transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) induces Golgi accumulation of this normally plasma membrane and endosomal protein, indicating that TM1 is sufficient for Golgi localization. In addition, we determined that the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of SAC1 also promotes Golgi localization, even when TM1 is mutated or absent. We conclude that the distribution of SAC1 within the Golgi is controlled via both passive membrane thickness-dependent partitioning of TM1 and a retention mechanism that requires the N-terminal cytoplasmic region.","publish_time":"2013-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jinzhi; Chen, Juxing; Enns, Caroline A.; Mayinger, Peter","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/baa8420ed8f9d0dc7ba81b519eda2c3fe91291b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3731292.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0071112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23936490/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs0MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Golgi"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Golgi retention of Sac1","Golgi localization","Golgi accumulation","human SAC1","distribution of SAC1","cisternal Golgi compartments","Transplanting TM1","N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of SAC1","Starvation triggers accumulation of Sac1","lipid phosphatase Sac1 cycles","passive membrane thickness-dependent partitioning of TM1","retention mechanism","N-terminal cytoplasmic region","plasma membrane","mechanism responsible","endoplasmic reticulum","canonical dilysine motif","C-terminus","TfR2","proliferating mammalian cells","functions","endosomal protein","transferrin receptor","binding","adjacent flanking sequences","transmembrane regions","coatomer complex","continuous retrieval","COP","minimal construct","addition"],"language":"en"},

Specifically the JHM strain of MHV (MHV-JHM) generally causes an acute encephalitis when inoculated is into 2-day-old Wistar Furth rats. In contrast, JHM generally produces a chronic demyelinating disease with resulting posterior paralysis when inoculated is into 10-day-old Wistar Furth rats. In addition, while JHM readily produces a productive infection in a mouse fibroblast cell line (L-2), it does not form syncytia or replicate well in a tissue cell line of glial origin (G26-24). We have isolated and characterized three MHV-JHM viral variants from the central nervous system of two Wistar Furth rats with a MHV-JHM-induced demyelinating disease. The pattern of viral-specific mRNA for all three of these variants differed from what was observed for the wild-type parental MHV-JHM that had been passaged only in tissue culture. One of these variants, ATIIf cord virus, which induced a chronic demyelinating disease in 2- or 10-day-old intracerebrally inoculated Wistar Furth rats, had a deletion in the coding region of the peplomer glycoprotein mRNA. In addition, this variant formed massive syncytia and replicated well in G26-24 cells. We have not detected this deletion in the other two JHM variants, ATIIf brain virus and ATIIe brain virus. ATIIf brain virus and ATIIe brain virus primarily produced an acute encephalitis when reinoculated into 2-or 10-day-old Wistar Furth rats. In addition, these two variants did not form syncytia and had a reduced ability to replicate in G26-24 cells.","publish_time":"1989-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morris, Vincent L.; Tieszer, Christina; MacKinnon, Joanne; Percy, Dean","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/49528bcccaed92a1bf66fdc108109bfe2a48e9a0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682289900482; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682289900482","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs0MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JHM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["JHM variants","MHV-JHM viral variants","JHM strain of MHV","day-old Wistar Furth rats","inoculated Wistar Furth rats","ATIIf brain virus","ATIIe brain virus","wild-type parental MHV-JHM","ATIIf cord virus","chronic demyelinating disease","G26","addition","neurological disease","Abstract Murine hepatitis virus","deletion","massive syncytia","acute encephalitis","cells","tissue cell line of glial origin","mouse fibroblast cell line","pattern of viral","specific mRNA","tissue culture","peplomer glycoprotein mRNA","central nervous system","productive infection","coding region","resulting posterior paralysis","reduced ability","mice","contrast"],"language":"en"},

The success of IgG concentrates on a clinical level is documented by the slowly increasing number of registered indication and the more rapid increase of the off-label uses, a topic dealt with in another contribution to this special issue of Frontiers in Immunology. A part of the success is the adverse event (AE) profile of IgG concentrates which is, even at life-long need for therapy, excellent. Transmission of pathogens in the last decade could be entirely controlled through the antecedent introduction by authorities of a regulatory network and installing quality standards by the plasma fractionation industry. The cornerstone of the regulatory network is current good manufacturing practice. Non-infectious AEs occur rarely and mainly are mild to moderate. However, in recent times, the increase in frequency of hemolytic and thrombotic AEs raised worrying questions on the possible background for these AEs. Below, we review elements of non-infectious AEs, and particularly focus on hemolysis and thrombosis. We discuss how the introduction of plasma fractionation by ion-exchange chromatography and polishing by immunoaffinity chromatographic steps might alter repertoire of specificities and influence AE profiles and efficacy of IgG concentrates.","publish_time":"2015-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sp\u00E4th, Peter J.; Granata, Guido; La Marra, Fabiola; Kuijpers, Taco W.; Quinti, Isabella","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/77888e24fe540edda3d9cd2e0aadd2e699aa466d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4318428.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2015.00011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25699039/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs0MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["success of IgG concentrates","efficacy of IgG concentrates","profile of IgG concentrates","thrombotic AEs","introduction of plasma fractionation","elements of non-infectious AEs","regulatory network","Therapy","plasma fractionation industry","plasma product","success story ongoing","rapid increase","antecedent introduction","influence AE profiles","repertoire of specificities","worrying questions","frequency of hemolytic","ion-exchange chromatography","quality standards","immunoaffinity chromatographic steps","current good manufacturing practice","human immunoglobulin G","possible background","adverse event","contribution","special issue of Frontiers","decades","life-long need","authorities","number of registered indication","clinical level","Immunology","label","recent times","demand","cornerstone","Transmission of pathogens","topic","hemolysis","thrombosis"],"language":"en"},

Swine influenza virus (SIV) may predispose to secondary infection. Haemophilus parasuis (Hps) can be a primary pathogen or be associated with other pathogens such as SIV. To date, little is known about the effect of coinfection with SIV and Hps on the disease severity and inflammatory response and the role of Hps in the induction of pneumonia in the absence of other respiratory pathogens. In the study we investigated the influence of SIV and Hps coinfection on clinical course, inflammatory response, pathogens shedding and load at various time points following intranasal inoculation. The correlation between local concentration of cytokines and severity of disease as well as serum acute phase proteins (APP) concentration has been also studied. RESULTS: All co-infected pigs had fever, while in single inoculated pigs fever was observed only in part of animals. Necropsy revealed lesions in the lungs all SIV-inoculated and co-inoculated pigs, while in Hps-single inoculated animals only 1 out of 11 pigs revealed gross lung lesions. The SIV shedding was the highest in co-inoculated pigs. There were no differences between Hps-single inoculated and co-inoculated groups with regard to Hps shedding. The significant increase in Hps titre in the lung has been found only in co-inoculated group. All APP increased after co-infection. In single-inoculated animals various kinetics of APP response has been observed. The lung concentrations of cytokines were induced mostly in SIV \u002B Hps pigs in the apical and middle lobe. These results correlated well with localization of gross lung lesions. CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed that SIV increased the severity of lung lesions and facilitated Hps (PIWetHps192/2015) replication in the porcine lung. Furthermore, Hps influenced the SIV nasal shedding. Enhanced Hps and SIV replication, together with stronger systemic and local inflammatory response contributed to a more severe clinical signs and stronger, earlier immune response in co-inoculated animals. We confirmed the previous evidence that single-Hps infection does not produce significant pneumonic lesions but it should be in mind that other strains of Hps may produce lesions different from that reported in the present study.","publish_time":"2017-12-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pomorska-M\u00F3l, Ma\u0142gorzata; Dors, Arkadiusz; Kwit, Krzysztof; Czy\u017Cewska-Dors, Ewelina; Pejsak, Zygmunt","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cf08012c131b34b073bc10b82fcb6574b17d13b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5716233.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-017-1298-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29202835/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs0MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIV","Hps","APP","SIV   Hps"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Hps pigs","Hps shedding","co-inoculated pigs","Hps-single inoculated animals","Hps coinfection","role of Hps","strains of Hps","Hps titre","Enhanced Hps","single-Hps infection","co-inoculated animals","SIV shedding","co-inoculated groups","SIV replication","single inoculated pigs fever","influence of SIV","co-infected pigs","SIV nasal shedding","severity of lung lesions","single-inoculated animals various kinetics of APP response","localization of gross lung lesions","Respiratory co-infections","lesions different","porcine lung","local inflammatory response","immune response","profitability of pigs production","significant pneumonic lesions","lung concentrations of cytokines","RESULTS","disease severity","severity of disease","respiratory pathogens","local concentration of cytokines","secondary infection","clinical course","effect of coinfection","significant increase","present study","various time points","severe clinical signs","important factor","load","serum acute phase proteins","regard","intranasal inoculation","absence","induction of pneumonia","BACKGROUND","previous evidence","lungs","PIWetHps192","middle lobe","Swine influenza virus","correlation","mind","differences","primary pathogen","Necropsy","Haemophilus parasuis","CONCLUSIONS","date"],"language":"en"},

Infection control precautions for hospital visitors are needed to avoid cluster outbreaks, so this study investigated the visiting policies of all the hospitals in Taiwan in the time of COVID-19. METHODS: From March 15, 2020, to March 18, 2020, we searched the official websites of all 472 National Health Insurance\u2013contracted hospitals to determine their visiting policies. For those hospitals that had posted new visiting policies and still allowed visits to ordinary wards, we recorded the relevant details shown on their websites, including the number of visitors allowed at one time, the number of visiting slots per day, the total visiting hours per day, and the rules provided to visitors before visiting. RESULTS: During the study period, 276 (58.5%) hospitals had posted new visiting policies on their websites, with higher proportions of academic medical centers (92.0%, 23/25) and metropolitan hospitals (91.5%, 75/82) than local community hospitals (48.8%, 178/365) doing so. Visits to ordinary wards were forbidden in 83 hospitals among those. Among the 193 hospitals that had new visiting policies and still allowed visits to ordinary wards, 73.1% (n = 141) restricted visitors to two at a time and 54.9% (n = 106) restricted visits to two visiting slots per day. Furthermore, history taking regarding travel, occupation, contacts, and cluster information was mentioned by 82.4% (n = 159) of these 193 hospitals, body temperature monitoring by 78.2% (n = 151), hand hygiene by 63.2% (n = 122), and identity checks by 51.8% (n = 100).

The structures induced by enteroviruses, which are members of the family Picornaviridae, have so far been described as either single- or double-membrane vesicles (DMVs). Aside from the number of delimiting membranes, their exact architecture has also remained elusive due to the limitations of conventional electron microscopy. In this study, we used electron tomography (ET) to solve the three-dimensional (3-D) ultrastructure of these compartments. At different time points postinfection, coxsackievirus B3-infected cells were high-pressure frozen and freeze-substituted for ET analysis. The tomograms showed that during the exponential phase of viral RNA synthesis, closed smooth single-membrane tubules constituted the predominant virus-induced membrane structure, with a minor proportion of DMVs that were either closed or connected to the cytosol in a vase-like configuration. As infection progressed, the DMV number steadily increased, while the tubular single-membrane structures gradually disappeared. Late in infection, complex multilamellar structures, previously unreported, became apparent in the cytoplasm. Serial tomography disclosed that their basic unit is a DMV, which is enwrapped by one or multiple cisternae. ET also revealed striking intermediate structures that strongly support the conversion of single-membrane tubules into double-membrane and multilamellar structures by a process of membrane apposition, enwrapping, and fusion. Collectively, our work unravels the sequential appearance of distinct enterovirus-induced replication structures, elucidates their detailed 3-D architecture, and provides the basis for a model for their transformation during the course of infection.","publish_time":"2011-10-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Limpens, Ronald W.

Indeed, in recent years controversy has intensified over strains resistant to carbapenem and/or colistin. Various therapeutic solutions are used to overcome administration of last line antibiotics. In this context, drug repurposing, which consists of using a non-antibiotic compound to treat multi-drug resistant bacteria (MDR), is encouraged. In this review, we first report what may have led to drug repurposing. Main definitions, advantages and drawbacks are summarized. Three major methods are described: phenotypic, computational and serendipity. In a second time we will focus on the current knowledge in drug repurposing for carbapenem and colistin-resistant bacteria with different studies describing repurposed compounds tested on Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, we show that drug combination therapies can increase successful by drug repurposing strategy. In conclusion, we discuss the pharmaceutical industries that have little interest in reprofiling drugs due to lack of profits. We also consider what a clinician might think of the indications of these uncommon biologists to treat MDR bacterial infections and avoid therapeutic impasses.","publish_time":"2019-06-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peyclit, Lucie; Baron, Sophie Alexandra; Rolain, Jean-Marc","journal":"Front Cell Infect Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f64d07df542245c19781c36476a6cde273627f87.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6579884.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31245302/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2019.00193","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["drug repurposing strategy","multi-drug resistant bacteria","colistin-resistant bacteria","drug combination therapies","strains resistant","carbapenem","Gram-negative bacteria","development of antibiotics","line antibiotics","failure of classical antibiotics","new strategies","therapeutic impasses","MDR bacterial infections","Various therapeutic solutions","emergence of new resistance mechanisms","repurposed compounds","different studies","uncommon biologists","decrease","non-antibiotic compound","reprofiling drugs","current knowledge","administration","treatment of infectious diseases","recent years controversy","pharmaceutical industries","Main definitions","advantages","drawbacks","indications","lack of profits","industry","challenges","major methods","serendipity","conclusion","report","context","review","clinician","time"],"language":"en"},

The intestinal microbiota is a collection of microorganisms that live within the gastrointestinal tract, and perform many important health-promoting functions. The intestinal microbiota aids in the breakdown of food products into absorbable nutrients, stimulates the host immune system, prevents growth of pathogenic bacteria and produces a great variety of biologically important compounds. In this review, we will summarize the current evidence supporting roles of the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis and management of chronic constipation.

The history of their structural analysis, occurrence, and functions is fascinating and described in this review. Reports from different researchers on apparently similar substances from a variety of biological materials led to the identification of a 9-carbon monosaccharide, which in 1957 was designated \u201Csialic acid.\u201D The most frequently occurring member of the sialic acid family is N-acetylneuraminic acid, followed by N-glycolylneuraminic acid and O-acetylated derivatives, and up to now over about 80 neuraminic acid derivatives have been described. They appeared first in the animal kingdom, ranging from echinoderms up to higher animals, in many microorganisms, and are also expressed in insects, but are absent in higher plants. Sialic acids are masks and ligands and play as such dual roles in biology. Their involvement in immunology and tumor biology, as well as in hereditary diseases, cannot be underestimated. N-Glycolylneuraminic acid is very special, as this sugar cannot be expressed by humans, but is a xenoantigen with pathogenetic potential. Sialidases (neuraminidases), which liberate sialic acids from cellular compounds, had been known from very early on from studies with influenza viruses. Sialyltransferases, which are responsible for the sialylation of glycans and elongation of polysialic acids, are studied because of their significance in development and, for instance, in cancer. As more information about the functions in health and disease is acquired, the use of sialic acids in the treatment of diseases is also envisaged.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schauer, Roland; Kamerling, Johannis P.","journal":"Advances in Carbohydrate Chemistry and Biochemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5d252fd6dcb94ce97104e6ea7655f62120cc7083.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112061.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065231818300015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30509400/; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.accb.2018.09.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065231818300015","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs1MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sialic acid family","use of sialic acids","Abstract Sialic acids","N-glycolylneuraminic acid","N-acetylneuraminic acid","neuraminic acid derivatives","elongation of polysialic acids","outstanding cell biological functions","higher animals","tumor biology","higher plants","treatment of diseases","hereditary diseases","surface of cell membranes","variety of biological materials","O-acetylated derivatives","similar substances","occurrence","ligands","sialylation of glycans","different researchers","echinoderms","identification","structural analysis","cytoprotectors","xenoantigen","instance","history","Reports","involvement","immunology","dual roles","health","significance","neuraminidases","cellular compounds","masks","member","studies","influenza viruses","pathogenetic potential","humans","animal kingdom","carbon monosaccharide","development","sugar","insects","microorganisms","information","cancer","Sialyltransferases","review","Sialidases"],"language":"en"},

In this study, the effects of QF on Pseudomonas aeruginosa\u2013induced acute pneumonia in mice were evaluated. The mechanisms by which four typical anti-inflammatory ingredients from QF, arctigenin (ATG), cholic acid (CLA), chlorogenic acid (CGA) and sinapic acid (SPA), regulate anti-inflammatory signaling pathways and related targets were investigated using molecular biology and molecular docking techniques. The results showed that pretreatment with QF significantly inhibits the release of cytokines (TNF-\u03B1 and IL-6) and chemokines (IL-8 and RANTES), reduces leukocytes recruitment into inflamed tissues and ameliorates pulmonary edema and necrosis. In addition, ATG was identified as the primary anti-inflammatory agent with action on the PI3K/AKT and Ras/MAPK pathways. CLA and CGA enhanced the actions of ATG and exhibited synergistic NF-\u03BAB inactivation effects possibly via the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway. Moreover, CLA is speculated to target FGFR and MEK firstly.

Methods A Collison single\u2010jet nebulizer was used to aerosolize the attenuated FluMist\u00AE vaccine into a calm\u2010air settling chamber. Viral particles were captured with bioaerosol samplers that utilize 2 microcentrifuge tubes to collect airborne particulates. The first tube (T1) collects particles greater than 1.8 \u03BCm in diameter, while the second tube (T2) collects particles between 1.0 and 1.8 \u03BCm, and the back\u2010up filter (F) collects submicron particles. Following aerosolization, quantitative PCR was used to detect and quantify H1N1 and H3N2 influenza strains. Results Based on qPCR results, we demonstrate that aerosolized viral particles were efficiently collected and separated according to aerodynamic size using the two\u2010stage bioaerosol sampler. Most viral particles were collected in T2 (1\u20101.8 \u03BCm) and on the back\u2010up filter (\u003C 1 \u03BCm) of the bioaerosol sampler. Furthermore, we found that the detection of viral particles with the two\u2010stage sampler was directly proportional to the collection time. Consequently, viral particle counts were significantly greater at 40 minutes in comparison to 5, 10 and 20 minute aerosol collection points. Conclusions Due to a lack of empirical data, aerosol transmission of influenza is often questioned. Using FluMist\u00AE, we demonstrated that a newly developed bioaerosol sampler is able to recover and size fractionate aerosolized viral particles. This sampler should be an important tool for studying viral transmission in clinical settings and may significantly contribute towards understanding the modes of influenza virus transmission.","publish_time":"2007-10-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blachere, Francoise M.; Lindsley, William G.; Slaven, James E.; Green, Brett J.; Anderson, Stacey E.; Chen, Bean T.; Beezhold, Don H.","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ee9f67cb46223274974fce223eb6c5d4834d809.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4941879.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2007.00020.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19453416/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs1NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of viral particles","viral transmission","particles greater","submicron particles","size fractionation of aerosolized viral particles","stage bioaerosol sampler","stage sampler","developed bioaerosol sampler","\u03BCm","stage personal bioaerosol sampler","viral particle counts","aerosol transmission of influenza","bioaerosol samplers","modes of influenza virus transmission","Background Influenza virus","aerodynamic size","collection time","back\u2010up filter","H3N2 influenza strains","T2","minute aerosol collection points","qPCR results","attenuated FluMist","lack of empirical data","calm","microcentrifuge tubes","jet nebulizer","important tool","Methods","Collison single","vaccine","comparison","diameter","clinical settings","airborne particulates","minutes","H1N1","T1","aerosolization","quantitative PCR","chamber","Conclusions","efficacy","cyclone"],"language":"en"},

Its apparent endemicity and the wide spread of its reservoir host (dromedary camels) in the Arabian Peninsula highlight the ongoing public health threat of this virus. Therefore, development of effective prophylactic vaccine needs to be urgently explored given that there are no approved prophylactics or therapeutics for humans or animals to date. Different vaccine candidates have been investigated but serious safety concerns remain over protein or full-length spike (S) protein-based vaccines. Here, we investigated the immunogenicity of naked DNA vaccines expressing different fragments of MERS-CoV S protein in mice. We found that plasmids expressing full-length (pS) or S1-subunit (pS1) could induce significant levels of S1-specific antibodies (Abs) but with distinct IgG isotype patterns. Specifically, pS1 immunization elicited a balanced Th1/Th2 response and generally higher levels of all IgG isotypes compared to pS vaccination. Interestingly, only mice immunized with pS1 demonstrated significant S1-specific cellular immune response. Importantly, both constructs induced cross-neutralizing Abs against multiple strains of human and camel origins. These results indicate that vaccines expressing S1-subunit of the MERS-CoV S protein could represent a potential vaccine candidate without the possible safety concerns associated with full-length protein-based vaccines.","publish_time":"2017-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-amri, Sawsan S.; Abbas, Ayman T.; Siddiq, Loai A.; Alghamdi, Abrar; Sanki, Mohammad A.; Al-Muhanna, Muhanna K.; Alhabbab, Rowa Y.; Azhar, Esam I.; Li, Xuguang; Hashem, Anwar M.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/76418514384003ef87ee3e6922525db0b8bf0bd3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5362948.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28332568/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep44875","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs1NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["full-length protein-based vaccines","MERS-CoV S protein","S1-subunit","significant levels of S1","different fragments of MERS","Abs","significant S1-specific cellular immune response","full-length spike","MERS-coronavirus","Different vaccine candidates","pS1 immunization","mice","immunogenicity of naked DNA vaccines","possible safety concerns","serious safety concerns","potential vaccine candidate","specific antibodies","Th2 response","higher levels","IgG isotypes","wide spread","development of effective prophylactic vaccine","pS vaccination","distinct IgG isotype patterns","Arabian Peninsula","ongoing public health threat","multiple strains of human","dromedary camels","balanced Th1","therapeutics","humans","reservoir host","animals","camel origins","novel zoonotic pathogen","approved prophylactics","apparent endemicity","constructs","plasmids","results","countries"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies suggest that BHV-1 may induce apoptosis in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells via a mechanism only involving caspases and p53. However, the mechanism for BHV-1-induced MDBK cell apoptosis still requires more research. METHODS: MDBK was used as a model to study the precise signaling pathways of apoptosis induced by BHV-1 infection. RESULTS: BHV-1 infection activated a Fas/FasL-mediated apoptotic pathway, resulting in activation of caspase-8 and cleavage of Bid. In addition, BHV-1 infection down-regulated Bcl-2 and up-regulated Bax expression, thereby initiating the release of cytochrome c followed by caspase-9 activation. The combined activation of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways resulted in activation of downstream effecter caspase-3 and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), leading to apoptosis. Furthermore, blocking apoptosis using caspase inhibitors improved BHV-1-infected MDBK cell viability to different extent. BHV-1 infection did not induce significant DNA fragmentation in MDBK cells pretreated with ammonium chloride (NH(4)Cl) or cells infected with UV-inactivated BHV-1. Blocking caspases activation increased BHV-1 replication. CONCLUSIONS: BHV-1 induces apoptosis in MDBK cells through extrinsic and intrinsic pathways and there might be cross-talk between the two pathways. In addition, BHV-1 replication may be necessary for the induction of apoptosis in BHV-1-infected cells, and prolonged cell viability benefits BHV-1 replication.","publish_time":"2012-09-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Xingang; Zhang, Kuan; Huang, Yong; Ding, Li; Chen, Guangda; Zhang, Honglei; Tong, Dewen","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e2309c084ac694227f0411037944e3829c04c777.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3502331.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-202; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22978358/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDBK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MDBK cells","pathways of apoptosis","caspases activation increased BHV","UV-inactivated BHV","caspase inhibitors improved BHV","induced MDBK cell apoptosis","activation of caspase","prolonged cell viability benefits BHV","infected cells","induction of apoptosis","infection","infected MDBK cell viability","intrinsic pathways","replication","combined activation","activation of downstream effecter caspase","mechanism","addition","regulated Bcl","Bovine herpesvirus type","regulated Bax expression","Madin-Darby bovine kidney","poly ADP-ribose polymerase","significant DNA fragmentation","cattle","PARP","different extent","apoptotic pathway","ammonium chloride","FasL","release of cytochrome c","substantial economic losses","important pathogen","BACKGROUND","model","research","cleavage of Bid","p53","Previous studies","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

In this review, we identify several broad research areas where the networks approach could greatly enhance our understanding of social patterns and processes in animals. The network theory provides a quantitative framework that can be used to characterise social structure both at the level of the individual and the population. These novel quantitative variables may provide a new tool in addressing key questions in behavioural ecology particularly in relation to the evolution of social organisation and the impact of social structure on evolutionary processes. For example, network measures could be used to compare social networks of different species or populations making full use of the comparative approach. However, the networks approach can in principle go beyond identifying structural patterns and also can help with the understanding of processes within animal populations such as disease transmission and information transfer. Finally, understanding the pattern of interactions in the network (i.e. who is connected to whom) can also shed some light on the evolution of behavioural strategies.","publish_time":"2007-07-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krause, J.; Croft, D.

While IFN-\u03BB stimulates expression of antiviral ISGs preferentially in cells of epithelial origin, recent studies have defined additional antiviral mechanisms in other cell types and tissues. Models of viral infection using mice lacking IFN-\u03BB signaling and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations with human disease have expanded our understanding of the contribution of IFN-\u03BB to the antiviral response at anatomic barriers and the immune response beyond these barriers. In this review, we highlight recent insights into the functions of IFN-\u03BB, including its ability to restrict virus spread into the brain and to clear chronic viral infections in the gastrointestinal tract.

In this study, we developed several pHu-E16 variants to improve its efficacy. These variants included a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of pHu-E16 fused to the heavy chain (HC) constant domains (C(H) (1-3)) of human IgG (pHu-E16scFv-C(H) (1-3)) and a tetravalent molecule (Tetra pHu-E16) assembled from pHu-E16scFv-C(H) (1-3) with a second pHu-E16scFv fused to the light chain (LC) constant region. pHu-E16scFv-C(H) (1-3) and Tetra pHu-E16 were efficiently expressed and assembled in plants. To assess the impact of differences in N-linked glycosylation on pHu-E16 variant assembly and function, we expressed additional pHu-E16 variants with various combinations of HC and LC components. Our study revealed that proper pairing of HC and LC was essential for the complete N-glycan processing of antibodies in both plant and animal cells. Associated with their distinct N-glycoforms, pHu-E16, pHu-E16scFv-C(H) (1-3) and Tetra pHu-E16 exhibited differential binding to C1q and specific Fc\u03B3 receptors (Fc\u03B3R). Notably, none of the plant-derived Hu-E16 variants showed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) activity in CD32A(\u002B) human cells, suggesting the potential of plant-produced antibodies to minimize the adverse effect of ADE. Importantly, all plant-derived MAb variants exhibited at least equivalent in vitro neutralization and in vivo protection in mice compared to mammalian cell-produced Hu-E16. This study demonstrates the capacity of plants to express and assemble a large, complex and functional IgG-like tetravalent mAb variant and also provides insight into the relationship between MAb N-glycosylation, Fc\u03B3R and C1q binding, and ADE. These new insights may allow the development of safer and cost effective MAb-based therapeutics for flaviviruses, and possibly other pathogens.","publish_time":"2014-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Junyun; Lai, Huafang; Engle, Michael; Gorlatov, Sergey; Gruber, Clemens; Steinkellner, Herta; Diamond, Michael S.; Chen, Qiang","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e22a07b2198216a1ec0b1c38e3d90e692e7fa30b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3968140.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0093541; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24675995/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HC","Tetra","Associated","ADE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pHu-E16scFv","Tetra pHu-E16","additional pHu-E16 variants","pHu-E16 variant assembly","plant-derived Hu-E16 variants","plant-derived MAb variants","MAb N-glycosylation","tetravalent mAb variant","potential of plant","study","plant-derived monoclonal antibody","N-linked glycosylation","C1q binding","effective MAb-based therapeutics","light chain","heavy chain","Fc\u03B3R","distinct N-glycoforms","LC components","human IgG","mice","human cells","complete N-glycan processing of antibodies","various combinations of HC","proper pairing of HC","adverse effect of ADE","differential binding","functional IgG","constant domains","single-chain variable fragment","constant region","tetravalent molecule","animal cells","capacity of plants","antibody-dependent enhancement","specific Fc\u03B3 receptors","WNV","infection","protection","flaviviruses","development of safer","West Nile virus","activity","CD32A","mammalian cell","neutralization","relationship","impact of differences","group","new insights","efficacy","pathogens"],"language":"en"},

Additionally, the passengers\u2019 exposures to a variety of environmental conditions were experimentally monitored in \u201Creal world\u201D field campaigns using the Harvard University shuttle bus system. Real time continuous monitoring systems were used to assess indoor environmental quality in the buses. It was found that CO levels were very low, while the levels of particulate matter varied and were influenced by the ambient air penetrated into the bus through the operation of the doors and the ventilation system. The CO2 level was found elevated and greatly affected by occupancy conditions. The elevated CO2 level indicates that the current bus ventilation is insufficient to dilute air pollutants in the bus especially under heavy occupancy conditions. This lack of sufficient ventilation indicates an elevated risk for airborne transmitted diseases in such a popular public transportation system.","publish_time":"2010-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Shengwei; Demokritou, Philip; Spengler, John","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1484ce1aef99cbc619c270a1280a97f1aed00bc9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125921.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288006/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2010.03.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132310000831; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132310000831","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Computational Fluid Dynamics","Harvard University"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bus ventilation system","current bus ventilation","bus environment","micro-environmental conditions","variety of environmental conditions","Harvard University shuttle bus system","elevated CO2 level","heavy occupancy conditions","popular public transportation system","elevated risk","public transportation buses","air pollutants","lack of sufficient ventilation","ambient air","developed CFD model","residual lifetime of air","indoor environmental quality","real world","mean age","levels of particulate matter","Real time continuous monitoring systems","field campaigns","airborne transmitted diseases","efficiency","Computational Fluid Dynamics","doors","spatial distributions","passengers\u2019 exposures","operation","study"],"language":"en"},

Genotyping of the CD14 variant was performed using an amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction method. Results The prevalence of CD14-159 TT and CT genotypes were associated with increased risk of brucellosis [odds ratio (OR) = 1.993, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.07\u20133.71, P = 0.03 for CT; OR = 3.869, 95% CI = 1.91\u20137.84, P = 0.01 for TT genotype. Additionally, the minor allele (T) was significantly more frequently present in brucellosis patients than in controls (61% vs. 45%, respectively), and was a risk factor for brucellosis (OR = 3.058, 95% CI = 1.507\u20136.315, P = 0.01).

Scientists are working quickly on multiple aspects of the pandemic. Genetic analyses are conducted to reveal the source and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, providing knowledge that can be used to contain it and to avoid future outbreaks. Epidemiological studies which incorporates lessons learned from outbreaks of previous related viral diseases can guide development of public health measures effective to contain the current and future outbreaks. Basic virology studies reveal viral structure and function. Pathology studies inform development of strategies to interfere with infection. COVID-19 prevention and treatment strategies are being developed in preclinical and clinical studies. Antibody-based therapy is one viable treatment option. Here, we discuss some of the most active areas of developing strategies to treat COVID-19, focusing on approaches to generate neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of COVID-19.

Genetic variation affects the establishment of the gene regulatory landscape and thus gene expression, and we hypothesized that this contributes to the observed heterogeneity in individual responses to exogenous cellular insults. OBJECTIVES: We performed an in vivo study of how genetic variation and chromatin organization may dictate susceptibility to DNA damage, and influence the cellular response to such damage, caused by an environmental toxicant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured DNA damage, messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) expression, and genome-wide chromatin accessibility in lung tissue from two genetically divergent inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J and CAST/EiJ, both in unexposed mice and in mice exposed to a model DNA-damaging chemical, 1,3-butadiene. RESULTS: Our results showed that unexposed CAST/EiJ and C57BL/6J mice have very different chromatin organization and transcription profiles in the lung. Importantly, in unexposed CAST/EiJ mice, which acquired relatively less 1,3-butadiene-induced DNA damage, we observed increased transcription and a more accessible chromatin landscape around genes involved in detoxification pathways. Upon chemical exposure, chromatin was significantly remodeled in the lung of C57BL/6J mice, a strain that acquired higher levels of 1,3-butadiene\u2013induced DNA damage, around the same genes, ultimately resembling the molecular profile of CAST/EiJ. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that strain-specific changes in chromatin and transcription in response to chemical exposure lead to a \u201Ccompensation\u201D for underlying genetic-driven interindividual differences in the baseline chromatin and transcriptional state. This work represents an example of how chemical and environmental exposures can be evaluated to better understand gene-by-environment interactions, and it demonstrates the important role of chromatin response in transcriptomic changes and, potentially, in deleterious effects of exposure. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1937","publish_time":"2017-10-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chappell, Grace A.; Israel, Jennifer W.; Simon, Jeremy M.; Pott, Sebastian; Safi, Alexias; Eklund, Karl; Sexton, Kenneth G.; Bodnar, Wanda; Lieb, Jason D.; Crawford, Gregory E.; Rusyn, Ivan; Furey, Terrence S.","journal":"Environ Health Perspect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee13a8332bcf2df6a68e2190a337a0cbaa161281.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5944832.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp1937; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29038090/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs4NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["baseline chromatin","EiJ mice","unexposed mice","butadiene-induced DNA damage","different chromatin organization","accessible chromatin landscape","unexposed CAST","important role of chromatin response","lung of C57BL","model DNA-damaging chemical","chemical exposure lead","RESULTS","genome-wide chromatin accessibility","damaging effects of exposure","cellular response","gene expression","Genetic variation","deleterious effects of exposure","increased transcription","transcription profiles","lung tissue","gene regulatory landscape","genes","environmental toxicants","molecular profile of CAST","environmental exposures","strain-specific changes","underlying genetic-driven interindividual differences","transcriptomic changes","observed heterogeneity","exogenous cellular insults","individual responses","mRNA","compensation","divergent inbred mouse strains","microRNA","messenger RNA","establishment","susceptibility","miRNA","distinct individuals","example","higher levels","study","transcriptional state","detoxification pathways","mechanisms","BACKGROUND","METHODS","environment interactions","work","MATERIALS","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

It has not been determined whether porcine IFITMs (pIFITMs) inhibit infection by pseudorabies virus (PRV), an enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus, which is the etiological agent of Aujeszky\u2019s disease in pigs. Here, we report that PRV infection elicited pIFITM1 expression in PK15 porcine kidney epithelial cells and 3D4/21 alveolar macrophages. pIFITM2 and pIFITM3 expression was only elevated in PK15 cells during PRV infection. Depletion of pIFITM1 using RNA interference, either in PK15 or in 3D4/21 cells, enhanced PRV infection while overexpression of pIFITM1 had the opposite effect. Knockdown of pIFITM2 and pIFITM3 did not influence PRV infection, suggesting that pIFITM2 and pIFITM3 are independent of PRV infection. PRV-induced pIFITM1 expression was dependent on the cGAS/STING/TBK1/IRF3 innate immune pathway and interferon-alpha receptor-1, suggesting that pIFITM1 is up-regulated by the type I interferon signaling pathway. The anti-PRV role of pIFITM1 was inhibited upon PRV entry. Our data demonstrate that pIFITM1 is a host restriction factor that inhibits PRV entry that may shed light on a strategy for prevention of PRV infection.","publish_time":"2019-11-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jiang; Wang, Chun-Feng; Ming, Sheng-Li; Li, Guo-Li; Zeng, Lei; Wang, Meng-Di; Su, Bing-Qian; Wang, Qi; Yang, Guo-Yu; Chu, Bei-Bei","journal":"Int J Biol Macromol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dbf2805a5a92d2ba97e9fe99918ecd0f871ac286.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102536.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141813019364232; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31743714/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0141813019364232; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.10.162","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs4NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["enhanced PRV infection","prevention of PRV infection","independent of PRV infection","PRV entry","PRV infection elicited pIFITM1 expression","PRV-induced pIFITM1 expression","anti-PRV role of pIFITM1","overexpression of pIFITM1","Depletion of pIFITM1","PK15 cells","dengue virus","pseudorabies virus","pIFITM3 expression","West Nile virus","PK15 porcine kidney epithelial cells","3D4","double-stranded DNA virus","porcine IFITMs","Knockdown of pIFITM2","interferon-alpha receptor","immune pathway","Interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins","IRF3","cGAS","host restriction factor","STING","TBK1","influenza","etiological agent of Aujeszky\u2019s disease","pIFITMs","pigs","light","RNA interference","strategy","viruses","alveolar macrophages","opposite effect","type","data"],"language":"en"},

The CO2 concentration in over 99% of the functional spaces is below the threshold of 1000 ppm. However, the dissatisfaction rate of the air freshness is higher than 25%, owing to the characteristics of healthcare activities. Insufficient fresh air volume and high supply air humidity ratio of the outdoor air system result in the inadequate dehumidification capacity and the over-humid environment in the inpatient buildings. From the perspective of indoor TVOC and PM2.5 concentration, a hospitable IAQ is achieved in the inpatient buildings. In the nurse unit, the illumination levels in public areas, such as patient corridors and nurse stations, are inadequate. The average noise levels (A) in the inpatient rooms and nurse stations are 50.7 and 61.6 dB, respectively, which exceeds the Chinese standard.

Handwashing/decontamination is the central and most essential part of ICP measures. It should be actively encouraged and regularly monitored to ensure adherence. The ward layout will influence how we manage ICP. This includes placement and number of alcohol dispensers, sinks, bathrooms, equipment storage and the number of cubicles.

In this study, we report the development and testing of a real-time RT-PCR assay using a Taqman\u00AE-labeled probe for early and rapid detection of IBV. The assay amplifies a 143-bp product in the 5\u2032-UTR of the IBV genome and has a limit of detection and quantification of 100 template copies per reaction. All 15 strains of IBV tested as well as two Turkey coronavirus strains were amplified, whereas none of the other pathogens examined, tested positive. Evaluation of the assay was completed with 1329 tracheal swab samples. A total of 680 samples collected from IBV antibody negative birds were negative for IBV by the real-time RT-PCR assay. We tested 229 tracheal swabs submitted to two different diagnostic laboratories and found 79.04% of the tracheal swabs positive for IBV by real-time RT-PCR, whereas only 27.51% of the samples were positive by virus isolation, which is the reference standard test. We also collected a total of 120 tracheal swabs at six different time points from birds experimentally infected with different dosages of IBV and found that, independent of the dose given, the viral load in the trachea plateau at 5 days post-inoculation. In addition, an inverse relationship between the dose of virus given and the viral load at 14 days post-inoculation was observed. Finally, we tested 300 total tracheal swab samples, from a flock of commercial broilers spray vaccinated for IBV in the field. The percentage of birds infected with the IBV vaccine at 3, 7, and 14 days post-vaccination was 58%, 65%, and 83%, respectively, indicating that only slightly more than half the birds were initially infected then the vaccine was subsequently transmitted to other birds in the flock. This observation is significant because coronaviruses, which have a high mutation rate, can revert to pathogenicity when bird-to-bird transmission occurs. The real-time RT-PCR test described herein can be used to rapidly distinguish IBV from other respiratory pathogens, which is important for control of this highly infectious virus. The test was extremely sensitive and specific, and can be used to quantitate viral genomic RNA in clinical samples.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Callison, Scott A.; Hilt, Deborah A.; Boynton, Tye O.; Sample, Brenda F.; Robison, Robert; Swayne, David E.; Jackwood, Mark W.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8d4b026fa5fc8924284bdfb3922b9cb27b1038a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112890.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093406002734; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093406002734","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle","IBV"],"locations":["Turkey"],"keyphrases":["IBV vaccine","strains of IBV","IBV genome","different dosages of IBV","IBV antibody negative birds","rapid detection of IBV","dose of virus","infectious virus","real-time RT-PCR assay","real-time RT-PCR test","total tracheal swab samples","tracheal swabs positive","virus isolation","infectious bronchitis virus","clinical samples","percentage of birds","days post-inoculation","exotic Newcastle disease virus","viral load","days post-vaccination","pathogenic avian influenza virus","different time points","viral genomic RNA","different diagnostic laboratories","reference standard test","disease agents","limit of detection","early stages","bird transmission","respiratory pathogens","Turkey coronavirus strains","flock of commercial broilers spray","trachea plateau","quantification","Taqman","coronaviruses","template copies","pathogenicity","probe","inverse relationship","development","control","testing","high mutation rate","reaction","UTR","bp product","observation","addition","pathogenesis","field","study","Evaluation"],"language":"en"},

This current review evaluates if drainage systems can cause infections and thus be of clinical concern. METHOD: A review of the literature was analyzed. Papers, guidelines, and quality management systems have been considered. RESULTS: Adequate sanitation is fundamental and a prerequisite for safe life and productivity. In contrast, malfunctioning sanitation has been reported to cause outbreaks all over the world. In areas with no sanitation, diarrheal mortality is high and has been shown to decrease by 36% after interventions to improve sanitation. Often, infections are faeces associated and when present in wastewater and sewage sludge poses a high risk of infection upon exposure. Hence, there are working safety guidelines and in industries where infection reduction is essential strict quality assurance systems, i.e. HACCP (hazard analysis critical control points) and GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) must be complied. Healthcare has recently taken interest in the HACCP system in their efforts to reduce healthcare associated infections as a response to increasing number of ineffective antibiotics and the threat of mortality rate like the pre-antibiotic era. The last few years have called for immediate action to contain the emergence of increasing resistant microorganisms. Resistance is obtained as a result of overuse and misuse of antibiotics in both healthcare and agriculture. Also, by the discharge of antibiotics from manufacturers, healthcare and society. One mechanism of development of novel resistant pathogens has been shown to be by effortless sharing of genetic mobile elements coding for resistance from microbes in the environment to human microbes. These pathogens have been sampled from the drainage systems. These were noticed owing to their possession of an unusual antibiotic resistance profile linking them to the outbreak. Often the cause of sanitation related outbreaks is due to inadequate sanitation and maintenance. However, in general these infections probably go unnoticed. CONCLUSION: Drainage systems and its maintenance, if neglected, could pose a threat in both community and healthcare causing infections as well as emergence of multi-resistant bacteria that could cause unpredictable clinical manifestations.","publish_time":"2015-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blom, Kristina","journal":"Arch Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/60bb4454a34fb7642d6805ff6261abc91809a135.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4342212.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25722855/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13690-014-0056-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Drainage systems","inadequate sanitation","malfunctioning sanitation","healthcare associated infections","cause of sanitation related outbreaks","quality management systems","essential strict quality assurance systems","misuse of antibiotics","discharge of antibiotics","novel resistant pathogens","resistant microorganisms","maintenance","emergence of multi-resistant bacteria","unusual antibiotic resistance profile","high risk of infection","number of ineffective antibiotics","threat of mortality rate","infection reduction","diarrheal mortality","HACCP system","human microbes","safety guidelines","clinical concern","current review","pre-antibiotic era","unpredictable clinical manifestations","GMP","hazard analysis critical control points","role","effortless sharing of genetic mobile elements coding","industries","prerequisite","response","sewage sludge","wastewater","present","efforts","safe life","Good Manufacturing Practice","mechanism of development","possession","environment","manufacturers","result of overuse","productivity","immediate action","Papers","exposure","faeces","RESULTS","areas","society","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","community","years","METHOD","literature","contrast","agriculture","world","interventions"],"language":"en"},

These aberrant and excessive immune cells may enter the pulmonary circulation in huge numbers and play an immune damaging role to causing lung functional disability and quick mortality. Our results demonstrate that excessive non-effective host immune responses by pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes may associate with severe lung pathology.

However, only limited data were available to demonstrate their efficacy against SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). We therefore investigated eight disinfectants for their activity against SARS-CoV according to prEN 14476. Four hand rubs were tested at 30s (Sterillium, based on 45% iso-propanol, 30% n-propanol and 0.2% mecetronium etilsulphate; Sterillium Rub, based on 80% ethanol; Sterillium Gel, based on 85% ethanol; Sterillium Virugard, based on 95% ethanol). Three surface disinfectants were investigated at 0.5% for 30min and 60min (Mikrobac forte, based on benzalkonium chloride and laurylamine; Kohrsolin FF, based on benzalkonium chloride, glutaraldehyde and didecyldimonium chloride; Dismozon pur, based on magnesium monoperphthalate), and one instrument disinfectant was investigated at 4% for 15min, 3% for 30min and 2% for 60min [Korsolex basic, based on glutaraldehyde and (ethylenedioxy)dimethanol]. Three types of organic load were used: 0.3% albumin, 10% fetal calf serum, and 0.3% albumin with 0.3% sheep erythrocytes. Virus titres were determined by a quantitative test (endpoint titration) in 96-well microtitre plates.

De estas 2 t\u00E9cnicas, mostramos los resultados de un estudio inicial propio con el LightCycler\u00AE SeptiFast Test Mgrade.

Sepsis is one of the main causes of mortality and morbidity in hospitals. Early detection of pathogens using nucleic acid-based techniques speeds diagnosis of bacteremia and/or fungemia, aids the rapid application of appropriate antibiotics, reduces the use of unnecessary antibiotics, and lowers mortality. Two commercially available techniques that help to identify different sepsisproducing bacteria and fungi in a shorter time period are: LightCycler\u00AE SeptiFast Test Mgrade (Roche Diagnostic SL) and GenoType Blood Culture (Hain Lifescience). We present the results of an initial in-house study using the LightCycler\u00AE SeptiFast Test Mgrade. The study was carried out in 50 samples from 28 patients (1-3 samples per patient) with septic syndrome admitted to the intensive care unit by comparing the new technique with conventional blood culture. The concordance between the results of blood culture and SeptiFast was good, 79%, in the first trial and 89% in the second, after correcting for technical defects. We initially observed substantial inhibition of internal controls in Gram-negative bacilli, due to the presence of heparin in the blood used, and excess DNA because of the high number of leucocytes. To minimize these inhibitions, the second study used 24 samples at half the original volume (extracted DNA at 1/4 concentration). With these modifications, inhibitions were substantially reduced. SeptiFast is more effective than blood culture in discriminating between contamination by coagulase-negative staphylococci and species of streptococci.","publish_time":"2008-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Molina, Jos\u00E9 Miguel; C\u00F3rdoba, Juan; Ram\u00EDrez, Paula; Gobernado, Miguel","journal":"Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiolog\u00EDa Cl\u00EDnica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/04027550dc47568b1bdb2efae56610275028fcea.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213005X08765443; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213005X08765443","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Roche Diagnostic SL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hemocultivo y","y GenoType Blood Culture","SeptiFast Test Mgrade","bacteriemia y","heparina en","En comparaci\u00F3n","mortalidad y morbilidad en los hospitales","results of blood culture","LightCycler","conventional blood culture","sangre empleada y","en otro estudio posterior se trabaj\u00F3","SeptiFast diferencia mejor","SeptiFast fue buena","antibi\u00F3ticos innecesarios y disminuir","mostramos los resultados","s\u00EDndrome s\u00E9ptico ingresados en","Se describen","estudio se realiz\u00F3","samples","los pat\u00F3genos mediante t\u00E9cnicas basadas en \u00E1cidos nucleicos puede facilitar","concordancia entre los resultados","los controles internos para los bacilos gramnegativos","contaminaciones por estafilococos coagulasa-negativa y especies","identificar distintas bacterias y hongos productores","muestras por paciente","Roche Diagnostic SL","se apreciaron reducciones importantes","muestras correspondientes","inhibiciones","hemocultivo convencional","Hain Lifescience","inhibitions","Inicialmente se observ\u00F3 inhibici\u00F3n importante","estudio inicial propio","sepsis es una","initial in-house study","\u00E1cido desoxirribonucleico","o fungemia","volumen original","original volume","estas modificaciones","available techniques","excess DNA","t\u00E9cnicas disponibles comercialmente que ayudan","\u00E1cido nucleico extra\u00EDdo","use of unnecessary antibiotics","main causes of mortality","rapid application of appropriate antibiotics","nucleic acid-based techniques speeds diagnosis of bacteremia","principales causas","reducir","tiempo reducido","diagn\u00F3stico r\u00E1pido","presencia","cuidados intensivos","llevando","unidad","uso","exceso","r\u00E1pida adecuaci\u00F3n","new technique","fungi","tratamiento antibi\u00F3tico","ADN","nueva t\u00E9cnica","comparando","shorter time period","contamination","discriminating","segundo","coagulase-negative staphylococci","Gram-negative bacilli","septic syndrome","intensive care unit","detecci\u00F3n temprana","different sepsisproducing bacteria","debido","mitad","despu\u00E9s","substantial inhibition of internal controls","Early detection of pathogens","corregir defectos t\u00E9cnicos","primer ensayo","n\u00FAmero","morbidity","diluci\u00F3n","estreptococos","pacientes","high number of leucocytes","species of streptococci","leucocitos","hospitals","presence of heparin","finalidad","concordance","concentration","patients","technical defects","modifications","trial"],"language":"en"},

Siglecs recognize ubiquitous Sia epitopes on various glycoconjugates in the cell glycocalyx and transduce signals to regulate immunological and inflammatory activities of these cells. The subset known as CD33-related Siglecs is principally inhibitory receptors that suppress leukocyte activation, and recent research has shown that a number of bacterial pathogens use Sia mimicry to engage these Siglecs as an immune evasion strategy. Conversely, Siglec-1 is a macrophage phagocytic receptor that engages GBS and other sialylated bacteria to promote effective phagocytosis and antigen presentation for the adaptive immune response, whereas certain viruses and parasites use Siglec-1 to gain entry to immune cells as a proximal step in the infectious process. Siglecs are positioned in crosstalk with other host innate immune sensing pathways to modulate the immune response to infection in complex ways. This chapter summarizes the current understanding of Siglecs at the host\u2013pathogen interface, a field of study expanding in breadth and medical importance, and which provides potential targets for immune-based anti-infective strategies.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Yung-Chi; Nizet, Victor","journal":"Lectin in Host Defense Against Microbial Infections","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64929e24b974a401e62f2af92abda931af8b9342.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121523.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32152948/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-1580-4_8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sia"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune cells","adaptive immune response","immune sensing pathways","immune evasion strategy","CD33-related Siglecs","current understanding of Siglecs","host","Sia mimicry","ubiquitous Sia epitopes","leukocyte activation","inhibitory receptors","major leukocyte lineages","various glycoconjugates","antigen presentation","certain viruses","effective phagocytosis","field of study","proximal step","GBS","signals","sialylated bacteria","cell glycocalyx","potential targets","pathogen interface","number of bacterial pathogens","medical importance","breadth","macrophage phagocytic receptor","inflammatory activities","recent research","surface","parasites","immunoglobulin","infection","complex ways","sialic acid","entry","crosstalk","anti-infective strategies","infectious process","mammals"],"language":"en"},

Principal Results Vaccination reduces influenza episodes of vaccinated (4.81/100 HCW) compared to unvaccinated (7.54/100) HCWs/influenza season. A Cochrane review found for inactivated vaccines the Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNV)=71 (95%CI 64%, 80%) for adults 18\u201360 (same age as HCWs) to prevent laboratory-proven influenza. There are no RCTs of screening HCWs, patients, visitors and influenza supershedders to prevent transmission. None of four RCTs of HCWs mask-wearing (two directly observed, two not) showed an effect because they were underpowered either due to small size or low circulation of influenza. Hospital rooms and equipment can effectively be cleaned of influenza by many chemicals and hydrogen peroxide vapor machines but the cleaning cycle needs shortening to increase the likelihood of adoption. Major Conclusions HCW vaccination is a partial solution with current vaccination levels. There are no RCTs of screening HCWs, patients and visitors demonstrating preventing influenza transmission. Only one study costed furloughing HCWs with influenza and no RCTs have identified benefits of isolating influenza supershedders. RCTs of directly- and electronically continuously-observed mask-wearing and hand-hygiene and RCTs of incentives for meticulous hygiene are required. RCTs of engineering solutions (external venting, frequent room air changes) are needed. A wide range of chemicals effectively cleans hospital rooms and equipment from influenza. Hydrogen peroxide vapor is effective against influenza and a wide range of bacterial pathogens with patient room changes, and clean areas cleaners do not clean but its cleaning cycle needs shortening to increase the likelihood of adoption of cleaning rooms vacated by influenza patients.","publish_time":"2016-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thomas, Roger E.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a484db449f6d41927b645a3d5bcdd1ada691e694.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130638.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.04.096; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X16302717; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X16302717; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27171752/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza patients","influenza transmission","influenza season","laboratory-proven influenza","RCTs of screening HCWs","low circulation of influenza","RCTs of HCWs mask","influenza episodes of vaccinated","benefits of isolating influenza supershedders","furloughing HCWs","visitors","cleaning rooms","RCTs of incentives","cleaning hospital rooms","RCTs of engineering solutions","equipment","cleaning cycle needs","screening asymptomatic individuals","wide range of chemicals","hand-hygiene","likelihood of adoption","hydrogen peroxide vapor machines","Major Conclusions HCW vaccination","patient room changes","current vaccination levels","Principal Results Vaccination","frequent room air changes","wide range of bacterial pathogens","meticulous hygiene","low risk","clean areas cleaners","external venting","partial solution","hospitals","health-care workers","small size","Number","inactivated vaccines","bias","Cochrane review","age","study","evidence","Abstract Purpose","effect","adults","NNV"],"language":"en"},

Recent studies documented that SARS-Coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV2), responsible for COVID-19, can affect the nervous system. The aim of the present observational study was to prospectively assess subjective neurological symptoms (sNS) in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection. Methods We included patients hospitalized at the University Hospital of Rome Tor Vergata, medical center dedicated to the treatment of patients with COVID-19 diagnosis, who underwent an anamnestic interview about sNS consisting of 13 items, each related to a specific symptom, requiring a dichotomized answer. Results We included 103 patients with SARS-CoV2 infection. Ninety-four patients (91.3%) reported at least one sNS. Sleep impairment was the most frequent symptom, followed by dysgeusia, headache, hyposmia, and depression. Women more frequently complained hyposmia, dysgeusia, dizziness, numbeness/paresthesias, daytime sleepiness, and muscle ache. Moreover, muscle ache and daytime sleepiness were more frequent in the first 2 days after admission. Conversely, sleep impairment was more frequent in patients with more than 7 days of hospitalization. In these patients we also documented higher white blood cells and lower C-reactive protein levels. These laboratory findings correlated with the occurrence of hyposmia, dysgeusia, headache, daytime sleepiness, and depression. Conclusions Patients with SARS-CoV2 infection frequently present with sNS. These symptoms were present from the early phases of the disease. The possibly intrinsic neurotropic properties of SARS-CoV2 may justify the very high frequency of sNS. Further studies targeted at investigating the consequences of SARS-CoV2 infection on the CNS should be planned.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liguori, Claudio; Pierantozzi, Mariangela; Spanetta, Matteo; Sarmati, Loredana; Cesta, Novella; Iannetta, Marco; Ora, Josuel; Genga Mina, Grazia; Puxeddu, Ermanno; Balbi, Ottavia; Pezzuto, Gabriella; Magrini, Andrea; Rogliani, Paola; Andreoni, Massimo; Biagio Mercuri, Nicola","journal":"Brain, behavior, and immunity","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/98d82c208aa58df4d5beff4a09492d33479ce214.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088915912030876X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32416289/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.037; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S088915912030876X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["University Hospital","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV2 infection","SARS-Coronavirus2","consequences of SARS","treatment of patients","Conclusions Patients","dysgeusia","daytime sleepiness","COVID","intrinsic neurotropic properties of SARS","frequent symptom","high frequency of sNS","headache","occurrence of hyposmia","complained hyposmia","muscle ache","Sleep impairment","depression","present observational study","specific symptom","Recent studies","days of hospitalization","subjective neurological symptoms","Abstract Objective Coronavirus disease","higher white blood cells","lower C-reactive protein levels","medical center","dizziness","University Hospital of Rome Tor Vergata","paresthesias","numbeness","severe acute respiratory syndrome","novel pneumonia","items","early phases","diagnosis","anamnestic interview","dichotomized answer","aim","Women","CNS","laboratory findings","nervous system","admission","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Extensive studies on the constituents of L. japonica extracts have revealed an accumulation of pharmaceutically active metabolite classes, such as chlorogenic acid, luteolin and other flavonoids, and secoiridoids, which impart characteristic medicinal properties. Despite being a rich source of pharmaceutically active metabolites, little is known about the biosynthetic enzymes involved, and their expression profile across different tissues of L. japonica. In this study, we performed de novo transcriptome assembly for L. japonica, representing transcripts from nine different tissues. A total of 22 Gbps clean RNA-seq reads from nine tissues of L. japonica were used, resulting in 243,185 unigenes, with 99,938 unigenes annotated based on a homology search using blastx against the NCBI-nr protein database. Unsupervised principal component analysis and correlation studies using transcript expression data from all nine tissues of L. japonica showed relationships between tissues, explaining their association at different developmental stages. Homologs for all genes associated with chlorogenic acid, luteolin, and secoiridoid biosynthesis pathways were identified in the L. japonica transcriptome assembly. Expression of unigenes associated with chlorogenic acid was enriched in stems and leaf-2, unigenes from luteolin were enriched in stems and flowers, while unigenes from secoiridoid metabolic pathways were enriched in leaf-1 and shoot apex. Our results showed that different tissues of L. japonica are enriched with sets of unigenes associated with specific pharmaceutically important metabolic pathways and, therefore, possess unique medicinal properties. The present study will serve as a resource for future attempts for functional characterization of enzyme coding genes within key metabolic processes.

Domain-swapping is of biotechnological interest because inhibiting domain-swapping can reduce disease-causing fibrillar protein aggregation. To achieve such inhibition, it is important to understand both the energetics that stabilize the domain-swapped structure and the protein dynamics that enable the swapping. Structure-based models (SBMs) encode the folded structure of the protein in their potential energy functions. SBMs have been successfully used to understand diverse aspects of monomer folding. Symmetrized SBMs model interactions between two identical protein chains using only intra-monomer interactions. Molecular dynamics simulations of such symmetrized SBMs have been used to correctly predict the domain-swapped structure and to understand the mechanism of domain-swapping. Here, we review such models and illustrate that monomer topology determines key aspects of domain-swapping. However, in some proteins, specifics of local energetic interactions modulate domain-swapping and these need to be added to the symmetrized SBMs. We then summarize some general principles of the mechanism of domain-swapping that emerge from the symmetrized SBM simulations. Finally, using our own results, we explore how symmetrized SBMs could be used to design domain-swapping in proteins.","publish_time":"2017-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mascarenhas, Nahren Manuel; Gosavi, Shachi","journal":"Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/128de1d0186d200abb0c50069fae5ff6d2dfbe26.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127520.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27867057/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0079610716300840; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2016.09.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079610716300840","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SBM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inhibiting domain-swapping","mechanism of domain","domain-swapped structure","key aspects of domain","Symmetrized SBMs model interactions","protein dynamics","identical protein chains","identical protein monomers","intra-monomer interactions","symmetrized SBM simulations","monomer topology","folded structure","original monomer","Structure-based models","diverse aspects of monomer","disease-causing fibrillar protein aggregation","proteins","Molecular dynamics simulations","specifics of local energetic interactions","structural elements","units","multimers","dimers","potential energy functions","energetics","general principles","results","need","inhibition","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

The rapid detection assay for MNV would be a useful tool for monitoring and preventing MNV infection. A recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay was established in this study to provide a solution for rapid and sensitive detection of MNV. RESULTS: The detection limit of the RT-RPA assay for the detection of MNV was 1 \u00D7 10(2) copies of RNA molecules per reaction. The assay was specific since there was no cross-reaction with other common murine viruses. In addition, the broad reactivity of the RT-RPA assay was validated using the synthesized template carrying seven point mutations among several MNV strains. The MNV RT-RPA assay could detect as few as 1 \u00D7 10(2) copies of the mutant per reaction, suggesting the assay could be broadly reactive against a large diversity of MNV strains. Forty eight clinical samples including 16 gastric tissue specimens, 16 cecal tissue specimens and 16 fecal specimens were tested for the validation of the new developed RT-RPA assay. The detection results of RT-RPA and RT-qPCR for clinical samples were very similar, except that a gastric tissue sample which was positive by RT-qPCR, with a RNA titer of 27 copies, was negative by RT-RPA. CONCLUSIONS: A broadly reactive RT-RPA assay was successfully established for MNV detection.","publish_time":"2018-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Lei; Zeng, Fanwen; Cong, Feng; Huang, Bihong; Zhu, Yujun; Wu, Miaoli; Xu, Fengjiao; Yuan, Wen; Huang, Ren; Guo, Pengju","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11f3022ad1def6dfb1b29712112b96739ff3c498.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6295035.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-018-1736-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547776/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Murine"],"organizations":["MNV","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MNV RT-RPA assay","MNV detection","reactive RT-RPA assay","detection results of RT","rapid detection assay","new developed RT-RPA assay","RT-qPCR","sensitive detection of MNV","MNV infection","detection limit","large diversity of MNV strains","gastric tissue specimens","cecal tissue specimens","fecal specimens","gastric tissue sample","clinical samples","copies of RNA molecules","RNA titer","Murine norovirus","common murine viruses","prevalent viral pathogen","captive mouse colonies","point mutations","validation","useful tool","synthesized template","broad reactivity","cross-reaction","monitoring","solution","recombinase polymerase amplification","BACKGROUND","study","mutant","addition","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Initiation of treatment more than 7 days after diagnosis was considered a long treatment delay. RESULTS: The study included 31,937 patients. The mean day of delayed treatment was 3.6 days. Most patients were treated immediately after diagnosis. The relationship between number of TB patients and days of delayed treatment after diagnosis exhibited a Power-law distribution. The long tail of the power-law distribution indicated that an extreme number occur cannot be neglected. Tuberculosis patients treated after an unusually long delay require close observation and follow up. CONCLUSION: This study found that TB control is generally acceptabl in Taiwan; however, delayed treatment increases the risk of transmission.

METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched to identify eligible articles. Studies of diagnosis, severity or outcome were included. PROSPERO systematic review registration CRD42017075032. RESULTS: Forty studies were included, reporting on bacterial and viral infections, malaria, and critical illness due to sepsis. Ten studies reported an association of higher NLR with bacteraemia, supported by meta-analysis of patient-level data (five studies, n = 3320; AUC 0.72, p\u003C0.0001) identifying a cut-off of \u003E12.65. Two studies reported an association with lower LMR and diagnosis of influenza virus infection in patients with respiratory tract infection. Meta-analysis of patient-level data (n = 85; AUC 0.66, p = 0.01) identified a cut-off of \u22642.06. The directionality of associations between NLR and outcomes in heterogeneous cohorts of critically ill adults with sepsis varied. Potential clinical utility was also demonstrated in pneumonia (NLR), pertussis (NLR), urinary tract infection (NLR), diabetic foot infections (NLR) and Crimean Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (PLR). Longitudinal measurement of LMR during respiratory virus infection reflected symptoms and NLR during sepsis and bacteraemia predicted mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral blood leucocyte ratios are useful infection biomarkers, with the most evidence related to diagnosis of bacteraemia and influenza virus infection. In critical illness due to sepsis, a signal towards an association with NLR and outcomes exists, and NLR should be evaluated in future stratification models.

Little is known, however, in tropical countries like Cameroon about the cause and seasonality of respiratory infections, especially in hospitalized settings. Objectives: Our study investigates the viral etiology and seasonality of SARI in hospitalized children in Yaounde, Cameroon. METHODS: Prospective clinic surveillance was conducted to identify hospitalized children aged \u226415 years presenting with respiratory symptoms \u22645\u2010day duration. Demographic and clinical data, and respiratory specimens were collected. Nasopharyngeal samples were tested for 17 respiratory viruses using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction. The viral distribution and demographic data were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: From September 2011 through September 2013, 347 children aged \u226415 years were enrolled. At least one virus was identified in each of 65\u00B74% children, of which 29\u00B75% were coinfections; 27\u00B73% were positive for human adenovirus (hAdV), 13\u00B72% for human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), 11\u00B75% for rhinovirus/enterovirus (RV/EV), 10\u00B76% for human bocavirus (hBoV), 9\u00B78% for influenza virus (Inf), 6\u00B76% for human parainfluenza virus (hPIV), 5\u00B77% for human coronavirus (hCoV), and 2\u00B73% for human metapneumovirus (hMPV). While hRSV showed seasonal patterns, hAdV and RV/EV were detected throughout the year and no evident temporal patterns were observed for the remaining viruses. CONCLUSION: Respiratory viruses were associated with a high burden of hospitalizations among children in Cameroon. Nevertheless, additional studies evaluating asymptomatic Cameroonian children will be important in understanding the relationship between viral carriage and disease.","publish_time":"2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kenmoe, Sebastien; Tchendjou, Patrice; Vernet, Marie\u2010Astrid; Moyo\u2010Tetang, Suzie; Mossus, Tatiana; Njankouo\u2010Ripa, Mohamadou; Kenne, Angeladine; Penlap Beng, V\u00E9ronique; Vabret, Astrid; Njouom, Richard","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a8c6a1683a063b6fc3c1bd689ff9c1b83723b4e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4947949.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27012372/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12391","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs4NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARI","RV/EV"],"locations":["Cameroon"],"keyphrases":["respiratory viruses","hospitalized children","human respiratory syncytial virus","respiratory symptoms","respiratory specimens","human parainfluenza virus","human adenovirus","human coronavirus","human metapneumovirus","human bocavirus","seasonality of respiratory infections","asymptomatic Cameroonian children","Severe acute respiratory illness","seasonality of SARI","hAdV","viral etiology","hospitalized settings","hRSV","viral carriage","remaining viruses","viral distribution","demographic data","years","important cause of morbidity","seasonal patterns","clinical data","developing countries","tropical countries","evident temporal patterns","mortality","multiplex polymerase chain reaction","high burden of hospitalizations","Prospective clinic surveillance","additional studies","BACKGROUND","relationship","study","rhinovirus","hPIV","Yaounde","METHODS","disease","enterovirus","hBoV","day duration","Nasopharyngeal samples","Objectives","hCoV","hMPV","CONCLUSION","coinfections","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Current antiviral strategies provide only limited protection. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR) X1 is unique among NLR proteins in its functions as a pro-viral or antiviral factor to different viral infections. To date, the impact of NLRX1 on PRRSV infection remains unclear. In this study, we found that PRRSV infection promoted the expression of NLRX1 gene. In turn, ectopic expression of NLRX1 inhibited PRRSV replication in Marc-145 cells, whereas knockdown of NLRX1 enhanced PRRSV propagation in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs). Mechanistically, NLRX1 was revealed to impair intracellular viral subgenomic RNAs accumulation. Finally, Mutagenic analyses indicated that the LRR (leucine-rich repeats) domain of NLRX1 interacted with PRRSV Nonstructural Protein 9 (Nsp9) RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase) domain and was necessary for antiviral activity. Thus, our study establishes the role of NLRX1 as a new host restriction factor in PRRSV infection.","publish_time":"2019-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jing, Huiyuan; Song, Tao; Cao, Sufang; Sun, Yanting; Wang, Jinhe; Dong, Wang; Zhang, Yan; Ding, Zhen; Wang, Ting; Xing, Zhao; Bao, Wenqi","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5a78b61d406871703b3fd4173f1fd6c8b8f31e8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114581.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170219302485; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31132368/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2019.05.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170219302485","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs4NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Mutagenic","LRR","RNA Polymerase"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["domain of NLRX1","PRRSV infection","role of NLRX1","impact of NLRX1","knockdown of NLRX1 enhanced PRRSV propagation","expression of NLRX1 gene","ectopic expression of NLRX1 inhibited PRRSV replication","PRRSV Nonstructural Protein","antiviral factor","antiviral activity","study","different viral infections","Current antiviral strategies","RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase","NLR proteins","Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain","intracellular viral subgenomic RNAs accumulation","porcine alveolar macrophages","new host restriction factor","RdRp","receptor","respiratory syndrome virus","Nsp9","functions","Marc","cells","LRR","leucine-rich repeats","PAMs","limited protection","turn","Mutagenic analyses","important diseases of swine","date"],"language":"en"},

In the United States more than 35,000 deaths and 200,000 hospitalizations due to influenza occur annually, and the number is increasing. Children aged less than 1 year and adults aged more than 65 years, pregnant woman, and people of any age with comorbid illnesses are at highest risk. Annual vaccination is the cornerstone of prevention, but some older patients may derive less benefit from immunization than otherwise fit individuals. If started promptly, antiviral medications may reduce complications of acute influenza, but increasing resistance to amantadine and perhaps neuraminidase inhibitors underscores the need for novel prevention and treatment strategies. Pulmonary complications of influenza are most common and include primary influenza and secondary bacterial infection. Either may cause pneumonia, and each has a unique clinical presentation and pathologic basis. Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains, is an important cause of secondary bacterial pneumonia with high mortality. During influenza season, treatment of pneumonia should include empiric coverage for this pathogen.

Objective In this study, we considered the Marche region of Italy to compute different daily transmission rates (Rt) including five provinces in it. We also present forecasting of daily and cumulative incidences associated after the next thirty days. The Marche region is the 8th in terms of number of people infected in Italy and the first in terms of diffusion of the infection among the 4 regions of the center of Italy. Methods Epidemic statistics were extracted from the national Italian Health Ministry website. We considered outbreak information where the first case registered with onset symptoms (26 February 2020) to the present date (20 April 2020). Adoption of incidence and projections with R statistics was done. Results The median values of Rt for the five provinces of Pesaro and Urbano, Ancona, Fermo, Ascoli Piceno, and Macerata, was 2.492 (1.1-4.5), 2.162 (1.0-4.0), 1.512 (0.75-2.75), 1.141 (1.0-1.6), and 1.792 (1.0-3.5) with 95% of CI achieved. The projections at end of 30th day of the cumulative incidences 323 (95% CI), and daily incidences 45 (95% CI) might be reached.

None of these flocks were found to be infected with all four viruses, but one of the flocks was found to be infected with astrovirus, coronavirus, and rotavirus simultaneously. Individual infection was noted with astrovirus, coronavirus and rotavirus but not with reovirus, whereas all flocks infected with reovirus were also infected with coronavirus.

MeV is a member of the genus Morbillivirus and is most closely related to rinderpest virus (RPV), which is a pathogen of cattle. MeV is thought to have evolved in an environment where cattle and humans lived in close proximity. Understanding the evolutionary history of MeV could answer questions related to divergence times of MeV and RPV. We investigated divergence times using relaxed clock Bayesian phylogenetics. Our estimates reveal that MeV had an evolutionary rate of 6.0 - 6.5 \u00D7 10(-4 )substitutions/site/year. It was concluded that the divergence time of the most recent common ancestor of current MeV was the early 20(th )century. And, divergence between MeV and RPV occurred around the 11(th )to 12(th )centuries. The result was unexpected because emergence of MeV was previously considered to have occurred in the prehistoric age. MeV may have originated from virus of non-human species and caused emerging infectious diseases around the 11(th )to 12(th )centuries. In such cases, investigating measles would give important information about the course of emerging infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2010-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Furuse, Yuki; Suzuki, Akira; Oshitani, Hitoshi","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73d7ae5e79b6ba07548cf38ddcaa2979bee6916b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2838858.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20202190/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-7-52","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emergence of MeV","divergence times of MeV","evolutionary history of MeV","recent common ancestor of current MeV","RPV","measles virus","rinderpest virus","centuries","course of emerging infectious diseases","virus of non-human species","common infection","evolutionary rate","pathogen of cattle","questions","relaxed clock Bayesian phylogenetics","important information","humans","close proximity","member","result","genus Morbillivirus","substitutions","site","year","environment","children","cases","century","estimates","prehistoric age"],"language":"en"},

No antiviral therapeutics have yet received regulatory approval or demonstrated clinical efficacy. Here we describe the discovery of a novel anti-EBOV small molecule antiviral, GS-5734, a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog. GS-5734 exhibits antiviral activity against multiple variants of EBOV in cell-based assays. The pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) is efficiently formed in multiple human cell types incubated with GS-5734 in vitro, and the NTP acts as an alternate substrate and RNA-chain terminator in primer-extension assays utilizing a surrogate respiratory syncytial virus RNA polymerase. Intravenous administration of GS-5734 to nonhuman primates resulted in persistent NTP levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (half-life = 14 h) and distribution to sanctuary sites for viral replication including testes, eye, and brain. In a rhesus monkey model of EVD, once daily intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg GS-5734 for 12 days resulted in profound suppression of EBOV replication and protected 100% of EBOV-infected animals against lethal disease, ameliorating clinical disease signs and pathophysiological markers, even when treatments were initiated three days after virus exposure when systemic viral RNA was detected in two of six treated animals. These results provide the first substantive, post-exposure protection by a small-molecule antiviral compound against EBOV in nonhuman primates. The broad-spectrum antiviral activity of GS-5734 in vitro against other pathogenic RNA viruses \u2013 including filoviruses, arenaviruses, and coronaviruses \u2013 suggests the potential for expanded indications. GS-5734 is amenable to large-scale manufacturing, and clinical studies investigating the drug safety and pharmacokinetics are ongoing.","publish_time":"2016-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Warren, Travis K.; Jordan, Robert; Lo, Michael K.; Ray, Adrian S.; Mackman, Richard L.; Soloveva, Veronica; Siegel, Dustin; Perron, Michel; Bannister, Roy; Hui, Hon C.; Larson, Nate; Strickley, Robert; Wells, Jay; Stuthman, Kelly S.; Van Tongeren, Sean A.; Garza, Nicole L.; Donnelly, Ginger; Shurtleff, Amy C.; Retterer, Cary J.; Gharaibeh, Dima; Zamani, Rouzbeh; Kenny, Tara; Eaton, Brett P.; Grimes, Elizabeth; Welch, Lisa S.; Gomba, Laura; Wilhelmsen, Catherine L.; Nichols, Donald K.; Nuss, Jonathan E.; Nagle, Elyse R.; Kugelman, Jeffrey R.; Palacios, Gustavo; Doerffler, Edward; Neville, Sean; Carra, Ernest; Clarke, Michael O.; Zhang, Lijun; Lew, Willard; Ross, Bruce; Wang, Queenie; Chun, Kwon; Wolfe, Lydia; Babusis, Darius; Park, Yeojin; Stray, Kirsten M.; Trancheva, Iva; Feng, Joy Y.; Baraskaus, Ona; Xu, Yili; Wong, Pamela; Braun, Molly R.; Flint, Mike; McMullan, Laura K.; Chen, Shan-Shan; Fearns, Rachel; Swaminathan, Swami; Mayers, Douglas L.; Spiropoulou, Christina F.; Lee, William A.; Nichol, Stuart T.; Cihlar, Tomas; Bavari, Sina","journal":"Nature","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0db4d8d65bd9027984fc18280099298d1e536953.json; document_parses/pdf_json/450842232c176d0422a8d77300dec428f7c81d61.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b4b8f10ccc235f72d842eec82c9e6f5a5afd56cc.json; document_parses/pdf_json/cc3d2830fa273ecc92c303d274c48be914da9343.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5551389.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature17180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26934220/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBOV","NTP"],"locations":["West Africa"],"keyphrases":["broad-spectrum antiviral activity of GS","Intravenous administration of GS","antiviral therapeutics","virus exposure","novel anti-EBOV small molecule antiviral","multiple variants of EBOV","EBOV-infected animals","small-molecule antiviral compound","available antiviral agents","profound suppression of EBOV replication","clinical disease signs","systemic viral RNA","lethal disease","prevention of acute Ebola virus","surrogate respiratory syncytial virus RNA polymerase","recent Ebola virus outbreak","clinical studies","RNA-chain terminator","viral replication","nonhuman primates","clinical efficacy","NTP acts","pathogenic RNA viruses","days","persistent NTP levels","cell-based assays","geographic distribution","number of cases","number of nations","multiple human cell types","treated animals","primer-extension assays","post-exposure protection","rhesus monkey model of EVD","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","West Africa","half-life","testes","sanctuary sites","alternate substrate","drug safety","filoviruses","fatalities","pathophysiological markers","regulatory approval","large-scale manufacturing","coronaviruses","pharmacokinetics","substantive","arenaviruses","eye","monophosphoramidate prodrug","treatments","discovery","potential","adenosine analog","need","active nucleoside triphosphate","expanded indications","results","brain","sequelae"],"language":"en"},

In January, 2020, state, local, and federal public health agencies investigated the first case of COVID-19 in Illinois, USA. METHODS: Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were defined as those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Contacts were people with exposure to a patient with COVID-19 on or after the patient\u0027s symptom onset date. Contacts underwent active symptom monitoring for 14 days following their last exposure. Contacts who developed fever, cough, or shortness of breath became persons under investigation and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. A convenience sample of 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel contacts were also tested. FINDINGS: Patient 1\u2014a woman in her 60s\u2014returned from China in mid-January, 2020. One week later, she was hospitalised with pneumonia and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Her husband (Patient 2) did not travel but had frequent close contact with his wife. He was admitted 8 days later and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Overall, 372 contacts of both cases were identified; 347 underwent active symptom monitoring, including 152 community contacts and 195 health-care personnel. Of monitored contacts, 43 became persons under investigation, in addition to Patient 2. These 43 persons under investigation and all 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.

MAIN MEASURES: Thirty-day readmission rates and emergency department visits, hospital length of stay, expected length of stay, adverse events, in-hospital mortality, patient complaints, and cost of care in Canadian doll ars (CAD). KEY RESULTS: A total of 17,649 non-isolated patients were admitted to the participating hospitals during the study period. We identified 1506 patients isolated for respiratory illnesses and 745 patients isolated for MRSA. Compared to non-isolated individuals, those on isolation precautions for respiratory illnesses stayed 17 % longer (95 % CI: 9 %, 25 %), stayed 9 % longer than expected (95 % CI: 3 %, 15 %), and had 23 % higher cost of care (95 % CI: 14 %, 32 %). Patients isolated for MRSA had similar outcomes, but they also had a 4.4 % higher (95 % CI: 1.4 %, 7.3 %) rate of readmission to hospital within 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: Isolation precautions are associated with adverse effects which may result in poorer hospital outcomes. Balancing the benefits for the many with the harms to the few will be a future challenge.","publish_time":"2016-10-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tran, Kim; Bell, Chaim; Stall, Nathan; Tomlinson, George; McGeer, Allison; Morris, Andrew; Gardam, Michael; Abrams, Howard B.","journal":"Journal of General Internal Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/32edd4b65bdde3b8ff503a48fc9f46d715687409.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5330996.xml.json","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11606-016-3862-4.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27752880/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-016-3862-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsxMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Resource Intensity Weight","Case Mix Group","MRSA"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["effect of isolation precautions","hospital length of stay","year of isolation","month of isolation","hospital mortality","hospital admissions","poorer hospital outcomes","non-isolated patients","certain hospital-related outcomes","number of hospital readmissions","respiratory illnesses","days","MRSA","higher cost of care","non-isolated individuals","total length","similar outcomes","adverse effects","negative effects","patient safety","patient complaints","years of age","academic hospitals","participating hospitals","adverse events","matched cohort study of inpatients","study period","rate of readmission","propensity scores","day readmission rates","psychological well-being","emergency department visits","services","Resource Intensity Weight","methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","general internal medicine","GIM","sex","site of admission","Toronto","covariates","Canadian doll ars","healthcare worker contact","Ontario","Retrospective","BACKGROUND","Case Mix Group","MAIN MEASURES","Canada","Adult","KEY RESULTS","PARTICIPANTS","DESIGN","CONCLUSIONS","benefits","harms","future challenge","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

Yet it seems to be the worst EHF epidemic outbreak caused by Ebola virus Zaire since 1976 as regards its extremely large scale and rapid spread in the population. Experiments to study the agent have continued for more than 20 years. The EHF virus has a relatively simple genome with seven genes and additional reading frame resulting from RNA editing. While being of a relatively low genetic capacity, the virus can be ranked as a standard for pathogenicity with the ability to evade the host immune response in uttermost perfection. The EHF virus has similarities with retroviruses, but belongs to (\u2013)RNA viruses of a nonretroviral origin. Genetic elements of the virus, NIRV, were detected in animal and human genomes. EHF virus glycoprotein (GP) is a class I fusion protein and shows more similarities than distinctions in tertiary structure with SIV and HIV gp41 proteins and even influenza virus hemagglutinin. EHF is an unusual infectious disease, and studying the molecular basis of its pathogenesis may contribute to new findings in therapy of severe conditions leading to a fatal outcome.","publish_time":"2015-08-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kiselev, O.

Increasing numbers of studies are examining the occupational risk to healthcare workers due to proximity to patients. Selecting the appropriate air sampling method is a critical factor in assuring the analytical performance characteristics of a clinical study. The objective of this study was to compare the physical collection efficiency and virus collection efficiency of a 5mL compact SKC BioSampler\u00AE, a gelatin filter, and a glass fiber filter, in a laboratory setting. The gelatin filter and the glass fiber filter were housed in a home-made filter holder. Submersion (with vortexing and subsequent centrifugation) was used for the gelatin and glass fiber filters. Swabbing method was also tested to retrieve the viruses from the glass fiber filter. Experiments were conducted using the H1N1 influenza A virus A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (IAV-PR8), and viral recovery was determined using culture and commercial real-time-PCR (BioFire and Xpert). An atomizer was used to aerosolize a solution of influenza virus in PBS for measurement, and two Scanning Mobility Particle Sizers were used to determine particle size distributions. The SKC BioSampler demonstrated a U-shaped physical collection efficiency, lowest for particles around 30\u201350nm, and highest at 10nm and 300\u2013350nm within the size range examined. The physical collection efficiency of the gelatin filter was strongly influenced by air flow and time: a stable collection across all particle sizes was only observed at 2L/min for the 9min sampling time, otherwise, degradation of the filter was observed. The glass fiber filter demonstrated the highest physical collection efficiency (100% for all sizes) of all tested samplers, however, its overall virus recovery efficiency fared the worst (too low to quantify). The highest viral collection efficiencies for the SKC BioSampler and gelatin filter were 5% and 1.5%, respectively. Overall, the SKC BioSampler outperformed the filters. It is important to consider the total concentration of viruses entering the sampler when interpreting the results.","publish_time":"2018-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Jiayu; Leavey, Anna; Wang, Yang; O\u2019Neil, Caroline; Wallace, Meghan A.; Burnham, Carey-Ann D.; Boon, Adrianus CM; Babcock, Hilary; Biswas, Pratim","journal":"Journal of Aerosol Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e06022e85d59209981ff67b7bd0d4bebd2becfa5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125700.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2017.08.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287370/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021850217301398; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021850217301398","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjsxMzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Swabbing"],"organizations":["PBS","SKC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gelatin filter","virus collection efficiency","highest physical collection efficiency","U-shaped physical collection efficiency","stable collection","home-made filter holder","glass fiber filters","overall virus recovery efficiency","highest viral collection efficiencies","compact SKC BioSampler","particle sizes","nm","solution of influenza virus","viral recovery","sampling time","particle size distributions","individual","Scanning Mobility Particle Sizers","appropriate air sampling method","commercial real-time","air flow","H1N1 influenza","clinical study","Abstract Respiratory viral diseases","Swabbing method","size range","tested samplers","total concentration of viruses","critical factor","measurement","analytical performance characteristics","occupational risk","healthcare workers","PCR","Puerto Rico","PBS","culture","worst","particles","proximity","BioFire","IAV-PR8","subsequent centrifugation","laboratory setting","Submersion","vortexing","patients","indirect contact","Xpert","droplet","degradation","numbers of studies","Experiments","results","atomizer","objective"],"language":"en"},

In about 10% of infected cats, a potentially lethal disease, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) occurs. Virus transmission is faecal-oral. Mutian\u00AE Xraphconn (Mutian X) is a product marketed to treat cats with FIP but is also being used to stop virus shedding, although no clear guidelines exist for its use for this purpose. The aim of this study was to establish the minimum dose and treatment duration required to ensure viral clearance from the faeces of asymptomatic virus-shedding cats. In five multicat households, 29 cats naturally infected with FCoV and actively shedding virus in the faeces were given Mutian X pills. Virus shedding was monitored using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) controlled for faecal inhibitors to ensure sensitivity. Mutian X given orally cleared the virus in 29 cats; although four cats required a repeated course to finally stop virus shedding. A dose of 4 mg/kg q24 h for four days was found to be the optimal treatment protocol: 2 mg/kg cleared only 80% of cats. Post-treatment using a sensitive RT-qPCR test was essential to ensure that virus clearance had been achieved, since failure to clear even one cat can result in re-infection of the others. Records of virus shedding by cats before treatment provided a retrospective control: significantly more cats stopped shedding virus after Mutian X than recovered from infection during the control period (p \u003C .00001). This is the first report of the successful elimination of faecal FCoV shedding in chronically infected cats.","publish_time":"2020-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Addie, Diane D.; Curran, Sheryl; Bellini, Flora; Crowe, Ben; Sheehan, Emily; Ukrainchuk, Lesya; Decaro, Nicola","journal":"Research in Veterinary Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c27a1eb3cf304d95c536c8db996909fd48618d34.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102653.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2020.02.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32220667/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528819312056; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034528819312056","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjszMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus shedding","shedding virus","infected cats","faeces of asymptomatic virus-shedding cats","virus clearance","Virus transmission","Records of virus","Mutian X pills","treatment duration","Post-treatment","successful elimination of faecal FCoV","faecal inhibitors","faecal-oral","optimal treatment protocol","FIP","sensitive RT-qPCR test","viral clearance","retrospective control","control period","minimum dose","re-infection","clear guidelines","feline infectious peritonitis","Abstract Feline coronavirus","reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction","lethal disease","product","repeated course","days","study","report","Xraphconn","q24 h","failure","sensitivity","multicat households","groups","aim","purpose"],"language":"en"},

In the present study we further investigated whether EV71 infection of neuronal SK-N-SH cells induces an autophagic flux. Furthermore, the effects of autophagy on EV71-related pathogenesis and viral load were evaluated after intracranial inoculation of mouse-adapted EV71 (MP4 strain) into 6-day-old ICR suckling mice. RESULTS: We demonstrated that in EV71-infected SK-N-SH cells, EV71 structural protein VP1 and nonstructural protein 2C co-localized with LC3 and mannose-6-phosphate receptor (MPR, endosome marker) proteins by immunofluorescence staining, indicating amphisome formation. Together with amphisome formation, EV71 induced an autophagic flux, which could be blocked by NH(4)Cl (inhibitor of acidification) and vinblastine (inhibitor of fusion), as demonstrated by Western blotting. Suckling mice intracranially inoculated with EV71 showed EV71 VP1 protein expression (representing EV71 infection) in the cerebellum, medulla, and pons by immunohistochemical staining. Accompanied with these infected brain tissues, increased expression of LC3-II protein as well as formation of LC3 aggregates, autophagosomes and amphisomes were detected. Amphisome formation, which was confirmed by colocalization of EV71-VP1 protein or LC3 puncta and the endosome marker protein MPR. Thus, EV71-infected suckling mice (similar to EV71-infected SK-N-SH cells) also show an autophagic flux. The physiopathological parameters of EV71-MP4 infected mice, including body weight loss, disease symptoms, and mortality were increased compared to those of the uninfected mice. We further blocked EV71-induced autophagy with the inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA), which attenuated the disease symptoms and decreased the viral load in the brain tissues of the infected mice. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we reveal that EV71 infection of suckling mice induces an amphisome formation accompanied with the autophagic flux in the brain tissues. Autophagy induced by EV71 promotes viral replication and EV71-related pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2014-08-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Ying-Ray; Wang, Po-Shun; Wang, Jen-Ren; Liu, Hsiao-Sheng","journal":"J Biomed Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cbe56b09d64047cba4ee7875c4f55276a0cdf273.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4237791.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12929-014-0080-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25139436/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjszNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Enterovirus","ICR","MPR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["adapted EV71","colocalization of EV71","EV71-infected suckling mice","EV71 infection of suckling mice","EV71-infected SK-N","EV71-related pathogenesis","EV71 VP1 protein expression","EV71 structural protein VP1","blocked EV71-induced autophagy","physiopathological parameters of EV71","EV71 infection of neuronal SK-N","MP4 infected mice","amphisome formation","infected brain tissues","uninfected mice","autophagic flux","nonstructural protein","formation of LC3 aggregates","day-old ICR suckling mice","SH cells","endosome marker protein MPR","viral load","viral replication","increased expression of LC3","LC3 puncta","effects of autophagy","disease symptoms","inhibitor of fusion","inhibitor of acidification","MP4 strain","immunofluorescence staining","immunohistochemical staining","present study","C co-localized","body weight loss","mannose","intracranial inoculation of mouse","proteins","phosphate receptor","medulla","pons","vinblastine","autophagosomes","cerebellum","amphisomes","mortality","methyladenine","Enterovirus","Western blotting","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The plausibility of the analytical framework is assessed on the basis of three cases: the WHO\u2019s dealing with the SARS crisis; the European Commission\u2019s dealing with the Mad Cow Disease crisis; and the UN\u2019s handling of the humanitarian crisis in the Great Lakes region.

(2012) Transmission dynamics and risk factors for pandemic H1N1\u2010related illness: outbreak investigation in a rural community of British Columbia, Canada. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 6(3), e54\u2013e62. Objective To characterize the first\u2010wave epidemiologic features of influenza\u2010like illness (ILI) associated with the novel pandemic A/H1N1 [A(H1N1)pdm09] virus. Methods We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) to assess risk factors and non\u2010parametric and/or parametric distributions to estimate attack rates, secondary attack rates (SAR), duration of illness, and serial interval during a laboratory\u2010confirmed community outbreak of A(H1N1)pdm09 clustered around on\u2010reserve residents and households of an elementary school in rural British Columbia, Canada, in late April/early May 2009. ILI details were collected as part of outbreak investigation by community telephone survey in early June 2009. Results Overall, 92/408 (23%) of participants developed ILI and 36/408 (9%) experienced medically attended ILI (MAILI). The overall SAR in households was 22%: highest among participants 1\u20134 years of age (yoa) (50%) followed by \u003C1 yoa (38%), 5\u20138 yoa (20%), 10\u201319 yoa (13%), 20\u201349 yoa (20%), and 50\u201364 yoa (0%). The median serial interval was estimated at 3\u00B75 days (95% CI: 2\u00B71\u20135\u00B71). In multivariable GLMM analysis, having a chronic condition (OR: 2\u00B758; 95% CI: 1\u00B71\u20136\u00B704), younger age [1\u20138 yoa: OR: 4\u00B763; 95% CI: 2\u00B725\u20139\u00B752; 9\u201319 yoa: OR: 1\u00B795; 95% CI: 0\u00B797\u20133\u00B79 (referent: \u226520 yoa)] and receipt of 2008\u20132009 influenza vaccine (OR: 2\u00B768; 95% CI: 1\u00B737\u20135\u00B725) were associated with increased risk of ILI. Median duration of illness was 9 days, longer among those with chronic conditions (21 days). Median time to seeking care after developing illness was 4\u00B75 days. On\u2010reserve participants had higher chronic conditions, household density, ILI, MAILI, and SAR. Conclusions During a community outbreak of A(H1N1)pdm09\u2010related illness, we identified substantial clinical ILI attack rates exceeding 20% with secondary household attack rates as high as 50% in young children. The serial interval was short suggesting a narrow period to prevent transmission.","publish_time":"2012-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Janjua, Naveed Z.; Skowronski, Danuta M.; Hottes, Travis S.; Osei, William; Adams, Evan; Petric, Martin; Lem, Marcus; Tang, Patrick; De Serres, Gaston; Patrick, David M.; Bowering, David","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb682a5cbe2942e78f0ec4959adce8475d5723d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4986582.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22385647/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2012.00344.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs1MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses","ILI","SAR"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["yoa","related illness","community outbreak","ILI details","days","Median duration of illness","increased risk of ILI","pandemic H1N1","substantial clinical ILI attack rates","secondary attack rates","secondary household attack rates","outbreak investigation","pdm09","median serial interval","rural community of British Columbia","risk factors","reserve participants","overall SAR","rural British Columbia","Canada","higher chronic conditions","community telephone survey","households","influenza vaccine","Median time","MAILI","household density","parametric distributions","novel pandemic","reserve residents","Transmission dynamics","wave epidemiologic features of influenza","years of age","younger age","multivariable GLMM analysis","elementary school","generalized linear mixed models","narrow period","Methods","care","laboratory","Janjua","receipt","Respiratory Viruses","e54","young children","Conclusions","referent","e62","paper","Objective","Results"],"language":"en"},

But, its growth and production are significantly hampered by the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) which causes leaf blight disease. Earlier studies have reported the antibacterial ability of FDA-approved niclosamide drug against Xoo. However, the underlying mechanism by which niclosamide blocks the growth of Xoo remained elusive. In the present study, by employing the microbiological, microscopical, molecular, bioinformatics and analytical tools we found that niclosamide can directly inhibit the growth of the Xoo by hampering the biofilm formation and the production of xanthomonadin and exopolysaccharide substances (EPS) required for relentless growth and virulence of Xoo. Interestingly, niclosamide was found to specifically suppress the growth of Xoo without affecting other bacteria like Escherichia coli. Our electron microscopic observations disclosed that niclosamide disrupts the membrane permeability of Xoo and causes the release of intracellular components. Similarly, the molecular docking analysis disclosed the molecular interaction of niclosamide with the biofilm, virulence and quorum sensing related proteins, which was further substantiated by relative gene expression analysis where niclosamide was found to significantly downregulate the expression of these key regulatory genes. In addition, considerable changes in chemical structures were detected by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) in response to niclosamide treatment. Overall, our findings advocate the utilization of niclosamide as a safe and potent alternative antibacterial compound to control bacterial blight disease in rice.","publish_time":"2018-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sahu, Sunil Kumar; Zheng, Ping; Yao, Nan","journal":"Front Plant Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/405e67def78a29e92a4de5e016d0334550153142.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5884940.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2018.00408; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29651297/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs1MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["growth of Xoo","utilization of niclosamide","niclosamide treatment","virulence of Xoo","molecular interaction of niclosamide","approved niclosamide drug","membrane permeability of Xoo","relentless growth","bacterial blight disease","molecular docking analysis","Rice","leaf blight disease","biofilm formation","production of xanthomonadin","relative gene expression analysis","bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv","antibacterial ability of FDA","potent alternative antibacterial compound","FTIR","chemical structures","Fourier","bioinformatics","EPS","response","Infrared Spectroscopy","exopolysaccharide substances","analytical tools","half","leading source of nutrition","addition","considerable changes","Oryza sativa","microscopical","quorum","related proteins","electron microscopic observations","important commercial food crop","key regulatory genes","Earlier studies","release of intracellular components","Escherichia coli","underlying mechanism","world\u2019s population","present study","findings"],"language":"en"},

Up to March 3, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 89,000 people in China and other 66 countries across six continents. In this study, we used 10 new sequenced genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and combined 136 genomes from GISAID database to investigate the genetic variation and population demography through different analysis approaches (e.g. Network, EBSP, Mismatch, and neutrality tests). The results showed that 80 haplotypes had 183 substitution sites, including 27 parsimony-informative and 156 singletons. Sliding window analyses of genetic diversity suggested a certain mutations abundance in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2, which may be explaining the existing widespread and high adaptation of the deadly virus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the view, pangolin acted as an intermediate host, may be controversial. The network indicated that, in the original haplotype (H14), one patient sample lived near the Huanan seafood market (approximate 2 km), indicating high possibility of the patient having a history of unconscious contact with this market. However, based on this clue, we cannot accurately concluded that whether this market was the origin center of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, 16 genomes, collected from this market, assigned to 10 haplotypes, indicated a circulating infection within the market in a short term and then leading to the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan and other areas. The EBSP results showed that the first estimated expansion date of SARS-CoV-2 began from 7 December 2019, which may indicated that the transmission could have begun from person to person in mid to late November.","publish_time":"2020-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fang, Bin; Liu, Linlin; Yu, Xiao; Li, Xiang; Ye, Guojun; Xu, Juan; Zhang, Ling; Zhan, Faxian; Liu, Guiming; Pan, Tao; Shu, Yilin; Jiang, Yongzhong","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dfb2f07149617b0c2911899ac61563e808e2cee1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.976662","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs1Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBSP"],"locations":["China","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","outbreak of SARS","new sequenced genomes of SARS","origin center of SARS","Huanan seafood market","estimated expansion date of SARS","person","Network","EBSP results","haplotypes","Wuhan","Central China","genetic variation","patient sample","high adaptation","Phylogenetic analysis","high possibility","different analysis approaches","window analyses of genetic diversity","population demography","certain mutations abundance","history of unconscious contact","view","pangolin","H14","Mismatch","GISAID database","parsimony-informative","intermediate host","substitution sites","deadly virus","circulating infection","COVID","original haplotype","neutrality tests","countries","short term","coronavirus disease","singletons","study","people","continents","transmission","areas","clue"],"language":"en"},

Control of its spread is typically attempted through biosecurity measures and extensive vaccination. However, the remarkable genetic and antigenic variability of the virus, which originate from both mutations and recombination events, represents an unsolved challenge for this disease. The present study reports on the emergence and spread of recombinant clusters detected in Italy and Spain between 2012 and 2014. A total of 36 Spanish and Italian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) field strains were investigated and genetically characterized using phylogenetic, molecular, recombination and selection pressure analyses of the complete S1 gene. Based on the partial S1 sequencing, 27 IBV strains originating from Spain and nine from Italy were initially classified as being closely related to the Guandong/Xindadi (XDN) genotype. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete S1 gene revealed that the XDN strains formed a homogeneous clade with the Spanish IBV isolates within the QX genotype, whereas there was higher variability within the Italian strains. Recombination analysis determined that these strains belonged to four groups, which originated from independent recombination events between the QX and 793B IBV genotypes. Our data support the hypothesis of two different scenarios: firstly, in Spain, the large and homogeneous clade probably originated from a single offspring of the recombinant founder, which became dominant and spread throughout the country. Secondly, the nine Italian recombinants, which are characterized by three different recombination patterns, probably represent less fitted strains, because they were less viable with respect to their recombinant parents.","publish_time":"2016-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moreno, Ana; Franzo, G.; Massi, P.; Tosi, G.; Blanco, A.; Antilles, N.; Biarnes, M.; Maj\u00F3, N.; Nofrar\u00EDas, M.; Dolz, R.; Lelli, D.; Sozzi, E.; Lavazza, A.; Cecchinato, M.","journal":"Avian Pathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a29772eb4a3354e17398177bab820d68208b0b4b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114073.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/03079457.2016.1200011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27329854/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs1NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Guandong/Xindadi","XDN","QX"],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["IBV strains","Italian strains","XDN strains","field strains","fitted strains","Recombination analysis","Spain","spread","independent recombination events","different recombination patterns","Spanish IBV isolates","complete S1 gene","Italian infectious bronchitis virus","homogeneous clade","QX genotype","B IBV genotypes","recombinant founder","recombinant clusters","recombinant parents","Phylogenetic analysis","Italian recombinants","Italy","partial S1 sequencing","higher variability","antigenic variability","different scenarios","selection pressure analyses","emergence","single offspring","biosecurity measures","unsolved challenge","present study reports","extensive vaccination","hypothesis","respect","Guandong","Xindadi","total","mutations","groups","devastating diseases","poultry","data","country","Control"],"language":"en"},

In this review, we will summarize what is known about the alphavirus capsid protein, the packaging signal, and their roles in the mechanism of packaging and assembly. We will review the discovery of the packaging signal and how there is as much evidence for, as well as against, its requirement to specify packaging of the genomic RNA. Finally, we will compare this model with those of other viral systems including particular reference to a relatively new idea of RNA packaging based on the presence of multiple minimal packaging signals throughout the genome known as the two stage mechanism. This review will provide a basis for further investigating the fundamental ways of how RNA viruses are able to select their own cargo from the relative chaos that is the cytoplasm.","publish_time":"2018-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mendes, Adriano; Kuhn, Richard J.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e741dab28c2359000a1069189b3879c97f2f83ad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5869531.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v10030138; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29558394/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs1NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mechanism of packaging","new idea of RNA packaging","RNA viruses","RNA package","review","alphavirus capsid protein","positive strand genomic RNA","presence of multiple minimal packaging signals","Alphavirus nucleocapsids","stage mechanism","cytoplasm of infected cells","genome","particular reference","copies","fundamental ways","viral systems","roles","cargo","relative chaos","basis","model","assembly","requirement","discovery","challenge","evidence"],"language":"en"},

A tool to facilitate rapid and accurate point-of-care (POC) differentiation is needed. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A prospective, single center, blinded, observational clinical trial was conducted at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center from December 2012 to August 2013 to determine the accuracy of a POC immunoassay to identify a clinically significant immune response to viral and/or bacterial infection. Sixty patients with acute febrile respiratory infection (19 pharyngitis and 41 lower respiratory tract infection [LRTI]) were enrolled. Participants provided fingerstick blood for immunoassay testing (myxovirus A [MxA] and c-reactive protein [CRP]) and four oropharyngeal samples for viral PCR and routine bacterial cell culture. A venous blood sample was collected. An ELISA was used to measure CRP and MxA. Paired serological testing was used to confirm atypical bacteria. A urine sample was provided for Streptococcus and Legionella antigen testing. Patients with suspected LRTI had sputum and blood cultures, chest X-ray, and WBC count measured. Viral infection was confirmed if oropharyngeal PCR was positive for viral pathogens. Bacterial infection was confirmed in positive throat or sputum cultures. Elevated immunoglobulin M antibodies or twofold increase in IgG antibodies between acute and convalescent phase indicated atypical bacteria. Positive Streptococcus or Legionella urine antigen assays also confirmed bacterial infection. The immunoassay correctly categorized subjects as 92% (22/24) negative, 80% (16/20) with bacterial infection, and 70% (7/10) with viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: The interplay between an MxA value and a semi-quantitative CRP value can aid in the differentiation of infectious etiology. In isolation, neither MxA nor CRP alone is sensitive or specific. However, the pattern of results in a rapid immunoassay provides a sensitive and specific method to differentiate acute febrile respiratory infections. This diagnostic information may help reduce antibiotic misuse and resistance and lower healthcare costs.","publish_time":"2015-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sambursky, Robert; Shapiro, Nathan","journal":"Eur Clin Respir J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b4e98770894089e276f91c1d00e58c8885708e11.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4676840.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26672961/; https://doi.org/10.3402/ecrj.v2.28245","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs2NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center","POC","LRTI","WBC","CRP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Viral infection","bacterial infection","bacterial respiratory infection lead","viral PCR","lower respiratory tract infection","clinical differentiation of viral","immunoassay testing","viral pathogens","MxA value","rapid immunoassay","POC immunoassay","acute febrile respiratory infections","Positive Streptococcus","blood cultures","Legionella antigen testing","routine bacterial cell culture","oropharyngeal PCR","sputum cultures","semi-quantitative CRP value","lower healthcare costs","positive throat","fingerstick blood","urine sample","patients","venous blood sample","atypical bacteria","Legionella urine antigen assays","increased healthcare costs","Paired serological testing","differentiation of infectious etiology","IgG antibodies","oropharyngeal samples","specific method","single center","suspected LRTI","observational clinical trial","Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center","pharyngitis","twofold increase","misappropriation of antibiotics","antibiotic misuse","chest X-ray","convalescent phase","myxovirus","resistance","accurate point","c-reactive protein","significant immune response","FINDINGS","Elevated immunoglobulin","Challenges","Participants","WBC count","diagnostic information","tool","BACKGROUND","pattern of results","interplay","METHODS","categorized subjects","CONCLUSIONS","accuracy","isolation","ELISA","negative"],"language":"en"},

Individual sPLA2s exhibit unique tissue or cellular distributions and enzymatic properties, suggesting their distinct biological roles. Although PLA2 enzymes, particularly cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2\u03B1), have long been implicated in inflammation by driving arachidonic acid metabolism, the precise biological roles of sPLA2s have remained a mystery over the last few decades. Recent studies employing mice gene-manipulated for individual sPLA2s, in combination with mass spectrometric lipidomics to identify their target substrates and products in vivo, have revealed their roles in diverse biological events, including immunity and associated disorders, through lipid mediator-dependent or -independent processes in given microenvironments. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of the roles of sPLA2s in various immune responses and associated diseases.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Murakami, M.; Yamamoto, K.; Miki, Y.; Murase, R.; Sato, H.; Taketomi, Y.","journal":"Advances in Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6493e6374b1ab79aef927ea66a239463386d5109.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112020.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065277616300347; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.ai.2016.05.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065277616300347; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27769509/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs2OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Individual sPLA2s","precise biological roles of sPLA2s","PLA2 enzymes","distinct biological roles","secreted PLA2","cytosolic PLA2","diverse biological events","associated disorders","associated diseases","enzymatic properties","cellular distributions","unique tissue","lysophospholipids","immunity","various immune responses","lipid mediator-dependent","mass spectrometric lipidomics","arachidonic acid metabolism","fatty acids","largest group","family","mice gene","combination","independent processes","target substrates","phospholipase A2","current knowledge","isoforms","mammals","Recent studies","inflammation","Abstract","products","cPLA2\u03B1"],"language":"en"},

Thus, the potential for genetic engineering and misuse of biotechnology is a serious threat. An effective defense against viral agents requires a comprehensive approach including restricting access to viral stocks, detecting deliberately induced disease outbreaks, rapid laboratory identification of viral agents in clinical specimens, preventing person-to-person transmission, using reliable decontamination procedures, and developing effective vaccines and antiviral drugs.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meyer, R.

It finds extensive use as a medicinal herb since antiquity in different traditional systems of medicine to cure a wide range of ailments related to the circulatory, digestive, endocrine, respiratory and skeletal systems as well as to treat various infectious diseases. The remedying properties of this plant species are ascribed to a set of diverse bioactive secondary metabolite constituents, particularly anthraquinones (emodin, chrysophanol, physcion, aloe-emodin and rhein) and stilbenoids (piceatannol, resveratrol), besides dietary flavonoids known for their putative health benefits. Recent studies demonstrate the pharmacological efficacy of some of these metabolites and/or their derivatives as lead molecules for the treatment of various human diseases.

For example, conurbation and rural living is associated with increased respiratory and allergic conditions, whereas a farm or rural upbringing has been shown to be a protective factor against this. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess differences in general practice presentations of allergic and infectious disease in those exposed to conurbation or urban living compared with rural environments. METHODS: The population was a nationally representative sample of 175 English general practices covering a population of over 1.6 million patients registered with sentinel network general practices. General practice presentation rates per 100,000 population were reported for allergic rhinitis, asthma, and infectious conditions grouped into upper and lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infection, and acute gastroenteritis by the UK Office for National Statistics urban-rural category. We used multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, comorbidities, and smoking status, reporting odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. RESULTS: For allergic rhinitis, the OR was 1.13 (95% CI 1.04-1.23; P=.003) for urban and 1.29 (95% CI 1.19-1.41; P\u003C.001) for conurbation compared with rural dwellers. Conurbation living was associated with a lower OR for both asthma (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.67-0.73; P\u003C.001) and lower respiratory tract infections (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.90-0.98; P=.005). Compared with rural dwellers, the OR for upper respiratory tract infection was greater in urban (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03-1.08; P\u003C.001) but no different in conurbation dwellers (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97-1.03; P=.93). Acute gastroenteritis followed the same pattern: the OR was 1.13 (95% CI 1.01-1.25; P=.03) for urban dwellers and 1.04 (95% CI 0.93-1.17; P=.46) for conurbation dwellers. The OR for urinary tract infection was lower for urban dwellers (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89-0.99; P=.02) but higher in conurbation dwellers (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00-1.13; P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: Those living in conurbations or urban areas were more likely to consult a general practice for allergic rhinitis and upper respiratory tract infection. Both conurbation and rural living were associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infection. Living in rural areas was associated with an increased risk of asthma and lower respiratory tract infections. The data suggest that living environment may affect rates of consultations for certain conditions. Longitudinal analyses of these data would be useful in providing insights into important determinants.","publish_time":"2018-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Lusignan, Simon; McGee, Christopher; Webb, Rebecca; Joy, Mark; Byford, Rachel; Yonova, Ivelina; Hriskova, Mariya; Matos Ferreira, Filipa; Elliot, Alex J; Smith, Gillian; Rafi, Imran","journal":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6288591.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30478022/; https://doi.org/10.2196/11354","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK Office for National Statistics"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rural living","Conurbation living","rural dwellers","conurbation dwellers","urban living","urban dwellers","upper respiratory tract infection","lower respiratory tract infections","rural areas","urban areas","rural environments","rural upbringing","increased risk of urinary tract infection","allergic conditions","allergic rhinitis","National Statistics urban-rural category","general practice presentations of allergic","population","General practice presentation rates","English general practices","increased risk of asthma","infectious conditions","sentinel network general practices","acute gastroenteritis","certain conditions","data","OBJECTIVE","infectious disease","rates of consultations","important determinants","important determinant of health","UK Office","age","sex","deprivation","smoking status","comorbidities","patients","representative sample","differences","ORs","odds ratios","ethnicity","insights","conurbations","study","farm","multivariate logistic regression","example","Longitudinal analyses","pattern","RESULTS","protective factor","CIs","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

We calculated the overall burden of H7N9 cases in China as of 31 May 2013 to provide an example of comprehensive burden of disease in the 21st century from an acute animal-borne emerging infectious disease. DESIGN: We present an accurate and operable method for estimating the burden of H7N9 cases in China. The main drivers of economic loss were identified. Costs were broken down into direct (outpatient and inpatient examination and treatment) and indirect costs (cost of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and losses in the poultry industry), which were estimated based on field surveys and China statistical year book. SETTING: Models were applied to estimate the overall burden of H7N9 cases in China. PARTICIPANTS: 131 laboratory-confirmed H7N9 cases by 31 May 2013. OUTCOME MEASURE: Burden of H7N9 cases including direct and indirect losses. RESULTS: The total direct medical cost was \u00A516 422 535 (US$2 627 606). The mean cost for each patient was \u00A510 117 (US$1619) for mild patients, \u00A5139 323 (US$22 292) for severe cases without death and \u00A5205 976 (US$32 956) for severe cases with death. The total cost of DALYs was \u00A517 356 561 (US$2 777 050). The poultry industry losses amounted to \u00A57.75 billion (US$1.24 billion) in 10 affected provinces and \u00A53.68 billion (USD$0.59 billion) in eight non-affected adjacent provinces. CONCLUSIONS: The huge poultry industry losses followed live poultry markets closing down and poultry slaughtering in some areas. Though the proportion of direct medical losses and DALYs losses in the estimate of H7N9 burden was small, the medical costs per case were extremely high (particularly for addressing the use of modern medical devices). A cost-effectiveness assessment for the intervention should be conducted in a future study.","publish_time":"2014-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qi, Xiaopeng; Jiang, Dong; Wang, Hongliang; Zhuang, Dafang; Ma, Jiaqi; Fu, Jingying; Qu, Jingdong; Sun, Yan; Yu, Shicheng; Meng, Yujie; Huang, Yaohuan; Xia, Lanfang; Li, Yingying; Wang, Yong; Wang, Guohua; Xu, Ke; Zhang, Qun; Wan, Ming; Su, Xuemei; Fu, Gang; Gao, George F","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7da1a3651e1aba73bc607cf4aaa93105af0c2bf7.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f2b1074882bd3bdb8794c79fb4ab6fb72fbbf2ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3902515.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24441057/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["overall burden of H7N9 cases","estimate of H7N9 burden","severe cases","DALYs losses","cases of avian","indirect losses","proportion of direct medical losses","huge poultry industry losses","total direct medical cost","medical costs","total cost of DALYs","originated H7N9 infection","China mainland","cost of disability","indirect costs","example of comprehensive burden of disease","mean cost","live poultry markets","China statistical year book","affected provinces","death","use of modern medical devices","non-affected adjacent provinces","emerging infectious disease","treatment","adjusted life years","inpatient examination","acute animal","field surveys","outpatient","century","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","OUTCOME MEASURE","operable method","intervention","main drivers of economic loss","USD","mild patients","laboratory","cost-effectiveness assessment","Models","PARTICIPANTS","OBJECTIVE","future study","SETTING","DESIGN","areas"],"language":"en"},

Here, we described specific silencing of five white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) genes in Litopenaeus vannamei in vivo with sequence-specific siRNAs. These genes included DNA polymerase (dnapol), ribonucleotide reductase small subunit (rr2), thymidine kinase and thymidylate kinase (tk-tmk), vp24 and vp28. At 6 days post-challenged, the relative survival rates of shrimp injected with siDNApol, siRR2, siTK-TMK, siVP24 and siVP28 (siRNAs for dnapol, rr2, tk-tmk, vp24 and vp28 genes) reached 50%, 50%, 66%, 33% and 33%, respectively. Specific siRNAs of the five WSSV genes could result in suppression of the target genes and a significant reduction in the viral proliferation. In negative controls, sequence-independent siRNA (mutant siRNA) could not inhibit expression of these five genes or viral replication. Consequently, injection of sequence-dependent siRNA could induce anti-WSSV activity in shrimp. These results suggest that siRNA can suppress WSSV efficiently in shrimp, and it may provide a potential approach to the therapy of aquaculture viral disease.","publish_time":"2007-10-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Yue; L\u00FC, Ling; Yang, Li-Shi; Weng, Shao-Ping; Chan, Sui-Ming; He, Jian-Guo","journal":"Aquaculture","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/238b6914ccebd29ffd65137b580327dd4add1a35.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112065.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287454/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044848607005200; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2007.06.029; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0044848607005200","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs4MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["WSSV genes","vp28 genes","sequence-specific siRNAs","target genes","sequence-independent siRNA","mutant siRNA","injection of sequence","specific silencing","siTK-TMK","anti-WSSV activity","viral proliferation","viral replication","thymidine kinase","thymidylate kinase","relative survival rates of shrimp","therapy of aquaculture viral disease","days post-challenged","post-transcriptional process of mRNA degradation","white spot syndrome virus","ribonucleotide reductase small subunit","siDNApol","siVP24","siVP28","Litopenaeus vannamei","siRR2","RNAi","significant reduction","DNA polymerase","negative controls","expression","suppression","potential approach","Abstract RNA interference","results"],"language":"en"},

In addition, evidence supports that this relationship is causal. However, the mechanisms through which RSV contributes to asthma development are not understood. The INSPIRE (Infant Susceptibility to Pulmonary Infections and Asthma Following RSV Exposure) study objectives are to: 1) characterize the host phenotypic response to RSV infection in infancy and the risk of recurrent wheeze and asthma, 2) identify the immune response and lung injury patterns of RSV infection that are associated with the development of early childhood wheezing illness and asthma, and 3) determine the contribution of specific RSV strains to early childhood wheezing and asthma development. This article describes the INSPIRE study, including study aims, design, recruitment results, and enrolled population characteristics. METHODS/DESIGN: The cohort is a population based longitudinal birth cohort of term healthy infants enrolled during the first months of life over a two year period. Respiratory infection surveillance was conducted from November to March of the first year of life, through surveys administered every two weeks. In-person illness visits were conducted if infants met pre-specified criteria for a respiratory illness visit. Infants will be followed annually to ages 3-4 years for assessment of the primary endpoint: wheezing illness. Nasal, urine, stool and blood samples were collected at various time points throughout the study for measurements of host and viral factors that predict wheezing illness. Nested case-control studies will additionally be used to address other primary and secondary hypotheses. DISCUSSION: In the INSPIRE study, 1952 infants (48% female) were enrolled during the two enrollment years and follow-up will continue through 2016. The mean age of enrollment was 60 days. During winter viral season, more than 14,000 surveillance surveys were carried out resulting in 2,103 respiratory illness visits on 1189 infants. First year follow-up has been completed on over 95% percent of participants from the first year of enrollment. With ongoing follow-up for wheezing and childhood asthma outcomes, the INSPIRE study will advance our understanding of the complex causal relationship between RSV infection and early childhood wheezing and asthma.","publish_time":"2015-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Larkin, Emma K; Gebretsadik, Tebeb; Moore, Martin L; Anderson, Larry J; Dupont, William D; Chappell, James D; Minton, Patricia A; Peebles, R Stokes; Moore, Paul E; Valet, Robert S; Arnold, Donald H; Rosas-Salazar, Christian; Das, Suman R; Polack, Fernando P; Hartert, Tina V","journal":"BMC Pulm Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/69f5726e6b53f93b94630c1388479879f49f456e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4506623.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26021723/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12890-015-0040-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs4MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asthma development","respiratory illness","childhood asthma outcomes","development of early childhood wheezing illness","RSV Exposure","increased risk of childhood asthma","Respiratory infection surveillance","study objectives","year of enrollment","year follow-up","lung injury patterns of RSV infection","lower respiratory tract infection","person illness visits","year of life","contribution of specific RSV strains","enrollment years","year period","Respiratory syncytial virus","infancy","design","enrolled population characteristics","surveillance surveys","ongoing follow-up","longitudinal birth cohort of term healthy infants","host phenotypic response","complex causal relationship","mean age of enrollment","immune response","measurements of host","viral factors","primary endpoint","months of life","risk of recurrent wheeze","winter viral season","blood samples","Pulmonary Infections","recruitment results","various time points","pre-specified criteria","assessment","LRI","urine","stool","Infant Susceptibility","understanding","BACKGROUND","Nested case-control studies","Nasal","days","evidence","ages","percent of participants","secondary hypotheses","addition","METHODS","mechanisms","weeks","female","article","DISCUSSION"],"language":"en"},

In children, the clinical symptoms of human metapneumovirus are similar to those produced by respiratory syncytial virus, ranging from mild to severe diseases such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence of human metapneumovirus and other common respiratory viruses among admitted to hospital infants. From January 2006 to June 2006, 99 nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from hospitalized children younger than 12 months in order to study respiratory viruses. Human metapneumovirus detection was performed by cell culture and two RT\u2010PCR targeting on polymerase and fusion genes. The latter gene was used for phylogenetic analysis. In 67/99 children (67%) at least one viral pathogen was identified, the viruses detected most frequently were respiratory syncytial virus (35%), human metapneumovirus (25%) and rhinovirus (19%). The results obtained in this study, show that: (1) human metapneumovirus is one of the most important viruses among children less than 12 months; (2) children infected with human metapneumovirus were significantly older than those infected by respiratory syncytial virus; (3) human metapneumovirus was associated more frequently with pneumonia whereas respiratory syncytial virus was only detected in patients with bronchiolitis; (4) there was a clear epidemiological succession pattern with only a small overlap among the viruses detected most frequently; (5) all human metapneumovirus samples were clustered within sublineage A2.

Limited racial data is available on a national level. METHODS We conducted the first nationwide analysis to examine COVID-19 and race on a county level. We obtained datasets on COVID-19 cases and deaths, and racial population totals, by US county. We examined if correlations exist between the racial percentages and percentages of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths by county. RESULTS A positive correlation existed between percentages of African-Americans living in a county and who have COVID-19 (r = 0.254, P \u003C 0.0001), who have died from COVID-19 (r = 0.268, P \u003C 0.0001), and case mortality (r = 0.055, P = 0.003). Positive correlations also existed between percentages of Asian-Americans living in counties and these factors. Negative correlations existed between percentages of Whites living in counties and these factors. CONCLUSIONS A weak, albeit very significant, positive relationship exists between the percentage of African-Americans living in a county and the percentage of COVID-19 confirmed cases, confirmed deaths and case mortality in the county. This is in support of many city and statewide analyses, and we urge for targeted resources towards work that further examine these racial associations.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mahajan, Uma V; Larkins-Pettigrew, Margaret","journal":"Journal of public health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32435809/; https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdaa070","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["percentages of confirmed COVID","racial percentages","percentage of COVID","percentages of African","deaths","confirmed cases","greater COVID","county level","African-Americans","US county","racial associations","percentages of Whites","percentages of Asian","Positive correlations","percentage of African","racial minority groups","racial population totals","Limited racial data","case mortality","positive relationship","counties","Negative correlations","factors","national level","BACKGROUND Recent news reports state","work","statewide analyses","support","city","nationwide analysis","burden","race","targeted resources","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","datasets"],"language":"en"},

There are two FCoV serotypes. Both type I and II FCoV can replicate in Felis catus whole fetus (fcwf)-4 cells, but the replicability of type I FCoV in feline cell lines is lower than that of type II FCoV, the reason for which is unclear. Inhibition of IFN\u03B2 production by non-structural and structural proteins, excluding spike protein has been reported in many coronavirus infections. In this study, we investigated whether IFN\u03B2 is involved in the difference in replicability in feline cell lines between types I and II FCoV. When fcwf-4 cells were infected with FCoV, the virus titer of type II FCoV in the culture supernatant was higher than that of type I FIPV. When the IFN\u03B2 expression level in FCoV-infected fcwf-4 cells was semi-quantitatively analyzed, infection with type I FIPV, excluding type I FIPV UCD-1, highly induced IFN\u03B2 expression. In contrast, induction of IFN\u03B2 by type II FCoV infection was significantly lower than that by type I FIPV. In addition, when fcwf-4 cells were adsorbed by FIPV and then stimulated with Poly(I:C), type II FCoV infection inhibited Poly(I:C)-induced IFN\u03B2 gene expression. Also, the proliferation of type I FIPV was enhanced by a IFN inhibitor. These findings clarified that, unlike type I FIPV, type II FCoV strongly inhibits IFN\u03B2 expression in infected cells. It was also suggested that the IFN\u03B2-inducing ability is different among type I FIPV strains.","publish_time":"2018-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Doki, Tomoyoshi; Yabe, Midori; Takano, Tomomi; Hohdatsu, Tsutomu","journal":"Research in Veterinary Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a9686ede8f04c8bb054e2b038b9206184c841428.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111755.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528818301917; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30265871/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2018.09.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034528818301917","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["replicability of type","FCoV infection","proliferation of type","FCoV serotypes","FCoV-infected fcwf","virus titer of type","induced IFN\u03B2 expression","induction of IFN\u03B2","FIPV UCD","FIPV strains","IFN\u03B2 expression level","induced IFN\u03B2 gene expression","infected cells","Inhibition of IFN\u03B2 production","feline coronavirus","feline cell lines","Poly","Abstract Feline infectious peritonitis","coronavirus infections","structural proteins","fatal disease","difference","culture supernatant","domestic cats","spike protein","fetus","Felis catus","contrast","reason","IFN inhibitor","addition","study","findings"],"language":"en"},

They are among many other functions involved in cell\u2013cell interactions, host\u2013pathogen recognition and the regulation of serum half-life of glycoproteins. An important modification of sialic acids is O-acetylation, which can alter or mask the biological properties of the parent sialic acid molecule. The nature of mammalian sialate-O-acetyltransferases (EC 2.3.1.45) involved in their biosynthesis is still unknown. We have identified the human CasD1 (capsule structure1 domain containing 1) gene as a candidate to encode the elusive enzyme. The human CasD1 gene encodes a protein with a serine\u2013glycine\u2013asparagine\u2013histidine hydrolase domain and a hydrophobic transmembrane domain. Expression of the Cas1 protein tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein in mammalian and insect cells directed the protein to the medial and trans-cisternae of the Golgi. Overexpression of the Cas1 protein in combination with \u03B1-N-acetyl-neuraminide \u03B1-2,8-sialyltransferase 1 (GD3 synthase) resulted in an up to 40% increased biosynthesis of 7-O-acetylated ganglioside GD3. By quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, we found up to 5-fold increase in CasD1 mRNA in tumor cells overexpressing O-Ac-GD3. CasD1-specific small interfering RNA reduced O-acetylation in tumor cells. These results suggest that the human Cas1 protein is directly involved in O-acetylation of \u03B12-8-linked sialic acids.","publish_time":"2010-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arming, Sigrid; Wipfler, Dirk; Mayr, Juliane; Merling, Anette; Vilas, Ulrike; Schauer, Roland; Schwartz-Albiez, Reinhard; Vlasak, Reinhard","journal":"Glycobiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d43c56ffd7f500a0b5e681df1a83a9c4e7f1818a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108626.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20947662/; https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwq153","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EC","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["O-acetylation","human Cas1 protein","human CasD1 gene","O-acetylated ganglioside GD3","tumor cells","nature of mammalian sialate-O","CasD1 mRNA","important modification of sialic acids","enhanced green fluorescent protein","insect cells","GD3 synthase","parent sialic acid molecule","histidine hydrolase domain","hydrophobic transmembrane domain","capsule structure1 domain","CasD1-specific small interfering RNA","cell interactions","\u03B1-N","important sugars","increased biosynthesis","acetyl-neuraminide \u03B1","reducing end of glycoproteins","regulation of serum half-life of glycoproteins","pathogen recognition","host","glycine","combination","asparagine","serine","biological properties","fold increase","quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction","trans-cisternae","sialyltransferase","acetyltransferases","\u03B12","Golgi","candidate","glycolipids","functions","Overexpression","results","elusive enzyme"],"language":"en"},

Comparative analyses of the BYD1 genome with those of three prototype mammalian reovirus strains demonstrated that BYD1 is a novel reassortant virus, with its S1 gene segment coming from a previously unidentified serotype 2 isolate and other nine segments coming from ancestors of homologous T1L and T3D segments, which supports the hypothesis that mammalian reovirus gene segments reassort in nature. Further analyses of the S1 segments of the six isolates showed that all the isolates are novel serotype 2 MRVs based on their S1 gene sequences, which are markedly different from those of all previously reported, and the S1 genes of the four new isolates share more than 99% identity with each other, proving that they diverged from a common ancestor most recently, and the S1 genes of the four new isolates share about 65% identity with those of the two strains isolated in 1982.","publish_time":"2008-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Lihua; Zhou, Yusen; He, Jun; Zhu, Hong; Huang, Rutong; Mao, Panyong; Duan, Qing","journal":"Virus Genes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb3f45ac7473ba71fc21537056a01c4a528d1b35.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088624.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-008-0283-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18810628/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["S1 segments","mammalian reovirus isolates","S1 gene sequences","mammalian reovirus gene segments","new mammalian reovirus","new isolates","S1 genes","S1 gene segment","BYD1 genome","genome sequences of BYD1","prototype mammalian reovirus strains","reported mammalian reoviruses","designated BYD1","T3D segments","SARS patient of Beijing","MRVs","different SARS patients","novel serotype","identity","unidentified serotype","children of Beijing","Comparative analyses","novel reassortant virus","severe acute respiratory syndrome","guinea pigs","throat swabs","hypothesis","clinical symptoms similar","macaques","BYL","ancestors of homologous T1L","BLD","JP","molecular comparison","nature","described isolation","fecal specimens","outbreak","study","common ancestor"],"language":"en"},

MERS is caused by MERS-CoV, an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae. Despite expert opinions that the danger of MERS might be exaggerated, there was an overreaction by the public according to the Korean mass media, which led to a noticeable reduction in social and economic activities during the outbreak. To explain this phenomenon, we presumed that machine learning-based analysis of media outlets would be helpful and collected a number of Korean mass media articles and short-text comments produced during the 10-week outbreak. To process and analyze the collected data (over 86 million words in total) effectively, we created a methodology composed of machine-learning and information-theoretic approaches. Our proposal included techniques for extracting emotions from emoticons and Internet slang, which allowed us to significantly (approximately 73%) increase the number of emotion-bearing texts needed for robust sentiment analysis of social media.

The hazards stem from chemical and microbiological agents whose nature and magnitude depend heavily on the degree of sorting and on the composting methods. Three main routes of exposure can be determined and are quantified in the literature: (i) The ingestion of soil/compost mixtures by children, mostly in cases of pica, can be a threat because of the amount of lead, chromium, cadmium, PCDD F and fecal streptococci that can be absorbed. (ii) Though concern about contamination through the food chain is weak when compost is used in agriculture, some authors anticipate accumulation of pollutants after several years of disposal, which might lead to future hazards. (iii) Exposure is also associated with atmospheric dispersion of compost organic dust that convey microorganisms and toxicants. Data on hazard posed by organic dust from municipal composts to the farmer or the private user is scarce. To date, microorganisms are only measured at composting plants, thus raising the issue of extrapolation to environmental situations. Lung damage and allergies may occur because of organic dust, Gram negative bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi. Further research is needed on the risk related to inhalation of chemical compounds.","publish_time":"1995-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"D\u00E9portes, Isabelle; Benoit-Guyod, Jean-Louis; Zmirou, Denis","journal":"Science of The Total Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f18f54b3b4f54ef64c1c44b03bab3dfcf7bb581f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0048969795048081; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0048969795048081","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsyMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCDD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["compost mixtures","atmospheric dispersion of compost organic dust","use of municipal waste compost","microorganisms","lead","municipal composts","composting plants","hazards stem","composting methods","future hazards","inhalation of chemical compounds","main routes of exposure","terms of health risk assessment","cadmium","microbiological agents","farmer","Gram negative bacteria","PCDD F","relationship","actinomycetes","children","food chain","current state of knowledge","accumulation of pollutants","contamination","magnitude","fecal streptococci","fungi","issue of extrapolation","chromium","nature","agriculture","ingestion of soil","allergies","private user","years of disposal","environmental situations","cases of pica","authors","review","concern","degree of sorting","Data","toxicants","Lung damage","threat","literature","date","research"],"language":"en"},

This post-translational modification and the ADP-ribosyltransferases (also known as PARPs) responsible for its synthesis have been found to play a role in nearly all major cellular processes, including DNA repair, transcription, translation, cell signaling, and cell death. Furthermore, dysregulation of ADP-ribosylation has been linked to diseases including cancers, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, and heart failure, leading to the development of therapeutic PARP inhibitors, many of which are currently in clinical trials. The study of this therapeutically important modification has recently been bolstered by the application of mass spectrometry-based proteomics, arguably the most powerful tool for the unbiased analysis of protein modifications. Unfortunately, progress has been hampered by the inherent challenges that stem from the physicochemical properties of ADP-ribose, which as a post-translational modification is highly charged, heterogeneous (linear or branched polymers, as well as monomers), labile, and found on a wide range of amino acid acceptors. In this Perspective, we discuss the progress that has been made in addressing these challenges, including the recent breakthroughs in proteomics techniques to identify ADP-ribosylation sites, and future developments to provide a proteome-wide view of the many cellular processes regulated by ADP-ribosylation.","publish_time":"2015-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Daniels, Casey M.; Ong, Shao-En; Leung, Anthony K.L.","journal":"Mol Cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3dc217a3a9ba97ff2f55acf0b6bdfda7e7919086.json; document_parses/pdf_json/bd53a15e89e706d466deae8698fe83414efff832.json; document_parses/pdf_json/bd4d9f021048a82ff662906bbfdeaf2948a905c8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4486045.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2015.06.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26091340/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276515004517; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1097276515004517","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsyMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ADP-ribose","ADP-ribosyltransferases","ADP-ribosylation sites","mono-ADP","poly-ADP","dysregulation of ADP","physicochemical properties of ADP","post-translational modification","important modification","progress","major cellular processes","proteomics techniques","cell death","inherent challenges","proteome-wide view","application of mass spectrometry-based proteomics","wide range of amino acid acceptors","DNA repair","single units","neurodegenerative disorders","polymeric chains","diabetes","powerful tool","transcription","future developments","heart failure","recent breakthroughs","unbiased analysis of protein modifications","branched polymers","cancers","diseases","proteins","development of therapeutic PARP inhibitors","monomers","PARPs","role","synthesis","study","clinical trials","Perspective"],"language":"en"},

Here, such a multiplex real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assay for typing influenza A and B viruses and the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 is developed. This assay can also subtype seasonal influenza A viruses simultaneously. The analytical sensitivity is 10\u2013104 copies/reaction. The coefficients of variation of inter-assay and intra-assay are 0.04\u20130.45% and 0.08\u20130.97%, respectively. The new multiplex rRT-PCR assay is more sensitive in subtyping seasonal influenza viruses than the conventional PCR techniques. Results obtained with this assay for the detection of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 are highly consistent (96.88%) with those achieved using the US CDC\u0027s rRT-PCR protocol.

The decision to proceed with medically necessary, time-sensitive (MeNTS) procedures in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic requires incorporation of factors (resource limitations, COVID-19 transmission risk to providers and patients) heretofore not overtly considered by surgeons in the already complicated processes of clinical judgment and shared decision-making. We describe a scoring system that systematically integrates these factors to facilitate decision-making and triage for MeNTS procedures, and appropriately weighs individual patient risks with the ethical necessity of optimizing public health concerns.

Control of gene expression is a vital element of virus replication. Coordinate expression of groups of virus genes results in successive phases of gene expression. Immediate\u2013early genes encode activator proteins, early genes encode further regulatory proteins, and late genes encode virus structural proteins. Viruses make use of the biochemical apparatus of their host cells to express their genetic information as proteins and, consequently, utilize the appropriate biochemical language recognized by the cell. Thus viruses of prokaryotes produce polycistronic mRNAs, while viruses with eukaryotic hosts produce more monocistronic mRNAs. Some viruses of eukaryotes do produce polycistronic mRNA to assist with the coordinate regulation of multiple genes. Viruses rely on specific cis- and trans-acting mechanisms to manipulate the biology of their host cells, and to enhance and coordinate the expression of their genetic information. The chapter discusses control of prokaryote gene expression, expression in bacteriophage \u03BB, eukaryote gene expression, and also discusses genome coding strategies.

METHODS: The Observational Research in Childhood Infectious Diseases (ORChID) study is a community-based birth cohort describing acute respiratory infections in infants until their second birthday. Parents recorded daily symptoms and collected nose swabs weekly, which were batch-tested using polymerase chain reaction assays for 17 respiratory viruses.

There will be a progressive increase in deferred cases during the pandemic that will require completion within a limited time frame once restrictions ease. We investigated the impact of various levels of increased post-pandemic hospital operating capacity on the time to clear the backlog of deferred cases. Methods We collected data from four cardiac surgery programs across two health systems. We recorded case rates at baseline and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We created a mathematical model to quantify the cumulative surgical backlog based on the projected pandemic duration. We then used our model to predict the time required to clear the backlog depending on the level of increased operating capacity. Results Cardiac surgery volumes fell to 54% of baseline after restrictions were implemented. Assuming a service restoration date of either June 1 or July 1, we calculated the need to perform 216% or 263% of monthly baseline volume, respectively, to clear the backlog in one month. The actual duration required to clear the backlog is highly dependent on hospital capacity in the post-COVID time period, and ranges from one to eight months depending on when services are restored and degree of increased capacity. Conclusions Cardiac surgical operating capacity during the COVID-19 recovery period will have a dramatic impact on the time to clear the deferred cases backlog. Inadequate operating capacity may cause substantial delays and increase morbidity and mortality. If only pre-pandemic capacity is available, the backlog will never clear.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Salenger, Rawn; Etchill, Eric W.; Ad, Niv; Matthew, Thomas; Alejo, Diane; Whitman, Glenn; Lawton, Jennifer S.; Lau, Christine L.; Gammie, Charles F.; Gammie, James S.","journal":"Ann Thorac Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ecb99922b0738baab2d470e0e57bcedec255404.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003497520306937; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376350/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2020.04.018; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003497520306937?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pre-pandemic capacity","hospital capacity","backlog of deferred cases","deferred cases backlog","Inadequate operating capacity","level of increased operating capacity","degree of increased capacity","Conclusions Cardiac surgical operating capacity","cumulative surgical backlog","post-COVID time period","Cardiac surgery volumes","projected pandemic duration","cardiac surgery programs","impact of various levels of increased post-pandemic hospital","adult cardiac surgery case volumes","limited time frame","monthly baseline volume","recovery period","dramatic impact","case rates","restrictions ease","mathematical model","progressive increase","actual duration","institutions","surgeons","substantial delays","ranges","non-urgent operations","data","health systems","completion","morbidity","mortality","services","ABSTRACT Background","service restoration date","months","Methods","need"],"language":"en"},

On this basis, a label-free ECL immunosensor was developed for the sensitive detection of human immunoglobulin G (hIgG) by using ABEI-GC as the ECL nano-interface via a layer-by-layer assembly technique.

The ECL immunosensor for the determination of hIgG showed a linear range of 1.0\u00D710(\u221213)\u20131.0\u00D710(\u22128) g/mL with a detection limit of 5.0\u00D710(\u221214) g/mL. This immunosensor has high sensitivity, wide linearity and good reproducibility. The superior sensitivity of the proposed ECL immunoassay mainly derives from the incorporation of ABEI-GC, which not only improves the ECL intensity, response speed, and stability, but also provides a large specific surface for high levels of protein loading. This work reveals that ABEI-GC is good nano-interface for the construction of ECL biosensors. Our strategy is promising for protein detection and may open up a new avenue for ultrasensitive label-free immunoassays.","publish_time":"2015-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shu, Jiangnan; Shen, Wen; Cui, Hua","journal":"Sci China Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f396dca9b8d5d8e40af2f4aab4c91584ecd2776.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32215002/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11426-015-5320-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ECL","ITO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ABEI-GC","ECL intensity","ECL signal","ECL nano-interface","label-free ECL immunosensor","proposed ECL immunoassay","construction of ECL biosensors","excellent ECL activity","incorporation of ABEI","presence of hIgG","determination of hIgG","protein detection","ITO electrode","modified electrode","high sensitivity","good nano-interface","detection limit","sensitive detection of human immunoglobulin G","high levels of protein loading","superior sensitivity","good reproducibility","ultrasensitive label-free immunoassays","N-ethylisoluminol","behavior of N","large specific surface","layer assembly technique","antibody-coated gold nanoparticles","wide linearity","functionalized graphene composite","new avenue","indium tin oxide","stability","response speed","linear range","aminobutyl","electrochemiluminescence","basis","strategy","addition","work","double potential","chitosan"],"language":"en"},

Since our understanding of the HCV lifecycle would benefit from the identification of additional permissive cell lines, we assembled a panel of hepatic and non-hepatic cell lines and assessed their ability to support HCV infection. Here we show infection of the human hepatoma cell lines PLC/PRF/5 and Hep3B with cell culture-derived HCV (HCVcc), albeit to lower levels than that achieved in Huh7 cells. To better understand the reduced permissiveness of PLC and Hep3B cells for HCVcc infection, we performed studies to evaluate the ability of each cell line to support specific steps of the viral lifecycle (i.e. entry, replication, egress and spread). RESULTS: We found that while the early events in HCV infection (i.e. entry plus replication initiation) are cumulatively equivalent or only marginally reduced in PLC and Hep3B cells, later steps of the viral life cycle such as steady-state replication, de novo virus production and/or spread are impaired to different degrees in PLC and Hep3B cultures compared to Huh7 cell cultures. Interestingly, we also observed that interferon stimulated gene (i.e. ISG56) expression was significantly and differentially up-regulated in PLC and Hep3B cells following viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the restrictions observed later during HCV infection in these cell lines could in part be attributed to HCV-induced innate signaling. Nevertheless, the identification of two new cell lines capable of supporting authentic HCVcc infection, even at reduced levels, expands the current repertoire of cell lines amendable for the study of HCV in vitro and should aid in further elucidating HCV biology and the cellular determinants that modulate HCV infection.","publish_time":"2012-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sainz, Bruno; Barretto, Naina; Yu, Xuemei; Corcoran, Peter; Uprichard, Susan L","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0241ada1b12eaacadc56a59586bc1728a580583d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3317838.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22273112/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-30","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV","PLC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCV infection","HCV lifecycle","viral infection","study of HCV","infectious HCV","cell culture-derived HCV","human hepatoma cell lines PLC","non-hepatic cell lines","Huh7 cell cultures","Hep3B cells","new cell lines capable","identification of additional permissive cell lines","authentic HCVcc infection","elucidating HCV biology","current repertoire of cell lines amendable","Huh7 cells","Hep3B cultures","reduced permissiveness of PLC","viral lifecycle","reduced levels","replication initiation","later steps","entry","ability","spread","steady-state replication","viral life cycle","specific steps","panel of hepatic","lower levels","novo virus production","hepatitis C virus","PRF","different degrees","cellular determinants","ISG56","interferon stimulated gene","early events","expression","studies","restrictions","BACKGROUND","egress","understanding","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Here, we integrate this theory with Lotka\u2019s Maximum Power Principle and propose a model linking energy extraction from the environment with genetic, technological and cultural evolution to increase human ecosystem carrying capacity. Carrying capacity is partially determined by energetic factors such as the net energy a population can acquire from its environment and the efficiency of conversion from energy input to offspring output. These factors are under Darwinian genetic selection in all species, but in humans, they are also determined by technology and culture. If there is genetic or non-genetic heritable variation in the ability of an individual or social group to increase its carrying capacity, then we hypothesize that selection or cultural evolution will act to increase carrying capacity. Furthermore, if this evolution of carrying capacity occurs faster than the biotic components of the ecological system can respond via their own evolution, then we hypothesize that unsustainable ecological changes will result.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Snyder, Brian F.","journal":"Sustain Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b8ec626ad86924e9f899b81e974ba02346057445.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7133775.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-020-00803-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292525/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Maximum Power Principle"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["capacity","Anthropogenic changes","cultural evolution","Darwinian genetic selection","unsustainable ecological changes","energy input","net energy","energy extraction","ultimate cause of anthropogenic environmental change","non-genetic heritable variation","multi-level selection","climate change","population growth","human ecosystem","ecosystem engineering","energetic factors","ecological system","Anthroecological theory","ability","niche construction","model","Lotka\u2019s Maximum Power Principle","biodiversity loss","efficiency of conversion","biotic components","evolutionary causality","AET","offspring output","social group","species","proximate mechanisms","future of life","earth","technology","culture","humans"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: Diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection in 39 cases: 31 between September and December 2008 (30 children and one adult) and eight since June 2009 (three adults and five children). Children (mean age: 3.6 years) were hospitalized in 88.6% of cases, mean hospitalization duration was 2.9 days for respiratory tract infections, mainly due to lack of response to \u03B2-lactamines therapy (65.7%). Four adults (mean age: 29.5 years) presented a pneumonia, with hospitalization for three of them with one in intensive care unit. Twenty-eight PCR have proved positive (87%): without associated serology (13), eight negative serologies, IgG and IgM positive (five), and IgG alone (two). Seven patients had only serological test for diagnosis: IgM \u00B1 IgG. For two children, IgM positive only in isolation, with a PCR probably false negative. CONCLUSION: The sensitivity of the serology in the diagnosis of mycoplasma infection is limited: IgM, which appear traditionally 1 week after clinical signs are mostly inexistent for adults and IgG rise at a later stage.

In 2008, Hong Kong removed all duties on alcohol except for spirits. The aim of this paper is to examine the case of Hong Kong with its history of changes in alcohol taxation to explore the factors that have driven such an unprecedented policy evolution. METHODS: The research is based on an analysis of primary documents. Searches of official government documents, alcohol-related industry materials and other media reports on alcohol taxation for the period from 2000 to 2008 were systematically carried out using key terms such as \u201Calcohol tax\u201D and \u201Calcohol industry\u201D. Relevant documents (97) were indexed by date and topic to undertake a chronological and thematic analysis using Nvivo8 software. RESULTS: Our analysis demonstrates that whereas the city\u2019s changing financial circumstances and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government\u2019s strong propensity towards economic liberalism had, in part, contributed to such dramatic transformation, the alcohol industry\u2019s lobbying tactics and influence were clearly the main drivers of the policy decision. The alcohol industry\u2019s lobbying tactics were two-fold. The first was to forge a coalition encompassing a range of catering and trade industries related to alcohol as well as industry-friendly lawmakers so that these like-minded actors could find common ground in pursuing changes to the taxation policy. The second was to deliberately promote a blend of ideas to garner support from the general public and to influence the perception of key policy makers. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the success of aggressive industry lobbying coupled with the absence of robust public health advocacy was the main driving force behind the unparalleled abolition of wine and beer duties in Hong Kong. Strong public health alliance and advocacy movement are needed to counteract the industry\u2019s continuing aggressive lobby and promotion of alcoholic beverages.","publish_time":"2012-08-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yoon, Sungwon; Lam, Tai-Hing","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cab83150f6a2199249918297638108ce1c45e4e4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3490743.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22935365/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-12-717","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs0NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["alcohol taxation","alcohol industry\u2019s lobbying tactics","alcohol-related industry materials","taxation policy","case of Hong Kong","Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government\u2019s strong propensity","Strong public health alliance","general public","success of aggressive industry lobbying","beer duties","policy decision","analysis of primary documents","overall public health measures","absence of robust public health advocacy","industry-friendly lawmakers","thematic analysis","perception of key policy makers","influence","Relevant documents","unprecedented policy evolution","industry\u2019s continuing aggressive lobby","Searches of official government documents","advocacy movement","main drivers","pursuing changes","history of changes","common ground","common practice","key terms","main driving force","unparalleled abolition of wine","media reports","city\u2019s changing financial circumstances","like-minded actors","economic liberalism","promotion of alcoholic beverages","countries","trend","range of catering","dramatic transformation","Nvivo8 software","support","trade industries","topic","findings","fold","factors","period","blend of ideas","paper","date","coalition","research","percent","spirits","BACKGROUND","aim","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

BAG3 protein is the only member of this family containing also the N\u2010terminally located WW domain. We describe here the identification of adenovirus (Ad) penton base protein as the first BAG3 partner recognising BAG3 WW domain. Ad penton base is the viral capsid constituent responsible for virus internalisation. It contains in the N\u2010terminal part two conserved PPxY motifs, known ligands of WW domains. In cells producing Ad penton base protein, cytoplasmic endogenous BAG3 interacts with it and co\u2010migrates to the nucleus. Preincubation of BAG3 with Ad base protein results in only slight modulation of BAG3 co\u2010chaperone activity, suggesting that this interaction is not related to the classical BAG3 co\u2010chaperone function. However, depletion of BAG3 impairs the cell entry of the virus and viral progeny production in Ad\u2010infected cells, suggesting that the interaction between virus penton base protein and cellular co\u2010chaperone BAG3 positively influences virus life cycle. These results thus demonstrate a novel host\u2013pathogen interaction, which contributes to the successful infectious life cycle of adenoviruses. In addition, these data enrich our knowledge about the multifunctionality of the BAG3 co\u2010chaperone. J. Cell.

The salt coating on the fiber surface dissolves upon exposure to virus aerosols and recrystallizes during drying, destroying the pathogens. When tested with tightly sealed sides, salt-coated filters showed remarkably higher filtration efficiency than conventional mask filtration layer, and 100% survival rate was observed in mice infected with virus penetrated through salt-coated filters. Viruses captured on salt-coated filters exhibited rapid infectivity loss compared to gradual decrease on bare filters. Salt-coated filters proved highly effective in deactivating influenza viruses regardless of subtypes and following storage in harsh environmental conditions.

Relatively little is known, however, concerning the stability of HCV and reliable procedures for inactivating this virus. METHODS: In the current study, the thermostability of cell culture-derived HCV (HCVcc, JFH-1 strain) under different environmental temperatures (37\u00B0C, room temperature, and 4\u00B0C) and the ability of heat, UVC light irradiation, and aldehyde and detergent treatments to inactivate HCVcc were evaluated. The infectious titers of treated viral samples were determined by focus-forming unit (FFU) assay using an indirect immunofluorescence assay for HCV NS3 in hepatoma Huh7-25-CD81 cells highly permissive for HCVcc infection. MTT cytotoxicity assay was performed to determine the concentrations of aldehydes or detergents at which they were no longer cytotoxic. RESULTS: HCVcc in culture medium was found to survive 37\u00B0C and room temperature (RT, 25 \u00B1 2\u00B0C) for 2 and 16 days, respectively, while the virus was relatively stable at 4\u00B0C without drastic loss of infectivity for at least 6 weeks. HCVcc in culture medium was sensitive to heat and could be inactivated in 8 and 4 min when incubated at 60\u00B0C and 65\u00B0C, respectively. However, at 56\u00B0C, 40 min were required to eliminate HCVcc infectivity. Addition of normal human serum to HCVcc did not significantly alter viral stability at RT or its susceptibility to heat. UVC light irradiation (wavelength = 253.7 nm) with an intensity of 450 \u03BCW/cm(2 )efficiently inactivated HCVcc within 2 min. Exposures to formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, ionic or nonionic detergents all destroyed HCVcc infectivity effectively, regardless of whether the treatments were conducted in the presence of cell culture medium or human serum. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide quantitative evidence for the potential use of a variety of approaches for inactivating HCV. The ability of HCVcc to survive ambient temperatures warrants precautions in handling and disposing of objects and materials that may have been contaminated with HCV.","publish_time":"2010-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Hongshuo; Li, Jin; Shi, Shuang; Yan, Ling; Zhuang, Hui; Li, Kui","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b9b85a4893f9ed75881adcedbf142098bd7edc93.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2834657.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-7-40; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20167059/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs1MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MTT","RT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCVcc infectivity","ability of HCVcc","inactivated HCVcc","HCVcc infection","Hepatitis C virus","stability of HCV","inactivating HCV","HCV NS3","thermostability of cell culture-derived HCV","presence of cell culture medium","ability of heat","UVC light irradiation","viral stability","RESULTS","RT","room temperature","indirect immunofluorescence assay","MTT cytotoxicity assay","drastic loss of infectivity","ambient temperatures","nonionic detergents","Addition of normal human serum","detergent treatments","different environmental temperatures","infectious titers of treated viral samples","hepatoma Huh7","CD81 cells","potential use","handling","quantitative evidence","focus","glutaraldehyde","FFU","formaldehyde","variety of approaches","Exposures","precautions","strain","JFH","current study","wavelength","reliable procedures","BACKGROUND","flavivirus","objects","CONCLUSIONS","unit","susceptibility","blood","concentrations of aldehydes","millions of people","intensity","materials","METHODS","weeks","days","\u03BCW"],"language":"en"},

Apelin induces the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in failing hearts, thereby improving heart function in an angiotensin 1\u20137-dependent manner. Whether apelin antagonizes the over-activation of the renin\u2013angiotensin system in the heart remains elusive. In this study we show that the detrimental effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) were exacerbated in the hearts of aged apelin-gene-deficient mice. Ang II-mediated cardiac dysfunction and hypertrophy were augmented in apelin knockout mice. The loss of apelin increased the ratio of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to ACE2 expression in the Ang II-stressed hearts, and Ang II-induced cardiac fibrosis was markedly enhanced in apelin knockout mice. mRNA expression of pro-fibrotic genes, such as transforming growth-factor beta (TGF-\u03B2) signaling, were significantly upregulated in apelin knockout hearts. Consistently, treatment with the ACE-inhibitor Captopril decreased cardiac contractility in apelin knockout mice. In vitro, apelin ameliorated Ang II-induced TGF-\u03B2 expression in primary cardiomyocytes, accompanied with reduced hypertrophy. These results provide direct evidence that endogenous apelin plays a crucial role in suppressing Ang II-induced cardiac dysfunction and pathological remodeling.","publish_time":"2019-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sato, Teruki; Kadowaki, Ayumi; Suzuki, Takashi; Ito, Hiroshi; Watanabe, Hiroyuki; Imai, Yumiko; Kuba, Keiji","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0321c49afd322bf426b0dfb3eca1152a69ed168.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6358887.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20020239; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30634441/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs1NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ang"],"organizations":["APJ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["apelin knockout mice","apelin knockout hearts","endogenous apelin","loss of apelin","expression of angiotensin","hearts of aged apelin-gene","angiotensin system","ratio of angiotensin","ACE2 expression","cardiac dysfunction","induced TGF-\u03B2 expression","detrimental effects of angiotensin","cardiac contractility","cardiac fibrosis","failing hearts","deficient mice","stressed hearts","enzyme","mRNA expression of pro-fibrotic genes","beneficial effects","over-activation","heart function","reduced hypertrophy","ACE-inhibitor Captopril","primary cardiomyocytes","APJ receptor","cardioprotective peptide","renin","direct evidence","crucial role","growth-factor beta","results","pathology of cardiovascular diseases","treatment","pathological remodeling","study","dependent manner"],"language":"en"},

The presence of human herpes simplex virus 1, human cytomegalovirus and Epstein\u2013Barr virus in respiratory samples of critically ill patients is increasingly reported even without canonical immunosuppression. The main aim of this study was to better understand the significance of herpesviruses finding in lower respiratory tract of ARDS patients hospitalized in ICU. The presence of this group of herpesviruses, in addition to the research of influenza viruses and other common respiratory viruses, was investigated in respiratory samples from 54 patients hospitalized in ICU, without a known microbiological causative agent. Moreover, the immunophenotype of each patient was analyzed. Herpesviruses DNA presence in the lower respiratory tract seemed not attributable to an impaired immunophenotype, whereas a significant correlation was observed between herpesviruses positivity and influenza virus infection. A higher ICU mortality was significantly related to the presence of herpesvirus infection in the lower respiratory tract as well as to impaired immunophenotype, as patients with poor outcome showed severe lymphopenia, affecting in particular T (CD3\u002B) cells, since the first days of ICU hospitalization. In conclusion, these results indicate that herpesviruses lower respiratory tract infection, which occurs more frequently following influenza virus infection, can be a negative prognostic marker. An independent risk factor for ICU patients with ARDS is an impaired immunophenotype.","publish_time":"2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bonizzoli, Manuela; Arvia, Rosaria; di Valvasone, Simona; Liotta, Francesco; Zakrzewska, Krystyna; Azzi, Alberta; Peris, Adriano","journal":"Med Microbiol Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/579fdd7af308a5a9b022f5a38c69b6d1fd3c6224.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086591.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27138606/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00430-016-0456-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ICU patients","lower respiratory tract of ARDS patients","herpesviruses lower respiratory tract infection","respiratory samples","ill patients","common respiratory viruses","impaired immunophenotype","Herpesviruses DNA presence","herpesviruses positivity","following influenza virus infection","significance of herpesviruses","group of herpesviruses","presence of herpesvirus infection","days of ICU hospitalization","Acute respiratory distress syndrome","higher ICU mortality","Barr virus","presence of human herpes simplex virus","research of influenza viruses","human cytomegalovirus","etiologic agent","leading cause of hospitalization","known microbiological causative agent","Epstein","severe lymphopenia","intensive care unit","poor outcome","particular T","addition","significant correlation","results","independent risk factor","cells","study","CD3","negative prognostic marker","main aim","conclusion","pneumonia","canonical immunosuppression"],"language":"en"},

To gain access to enterocytes and to cross the epithelial membrane, many enterovirulent microorganisms interact with the brush border membrane-associated components as receptors. Recent reports provide evidence that intestinal cell differentiation plays a role in microbial pathogenesis. Human enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) develop their pathogenicity upon infecting enterocytes. To determine if intestinal epithelial cell differentiation influences EPEC pathogenicity, we examined the infection of human intestinal epithelial cells by JPN 15 (pMAR7) [EAF\u002B eae\u002B] EPEC strain as a function of the cell differentiation. The human embryonic intestinal INT407 cells, the human colonic T84 cells, the human undifferentiated HT-29 cells (HT-29 Std) and two enterocytic cell lines, HT-29 glc\u2212/\u002B and Caco-2 cells, were used as cellular models. Cells were infected apically with the EPEC strain and the cell-association and cell-entry were examined by quantitative determination using metabolically radiolabeled bacteria, as well as by light, scanning and tranmission electron microscopy. [EAF\u002B eae\u002B] EPEC bacteria efficiently colonized the cultured human intestinal cells. Diffuse bacterial adhesion occurred to undifferentiated HT-29 Std and INT407 cells, whereas characteristic EPEC cell clusters were observed on fully differentiated enterocytic HT-29 glc\u2212/\u002B cells and on colonic crypt T84 cells. As shown using the Caco-2 cell line, which spontaneously differentiates in culture, the formation of EPEC clusters increased as a function of the epithelial cell differentiation. In contrast, efficient cell-entry of [EAF\u002B eae\u002B] EPEC bacteria occured in recently differentiated Caco-2 cells and decreased when the cells were fully differentiated. Our results provide evidence that the intestinal cell differentiation could play a dual role in EPEC pathogenesis: it up-regulates intestinal cell colonization and down-regulates intestinal cell invasion.","publish_time":"1995-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gabastou, Jean Marc; Kern\u00E9is, Sophie; Bernet-Camard, Marie Fran\u00E7oise; Barbat, Alain; Coconnier, Marie H\u00E9l\u00E8ne; Kaper, James B.; Servin, Alain L.","journal":"Differentiation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab863094215663acc79e39ae55484ccca05b0a63.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0301468109607982; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301468109607982","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JPN","EPEC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["intestinal cell differentiation","intestinal cell colonization","intestinal cell invasion","cultured human intestinal cells","eucaryotic cells","cell-association","infection of human intestinal epithelial cells","characteristic EPEC cell clusters","intestinal epithelial cell differentiation influences EPEC pathogenicity","human embryonic intestinal INT407 cells","EPEC bacteria","human colonic T84 cells","EPEC strain","EPEC pathogenesis","efficient cell-entry","enterocytic cell lines","colonic crypt T84 cells","human undifferentiated HT","formation of EPEC clusters","differentiated enterocytic HT","epithelial membrane","EAF","eae","differentiated Caco","Human enteropathogenic Escherichia coli","Std","process of pathogenicity","radiolabeled bacteria","evidence","function","glc","dual role","microbial pathogenesis","infecting enterocytes","brush border membrane-associated components","active partners","JPN","enterovirulent microorganisms","pMAR7","Abstract Pathogens","quantitative determination","Recent reports","receptors","light","Diffuse bacterial adhesion","tranmission electron microscopy","contrast","results","cellular models","access"],"language":"en"},

It helped to create a new vision of what is possible in the global effort against communicable diseases and has been instrumental in shaping the changing environments of development assistance, poverty reduction and other trends to reduce the impact of infectious and parasitic diseases.","publish_time":"2007-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kunii, Osamu","journal":"Trends in Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa80e80c209065e1ca070fe2adf7ade9291d1875.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106473.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1471492206003126; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471492206003126","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IDI"],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["parasitic diseases","Okinawa Infectious Diseases Initiative","communicable diseases","IDI","impact of infectious","unique initiative","Okinawa Group","changing environments of development assistance","poverty reduction","philosophical basis","inter-sectoral approaches","collaboration","coordination","trends","fight","Japan","financial commitments","stakeholders","measures","tailored interventions","summit","global effort","year period","developing countries","health","Kyushu","new vision","sectors","partnerships","expectations","years"],"language":"en"},

Methods For this observational, retrospective and cross-sectional study, information was obtained from the Hospitals and the Ministry of Health for the cases that were laboratory-diagnosed and related, during March 2020. rRT-PCR was used for the detection of the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 following the protocol Charit\u00E9, Berlin, Germany, from nasopharyngeal swabs. Results Among 152 suspected cases investigated, 12 (7.9%) were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infected by rRT-PCR. The median age was 39 years (IQR 25\u201343), six of them male. Two cases proceed from Italy and three from Spain. Nine patients presented fever, and cough, five sore throat, and myalgia, among other symptoms. Only a 60 y-old woman with hypertension was hospitalized. None of the patients required ICU nor fatalities occurred in this group. Conclusions This is the first report of surveillance of COVID-19 in Bolivia, with patients managed mainly with home isolation.

We aimed to determine the contribution of common pathogens to pneumonia adjusting for rates of asymptomatic detection to inform future diagnosis, treatment and preventive strategies. METHODS: A case\u2013control study was conducted among children \u003C18 years in Perth, Western Australia. Cases were children hospitalised with radiologically confirmed pneumonia; controls were healthy children identified from outpatient and local immunisation clinics. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and tested for 14 respiratory viruses and 6 bacterial species by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). For each pathogen, adjusted odds ratio (aOR; 95% CI) was calculated using multivariate logistic regression and population-attributable fraction (95% CI) for pneumonia was estimated. RESULTS: From May 2015 to October 2017, 230 cases and 230 controls were enrolled. At least one respiratory virus was identified in 57% of cases and 29% of controls (aOR: 4.7; 95% CI: 2.8 to 7.8). At least one bacterial species was detected in 72% of cases and 80% of controls (aOR: 0.7; 95% CI: 0.4 to 1.2). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) detection was most strongly associated with pneumonia (aOR: 58.4; 95% CI: 15.6 to 217.5). Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the only bacteria associated with pneumonia (aOR: 14.5; 95% CI: 2.2 to 94.8). We estimated that RSV, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), influenza, adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were responsible for 20.2% (95% CI: 14.6 to 25.5), 9.8% (5.6% to 13.7%), 6.2% (2.5% to 9.7%), 4% (1.1% to 7.1%) and 7.2% (3.5% to 10.8%) of hospitalisations for childhood pneumonia, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses, particularly RSV and HMPV, are major contributors to pneumonia in Australian children.","publish_time":"2018-10-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bhuiyan, Mejbah Uddin; Snelling, Thomas L; West, Rachel; Lang, Jurissa; Rahman, Tasmina; Granland, Caitlyn; de Gier, Camilla; Borland, Meredith L; Thornton, Ruth B; Kirkham, Lea-Ann S; Sikazwe, Chisha; Martin, Andrew C; Richmond, Peter C; Smith, David W; Jaffe, Adam; Blyth, Christopher C","journal":"Thorax","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b530a3db1f7e6d6f289cd4fa3df8a782dcb691ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6467248.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2018-212096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30337417/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs4MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Perth","Western Australia"],"keyphrases":["childhood pneumonia","confirmed pneumonia","pneumonia difficult","aOR","respiratory viruses","Respiratory pathogens","controls","Cases","Australian children","RSV","upper respiratory tract of healthy children","Respiratory syncytial virus","HMPV","bacterial species","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","contribution of common pathogens","rates of asymptomatic detection","future diagnosis","influenza","outpatient","major contributors","multivariate logistic regression","population-attributable fraction","Polymerase chain reaction","treatment","adenovirus","adjusted odds ratio","preventive strategies","PCR","local immunisation clinics","control study","years","Perth","human metapneumovirus","METHODS","Western Australia","INTRODUCTION","CONCLUSIONS","hospitalisations","Nasopharyngeal swabs","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Aptamers are short single-stranded RNA or DNA oligonucleotides capable of folding into complex 3D structures, enabling them to bind to a large variety of targets ranging from small ions to an entire organism. Their high binding specificity and affinity make them comparable to antibodies, but they are superior regarding a longer shelf life, simple production and chemical modification, in addition to low toxicity and immunogenicity. In the past three decades, aptamers have been used in a plethora of therapeutics and drug delivery systems that involve innovative delivery mechanisms and carrying various types of drug cargos. However, the successful translation of aptamer research from bench to bedside has been challenged by several limitations that slow down the realization of promising aptamer applications as therapeutics at the clinical level. The main limitations include the susceptibility to degradation by nucleases, fast renal clearance, low thermal stability, and the limited functional group diversity. The solution to overcome such limitations lies in the chemistry of aptamers. The current review will focus on the recent arts of aptamer chemistry that have been evolved to refine the pharmacological properties of aptamers. Moreover, this review will analyze the advantages and disadvantages of such chemical modifications and how they impact the pharmacological properties of aptamers. Finally, this review will summarize the conjugation strategies of aptamers to nanocarriers for developing targeted drug delivery systems.","publish_time":"2019-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Odeh, Fadwa; Nsairat, Hamdi; Alshaer, Walhan; Ismail, Mohammad A.; Esawi, Ezaldeen; Qaqish, Baraa; Bawab, Abeer Al; Ismail, Said I.","journal":"Molecules","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aefeb0e9f2d0db1868113232cdb87597e7614068.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6982925.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25010003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31861277/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs4Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chemistry of aptamers","pharmacological properties of aptamers","conjugation strategies of aptamers","targeted drug delivery systems","antibodies","main limitations","current review","various types of drug cargos","realization of promising aptamer applications","recent arts of aptamer chemistry","innovative delivery mechanisms","low toxicity","plethora of therapeutics","chemical modifications","successful translation of aptamer research","therapeutic applications","low thermal stability","fast renal clearance","degradation","nanocarriers","simple production","DNA oligonucleotides capable","short single-stranded RNA","longer shelf life","nucleases","addition","small ions","affinity","bench","susceptibility","diagnostic","limited functional group diversity","new class of biological ligands","disadvantages","bedside","high binding specificity","large variety of targets","clinical level","entire organism","immunogenicity","D structures","decades","solution"],"language":"en"},

The identification of these factors is critical in the efforts to predict and lessen viral disease burden. Because viral infection is able to spread to humans from the environment, animals, and other humans, the One-Health framework can be used to investigate the critical pathways through which viruses are transported and transmitted. A holistic approach, incorporating publicly available clinical data for human, livestock, and wildlife disease occurrence, together with environmental data reported in federal and state databases such as parameters related to land use, environmental quality, and weather, can enhance the understanding of variations in disease patterns, leading to the design and implementation of surveillance systems. An example analysis approach is presented for Michigan, United States, which is a state with large urban centers as well as a sizeable rural and agricultural population. Analysis of publicly available data from 2017 indicates that gastrointestinal (GI) and influenza-associated illnesses in Michigan may have been related with agricultural land use to a higher extent than with developed land use during that year. Meanwhile, hepatitis A virus appears to be most closely related with developed land use in dense population areas. GI illnesses may be related to precipitation, and this relationship is strongest in the springtime, although GI illnesses are most common in the winter months. Integration of human-related clinical data, animal disease data, and environmental data can ultimately be used for prioritization of the most critical locations and times for viral outbreaks in both urban and rural environments.","publish_time":"2019-10-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u0027Brien, Evan; Xagoraraki, Irene","journal":"One Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e8fa242b79e0687b11c09dc305227edce302d7d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/48aa9e790830499b8f0a8fd335d3e496b5127626.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6831848.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31709295/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2019.100105; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352771419300588; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771419300588","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs4OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Michigan","United States"],"keyphrases":["environmental data","related clinical data","available data","animal disease data","available clinical data","developed land use","agricultural land use","viral disease burden","GI illnesses","disease patterns","viral outbreaks","Viral diseases","viral infection","wildlife disease occurrence","environmental quality","Michigan","humans","agricultural population","critical locations","critical pathways","factors","influenza-associated illnesses","example analysis approach","state databases","Integration of human","rural environments","holistic approach","dense population areas","large urban centers","livestock","higher extent","parameters","design","times","temporal variation","precipitation","springtime","weather","efforts","understanding of variations","United States","implementation of surveillance systems","relationship","animals","prioritization","year","winter months","Health framework","viruses","identification","hepatitis"],"language":"en"},

Multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) by the Luminex xTAG\u00AE Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) detected 16 (100%) of the positive specimens, RVP of 24-h culture supernatant detected 8 (50%), direct fluorescent antibody testing detected 4 (25%), rapid culture detected 2 (12.5%), and rapid antigen testing detected none. For a comparison group, RVP was performed on NP swabs from 20 outpatient children with RTI. The mean fluorescence intensity by RVP was significantly lower for positive adult patients than pediatric patients (P = 0.0373).

However, various IBV QX-like virus strains have become increasingly prevalent in Korea. We conducted comparative genomic analyses of seven QX-like viruses: early viruses (n = 2), new cluster 1 (NC1; recombinants of KM91 and the early QX-like viruses, n = 3) and recurrent viruses (n = 2), to understand their genomic backgrounds. The early and NC1 viruses had KM91-like backgrounds, but the recurrent viruses had QX-like genomic backgrounds. The absence of pure QX-like viruses before the appearance of the early viruses suggests that the viruses were introduced from other countries after recombination, but the NC1 viruses originated in Korea. The recent prevalence of recurrent viruses with different genomic backgrounds and spike genes from the early and the NC1 viruses may indicate the repeated introduction of different infectious bronchitis viruses from other countries and their successful evasion of vaccine immunity in the field. Furthermore, a 1ab gene-based phylogenetic analysis revealed three distinct lineages: North America-Europe, China/Taiwan, and China. KM91 and the early and NC1 viruses were included in the North America-Europe lineage, and the recurrent QX-like viruses were included in the China lineage. The phylogenetic positions of KM91-like 1ab and QX-like spike suggest frequent recombination between the North America-Europe and China lineages. Additional studies on the patterns of recombination, including donor-acceptor relationships, geographical sites, and non-poultry hosts, may be valuable for understanding the evolution of IBVs.

However, the extent of PV infections in bats remains largely unknown. This work represents the first comprehensive study of PVs in Iberian bats. We identified four novel PVs in the mucosa of free-ranging Eptesicus serotinus (EserPV1, EserPV2, and EserPV3) and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (RferPV1) individuals and analyzed their phylogenetic relationships within the viral family. We further assessed their prevalence in different populations of E. serotinus and its close relative E. isabellinus. Although it is frequent to read that PVs co-evolve with their host, that PVs are highly species-specific, and that PVs do not usually recombine, our results suggest otherwise. First, strict virus\u2013host co-evolution is rejected by the existence of five, distantly related bat PV lineages and by the lack of congruence between bats and bat PVs phylogenies. Second, the ability of EserPV2 and EserPV3 to infect two different bat species (E. serotinus and E. isabellinus) argues against strict host specificity. Finally, the description of a second noncoding region in the RferPV1 genome reinforces the view of an increased susceptibility to recombination in the E2-L2 genomic region.

Mice were infected with an antibody escape variant which produces a nonlethal encephalomyelitis and compared to a clonal virus population which produces a fulminant fatal encephalomyelitis. Infection with both viruses induced the accumulation of mRNAs associated with Th1- and Th2-type cytokines, including IFN-\u03B3, IL-4, and IL-10. Peak mRNA accumulations were coincident with the clearance of virus and there was no obvious differences between lethally and nonlethally infected mice. TNF-\u03B1 mRNA was induced more rapidly in lethally infected mice compared to mice undergoing a nonfatal encephalomyelitis. Rapid transient increases in the mRNAs encoding IL-12, iNOS, IL-1\u03B1, IL-1\u03B2, and IL-6 occurred following infection. Nonlethal infections were associated with increased IL-12, IL-1\u03B2, and earlier expression of IL-6, while lethal infections were associated with increased iNOS and IL-1\u03B1 mRNA. These data suggest a rapid but differential response within the central nervous system cells to infection by different JHMV variants. However, neither the accumulation nor kinetics of induction provide evidence to distinguish lethal infections from nonlethal infections leading to a persistent infection. Accumulation of both Th1 and Th2 cytokines in the central nervous system of JHMV-infected mice is consistent with the participation of both cytokines and cell immune effectors during resolution of acute viral-induced encephalomyelitis.","publish_time":"1997-07-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parra, Beatriz; Hinton, David R.; Lin, Mark T.; Cua, Daniel J.; Stohlman, Stephen A.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e2b7785cc0f1b2f6206ad58e19fe7d178a838f4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004268229798613X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004268229798613X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs0ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rapid"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["increased IL","infected mice","earlier expression of IL","persistent infection","following infection","Nonlethal infections","nonlethal encephalomyelitis","persistent viral infection","Th2 cytokines","central nervous system of JHMV","TNF-\u03B1 mRNA","central nervous system cells","clearance of virus","accumulation of mRNAs","nonfatal encephalomyelitis","Th2-type cytokines","kinetics of cytokine mRNA expression","resolution of acute viral-induced encephalomyelitis","reduction of infectious virus","clonal virus population","increased iNOS","Th1","fulminant fatal encephalomyelitis","Peak mRNA accumulations","neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus","kinetics of induction","different JHMV variants","Rapid transient increases","differential response","cell immune effectors","participation","evidence","IFN-\u03B3","antibody escape variant","obvious differences","data","potential role","viruses"],"language":"en"},

The onset of apoptosis was directly proportional to the virus multiplicity of infection. Transient expression experiments showed a direct link between astrovirus ORF1a encoded proteins and apoptosis induction. A computer analysis of the astrovirus genome revealed the presence of a death domain in the nonstructural protein p38 of unknown function, encoded in ORF1a. Apoptosis inhibition experiments suggested the involvement of caspase 8 in the apoptotic response, and led to a reduction in the infectivity of the virus progeny released to the supernatant.

One Health offers the opportunity to acknowledge shared interests, set common goals, and drive toward team work to benefit the overall health of a nation. As in most countries, the health of Rwanda\u0027s people and economy are highly dependent on the health of the environment. Recently, Rwanda has developed a One Health strategic plan to meet its human, animal and environmental health challenges. This approach drives innovations that are important to solve both acute and chronic health problems and offers synergy across systems, resulting in improved communication, evidence-based solutions, development of a new generation of systems-thinkers, improved surveillance, decreased lag time in response, and improved health and economic savings. Several factors have enabled the One Health movement in Rwanda including an elaborate network of community health workers, existing rapid response teams, international academic partnerships willing to look more broadly than at a single disease or population, and relative equity between female and male health professionals. Barriers to implementing this strategy include competition over budget, poor communication, and the need for improved technology.

In some patients, endothelial cell and platelet dysfunction lead to life-threatening hemorrhagic dengue fever or dengue shock syndrome. Prognostication of disease severity is urgently required to improve patient management. The pathogenesis of severe dengue has not been fully elucidated, and the role of host proteins associated with viral particles has received little exploration. METHODS: The proteomes of virion-enriched fractions purified from plasma pools of patients with dengue fever or severe dengue were compared. Virions were purified by ultracentrifugation combined with a water-insoluble polyelectrolyte-based technique. Following in-gel hydrolysis, peptides were analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography coupled to ion trap mass spectrometry and identified using data libraries. RESULTS: Both dengue fever and severe dengue viral-enriched fractions contained identifiable viral envelope proteins and host cellular proteins. Canonical pathway analysis revealed the identified host proteins are mainly involved in the coagulation cascade, complement pathway or acute phase response signaling pathway. Some host proteins were over- or under-represented in plasma from patients with severe dengue compared to patients with dengue fever. ELISAs were used to validate differential expression of a selection of identified host proteins in individual plasma samples of patients with dengue fever compared to patients with severe dengue. Among 22 host proteins tested, two could differentiate between dengue fever and severe dengue in two independent cohorts (olfactomedin-4: area under the curve (AUC), 0.958; and platelet factor-4: AUC, 0.836). CONCLUSION: A novel technique of virion-enrichment from plasma has allowed to identify two host proteins that have prognostic value for classifying patients with acute dengue who are more likely to develop a severe dengue. The impact of these host proteins on pathogenicity and disease outcome are discussed.

Antigenically similar to their virulent counterparts are FCoV biotypes designated feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), which usually cause only mild enteritis and are unable to efficiently infect macrophages and monocytes. The FCoV spike protein mediates viral entry into the host cell and has previously been shown to determine the distinct tropism exhibited by certain isolates of FIPV and FECV, however the molecular mechanism underlying viral pathogenesis has yet to be determined. Here we show that the FECV strain WSU 79-1683 (FECV-1683) is highly dependent on host cell cathepsin B and cathepsin L activity for entry into the host cell, as well as on the low pH of endocytic compartments. In addition, both cathepsin B and cathepsin L are able to induce a specific cleavage event in the FECV-1683 spike protein. In contrast, host cell entry by the FIPV strains WSU 79-1146 (FIPV-1146) and FIPV-DF2 proceeds independently of cathepsin L activity and low pH, but is still highly dependent on cathepsin B activity. In the case of FIPV-1146 and FIPV-DF2, infection of primary feline monocytes was also dependent on host cell cathepsin B activity, indicating that host cell cathepsins may play a role in the distinct tropisms displayed by different feline coronavirus biotypes.","publish_time":"2008-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Regan, Andrew D.; Shraybman, Renata; Cohen, Rebecca D.; Whittaker, Gary R.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1bcfd5b202aad0aa650233d42247cf8c63864c67.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4fe01fd2901e3e88264b21d17e78c1589d28e07e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2588466.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113508001971; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18606506/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113508001971; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.05.019","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs1ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIPV","WSU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host cell cathepsin B activity","host cell entry","host cell cathepsins","case of FIPV","FCoV biotypes","feline enteric coronavirus","FIPV-DF2 proceeds","FIPV strains WSU","different feline coronavirus biotypes","infection of primary feline monocytes","certain isolates of FIPV","feline infectious peritonitis virus","FECV strain WSU","FCoV spike protein","viral entry","macrophages","systemic infection","distinct tropisms","viral pathogenesis","low pH of endocytic compartments","virulent counterparts","role","terminal disease of cats","molecular mechanism","specific cleavage event","contrast","addition","mild enteritis","ability"],"language":"en"},

Mutations in recombination-activating gene 1 (RAG1) and RAG2 result in loss or reduction of V(D)J recombination. It is known that different mutations in RAG genes vary in residual recombinase activity and give rise to a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes. Objective We sought to study the immunologic mechanisms causing the clinical spectrum of RAG deficiency. Methods We included 22 patients with similar RAG1 mutations (c.519delT or c.368_369delAA) resulting in N-terminal truncated RAG1 protein with residual recombination activity but presenting with different clinical phenotypes. We studied precursor B-cell development, immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor repertoire formation, receptor editing, and B- and T-cell numbers. Results Clinically, patients were divided into 3 main categories: T\u2212B\u2212 severe combined immunodeficiency, Omenn syndrome, and combined immunodeficiency. All patients showed a block in the precursor B-cell development, low B- and T-cell numbers, normal immunoglobulin gene use, limited B- and T-cell repertoires, and slightly impaired receptor editing. Conclusion This study demonstrates that similar RAG mutations can result in similar immunobiological effects but different clinical phenotypes, indicating that the level of residual recombinase activity is not the only determinant for clinical outcome. We postulate a model in which the type and moment of antigenic pressure affect the clinical phenotypes of these patients.","publish_time":"2014-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"IJspeert, Hanna; Driessen, Gertjan J.; Moorhouse, Michael J.; Hartwig, Nico G.; Wolska-Kusnierz, Beata; Kalwak, Krzysztof; Pituch-Noworolska, Anna; Kondratenko, Irina; van Montfrans, Joris M.; Mejstrikova, Ester; Lankester, Arjan C.; Langerak, Anton W.; van Gent, Dik C.; Stubbs, Andrew P.; van Dongen, Jacques J.M.; van der Burg, Mirjam","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a7b98ca2d4cb4effc7d5b69c70ff8cb0c34f652.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112318.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674913018484; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24418478/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2013.11.028; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674913018484","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Background V(D)J"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["B-cell receptors","T-cell numbers","precursor B-cell development","T-cell repertoires","different clinical phenotypes","limited B","low B","patients","T-cell receptor repertoire formation","different mutations","clinical outcome","residual recombination activity","similar RAG1 mutations","similar RAG mutations","broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes","large repertoire of T","J recombination","clinical spectrum of RAG deficiency","level of residual recombinase activity","lymphocyte development","RAG genes","impaired receptor editing","study","similar immunobiological effects","severe combined immunodeficiency","normal immunoglobulin gene use","reduction of V","Background V","RAG2 result","N-terminal truncated RAG1 protein","Omenn syndrome","loss","rise","moment of antigenic pressure","place","main categories","immunologic mechanisms","determinant","delT","block","delAA","Conclusion","model","Methods","Objective","Results"],"language":"en"},

EID surveillance systems seek to rapidly identify EID outbreaks to contain spread and improve public health outcomes. Sequencing data has historically not been integrated into real\u2010time responses, but portable DNA sequencing technology has prompted optimism among epidemiologists. Specifically, attention has focused on the goal of a \u201Csequencing singularity\u201D: the integration of portable sequencers in a worldwide event\u2010based surveillance network with other digital data (Gardy \u0026 Loman, Nature Reviews Genetics, 19, 2018, p. 9). The sequencing singularity vision is a powerful socio\u2010technical imaginary, shaping the discourse around the future of portable sequencing. Ethical and practical issues are bound by the vision in two ways: they are framed only as obstacles, and they are formulated only at the scales made visible by its implicit geography. This geography privileges two extremes of scale \u2013 the genomic and the global \u2013 and leaves intermediate scales comparatively unmapped. We explore how widespread portable sequencing could challenge this geography. Portable sequencers put the ability to produce genomic data in the hands of the individual. The explicit assertion of rights over data may therefore become a matter disputed more at an interpersonal scale than an international one. Portable sequencers also promise ubiquitous, indiscriminate sequencing of the total metagenomic content of samples, raising the question of what (or who) is under surveillance and inviting consideration of the human microbiome and more\u2010than\u2010human geographies. We call into question a conception of a globally integrated stream of sequencing data as composed mostly of \u201Cnoise,\u201D within which signals of pathogen \u201Cemergence\u201D are \u201Chidden,\u201D considering it instead from the perspective of recent work into more\u2010than\u2010human geographies.

The last two decades have already faced severe manifestations of the coronavirus infection in both humans and animals, thus, circulating epitopes from previous outbreaks might confer partial protection from SARS-CoV-2 infections. In the present study, we provide an in-silico survey of the major nucleocapsid protein epitopes and compare them with the homologues of taxonomically-related coronaviruses with tropism for animal species that are closely inter-related with the human beings population all over the world. Protein sequence alignment provides evidence of high sequence homology for some of the investigated proteins. Moreover, structural epitope mapping by homology modelling revealed a potential immunogenic value also for specific sequences scoring a lower identity with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid proteins. These evidence provide a molecular structural rationale for a potential role in conferring protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection and identifying potential candidates for the development of diagnostic tools and prophylactic-oriented strategies.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tilocca, Bruno; Soggiu, Alessio; Sanguinetti, Maurizio; Musella, Vincenzo; Britti, Domenico; Bonizzi, Luigi; Urbani, Andrea; Roncada, Paola","journal":"Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e71570b2b33c94a7a357347f0c248f21e2518f82.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156246.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302675/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1286457920300538; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457920300538; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2020.04.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","potential role","potential candidates","animals","nucleocapsid proteins","humans","evidence of high sequence homology","major nucleocapsid protein epitopes","potential immunogenic value","Protein sequence alignment","homology modelling","related coronaviruses","partial protection","conferring protection","coronavirus infection","investigated proteins","molecular structural rationale","structural epitope mapping","specific sequences","development of diagnostic tools","animal species","human beings population","lower identity","silico survey","previous outbreaks","prophylactic-oriented strategies","multitude of facets","target","severe manifestations","tropism","biology","Health concept","pandemic COVID","world","pathogenetic mechanisms","studies","homologues","better understanding","suitable containment measures","research lines","decades","infections","present study"],"language":"en"},

In 2009/10, researchers discovered RNA of two novel influenza virus subtypes \u2013 H17N10 and H18N11 \u2013 in Central and South American fruit bats. The identification of bats as possible additional reservoir for influenza A viruses raises questions about the role of this mammalian taxon in influenza A virus ecology and possible public health relevance. As molecular testing can be limited by a short time window in which the virus is present, serological testing provides information about past infections and virus spread in populations after the virus has been cleared. This study aimed at screening available sera from 100 free-ranging, frugivorous bats (Eidolon helvum) sampled in 2009/10 in Ghana, for the presence of antibodies against the complete panel of influenza A haemagglutinin (HA) types ranging from H1 to H18 by means of a protein microarray platform. This technique enables simultaneous serological testing against multiple recombinant HA-types in 5\u03BCl of serum. Preliminary results indicate serological evidence against avian influenza subtype H9 in about 30% of the animals screened, with low-level cross-reactivity to phylogenetically closely related subtypes H8 and H12. To our knowledge, this is the first report of serological evidence of influenza A viruses other than H17 and H18 in bats. As avian influenza subtype H9 is associated with human infections, the implications of our findings from a public health context remain to be investigated.","publish_time":"2015-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Freidl, Gudrun Stephanie; Binger, Tabea; M\u00FCller, Marcel Alexander; de Bruin, Erwin; van Beek, Janko; Corman, Victor Max; Rasche, Andrea; Drexler, Jan Felix; Sylverken, Augustina; Oppong, Samuel K.; Adu-Sarkodie, Yaw; Tschapka, Marco; Cottontail, Veronika M.; Drosten, Christian; Koopmans, Marion","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc89cc67ce1d4e381a17de2c92a9b882f264197d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4429104.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25965069/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0127035","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs3MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel influenza virus subtypes","report of serological evidence of influenza","avian influenza subtype H9","virus ecology","complete panel of influenza","frugivorous bats","identification of bats","simultaneous serological testing","South American fruit bats","molecular testing","possible public health relevance","range of zoonotic viruses","public health context","multiple recombinant HA-types","past infections","human infections","possible additional reservoir","related subtypes H8","H18N11","H17N10","information","mammalian taxon","Marburg","likely natural hosts","findings","role","questions","haemagglutinin","RNA","presence of antibodies","Preliminary results","screening available sera","low-level cross-reactivity","Ebola","implications","technique","populations","short time window","Eidolon helvum","study","Rabies","Ghana","H12","\u03BCl of serum","researchers","protein microarray platform","various Corona","Paramyxoviruses","animals","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

Methods We retrospectively report on 1061 SARS-CoV-2 positive tested patients treated with HCQ (200 mg three times daily for ten days) \u002B AZ (500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg daily for the next four days) for at least three days. Outcomes were death, clinical worsening (transfer to ICU, and \u003E10 day hospitalization) and viral shedding persistence (\u003E10 days). Results A total of 1061 patients were included in this analysis (46.4% male, mean age 43.6 years \u2013 range 14\u201395 years). Good clinical outcome and virological cure were obtained in 973 patients within 10 days (91.7%). Prolonged viral carriage was observed in 47 patients (4.4%) and was associated to a higher viral load at diagnosis (p \u003C .001) but viral culture was negative at day 10. All but one, were PCR-cleared at day 15. A poor clinical outcome (PClinO) was observed for 46 patients (4.3%) and 8 died (0.75%) (74\u201395 years old). All deaths resulted from respiratory failure and not from cardiac toxicity. Five patients are still hospitalized (98.7% of patients cured so far). PClinO was associated with older age (OR 1.11), severity at admission (OR 10.05) and low HCQ serum concentration. PClinO was independently associated with the use of selective beta-blocking agents and angiotensin II receptor blockers (p \u003C .05). A total of 2.3% of patients reported mild adverse events (gastrointestinal or skin symptoms, headache, insomnia and transient blurred vision).

The novelty of C/OK virus prompted us to investigate whether C/OK virus could exist in a nonswine species. Significantly, we found that C/OK virus was widespread in U.S. bovine herds, as demonstrated by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and serological assays. Genome sequencing of three bovine viruses isolated from two herds in different states further confirmed these findings. To determine whether swine/bovine C/OK viruses can undergo reassortment with human ICV, and to clarify the taxonomic status of C/OK, in vitro reassortment and serological typing by agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) were conducted. In vitro reassortment using two human ICV and two swine and bovine C/OK viruses demonstrated that human ICV and C/OK viruses were unable to reassort and produce viable progeny. Antigenically, no cross-recognition of detergent split virions was observed in AGID between human and nonhuman viruses by using polyclonal antibodies that were reactive to cognate antigens. Taken together, these results demonstrate that C/OK virus is genetically and antigenically distinct from ICV. The classification of the new virus in a separate genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family is proposed. The finding of C/OK virus in swine and bovine indicates that this new virus may spread and establish infection in other mammals, including humans.","publish_time":"2014-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hause, Ben M.; Collin, Emily A.; Liu, Runxia; Huang, Bing; Sheng, Zizhang; Lu, Wuxun; Wang, Dan; Nelson, Eric A.; Li, Feng","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc6489e42c4a336fd64bd4b82639037087aa60fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3958797.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00031-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24595369/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs3NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICV"],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["bovine C","OK viruses","designated C","novelty of C","finding of C","human influenza C viruses","bovine viruses","new virus","human ICV","novel virus","taxonomic status of C","Deep RNA sequencing of C","nonhuman viruses","bovine herds","reassortment","AGID","Oklahoma","serological typing","serological assays","Genome sequencing","polyclonal antibodies","matrix","agar gel immunodiffusion","detergent split virions","PCR","M1","separate genus","overall homology","reverse transcription","cross-recognition","protein expression strategy","infection","cognate antigens","different states","Orthomyxoviridae family","results","nonswine species","mammals","humans","findings","viable progeny","isolation","pig","classification"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: To describe a Pseudomonas fluorescens (Pf)-contaminated feline packed RBC (pRBC) unit and experimentally investigate Pf-contaminated canine pRBCs. METHODS: Canine pRBCs were inoculated with Pf-rich pRBCs from the sentinel feline unit and stored at 4\u00B0C or 20\u00B0C for 72 hours. Aliquots from the pRBCs were serially evaluated by microscopy, culture, and a eubacterial 16S rRNA real-time PCR assay. RESULTS: One Pf-contaminated feline unit turned black after 22 days of storage and was removed from the blood bank; a source was not found, and no other contaminated units were identified. Canine pRBCs spiked with 5 or 25 \u03BCL of the sentinel unit became culture- and/or 16S PCR-positive at \u22658 hours at 20\u00B0C and 48 hours at 4\u00B0C and developed a color change at \u226524 hours. Sensitivity studies indicated that without incubation, inoculation of \u2265100 \u03BCL Pf-rich pRBCs was necessary for a positive 16S PCR test result. CONCLUSIONS: P. fluorescens grows in stored pRBCs slowly at 4\u00B0C and rapidly at 20\u00B0C. Screening of blood products for color change, estimating bacterial concentration with microscopy, and 16S PCR testing are simple and fast ways to detect bacteria in stored blood. Aseptic collection, temperature-controlled storage, and regular visual monitoring of stored units is recommended. Discolored units should not be transfused, but examined for bacterial contamination or other blood product quality problems.","publish_time":"2010-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kessler, Rebecca J.; Rankin, Shelley; Young, Sheri; O\u2019Shea, Kathleen; Calabrese, Maria; Guldin, Amy; Lipson, Nicole; Oakley, Donna A.; Giger, Urs","journal":"Veterinary Clinical Pathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9acfc4188f2d4aa320d9a6ccda3dee8242ac98b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8102c5c187044019fc78ab62bacf7aa6f88e14d2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3111970.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3111970?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1939-165x.2009.00190.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19843300/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs3NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stored pRBCs","stored blood","Pf-contaminated canine pRBCs","Pf-contaminated feline unit","\u03BCL Pf-rich pRBCs","hours","contaminated units","S PCR-positive","Screening of blood products","bacterial contamination of blood products","S PCR testing","sentinel feline unit","sentinel unit","veterinary blood banking","S PCR test result","contaminated feline packed RBC","blood product quality problems","S rRNA real-time PCR assay","bacterial concentration","color change","microscopy","regular visual monitoring of stored units","culture","Discolored units","human medicine","days of storage","screening programs","temperature-controlled storage","donors","fast ways","risk of infectious disease transmission","major complication","incubation","Aseptic collection","inoculation","Pseudomonas","RESULTS","Sensitivity studies","BACKGROUND","source","METHODS","OBJECTIVES","CONCLUSIONS","Aliquots"],"language":"en"},

The analysis of the S1 gene has been used to determine IBV genotype. The aim of this study was genotyping of IBVs circulating among the Iranian broiler flocks in the period between 2015 to 2017. Trachea samples from 278 broiler flocks were collected from broiler farms in eight provinces of Iran. After Real-time RT-PCR, IBV-positive samples were further characterized based on S1 gene. The results of the Real-time RT-PCR showed that 52.16% of flocks were IBV positive. Four genotypes were detected and the frequency of occurrence rates of IS-1494-like, 793/B, QX and Massachusetts IBV genotypes were 70.34%, 19.31%, 7.58% and 2.75%, respectively. Sequence analysis revealed that nucleotide identities within IS-1494-like group ranged between 98.86\u2013100%, while each of the QX, Massachusetts and 793/B groups were 98.05\u2013100%, 98.20\u2013100% and 93.29\u2013100% respectively. These results show that the IS-1494-like IBV is the dominant IBV genotype in Iran. Proper control strategies are essential to overcoming the high frequency of occurrence of IS-1494-like IBV. The phylogenetic relationship of the strains with respect to different sequences and geographical regions displayed complexity and diversity.

Coyotes also are monestrous, and both sexes are fertile only in winter; thus, they depend upon social and physiologic synchrony for successful reproduction. To investigate the mutability of seasonal reproduction in coyotes, we attempted to evoke an out-of-season estrus in October using one of two short-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agents: (1) a GnRH analogue, deslorelin (6-d-tryptophan-9-(N-ethyl-l-prolinamide)-10-deglycinamide), 2.1mg pellet sc; or (2) gonadorelin, a GnRH (5-oxoPro-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg-Pro-GlyNH2) porcine hypothalamic extract, 2.0\u03BCg/kg im once daily for 3 consecutive days. A transient increase in serum concentrations of estradiol and progesterone (1 and 2 wk, respectively) was detected after treatment with deslorelin but not gonadorelin. Also, socio-sexual behaviors reminiscent of winter mating (including courtship, mate-guarding, precoital mounts, and copulatory ties) were observed among the deslorelin group. During the subsequent breeding season (January and February), however, preovulatory courtship behavior and olfactory sampling appeared suppressed; emergence of mounts and copulations were delayed in both deslorelin and gonadorelin treatment groups. Furthermore, whereas 8 of 12 females treated in October ovulated and produced healthy litters in the spring, 4 na\u00EFve coyotes failed to copulate or become pregnant. Thus, perturbation of hormones prior to ovulation in species with complex mating behaviors may disrupt critical intrapair relationships, even if fertility is not impaired physiologically.","publish_time":"2009-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carlson, D.

Increasingly, transmission models fit to incidence data are used to estimate these parameters and guide policy. Some widely used modelling practices lead to potentially large errors in parameter estimates and, consequently, errors in model-based forecasts. Even more worryingly, in such situations, confidence in parameter estimates and forecasts can itself be far overestimated, leading to the potential for large errors that mask their own presence. Fortunately, straightforward and computationally inexpensive alternatives exist that avoid these problems. Here, we first use a simulation study to demonstrate potential pitfalls of the standard practice of fitting deterministic models to cumulative incidence data. Next, we demonstrate an alternative based on stochastic models fit to raw data from an early phase of 2014 West Africa Ebola virus disease outbreak. We show not only that bias is thereby reduced, but that uncertainty in estimates and forecasts is better quantified and that, critically, lack of model fit is more readily diagnosed. We conclude with a short list of principles to guide the modelling response to future infectious disease outbreaks.","publish_time":"2015-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"King, Aaron A.; Domenech de Cell\u00E8s, Matthieu; Magpantay, Felicia M.

However, no specific vaccines or antiviral drugs are currently available to prevent or treat ZIKV infection. Here we report that a synthetic peptide derived from the stem region of ZIKV envelope protein, designated Z2, potently inhibits infection of ZIKV and other flaviviruses in vitro. We show that Z2 interacts with ZIKV surface protein and disrupts the integrity of the viral membrane. Z2 can penetrate the placental barrier to enter fetal tissues and is safe for use in pregnant mice. Intraperitoneal administration of Z2 inhibits vertical transmission of ZIKV in pregnant C57BL/6 mice and protects type I or type I/II interferon receptor-deficient mice against lethal ZIKV challenge. Thus, Z2 has potential to be further developed as an antiviral treatment against ZIKV infection in high-risk populations, particularly pregnant women.","publish_time":"2017-07-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Yufeng; Deng, Yong-Qiang; Zou, Peng; Wang, Qian; Dai, Yanyan; Yu, Fei; Du, Lanying; Zhang, Na-Na; Tian, Min; Hao, Jia-Nan; Meng, Yu; Li, Yuan; Zhou, Xiaohui; Fuk-Woo Chan, Jasper; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Qin, Cheng-Feng; Jiang, Shibo; Lu, Lu","journal":"Nat Commun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/38cbb822fbce17d5cbd5d12896d8ffa7848e8229.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f582baa8aa4a5f3af8356e86df3d5c29ff426c85.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5537589.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28742068/; https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms15672","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs4ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ZIKV infection","infection of ZIKV","ZIKV surface protein","vertical transmission of ZIKV","lethal ZIKV challenge","pregnant mice","designated Z2","stem region of ZIKV envelope protein","Intraperitoneal administration of Z2","pregnant C57BL","pregnant women","type","interferon receptor-deficient mice","antiviral treatment","antiviral drugs","high-risk populations","fetal tissues","integrity","re-emerging flavivirus","placental barrier","specific vaccines","neurological disorders","synthetic peptide","Zika virus","viral membrane","flaviviruses","countries","territories","potential"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: This retrospective review includes 154 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosed between February 11 and 20, 2020, and 100 patients with other types of viral pneumonia diagnosed between April 2011 and December 2020 from two hospitals. High-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest was performed. Data on location, distribution, attenuation, maximum lesion range, lobe involvement, number of lesions, air bronchogram signs, Hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement, and pleural effusion were collected. Associations between imaging characteristics and COVID-19 pneumonia were analyzed with univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: A peripheral distribution was associated with a 13.04-fold risk of COVID-19 pneumonia, compared with a diffuse distribution. A maximum lesion range \u003E 10 cm was associated with a 9.75-fold risk of COVID-19 pneumonia, compared with a maximum lesion range \u2264 5 cm, and the involvement of 5 lobes was associated with an 8.45-fold risk of COVID-19 pneumonia, compared with a maximum lesion range \u2264 2. No pleural effusion was associated with a 3.58-fold risk of COVID-19 pneumonia compared with the presence of pleural effusion. Hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement was associated with a 2.79-fold risk of COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSION: A peripheral distribution, a lesion range \u003E 10 cm, involvement of 5 lobes, presence of hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement, and no pleural effusion were significantly associated with 2019-novel coronavirus pneumonia.

Rapid detection of the novel H7N9 virus is urgently needed to differentiate the disease from other infections, and to facilitate infection control as well as epidemiologic investigations. In this study, a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification combined with a lateral flow device (RT-LAMP-LFD) assay to rapidly detect H7N9 virus was developed and evaluated. The RT-LAMP primers were designed to target the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of H7N9 virus. Results of 10-fold dilution series assays showed that analysis of RT-LAMP products by the LFD method was as sensitive as real-time turbidity detection, and that the analytic sensitivities of the HA and NA RT-LAMP assays were both 10 copies of synthetic RNA. Furthermore, both the assays showed 100% clinical specificity for identification of H7N9 virus. The performance characteristics of the RT-LAMP-LFD assay were evaluated with 80 clinical specimens collected from suspected H7N9 patients. The NA RT-LAMP-LFD assay was more sensitive than real time RT-PCR assay. Compared with a combination of virus culture and real-time RT-PCR, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the RT-LAMP-LFD assay were all 100%. Overall, The RT-LAMP-LFD assay established in this study can be used as a reliable method for early diagnosis of the avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus infection.","publish_time":"2013-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ge, Yiyue; Wu, Bin; Qi, Xian; Zhao, Kangchen; Guo, Xiling; Zhu, Yefei; Qi, Yuhua; Shi, Zhiyang; Zhou, Minghao; Wang, Hua; Cui, Lunbiao","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f81ae57f3c989bf53683a523da0a1799ebd19862.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3731295.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0069941; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23936359/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs5MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NA"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["RT-LAMP primers","NA RT-LAMP assays","LFD assay","analysis of RT","novel H7N9 virus","genes of H7N9 virus","identification of H7N9 virus","real-time RT-PCR","LAMP products","virus infection","real time RT-PCR assay","LFD method","suspected H7N9 patients","combination of virus culture","clinical specificity","novel avian-origin influenza","study","positive predictive value","negative predictive value","real-time turbidity detection","clinical specimens","fold dilution series assays","reliable method","Rapid detection","infection control","severe disease","sensitivity","isothermal amplification","lateral flow device","early diagnosis","reverse transcription loop","analytic sensitivities","neuraminidase","humans","Results","epidemiologic investigations","haemagglutinin","copies of synthetic RNA","infections","performance characteristics","China","cases","deaths"],"language":"en"},

In July 2009, however, Argentina reported 3056 cases with 137 deaths, representing a CFR of 4.5%. Potential explanations for increased CFR included virus reassortment or genetic drift, or infection of a more vulnerable population. Virus genomic sequencing of 26 Argentinian samples representing both severe and mild disease indicated no evidence of reassortment, mutations associated with resistance to antiviral drugs, or genetic drift that might contribute to virulence. Furthermore, no evidence was found for increased frequency of risk factors for H1N1pdm disease. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined nasopharyngeal swab samples (NPS) from 199 cases of H1N1pdm infection from Argentina with MassTag PCR, testing for 33 additional microbial agents. The study population consisted of 199 H1N1pdm-infected subjects sampled between 23 June and 4 July 2009. Thirty-nine had severe disease defined as death (n = 20) or hospitalization (n = 19); 160 had mild disease. At least one additional agent of potential pathogenic importance was identified in 152 samples (76%), including Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 62); Haemophilus influenzae (n = 104); human respiratory syncytial virus A (n = 11) and B (n = 1); human rhinovirus A (n = 1) and B (n = 4); human coronaviruses 229E (n = 1) and OC43 (n = 2); Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2); Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2); Serratia marcescens (n = 1); and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 35) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA, n = 6). The presence of S. pneumoniae was strongly correlated with severe disease. S. pneumoniae was present in 56.4% of severe cases versus 25% of mild cases; more than one-third of H1N1pdm NPS with S. pneumoniae were from subjects with severe disease (22 of 62 S. pneumoniae-positive NPS, p = 0.0004). In subjects 6 to 55 years of age, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of severe disease in the presence of S. pneumoniae was 125.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.95, 928.72; p\u003C0.0001). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The association of S. pneumoniae with morbidity and mortality is established in the current and previous influenza pandemics. However, this study is the first to demonstrate the prognostic significance of non-invasive antemortem diagnosis of S. pneumoniae infection and may provide insights into clinical management.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Palacios, Gustavo; Hornig, Mady; Cisterna, Daniel; Savji, Nazir; Bussetti, Ana Valeria; Kapoor, Vishal; Hui, Jeffrey; Tokarz, Rafal; Briese, Thomas; Baumeister, Elsa; Lipkin, W.

In April 2009, an elementary school outbreak of pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza was reported in a community in northern British Columbia, Canada-an area that includes both non-Aboriginal and Aboriginal residents living on or off a reserve. During the outbreak investigation, we explored the relationship between prior receipt of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) and pH1N1-related illness. Methods. A telephone survey was conducted from 15 May through 5 June 2009 among households of children attending any school in the affected community. Members of participating households where influenza-like illness (ILI) was described were then invited to submit blood samples for confirmation of pH1N1 infection by hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization assays. Circulation of pH1N1 was concentrated among households of the elementary school and elsewhere on-reserve to which analyses of TIV effect were thus restricted. Odds ratios (ORs) for the TIV effect on ILI were computed through logistic regression, with adjustment for age, comorbidity, household density, and Aboriginal status. The influence of within-household clustering was assessed through generalized-linear-mixed models. Results. Of 408 participants, 92 (23%) met ILI criteria: 29 (32%) of 92 persons with ILI, compared with 61 (19%) 316 persons without ILI, had received the 2008\u20132009 formulation of TIV. Fully adjusted ORs for 2008- 2009 TIV effect on ILI were 2.45 (95% confidence interval, 1.34\u20134.48) by logistic regression and 2.68 [95% confidence interval, 1.37\u20135.25) by generalized-linear-mixed model. Conclusions. An outbreak investigation in British Columbia during the late spring of 2009 provided the first indication of an unexpected association between receipt of TIV and pH1N1 illness. This led to 5 additional studies through the summer 2009 in Canada, each of which corroborated these initial findings.","publish_time":"2010-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Janjua, Naveed Z.; Skowronski, Danuta M.; Hottes, Travis S.; Osei, William; Adams, Evan; Petric, Martin; Sabaiduc, Suzana; Chan, Tracy; Mak, Annie; Lem, Marcus; Tang, Patrick; Patrick, David M.; De Serres, Gaston; Bowering, David","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da70820b39071e92858b5a5db50ae98eb581abe8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107856.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20887210/; https://doi.org/10.1086/656586","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TIV","ILI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TIV effect","receipt of TIV","pH1N1 illness","formulation of TIV","ILI criteria","Circulation of pH1N1","pH1N1-related illness","outbreak investigation","confirmation of pH1N1 infection","elementary school outbreak of pandemic H1N1","Aboriginal residents","Aboriginal status","Canada","households of children","logistic regression","generalized-linear","reserve","confidence interval","persons","northern British Columbia","Members of participating households","linear-mixed model","prior receipt of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine","household density","household clustering","affected community","adjusted ORs","mixed models","hemagglutination inhibition","age","relationship","comorbidity","adjustment","area","microneutralization assays","unexpected association","indication","blood samples","late spring","summer","additional studies","Odds ratios","influence","telephone survey","initial findings","Background","Methods","Results","participants","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

We recruited drug-na\u00EFve or metformin-treated T2D patients with NAFLD to conduct a multicenter, prospective, open-label, exploratory clinical trial. Transient liver elastography (Fibroscan(\u00AE); Echosens, Paris, France) with controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) was used to non-invasively quantify hepatic fat contents. Fifty patients with CAP values above 250 dB/m were treated once daily with 0.5 mg lobeglitazone for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was a decline in CAP values, and secondary endpoints included changes in components of glycemic, lipid, and liver profiles. Lobeglitazone-treated patients showed significantly decreased CAP values (313.4 dB/m at baseline vs. 297.8 dB/m at 24 weeks; P = 0.016), regardless of glycemic control.

Moreover, multivariable linear regression analysis showed that hepatic fat reduction by lobeglitazone was independently associated with baseline values of CAP, liver stiffness, and liver enzymes, and metformin use. Lobeglitazone treatment reduced intrahepatic fat content, as assessed by transient liver elastography, and improved glycemic, liver, and lipid profiles in T2D patients with NAFLD.

The molecular underpinnings of immune recognition, host responses, and pathogenesis in this setting are poorly understood. We studied pandemic influenza viruses to determine the mechanism by which increasing glycosylation during evolution of surface proteins facilitates diminished pathogenicity in adapted viruses. ER stress during infection with poorly glycosylated pandemic strains activated the unfolded protein response, leading to inflammation, acute lung injury, and mortality. Seasonal strains or viruses engineered to mimic adapted viruses displaying excess glycans on the hemagglutinin did not cause ER stress, allowing preservation of the lungs and survival. We propose that ER stress resulting from recognition of non-adapted viruses is utilized to discriminate \u201Cnon-self\u201D at the level of protein processing and to activate immune responses, with unintended consequences on pathogenesis. Understanding this mechanism should improve strategies for treating acute lung injury from zoonotic viral infections.","publish_time":"2015-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hrincius, Eike R.; Liedmann, Swantje; Finkelstein, David; Vogel, Peter; Gansebom, Shane; Samarasinghe, Amali E.; You, Dahui; Cormier, Stephania A.; McCullers, Jonathan A.","journal":"Cell Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/52e323d1ed2d4a0dfbe4f68d15d20430a33de8bf.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b1eb120cfa12a756cba28ee8d08c63aa748f96a8.json; document_parses/pdf_json/59b4f87d0038e7e52b0e70ee0d0d35a53a706407.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4682876.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211124715005240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26051937/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2015.05.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124715005240","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recognition of non-adapted viruses","pandemic influenza viruses","ER stress","Incursions of new pathogenic viruses","immune responses","acute lung injury","pathogenesis","mechanism","glycosylated pandemic strains","host responses","molecular underpinnings of immune recognition","Seasonal strains","non-self","unfolded protein response","level of protein processing","animal reservoirs","evolution of surface proteins","humans","diminished pathogenicity","inflammation","zoonotic viral infections","hemagglutinin","glycosylation","preservation","unintended consequences","excess glycans","strategies","alarming frequency","lungs","mortality","survival","setting"],"language":"en"},

Vaccine development has focussed on the principal target of the neutralizing humoral immune response, the spike (S) glycoprotein, which mediates receptor recognition and membrane fusion. Coronavirus S proteins are extensively glycosylated viral fusion proteins, encoding around 69-87 N-linked glycosylation sites per trimeric spike. Using a multifaceted structural approach, we reveal a specific area of high glycan density on MERS S that results in the formation of under-processed oligomannose-type glycan clusters, which was absent on SARS and HKU1 CoVs. We provide a comparison of the global glycan density of coronavirus spikes with other viral proteins including HIV-1 envelope, Lassa virus glycoprotein complex, and influenza hemagglutinin, where glycosylation plays a known role in shielding immunogenic epitopes. Consistent with the ability of the antibody-mediated immune response to effectively target and neutralize coronaviruses, we demonstrate that the glycans of coronavirus spikes are not able to form an efficacious high-density global shield to thwart the humoral immune response. Overall, our data reveal how differential organisation of viral glycosylation across class I viral fusion proteins influence not only individual glycan compositions but also the immunological pressure across the viral protein surface.","publish_time":"2020-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Watanabe, Yasunori; Berndsen, Zachary T.; Raghwani, Jayna; Seabright, Gemma E.; Allen, Joel D.; McLellan, Jason S.; Wilson, Ian A.; Bowden, Thomas A.; Ward, Andrew B.; Crispin, Max","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f1ab528698b8539ef649199e4d29ba9f81af428.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d01e580a45c457c7c200cd884e746b4d836e2ea9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.20.957472","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjszOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["viral proteins","Coronavirus S proteins","viral fusion proteins influence","glycosylated viral fusion proteins","global glycan density of coronavirus spikes","differential organisation of viral glycosylation","MERS S","viral protein surface","neutralizing humoral immune response","individual glycan compositions","specific area of high glycan density","SARS","membrane fusion","coronaviruses","glycans of coronavirus spikes","Middle East respiratory syndrome","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","N-linked glycosylation sites","trimeric spike","principal target","HKU1 CoVs","data reveal","formation of under-processed oligomannose-type glycan clusters","high fatality rates","Lassa virus glycoprotein complex","efficacious high-density global shield","class","envelope","zoonotic pathogens","immunological pressure","influenza hemagglutinin","HIV","pandemic potential","known role","receptor recognition","antibody","immunogenic epitopes","multifaceted structural approach","ability","comparison","Vaccine development"],"language":"en"},

Digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) is a powerful method for nucleic acid detection and absolute quantification. However, it requires thermal cycling and accurate temperature control, which are difficult in resource-limited conditions. Accordingly, isothermal methods, such as recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), are more attractive. We developed a picoliter well array (PWA) chip with 27,000 consistently sized picoliter reactions (314 pL) for isothermal DNA quantification using digital RPA (dRPA) at 39\u00B0C. Sample loading using a scraping liquid blade was simple, fast, and required small reagent volumes (i.e., \u003C20 \u03BCL). Passivating the chip surface using a methoxy-PEG-silane agent effectively eliminated cross-contamination during dRPA. Our creative optical design enabled wide-field fluorescence imaging in situ and both end-point and real-time analyses of picoliter wells in a 6-cm(2) area. It was not necessary to use scan shooting and stitch serial small images together. Using this method, we quantified serial dilutions of a Listeria monocytogenes gDNA stock solution from 9 \u00D7 10(-1) to 4 \u00D7 10(-3) copies per well with an average error of less than 11% (N = 15). Overall dRPA-on-chip processing required less than 30 min, which was a 4-fold decrease compared to dPCR, requiring approximately 2 h. dRPA on the PWA chip provides a simple and highly sensitive method to quantify nucleic acids without thermal cycling or precise micropump/microvalve control. It has applications in fast field analysis and critical clinical diagnostics under resource-limited settings.","publish_time":"2016-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Zhao; Liu, Yong; Wei, Qingquan; Liu, Yuanjie; Liu, Wenwen; Zhang, Xuelian; Yu, Yude","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/66cda0b3d87b530e2659f8ac93a74ed963e9645e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4830604.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27074005/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0153359","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Digital","PWA","RPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PWA chip","absolute quantification","chip surface","chip processing","Overall dRPA","precise quantification methods","thermal cycling","isothermal DNA quantification","powerful method","isothermal methods","dPCR","digital RPA","sensitive method","scope of nucleic acids research","fast field analysis","nucleic acid detection","resource-limited settings","resource-limited conditions","sized picoliter reactions","precise micropump","serial dilutions","microvalve control","Digital polymerase chain reaction","stitch serial small images","practical applications","real-time analyses of picoliter wells","accurate temperature control","recombinase polymerase amplification","small reagent volumes","wide-field fluorescence imaging","critical clinical diagnostics","scraping liquid blade","methoxy-PEG","Listeria monocytogenes gDNA stock solution","silane agent","end","creative optical design","situ","scan","Sample loading","cross-contamination","array","copies","average error","fold decrease","\u03BCL","area"],"language":"en"},

Obesity, the main risk factor for incident type 2 diabetes, is more common in patients with critical forms of COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. On the other hand, COVID-19 is usually associated with poor glycemic control and a higher risk of ketoacidosis in diabetic patients. There are currently no recommendations in favor of discontinuing antihypertensive medications that interact with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

The aim of our study was to review the papers which evaluated effectiveness and compliance of the vaccines applied in Hajj. METHODS: We used PubMed and Scopus to search international medical databases. The key words were as follows: Hajj, Haj, vaccine, vaccination, and immunization. The time interval of the search was from the beginning of 2010 to May 23, 2016. One hundred and thirty papers were extracted, and their contents were subsequently reviewed after title and abstract screenings. The original articles were included in the study and non-English articles were excluded from the study. RESULTS: Considering the extracted papers, almost all pilgrims were vaccinated against meningococcal diseases. Using of influenza and pneumococcal vaccine rates were different among the pilgrims. The other vaccines have been taking according to specific conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The findings regarding influenza vaccine effectiveness are contradictory. A few studies confirmed the flu vaccine effectiveness while some others rejected its usefulness. Meningococcal immunization is an effective preventive tool with high compliance for Hajj pilgrims. Further investigations are recommended for the other vaccines.","publish_time":"2016-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Razavi, Seyed Mansour; Saeednejad, Mina; Salamati, Payman","journal":"Int J Prev Med","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5200976.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4103/2008-7802.195826; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28105294/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["Hajj pilgrims","influenza vaccine effectiveness","study","vaccines","flu vaccine effectiveness","meningococcal diseases","extracted papers","pneumococcal vaccine rates","communicable diseases","contagious diseases","vaccination","Meningococcal immunization","search","high compliance","non-English articles","original articles","effective preventive tool","Scopus","mass","findings","risk of exposure","PubMed","international medical databases","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","title","people","morbidities","CONCLUSIONS","studies","abstract screenings","METHODS","time interval","contents","mortalities","key words","RESULTS","specific conditions","BACKGROUND","beginning","investigations","aim","usefulness"],"language":"en"},

The protein microarray technology allows the interrogation of protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-small molecule interaction networks as well as post-translational modification networks in a large-scale, high-throughput manner. With this technology, many groundbreaking findings have been established in studies with the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, most of which could have been unachievable with traditional approaches.

NAD\u002B-dependent histone deacetylase sirtuin1 (SIRT1) prolongs mammalian cellular lifespan. Therefore, we propose that NaDC3 accelerates cellular aging by inhibiting SIRT1. After NaDC3 was overexpressed in two human embryo lung fibroblastic cell lines, WI38 and MRC-5, we found that the cells displayed aging-related phenotypes in advance. Meanwhile, the level of SIRT1 activity was down-regulated. In WI38/hNaDC3 cells treated with the activators of SIRT1, aging-related phenotypes induced by NaDC3 were obviously improved.

Such a transect, spanning a salinity gradient from freshwater to the open sea, facilitated a broad genome-enabled investigation of natural as well as impacted aspects of Baltic Sea viral communities. Taxonomic signatures representative of phages within the widely distributed order Caudovirales were identified with enrichments in lesser-known families such as Podoviridae and Siphoviridae. The distribution of phage reported to infect diverse and ubiquitous heterotrophic bacteria (SAR11 clades) and cyanobacteria (Synechococcus sp.) displayed population-level shifts in diversity. Samples from higher-salinity conditions (\u003E14 practical salinity units [PSU]) had increased abundances of viruses for picoeukaryotes, i.e., Ostreococcus. These data, combined with host diversity estimates, suggest viral modulation of diversity on the whole-community scale, as well as in specific prokaryotic and eukaryotic lineages. RNA libraries revealed single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and RNA viral populations throughout the Baltic Sea, with ssDNA phage highly represented in Lake Tornetr\u00E4sk. Further, our data suggest relatively high transcriptional activity of fish viruses within diverse families known to have broad host ranges, such as Nodoviridae (RNA), Iridoviridae (DNA), and predicted zoonotic viruses that can cause ecological and economic damage as well as impact human health. IMPORTANCE Inferred virus-host relationships, community structures of ubiquitous ecologically relevant groups, and identification of transcriptionally active populations have been achieved with our Baltic Sea study. Further, these data, highlighting the transcriptional activity of viruses, represent one of the more powerful uses of omics concerning ecosystem health. The use of omics-related data to assess ecosystem health holds great promise for rapid and relatively inexpensive determination of perturbations and risk, explicitly with regard to viral assemblages, as no single marker gene is suitable for widespread taxonomic coverage.","publish_time":"2017-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zeigler Allen, Lisa; McCrow, John P.; Ininbergs, Karolina; Dupont, Christopher L.; Badger, Jonathan H.; Hoffman, Jeffery M.; Ekman, Martin; Allen, Andrew E.; Bergman, Birgitta; Venter, J.

These compounds inhibited viral glycoprotein interactions with cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Based on this property, we evaluated their antiviral efficacy against several different viruses known to employ GAGs for host cell entry. RESULTS: Extensive analysis of the tannins\u2019 mechanism of action was performed on a panel of viruses during the attachment and entry steps of infection. Virus-specific binding assays and the analysis of viral spread during treatment with these compounds were also conducted. CHLA and PUG were effective in abrogating infection by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), dengue virus (DENV), measles virus (MV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), at \u03BCM concentrations and in dose-dependent manners without significant cytotoxicity. Moreover, the natural compounds inhibited viral attachment, penetration, and spread, to different degrees for each virus. Specifically, the tannins blocked all these steps of infection for HCMV, HCV, and MV, but had little effect on the post-fusion spread of DENV and RSV, which could suggest intriguing differences in the roles of GAG-interactions for these viruses. CONCLUSIONS: CHLA and PUG may be of value as broad-spectrum antivirals for limiting emerging/recurring viruses known to engage host cell GAGs for entry.

Upon recognition of microbes by innate immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, diverse signalling pathways are activated that combine to define inflammatory responses that direct sterilisation of the threat and/or orchestrate development of the adaptive immune response. Innate immune signalling must be carefully controlled and regulation comes in part from interactions between activating and inhibiting signalling receptors. In recent years, an increasing number of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin receptors and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), has been described that participate in innate recognition of microbes, especially through the so called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Recent studies demonstrate strong interactions between signalling through these receptors. Whereas useful models to study these receptors in great detail in the murine and human system are now emerging, relatively little is known regarding these receptors in companion and farm animals. In this review, current knowledge regarding these receptors in species of veterinary relevance is summarised.","publish_time":"2007-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Werling, Dirk; Coffey, Tracey J.","journal":"The Veterinary Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a818374d94e664ec8314c119a5b3094b07b91f14.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110490.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023306002206; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023306002206","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsxOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inhibiting signalling receptors","Innate immune signalling","innate immune system","immune cells","innate recognition of microbes","increasing number of pattern recognition receptors","C-type lectin receptors","diverse signalling pathways","adaptive immune response","dendritic cells","strong interactions","recent years","Recent studies","human system","host defence","PRRs","Toll","macrophages","early detection","direct sterilisation","threat","development","current knowledge","species of veterinary relevance","inflammatory responses","pathogenic microorganisms","molecular patterns","PAMPs","companion","farm animals","review","useful models","TLRs","regulation"],"language":"en"},

Methods Sentinel surveillance was established in 2003. Nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens and epidemiologic data are collected from persons of all ages presenting with ILI at sentinel sites. Respiratory specimens have been tested for influenza using various viral and molecular diagnostic methods. A subset of 470 specimens collected from children aged 0\u20135 years were tested for multiple respiratory viruses using RT\u2010PCR. Results From 2003 to 2010, 5074 NP specimens were collected from patients with ILI. Overall, 969/5074 (19%) of these specimens tested positive for influenza. Seasonal influenza A(H1N1) viruses predominated during 5 years and influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated during 3 years. Influenza B viruses cocirculated with influenza A viruses during each year from 2004 to 2010. Seasonal peaks in influenza circulation were observed during the months of May, June, and October, with the largest peak corresponding with the primary rainfall season. Of 470 specimens collected from children under aged 5 who were tested for multiple respiratory viruses, a viral respiratory pathogen was detected in 401/470 (85%) of specimens. Commonly detected viruses were RSV (113 of 470 specimens, 24%), rhinoviruses (85/470, 18%), influenza (77/470, 16%), and parainfluenza (75/470, 16%).

The mRNAs 1 to 6 were larger in the mutant, whereas there was no difference between the two viruses in the size of the smallest mRNA, mRNA 7. Sequence analyses of the genomic RNA, mRNA 6, and mRNA 7 of the two viruses revealed that an additional 111 nt were inserted just upstream of the intergenic consensus sequence preceding the N gene in MHV-S No. 8. The inserted region consisted of two different parts; the 3\u2032-most 30 nt corresponded to nucleotides 28 to 57 of the leader sequence and the 5\u2032-most 81 nt corresponded to nucleotides 58 to 138 of mRNA 7. This structure of No. 8 was most likely generated by RNA-RNA recombination between genomic RNA and subgenomic RNA species. The nucleotide insertion in the intergenic sequence between genes M and N resulted in two consensus sequences separated by 111 nt. Primer extension analysis revealed that the amount of a slightly larger, subgenomic mRNA resulting from initiation of synthesis at the upstream consensus sequence was only 5% of the usual sized mRNA 7 initiated from the downstream consensus sequence.","publish_time":"1994-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Taguchi, Fumihiro; Ikeda, Toshio; Makino, Shinji; Yoshikura, Hiroshi","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682284710415; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682284710415","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjsyMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["subgenomic mRNA","intergenic sequence","intergenic consensus sequence","smallest mRNA","upstream consensus sequence","RNA-RNA recombination","downstream consensus sequence","Sequence analyses","leader sequence","usual sized mRNA","subgenomic RNA species","MHV-S","consensus sequences","viruses","nucleotides","N gene","inserted region","plaque-cloned mouse hepatitis virus mutant","initiation of synthesis","genes","nucleotide insertion","Primer extension analysis","different parts","Ki-BALB cells","difference","mRNAs","structure of"],"language":"en"},

A real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to detect ECoV RNA. Nucleocapsid, spike and the region from the p4.7 to p12.7 genes of positive samples were sequenced, and sequence and phylogenetic analyses were conducted. Five samples (1.2%) collected in 2011 and 2013 tested positive for ECoV. Positive samples were collected from adult horses, Thoroughbred foals and a donkey foal. Sequence and/or phylogenetic analysis showed that nucleocapsid, spike and p12.7 genes were highly conserved and were closely related to ECoVs identified in other countries. In contrast, the region from p4.7 and the non-coding region following the p4.7 gene had deletions or insertions. The differences in the p4.7 region between the Irish ECoVs and other ECoVs indicated that the Irish viruses were distinguishable from those circulating in other countries. This is the first report of ECoV detected in both foals and adult horses in Ireland.","publish_time":"2019-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nemoto, Manabu; Schofield, Warren; Cullinane, Ann","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eee5a9068ade4c6776f189045115a90a5785e983.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6832964.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615132/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v11100946","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjszMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Ireland"],"keyphrases":["p4","clinical samples","genes of positive samples","Irish ECoVs","ECoV RNA","report of ECoV","adult horses","Irish viruses","spike","p12","Irish counties","non-coding region","sequence","Nucleocapsid","Ireland","countries","Thoroughbred foals","phylogenetic analysis","phylogenetic analyses","real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","equids","enteric disease","presence of equine coronavirus","circulating","diagnostic laboratory","donkey foal","deletions","study","insertions","total","contrast","differences","objective"],"language":"en"},

The virus is believed to have originated from bats and transmitted to human through intermediate animals such as civet cats. The re-emergence of SARS-CoV remains a valid concern due to the continual persistence of zoonotic SARS-CoVs and SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) in bat reservoirs. In this study, the screening for the presence of SARS-specific T cells in a cohort of three SARS-recovered individuals at 9 and 11 years post-infection was carried out, and all memory T cell responses detected target the SARS-CoV structural proteins. Two CD8\u002B T cell responses targeting the SARS-CoV membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins were characterized by determining their HLA restriction and minimal T cell epitope regions. Furthermore, these responses were found to persist up to 11 years post-infection. An absence of cross-reactivity of these CD8\u002B T cell responses against the newly-emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was also demonstrated. The knowledge of the persistence of SARS-specific celullar immunity targeting the viral structural proteins in SARS-recovered individuals is important in the design and development of SARS vaccines, which are currently unavailable.","publish_time":"2016-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ng, Oi-Wing; Chia, Adeline; Tan, Anthony T.; Jadi, Ramesh S.; Leong, Hoe Nam; Bertoletti, Antonio; Tan, Yee-Joo","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/072ad3450fc4330b8fd7d17f8a3ce50e4089f366.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115611.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26954467/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X16002589; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.02.063; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X16002589","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjszMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","HLA"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["SARS coronavirus","persistence of SARS","presence of SARS","re-emergence of SARS","SARS-CoV membrane","SARS-CoV structural proteins","development of SARS vaccines","continual persistence of zoonotic SARS-CoVs","memory T cell responses","MERS-CoV","specific T cells","minimal T cell epitope regions","novel human coronavirus","SL-CoVs","viral structural proteins","individuals","CD8","years post-infection","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome","specific celullar immunity","HLA restriction","design","reactivity","valid concern","cohort","intermediate animals","nucleocapsid","civet cats","contagious infectious disease","bat reservoirs","screening","absence of cross","study","bats","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

Interpersonal contact patterns play a large role in infectious disease spread, but little is known about the relationship between health care workers\u2019 (HCW) movements and contact patterns within a heath care facility and HAI. Quantitatively capturing these patterns will aid in understanding the dynamics of HAI and may lead to more targeted and effective control strategies in the hospital setting. METHODS: Staff at 3 urban university-based tertiary care hospitals in Canada completed a detailed questionnaire on demographics, interpersonal contacts, in-hospital movement, and infection prevention and control practices. Staff were divided into categories of administrative/support, nurses, physicians, and \u201COther HCWs\u201D - a fourth distinct category, which excludes physicians and nurses. Using quantitative network modeling tools, we constructed the resulting HCW \u201Cco-location network\u201D to illustrate contacts among different occupations and with locations in hospital settings. RESULTS: Among 3048 respondents (response rate 38%) an average of 3.79, 3.69 and 3.88 floors were visited by each HCW each week in the 3 hospitals, with a standard deviation of 2.63, 1.74 and 2.08, respectively. Physicians reported the highest rate of direct patient contacts (\u003E 20 patients/day) but the lowest rate of contacts with other HCWs; nurses had the most extended (\u003E 20 min) periods of direct patient contact. \u201COther HCWs\u201D had the most direct daily contact with all other HCWs. Physicians also reported significantly more locations visited per week than nurses, other HCW, or administrators; nurses visited the fewest. Public spaces such as the cafeteria had the most staff visits per week, but the least mean hours spent per visit. Inpatient settings had significantly more HCW interactions per week than outpatient settings. CONCLUSIONS: HCW contact patterns and spatial movement demonstrate significant heterogeneity by occupation. Control strategies that address this diversity among health care workers may be more effective than \u201Cone-strategy-fits-all\u201D HAI prevention and control programs.

METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates were prospectively collected from 484 children \u003C12 months admitted to the pediatrics ward or PICU at Universitary Hospital Sant Joan de D\u00E9u (Barcelona, Spain) for bronchiolitis from October 2007 to October 2008. Clinical and demographic data were collected. Sixteen respiratory viruses were studied using PCR. Severity was assessed with a bronchiolitis clinical score (BCS). RESULTS: Four hundred ten infants that tested positive for respiratory viruses were analyzed. Mixed viral infections did not increase the severity of the disease. Rhinovirus was associated with severe BCS in univariate analysis (P = 0.041), but in the multivariate logistic regression including viruses and clinical data only bronchopulmonary dysplasia (OR 7.2; 95% CI 1.2\u201343.3), congenital heart disease (OR 4.7; 95% CI 1.1\u201319.9), prematurity (OR 2.6; 95% CI 1.3\u20135.1), and fever (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1\u20133.1) showed statistical significance for predicting severe BCS. CONCLUSIONS: Classical clinical risk factors have more weight in predicting a severe BCS in infants with acute bronchiolitis than the involved viruses.

Predictors of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) including the impact of HRV species and types are poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to describe the clinical and molecular epidemiology of HRV infections among HM patients. STUDY DESIGN: From April 2012\u2013March 2013, HRV-positive respiratory specimens from symptomatic HM patients were molecularly characterized by analysis of partial viral protein 1 (VP1) or VP4 gene sequence. HRV LRTI risk-factors and outcomes were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: One hundred and ten HM patients presented with HRV URTI (n=78) and HRV LRTI (n=32). Hypoalbuminemia (OR 3.0; 95% CI, 1.0 \u2013 9.2; p=0.05) was independently associated with LRTI, but other clinical and laboratory markers of host immunity did not differ between patients with URTI versus LRTI. Detection of bacterial co-pathogens was common in LRTI cases (25%). Among 92 typeable respiratory specimens, there were 58 (64%) HRV-As, 12 (13%) HRV-Bs, and 21 (23%) HRV-Cs, and one Enterovirus 68. LRTI rates among HRV-A (29%), HRV-B (17%), and HRV-C (29%) were similar. HRV-A infections occurred year-round while HRV-B and HRV-C infections clustered in the late fall and winter. CONCLUSIONS: HRVs are associated with LRTI in HM patients. Illness severity is not attributable to specific HRV species or types. The frequent detection of bacterial co-pathogens in HRV LRTIs further substantiates the hypothesis that HRVs predispose to bacterial superinfection of the lower airways, similar to that of other community-acquired respiratory viruses.","publish_time":"2015-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jacobs, Samantha E.; Lamson, Daryl M.; Soave, Rosemary; Guzman, Brigitte Huertas; Shore, Tsiporah B.; Ritchie, Ellen K.; Zappetti, Dana; Satlin, Michael J.; Leonard, John P.; van Besien, Koen; Schuetz, Audrey N.; Jenkins, Stephen G.; St George, Kirsten; Walsh, Thomas J.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/514bf624e007b40bce7898534a1bd8edfc03a848.json; document_parses/pdf_json/051382aee4c0ba273ffcecaa0ec1b3bf28a3c3a7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4750469.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4750469?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653215006101; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2015.07.309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26370315/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653215006101","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV","HRV LRTI","URTI","LRTI","Enterovirus"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HRV URTI","HRV LRTIs","HRV-Cs","HRV-Bs","HRV-C infections","HRV LRTI risk-factors","specific HRV species","impact of HRV species","HRV-positive respiratory specimens","molecular epidemiology of HRV infections","LRTI cases","LRTI rates","symptomatic HM patients","HRVs","respiratory viruses","typeable respiratory specimens","Predictors of lower respiratory tract infection","common causes of upper respiratory tract infection","bacterial superinfection","frequent detection of bacterial co-pathogens","types","lower airways","STUDY DESIGN","outcomes","VP1","hematologic malignancy","hypothesis","laboratory markers of host immunity","analysis of partial viral protein","Human rhinoviruses","late fall","Illness severity","VP4 gene sequence","multivariable logistic regression","BACKGROUND","community","winter","Enterovirus","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS","Hypoalbuminemia"],"language":"en"},

In this review we will discuss the history of the discovery of the avian leukosis virus (ALV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Env proteins and their receptor specificity, comparing the many differences but having some similarities. Much of the progress in these fields has relied on viral genetics and genetic polymorphisms in the host population. A special feature of HIV-1 is that its persistent infection in its human host, to the point of depleting its favorite target cells, allows the virus to evolve new entry phenotypes to expand its host range into several new cell types. This variety of entry phenotypes has led to confusion in the field leading to the major form of entry phenotype of HIV-1 being overlooked until recently.

Of the thus-far identified gD receptors, nectin-1 is likely the most effective in terms of its wide usage by multiple alphaherpesviruses for cell entry. The molecular basis of nectin-1 recognition by the gD protein is therefore an interesting scientific question in the alphaherpesvirus field. Previous studies focused on the herpes simplex virus (HSV) of the Simplexvirus genus, for which both the free gD structure and the gD/nectin-1 complex structure were reported at high resolutions. The structural and functional features of other alphaherpesviral gDs, however, remain poorly characterized. In the current study, we systematically studied the characteristics of nectin-1 binding by the gD of a Varicellovirus genus member, the pseudorabies virus (PRV). We first showed that PRV infects host cells via both human and swine nectin-1, and that its gD exhibits similar binding affinities for nectin-1 of the two species. Furthermore, we demonstrated that removal of the PRV gD membrane-proximal residues could significantly increase its affinity for the receptor binding. The structures of PRV gD in the free and the nectin-1-bound states were then solved, revealing a similar overall 3D fold as well as a homologous nectin-1 binding mode to its HSV counterpart. However, several unique features were observed at the binding interface of PRV gD, enabling the viral ligand to utilize different gD residues (from those of HSV) for nectin-1 engagement. These observed binding characteristics were further verified by the mutagenesis study using the key-residue mutants of nectin-1. The structural and functional data obtained in this study, therefore, provide the basis of receptor recognition by PRV gD.","publish_time":"2017-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, An; Lu, Guangwen; Qi, Jianxun; Wu, Lili; Tian, Kegong; Luo, Tingrong; Shi, Yi; Yan, Jinghua; Gao, George F.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09525027db30dc3a6945da255f80b2099e239c48.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5453625.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006314; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28542478/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRV","HSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gD receptors","gD protein","structures of PRV gD","binding interface of PRV gD","characteristics of nectin","homologous nectin","swine nectin","free gD structure","different gD residues","PRV gD membrane-proximal residues","molecular basis of nectin","receptor binding","binding mode","observed binding characteristics","key-residue mutants of nectin","similar binding affinities","engagement of host receptors","HSV counterpart","basis of receptor recognition","functional features","mutagenesis study","current study","viral ligand","viral envelope glycoprotein D","host cells","alphaherpesvirus infection","pseudorabies virus","D fold","complex structure","alphaherpesvirus field","Simplexvirus genus","functional data","unique features","herpes simplex virus","Varicellovirus genus member","wide usage","interesting scientific question","multiple alphaherpesviruses","terms","cell entry","indispensable step","affinity","Previous studies","alphaherpesviral gDs","high resolutions","removal","bound states","species"],"language":"en"},

Viral lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) frequently causes adult hospitalization and is linked to antibiotic overuse. European studies suggest that the serum procalcitonin (PCT) level may be used to guide antibiotic therapy. We conducted a trial assessing the feasibility of using PCT algorithms with viral testing to guide antibiotic use in a US hospital. Methods. Three hundred patients hospitalized with nonpneumonic LRTI during October 2013\u2013April 2014 were randomly assigned at a ratio of 1:1 to receive standard care or PCT-guided care and viral PCR testing. The primary outcome was antibiotic exposure, and safety was assessed at 1 and 3 months. Results. Among the 151 patients in the intervention group, viruses were identified in 42% (63), and 83% (126) had PCT values of \u003C0.25 \u00B5g/mL. There were no significant differences in antibiotic use or adverse events between intervention patients and those in the nonintervention group. Subgroup analyses revealed fewer subjects with positive results of viral testing and low PCT values who were discharged receiving antibiotics (20% vs 45%; P = .002) and shorter antibiotic durations among algorithm-adherent intervention patients versus nonintervention patients (2.0 vs 4.0 days; P = .004). Compared with historical controls (from 2008\u20132011), antibiotic duration in nonintervention patients decreased by 2 days (6.0 vs 4.0 days; P \u003C .001), suggesting a study effect. Conclusions.

The first laboratory-confirmed case, which involved a 60-year-old man from Bisha, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), who died of rapidly progressive community-acquired pneumonia and acute renal failure, was announced by the World Health Organization (WHO) on September 23, 2012. Since then, a total of 70 cases, including 39 fatalities, have been reported in the Middle East and Europe. Recent clusters involving epidemiologically-linked household contacts and hospital contacts in the Middle East, Europe, and Africa strongly suggested possible human-to-human transmission.

The type I interferon (type I IFN)-mediated immune responses provide host protection from infectious diseases. Several coronaviruses have been reported to evolve diverse strategies to evade host IFN response. However, whether feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) antagonizes the type I IFN signaling remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that FIPV strain DF2 infection not only failed to induce interferon-\u03B2 (IFN-\u03B2) and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) production, but also inhibited Sendai virus (SEV) or polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C))-induced IFN-\u03B2 production. Subsequently, we found that one of the non-structural proteins encoded by the FIPV genome, nsp5, interrupted type I IFN signaling in a protease-dependent manner by cleaving the nuclear factor \u03BAB (NF-\u03BAB) essential modulator (NEMO) at three sites\u2014glutamine132 (Q132), Q205, and Q231. Further investigation revealed that the cleavage products of NEMO lost the ability to activate the IFN-\u03B2 promoter. Mechanistically, the nsp5-mediated NEMO cleavage disrupted the recruitment of the TRAF family member-associated NF-\u03BAB activator (TANK) to NEMO, which reduced the phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), leading to the inhibition of type I IFN production. Our research provides new insights into the mechanism for FIPV to counteract host innate immune response.","publish_time":"2019-12-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Si; Tian, Jin; Li, Zhijie; Kang, Hongtao; Zhang, Jikai; Huang, Jiapei; Yin, Hang; Hu, Xiaoliang; Qu, Liandong","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c9c650f233ed3a031c995a887d8dfbc8b41e78c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7019732.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v12010043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31905881/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN","FIPV","TRAF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN production","host IFN response","IFN-\u03B2 promoter","interferon-\u03B2","induced IFN-\u03B2 production","interrupted type","inhibition of type","feline infectious peritonitis virus","FIPV genome","infectious diseases","nsp5-mediated NEMO cleavage","cleavage products of NEMO","nuclear factor \u03BAB","host protection","leading infectious cause of death","interferon-stimulated gene","phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor","FIPV strain DF2 infection","virulent feline coronavirus","immune responses","Sendai virus","TRAF family member-associated NF-\u03BAB activator","recruitment","polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid","SEV","mechanism","TANK","essential modulator","ability","protease-dependent manner","diverse strategies","Q132","glutamine132","sites","new insights","cats","IRF3","ISG","Q205","research","non-structural proteins","Q231","investigation","study","coronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

Primary clinical findings included a large, multi lobulated mass in the caudodorsal abdomen, peripheral eosinophilia and hyperglobulinemia. Abdominal imaging revealed a multilobulated, cavitated mass in the sublumbar region. Exploratory celiotomy revealed multiple firm masses in the sublumbar retroperitoneal space causing ventral displacement and compression of the descending colon with extension of the masses into the pelvic canal. Histopathology was consistent with feline gastrointestinal eosinophilic sclerosing fibroplasia (FGESF). Aerobic culture was positive for Staphylococcus aureus. The cat was treated with prednisolone (2 mg/kg PO q24h), lactulose (0.5 g/kg PO q8h), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (62.5 mg/cat PO q12h for 1 month) and fenbendazole (50 mg/kg PO q24h for 5 days). Six months postoperatively, the cat had no recurrence of clinical signs. Repeat evaluation and imaging at day 732 postoperatively revealed marked improvement of the abdominal mass, resolution of peripheral eosinophilia and no clinical signs with continued prednisolone therapy (0.5 mg/kg PO q24h). RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: This is a report of a primary extramural FGESF lesion, and the first description of characteristics of FGESF on CT. Previous evidence suggests that the most favorable outcomes require immunosuppressive therapy and complete surgical excision; however, this case demonstrates a favorable outcome with medical management alone.","publish_time":"2019-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thieme, Maureen E; Olsen, Anastasia M; Woolcock, Andrew D; Miller, Margaret A; Simons, Micha C","journal":"JFMS Open Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95b9bac4d7a86402203e36f44eb826352f406b13.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6699013.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31452913/; https://doi.org/10.1177/2055116919867178","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PO q24h","cat PO q12h","PO q8h","abdominal mass","cavitated mass","Primary clinical findings","recurrence of clinical signs","Abdominal imaging","primary extramural FGESF lesion","year-old neutered male cat","multi lobulated mass","resolution of peripheral eosinophilia","continued prednisolone therapy","immunosuppressive therapy","favorable outcomes","sublumbar region","CASE SUMMARY","sublumbar retroperitoneal space","multiple firm masses","month history of intermittent constipation","compression","caudodorsal abdomen","feline gastrointestinal eosinophilic sclerosing fibroplasia","ventral displacement","report","complete surgical excision","descending colon","extension","marked improvement","clavulanic acid","Previous evidence","Aerobic culture","Staphylococcus aureus","Histopathology","Exploratory celiotomy","amoxicillin","hyperglobulinemia","description of characteristics","lactulose","medical management","NOVEL INFORMATION","fenbendazole","pelvic canal","RELEVANCE","obstipation","evaluation","days","months"],"language":"en"},

In recent years, it has expanded geographically, changing from an endemic mosquito-borne disease across equatorial Asia and Africa, to an epidemic disease causing large outbreaks in several areas of the world. With the recent Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks in the Americas, the disease has become a focus of attention of public health agencies and of the international research community, especially due to an association with neurological disorders in adults and to the severe neurological and ophthalmological abnormalities found in fetuses and newborns of mothers exposed to ZIKV during pregnancy. A large number of studies have been published in the last 3 years, revealing the structure of the virus, how it is transmitted and how it affects human cells. Many different animal models have been developed, which recapitulate several features of ZIKV disease and its neurological consequences. Moreover, several vaccine candidates are now in active preclinical development, and three of them have already entered phase I clinical trials. Likewise, many different compounds targeting viral and cellular components are being tested in in vitro and in experimental animal models. This review aims to discuss the current state of this rapidly growing literature from a multidisciplinary perspective, as well as to present an overview of the public health response to Zika and of the perspectives for the prevention and treatment of this disease.","publish_time":"2017-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saiz, Juan-Carlos; Mart\u00EDn-Acebes, Miguel A.; Bueno-Mar\u00ED, Rub\u00E9n; Salom\u00F3n, Oscar D.; Villamil-Jim\u00E9nez, Luis C.; Heukelbach, Jorg; Alencar, Carlos H.; Armstrong, Paul K.; Ortiga-Carvalho, Tania M.; Mendez-Otero, Rosalia; Rosado-de-Castro, Paulo H.; Pimentel-Coelho, Pedro M.","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aba0193185525dbd5c85f38245bcd05861ec4513.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5572254.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01554; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28878742/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Asia","Africa"],"keyphrases":["viral disease","epidemic disease","features of ZIKV disease","recent Zika virus","large outbreaks","neurological disorders","neurological consequences","different animal models","recent years","public health agencies","public health response","experimental animal models","different compounds","large number of studies","growing literature","fetuses","ophthalmological abnormalities","equatorial Asia","adults","focus of attention","Africa","newborns of mothers","international research community","current state","perspectives","association","cellular components","mosquitoes","areas","active preclinical development","vaccine candidates","endemic mosquito","multidisciplinary perspective","overview","prevention","treatment","Americas","phase","clinical trials","genus Aedes","review","world","pregnancy","structure","human cells"],"language":"en"},

Several HRSV genotypes have been described. Goals. To describe the main genotypes that caused infections in S\u00E3o Paulo (2013\u20132015) and to analyze their clinical/epidemiological features. Methods. 94 infants (0\u20136 months) with bronchiolitis were studied. Clinical/epidemiological information was collected; a search for 16 viruses in nasopharyngeal secretion (PCR-real-time and conventional, sequencing, and phylogenetic analyses) was performed. Results. The mean age was 2.4 m; 48% were male. The mean length of hospital stay was 4.4 d (14% in the Intensive Care Unit). The positive rate of respiratory virus was 98.9%; 73 cases (77.6%) were HRSV (76,7% HRSVA). HRSVA formed three clusters: ON1 (n = 34), NA1 (n = 1), and NA2 (n = 4). All HRSVB were found to cluster in the BA genotype (BA9-n = 10; BA10-n = 3). Clinical analyses showed no significant differences between the genotype AON1 and other genotypes. Conclusion. This study showed a high rate of HRSV detection in bronchiolitis. HRSVA ON1, which has recently been described in other countries and has not been identified in previous studies in the southeast region of Brazil, was predominant. The clinical characteristics of the infants that were infected with AON1 were similar to infants with infections by other genotypes.","publish_time":"2017-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vieira, Sandra E.; Thomazelli, Luciano M.; de Paulis, Milena; Ferronato, Angela E.; Oliveira, Daniele B.; Martinez, Marina Baquerizo; Durigon, Edison L.","journal":"Biomed Res Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e021441c02baaade6b2b93427db4beb54b06ea92.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5463120.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28626754/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/3459785","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Intensive Care Unit","HRSV"],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["infants","HRSV genotypes","main genotypes","BA9-n","BA10-n","Clinical analyses","clinical characteristics","HRSVA ON1","main cause of respiratory infections","positive rate of respiratory virus","genotype AON1","bronchiolitis","Human respiratory syncytial virus","high rate of HRSV detection","BA genotype","phylogenetic analyses","epidemiological information","epidemiological features","mean age","mean length of hospital stay","PCR-real","nasopharyngeal secretion","time","search","sequencing","significant differences","southeast region of Brazil","viruses","previous studies","S\u00E3o Paulo","study","clusters","Intensive Care Unit","cases","months","NA1","NA2","HRSVB","Conclusion","countries","Goals","Methods","Results","male"],"language":"en"},

At 4 d of age, 112 calves had accelerometers attached to their hind leg and were housed in pens with ACFS. Calves were examined daily for signs of illness or injury. Of the 112 calves monitored, 18 were diagnosed with NCD; activities of calves with NCD were then compared with those of 18 healthy controls (calves that had no symptoms of NCD, other illnesses, or injury). Feeding (milk consumption and the number of rewarded and unrewarded visits to the feeder) and lying behavior during the 5 d leading up to calves displaying clinical signs of NCD were analyzed. Calves with NCD performed fewer unrewarded visits and consumed less milk than healthy calves during the 2- and 4-d periods before diagnosis with NCD, respectively. Calves with NCD tended to perform fewer lying bouts than healthy calves over the 5-d period before diagnosis with NCD. At 3 wk of age, a subset of 51 healthy calves were allocated to 1 of 5 treatment groups: (1) sham handling (SHAM, n = 10), (2) cautery disbudding (DB, n = 11), (3) administration of local anesthetic (LA) and DB (LA\u002BDB, n = 11), 4) administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and DB (NSAID\u002BDB, n = 9), and (5) administration of LA, NSAID and DB (LA\u002BNSAID\u002BDB, n = 10). Feeding and lying behavior were recorded continuously for 24 h pre- and postdisbudding. We found no effect of treatment on the number of rewarded or unrewarded visits to the feeder and milk volume consumed 24 h before administration of treatments. During the 24-h postdisbudding period, SHAM calves performed more unrewarded visits than DB, LA\u002BDB, and NSAID\u002BDB calves, but the number of unrewarded visits did not differ between SHAM and LA\u002BNSAID\u002BDB calves. During the first hour of the posttreatment period we noted a difference in lying times among treatments, with DB and NSAID\u002BDB calves spending less time lying than SHAM calves and lying times being similar between SHAM, LA\u002BDB, and LA\u002BNSAID\u002BDB calves. The ACFS and accelerometers have the potential to automatically gather valuable information regarding health status and pain in calves. Therefore, it may be advantageous to combine both of these measures (ACFS and accelerometers) when evaluating NCD on farm or pain in calves in future research.","publish_time":"2018-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sutherland, M.

This disease has been responsible for significant economic losses in domestic and wild waterfowl as a result of mortality, and decreased egg production. Resveratrol is a naturally occurring phytoalexin in specific plants and exhibits inhibitory activity against many kinds of virus. In this paper, resveratrol was found to inhibit duck enteritis virus (DEV) replication in a dose-dependent manner, with a 50% inhibition concentration of 3.85 \u03BCg/mL. The inhibition in virus multiplication in the presence of resveratrol was not attributed to direct inactivation or inhibition of virus attachment to the host cells, but to the inhibition of viral multiplication in host cells. The assay of the time of addition limited the drug effect during the first 8 h of infection. This conclusion was supported by the ultrastructure images of the early stage of DEV infection, which showed that the replication of virus nucleic acid and the formation of the capsid in the cell nucleus were suppressed. In the indirect immunofluorescence assay, proteins expression in DEV infected duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) within 24 h post-infection (p.i.) was also effectively suppressed by resveratrol. In summary, the resveratrol has a good activity against DEV infection in vitro, which could be attributed to that fact that several essential immediate early viral proteins for virus replication were impacted by resveratrol.","publish_time":"2013-06-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Jiao; Yin, Zhongqiong; Li, Li; Cheng, Anchun; Jia, Renyong; Song, Xu; Lu, Hongke; Dai, Shujun; Lv, Cheng; Liang, Xiaoxia; He, Changliang; Zhao, Ling; Su, Gang; Ye, Gang; Shi, Fei","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e3de6d6d50592102725cbe2ee5cb0fe02b851aac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3679110.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23776451/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0065213","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus replication","virus multiplication","duck enteritis virus","inhibition of virus attachment","kinds of virus","h of infection","presence of resveratrol","early stage of DEV infection","inhibition of viral multiplication","replication of virus nucleic acid","Duck viral enteritis","h post-infection","inhibition concentration","DEV infected duck embryo fibroblasts","contagious herpesvirus infection of ducks","host cells","essential immediate early viral proteins","proteins expression","inhibitory activity","good activity","indirect immunofluorescence assay","DEFs","wild waterfowl","significant economic losses","result of mortality","geese","formation","DVE","direct inactivation","ultrastructure images","capsid","swans","drug effect","time of addition","specific plants","phytoalexin","fact","decreased egg production","dose-dependent manner","disease","cell nucleus","species","conclusion","\u03BCg","summary","paper"],"language":"en"},

Published data from scientific journals as well as the data presented in official reports and published on the Internet were used for this review. In the review, information is given for the main foodborne viruses, implicated virus species, and food matrices involved, some history data are given, as well as modes of transmission, and sources of the virus presence in food. Results of surveys on the presence of viruses in different kind of foods commodities (fresh produces and shellfish) and in some cases connections to caused outbreaks are presented. Also, possible zoonotic infection and implicated viruses that could be transmitted through food are given. Human Norovirus followed by hepatitis A virus are the most common foodborne viruses, which are transmitted by food consumed raw, such as shellfish, fresh vegetables, and berry fruit. In developed countries, hepatitis E virus is increasingly being recognized as an emerging viral foodborne pathogen that includes zoonotic transmission via pork products. The existing knowledge gaps and the major future expectations in the detection and surveillance of foodborne viruses are mentioned.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petrovi\u0107, T.; D\u0027Agostino, M.","journal":"Antimicrobial Food Packaging","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92bc516003eb265ef72168c6272fb0dc84117802.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150200.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B978012800723500005X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012800723500005X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["implicated viruses","main foodborne viruses","presence of viruses","surveillance of foodborne viruses","common foodborne viruses","relevant foodborne viruses","virus presence","review","food matrices","Published data","implicated virus species","hepatitis E virus","shellfish","zoonotic transmission","emerging viral foodborne pathogen","history data","fresh produces","fresh vegetables","modes of transmission","possible zoonotic infection","different kind of foods commodities","major future expectations","detection","sources","existing knowledge gaps","developed countries","scientific journals","berry fruit","pork products","cases connections","Internet","official reports","Human Norovirus","information","Results of surveys","outbreaks"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: A real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed and used to detect and quantify hMPV in respiratory specimens. STUDY DESIGN: The quantitative RT-PCR assay amplified an approximately 70 base pair fragment from the hMPV fusion protein gene. The assay was validated and used to test respiratory specimens obtained from children seen at a hospital in Seattle, Washington, from December 2002 through May 2003. RESULTS: The assay detected 1000 hMPV copies/mL of specimen, did not detect 19 other respiratory viruses, and was able to detect and accurately quantify isolates from the four known hMPV genetic lineages in a proficiency panel of 20 previously tested samples. hMPV was detected in 52 (7.2%) of 719 pediatric respiratory specimens. The mean log 10 copies/mL of hMPV in the 52 positive specimens was 7.67 (range = 4.59\u201310.60). Children aged 7\u201312 months had a significantly higher hMPV prevalence (12.4%) than did children younger than 7 months (4.7%) (P \u003C 0.005). Children in this age group also had significantly higher levels of hMPV in their respiratory specimens (mean log 8.43 copies/mL) than did the younger children (mean log 6.93 copies/mL) (P = 0.0025). CONCLUSIONS: The rapid real-time RT-PCR assay described here is a sensitive test for clarifying the epidemiology of and diseases associated with hMPV.","publish_time":"2005-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuypers, Jane; Wright, Nancy; Corey, Lawrence; Morrow, Rhoda","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/efe86baf0c7d99a226a38232b75499c12ee049be.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185467.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653205000089; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653205000089","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Seattle","Washington"],"keyphrases":["hMPV copies","higher levels of hMPV","higher hMPV prevalence","pediatric respiratory specimens","children younger","younger children","respiratory illness","respiratory viruses","known hMPV genetic lineages","hMPV fusion protein gene","quantitative RT-PCR assay","mean log","positive specimens","rapid real-time RT-PCR assay","months","sensitive test","real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","proficiency panel","base pair fragment","isolates","age group","epidemiology","STUDY DESIGN","tested samples","OBJECTIVES","hospital","Seattle","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","Human metapneumovirus","Washington","range","diseases","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Identifying animal reservoirs of zoonoses and predicting future outbreaks are increasingly important to human health and well-being and economic stability, particularly where research and resources are limited. Here, we integrate complex networks and machine learning approaches to develop a new approach to identifying reservoirs. An exhaustive dataset of mammal\u2013pathogen interactions was transformed into networks where hosts are linked via their shared pathogens. We present a methodology for identifying important and influential hosts in these networks. Ensemble models linking network characteristics with phylogeny and life-history traits are then employed to predict those key hosts and quantify the roles they undertake in pathogen transmission. Our models reveal drivers explaining host importance and demonstrate how these drivers vary by pathogen taxa. Host importance is further integrated into ensemble models to predict reservoirs of zoonoses of various pathogen taxa and quantify the extent of pathogen sharing between humans and mammals. We establish predictors of reservoirs of zoonoses, showcasing host influence to be a key factor in determining these reservoirs. Finally, we provide new insight into the determinants of zoonosis-sharing, and contrast these determinants across major pathogen taxa.","publish_time":"2020-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wardeh, Maya; Sharkey, Kieran J.; Baylis, Matthew","journal":"Proc Biol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9e8410e170ac72b3ccb909c2807403fc777fdf4c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/30b4f6254119ea425c5370fe40f3def0500fa359.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7031665.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2019.2882; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32019444/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs3NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["major pathogen taxa","pathogen interactions","extent of pathogen","pathogen transmission","animal reservoirs of zoonoses","various pathogen taxa","predictors of reservoirs","Ensemble models","host importance","key hosts","human health","host influence","complex networks","influential hosts","drivers","humans","sharing","major threats","new approach","determinants of zoonosis","new insight","key factor","phylogeny","future outbreaks","machine learning approaches","economic stability","network characteristics","well-being","animals","life-history traits","exhaustive dataset of mammal","roles","research","methodology","resources","Diseases","shared pathogens","mammals"],"language":"en"},

No randomised controlled trials involving acute exacerbations in children with bronchiectasis have been published to our knowledge. We hypothesised that azithromycin is non-inferior to amoxicillin-clavulanate for resolving exacerbations in children with bronchiectasis. METHODS: We did this parallel-group, double-dummy, double-blind, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial in three Australian and one New Zealand hospital between April, 2012, and August, 2016. We enrolled children aged 1\u201319 years with radiographically proven bronchiectasis unrelated to cystic fibrosis. At the start of an exacerbation, children were randomly assigned to oral suspensions of either amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate (22\u00B75 mg/kg, twice daily) and placebo or azithromycin (5 mg/kg per day) and placebo for 21 days. We used permuted block randomisation (stratified by age, site, and cause) with concealed allocation. The primary outcome was resolution of exacerbation (defined as a return to baseline) by 21 days in the per-protocol population, with a non-inferiority margin of \u221220%. We assessed several secondary outcomes including duration of exacerbation, time to next exacerbation, laboratory, respiratory, and quality-of-life measurements, and microbiology. This trial was registered with the Australian/New Zealand Registry (ACTRN12612000010897). FINDINGS: We screened 604 children and enrolled 236. 179 children had an exacerbation and were assigned to treatment: 97 to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate, 82 to azithromycin). By day 21, 61 (84%) of 73 exacerbations had resolved in the azithromycin group versus 73 (84%) of 87 in the amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate group. The risk difference showed non-inferiority (\u22120\u00B73%, 95% CI \u221211\u00B78 to 11\u00B71). Exacerbations were significantly shorter in the amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate group than in the azithromycin group (median 10 days [IQR 6\u201315] vs 14 days [8\u201316]; p=0\u00B7014). Adverse events were attributed to the trial medication in 17 (21%) of 82 children in the azithromycin group versus 23 (24%) of 97 in the amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate group (relative risk 0\u00B79, 95% CI 0\u00B75 to 1\u00B75). INTERPRETATION: By 21 days of treatment, azithromycin is non-inferior to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate for resolving exacerbations in children with non-severe bronchiectasis. In some patients, such as those with penicillin hypersensitivity or those likely to have poor adherence, azithromycin provides another option for treating exacerbations, but must be balanced with risk of treatment failure (within a 20% margin), longer exacerbation duration, and the risk of inducing macrolide resistance.

In this study, we investigated RNA interference (RNAi), a specific gene silencing process mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes, as an antiviral strategy against HCV. Synthetic siRNAs were designed to target conserved sequences of the HCV 5\u2032 nontranslated region (NTR) located in a functional, stem\u2013loop structured domain of the HCV internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which is crucial for initiation of polyprotein translation. Several siRNAs dramatically reduced or even abrogated the replication of selectable subgenomic HCV replicons upon cotransfection of human hepatoma cells with viral target and siRNAs, or upon transfection of cells supporting autonomous replication of HCV replicon with siRNAs. Importantly, three siRNAs also proved capable of strongly inhibiting virus production in cell culture. One siRNA, targeting a sequence that is highly conserved across all genotypes and forms a critical pseudoknot structure involved in translation, was identified as the most promising therapeutic candidate. These results indicate that the HCV life cycle can be efficiently blocked by using properly-designed siRNAs that target functionally important, highly conserved sequences of the HCV IRES. This finding offers a novel approach towards developing IRES-based antiviral treatment for chronic HCV infections.","publish_time":"2007-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chevalier, Christophe; Saulnier, Aure; Benureau, Yann; Fl\u00E9chet, Dorian; Delgrange, David; Colb\u00E8re-Garapin, Florence; Wychowski, Czeslaw; Martin, Annette","journal":"Molecular Therapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/124d50f8e6f06f11cf9cf6349558d601790cdc34.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106008.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S152500161632439X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S152500161632439X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV","HCV IRES"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCV IRES","chronic HCV infections","designed siRNAs","HCV life cycle","Synthetic siRNAs","autonomous replication of HCV replicon","replication of selectable subgenomic HCV replicons","HCV internal ribosome entry site","conserved sequences","viral target","transfection of cells","antiviral treatment","RNA interference","antiviral strategy","virus production","small interfering RNA","Hepatitis C virus","initiation of polyprotein translation","cotransfection of human hepatoma cells","major cause of chronic liver disease","hepatocellular carcinoma","structured domain","specific gene silencing process","duplexes","RNAi","critical pseudoknot structure","genotypes","nontranslated region","efficacious treatments","stem","cell culture","results","novel approach","promising therapeutic candidate","study"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the incidence, clinical features and risk factors of noninfectious ILD after HDCT in paediatric patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of paediatric solid tumour patients who underwent HDCT and autologous HSCT between 1997 and 2012. ILD was diagnosed using clinical symptoms and radiography after excluding cardiac, renal and infectious causes. Risk factors were analysed using a Cox proportional hazard regression model. RESULTS: Three hundred and forty patients were enrolled, and the median age was 3 years (interquartile range 1\u20137). Eight patients (2.4%) were diagnosed with noninfectious ILD. The median duration of symptom onset was 30 months (range 7\u201374). Six (75%) of eight ILD patients died during the study period, even though steroids were administered for treatment. High\u2010dose cyclophosphamide use (hazard ratio = 11.37, 95% confidence interval = 1.38\u201393.32, P = 0.023) and sex (hazard ratio = 0.10, 95% confidence interval = 0.01\u20130.84, P = 0.034) were associated with late\u2010onset, noninfectious ILD upon multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: The incidence of noninfectious ILD after HDCT and autologous HSCT was not negligible, and the clinical features of ILD showed late onset and a poor prognosis.

Double-membrane vesicles, termed autophagosomes, deliver trapped viral cargo to the lysosome for degradation. Specifically, autophagy initiates an innate immune response by cooperating with pattern recognition receptor signalling to induce interferon production. It also selectively degrades immune components associated with viral particles. Following degradation, autophagy coordinates adaptive immunity by delivering virus-derived antigens for presentation to T lymphocytes. However, in an ongoing evolutionary arms race, viruses have acquired the potent ability to hijack and subvert autophagy for their benefit. In this Review, we focus on the key regulatory steps during viral infection in which autophagy is involved and discuss the specific molecular mechanisms that diverse viruses use to repurpose autophagy for their life cycle and pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2018-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choi, Younho; Bowman, James W.; Jung, Jae U.","journal":"Nature Reviews Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca01c442d36a7167f6f25c733dccfc8a70e6e242.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6907743.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29556036/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-018-0003-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Autophagy","viral infection","viral particles","trapped viral cargo","degradation","diverse viruses","immune components","innate immune response","termed autophagosomes","virus-derived antigens","pattern recognition receptor signalling","adaptive immunity","presentation","key regulatory steps","interferon production","Double-membrane vesicles","specific molecular mechanisms","ongoing evolutionary arms race","T lymphocytes","cells","lysosome","potent ability","life cycle","pathogenesis","powerful tool","Review","benefit"],"language":"en"},

However, modulation of the access of immune cells to the CNS is associated with impaired immune surveillance and detrimental viral infections of the CNS. Here, we explored the potency of cellular immune responses within the CNS to protect against viral encephalitis in mice with T cell conditional disruption of VLA-4 integrin (\u03B14\u03B21) expression. RESULTS: While VLA-4 expression in virus specific Th1 cells is non-redundant for their ability to access the CNS, \u03B14-integrin deficient Th17 cells enter the CNS compartment and generate an inflammatory milieu upon intrathecal vaccinia virus (VV) infection. However, in contrast to Th1 cells that can adopt direct cytotoxic properties, Th17 cells fail to clear the virus due to insufficient Eomes induced perforin-1 expression. CONCLUSION: The quality of the intrathecal cellular antiviral response under conditions of impaired VLA-4 function jeopardizes host protection. Our functional in vivo data extend our mechanistic understanding of anti-viral immunity in the CNS and help to estimate the risk potential of upcoming therapeutic agents that target the trafficking of immune cells into distinct anatomical compartments.","publish_time":"2014-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rothhammer, Veit; Muschaweckh, Andreas; Gasteiger, Georg; Petermann, Franziska; Heink, Sylvia; Busch, Dirk H; Heikenw\u00E4lder, Mathias; Hemmer, Bernhard; Drexler, Ingo; Korn, Thomas","journal":"Acta Neuropathol Commun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab8da309a4060c4f4a3774c3ec9e7ebdc5a3a74e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4029267.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/2051-5960-2-27; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606807/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["trafficking of immune cells","access of immune cells","CNS compartment","virus specific Th1 cells","expression","\u03B14-integrin deficient Th17 cells","impaired immune surveillance","potency of cellular immune responses","intrathecal vaccinia virus","conditions of impaired VLA","viral encephalitis","detrimental viral infections","intrathecal cellular antiviral response","T cell conditional disruption of VLA","mechanistic understanding of anti-viral immunity","Natalizumab blocks \u03B14-integrins","inflammatory milieu","mice","series of anti-inflammatory drugs","direct cytotoxic properties","prototypic agent","risk potential of upcoming therapeutic agents","quality","function","VV","insufficient Eomes induced perforin","ability","distinct anatomical compartments","data","INTRODUCTION","host protection","\u03B14\u03B21","modulation","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Much of this new data is increasingly structural in nature, and is often difficult to coordinate with other data sets. There is a legitimate need for integrating and visualizing these disparate data sets to reveal structural relationships not apparent when looking at these data in isolation. RESULTS: We have applied object-oriented technology to develop a downloadable visualization tool, Genome3D, for integrating and displaying epigenomic data within a prescribed three-dimensional physical model of the human genome. In order to integrate and visualize large volume of data, novel statistical and mathematical approaches have been developed to reduce the size of the data. To our knowledge, this is the first such tool developed that can visualize human genome in three-dimension. We describe here the major features of Genome3D and discuss our multi-scale data framework using a representative basic physical model. We then demonstrate many of the issues and benefits of multi-resolution data integration. CONCLUSIONS: Genome3D is a software visualization tool that explores a wide range of structural genomic and epigenetic data. Data from various sources of differing scales can be integrated within a hierarchical framework that is easily adapted to new developments concerning the structure of the physical genome. In addition, our tool has a simple annotation mechanism to incorporate non-structural information. Genome3D is unique is its ability to manipulate large amounts of multi-resolution data from diverse sources to uncover complex and new structural relationships within the genome.","publish_time":"2010-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Asbury, Thomas M; Mitman, Matt; Tang, Jijun; Zheng, W Jim","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a0731d1284b815e6139b1a40a4cc1f3b68dd4f3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2941692.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-11-444; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20813045/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new data","epigenomic data","epigenetic data","large volume of data","disparate data sets","large amounts of multi-resolution data","multi-scale data framework","benefits of multi-resolution data integration","physical genome","new structural relationships","human genome","New technologies","new developments","downloadable visualization tool","software visualization tool","wide range of structural genomic","epigenomic information","major features of Genome3D","representative basic physical model","prescribed three-dimensional physical model","diverse sources","various sources of differing scales","types of genomic","non-structural information","hierarchical framework","simple annotation mechanism","ability","object-oriented technology","mathematical approaches","measurement","issues","structure","nature","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","order","BACKGROUND","addition","legitimate need","isolation","size","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

It was rather related to, but serologically different from, canine adenoviruses. We propose that the latter, isolated from Asian parti-colored bat, should be assigned to a novel species of Bat mastadenovirus. Both isolates replicated in various mammalian cell lines, implying their wide cell tropism. To gain insight into cell tropism of these BtAdVs, we investigated the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CXADR) for virus entry to the cells. We prepared CXADR-knockout canine kidney cells and found that replication of BtAdVs was significantly hampered in these cells. For confirmation, their replication in canine CXADR-addback cells was rescued to the levels with the original cells. We also found that viral replication was corrected in human or bat CXADR-transduced cells to similar levels as in canine CXADR-addback cells.

The MERS-CoV outbreak can be considered a typical public health crisis in that the public was not only greatly terrorized by the actual fear of the disease, but also experienced a great impact to their daily lives, all in a short period of time. Preparedness for and an appropriate response to a public health crisis require comprehensive systematic public healthcare measures to address risks comprehensively with an all-hazards approach.

Abstract At the end of the 70s, it was said that eradicating infectious diseases was possible. With the occurrence of AIDS and the discovery of new pathogens the come-back of infectious diseases was noted, 15 to 20 years later, and the concept of emerging infections was defined. An emerging infection is the appearance of a new infection or the increase of its incidence if not new. It also includes infections for which the incidence could increase because of favorable conditions. Several scenarios can be proposed: 1) the appearance of a new infection (AIDS or SARS); 2) the appearance of a known infection where it did not exist previously (West Nile virus infection in the USA); 3) an infection that existed but that was not diagnosed or could not be linked precisely to a particular infectious agent (hepatitis C before the discovery of the hepatitis C virus; 4) a known infection that increases its usual incidence (outbreaks\u2026); 5) infectious diseases for which current conditions may facilitate transmission (decrease of immunization coverage...). The deliberate release of a biological agent is one of the possible scenarios of emergence. Qualitative changes of infectious agents such as the resistance to anti-infectious agents may also contribute, through a selection mechanism, to the emergence of new infectious threat. Emerging infections result from the interaction between the agent, the host, and environment evolving according to human activity. Surveillance, research, laboratory capacity, and an effective public health system are key factors for their control.","publish_time":"2005-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Desenclos, J.-C.; De Valk, H.","journal":"M\u00E9decine et Maladies Infectieuses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/60e14b8a9c26c1cfb37d95fef2c3f95bc6f2f0b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127485.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X04002860; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0399077X04002860","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs0NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["West Nile","\u00C9tats-Unis"],"keyphrases":["the hepatitis","the host","the concept","to the emergence","the possible scenarios","before the discovery","The deliberate release","With the occurrence","new infection or the increase","new pathogens the come","Emerging infections result from the interaction between the agent","An emerging infection is the appearance","Abstract At the end","infectious agents such as the resistance to","West Nile virus infection in the USA","particular infectious agent","It also includes infections for which the incidence could increase because","new infectious threat","infectious diseases was noted","agent infectieux donn\u00E9","infections \u00E9mergentes","emerging infections was defined","an infection that existed but that was","conditions de transmission","it was said that eradicating infectious diseases was possible","infectious agents may also contribute","known infection that increases its usual incidence","biological agent is","known infection where it did","d\u00E9couverte de nouveaux agents infectieux","its incidence if","fait de conditions propices","favorable conditions","\u00E9mergences infectieuses","fin des maladies infectieuses","be linked precisely to","which current conditions may facilitate transmission","AIDS or SARS","surveillance","retour des maladies infectieuses","lieu donn\u00E9","environment evolving according to human activity","an effective public health","haut niveau","niveau moyen","apparition du sida","sort du lot","partie des sc\u00E9narios","Diff\u00E9rents sc\u00E9narios","fin des ann\u00E9es","Several scenarios can be proposed","exist previously","diagnosed","through","selection mechanism","decrease","key factors","laboratory capacity","capacit\u00E9 de r\u00E9ponse","years later","outbreaks","Qualitative changes","expertise microbiologique","r\u00E9surgence","r\u00E9sistance","h\u00E9patite","immunization coverage","attention","environnement","research","modifications qualitatives","syst\u00E8me de sant\u00E9 publique","their control","mani\u00E8re pr\u00E9cise","baisse de la couverture vaccinale","\u00E9pid\u00E9mie","fluctuations habituelles","bioterrorisme","novo","VHC","\u00C9tats","m\u00E9canisme de s\u00E9lection","naissance","lutte","h\u00F4te","activit\u00E9 humaine","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","SRAS","terme \u00E9pid\u00E9miologique"],"language":"fr"},

Among them the 2015 middle eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak imposed great psychological stress on almost all Korean citizens. Following the MERS outbreak, government is reviewing overall infectious disease management system and prioritizing the establishment of mental health service systems for infectious disease. This study makes suggestions for implementing disaster-related mental health service systems by analyzing the example of Gyeonggi Province, which proactively intervened with residents\u2019 psychological problems caused by the large-scale outbreak of an infectious disease. CASE DESCRIPTION: Mental health service system for MERS victims had the following two parts: a mental health service for people who had been placed in quarantine and a service provided to families of patients who had died or recovered patients. The government of Gyeonggi province, public health centers, regional and local Community Mental Health Centers and the National Center for Crisis Mental Health Management participated in this service system. Among 1221 Gyeonggi people placed in quarantine and who experienced psychological and emotional difficulties, 350 required continuing services; 124 of this group received continuing services. That is, 35 % of people who required psychological intervention received contact from service providers and received the required services. CONCLUSIONS: This study reflects a proactive monitoring system for thousands of people placed under quarantine for the first time in Korea. It is significant that the service utilization rate by a proactive manner, that is the professionals administering it actively approached and contacted people with problems rather than passively providing information was much higher than other general mental health situation in Korea. The core value of public mental health services is adequate public accessibility; it is therefore essential for governments to strengthen their professional competence and establish effective systems. These criteria should also be applied to psychological problems caused by disastrous infectious disease outbreaks.","publish_time":"2016-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yoon, Mi-Kyung; Kim, Soon-Young; Ko, Hye-Sun; Lee, Myung-Soo","journal":"Int J Ment Health Syst","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9c950cf19a2048596a6e143471fb2d0c009d8f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4976505.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27504141/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13033-016-0083-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs0ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Community Mental Health Centers","National Center for Crisis Mental Health Management"],"locations":["Korea"],"keyphrases":["establishment of mental health service systems","Crisis Mental Health Management","disaster-related mental health service systems","general mental health situation","public health centers","service providers","core value of public mental health services","local Community Mental Health Centers","Gyeonggi people","infectious disease management system","required services","service utilization rate","MERS outbreak","psychological intervention","residents\u2019 psychological problems","continuing services","quarantine","thousands of people","contacted people","disastrous infectious disease outbreaks","proactive monitoring system","great psychological stress","government of Gyeonggi province","MERS victims","large-scale outbreak","effective systems","example of Gyeonggi Province","study","adequate public accessibility","proactive manner","families of patients","National Center","parts","middle eastern respiratory syndrome","diverse kind of disasters","CASE DESCRIPTION","professional competence","emotional difficulties","suggestions","group","Korean citizens","governments","days","professionals","BACKGROUND","information","CONCLUSIONS","time","criteria"],"language":"en"},

The model exhibits two equilibria, namely, the disease-free and a unique endemic equilibrium. The existence and local stability of the disease free and endemic equilibria are explored in terms of the effective reproduction number R C . It is observed that media coverage does not affect the effective reproduction number, but it helps to mitigate disease burden by lowering the number of infectious individuals at the endemic steady state and also lowering the infection peak. A new approach is proposed to estimate the coefficient of media coverage. Using the results of central manifold theory, it is established that as R C passes through unity, transcritical bifurcation occurs in the system and the unique endemic equilibrium is asymptotically stable. It is observed that the population level impact of quarantine and isolation depend on the level of transmission by the isolated individuals. Moreover, the higher level of pre-existing immunity in the population decreases the infection peak and causes its early arrival. Theoretical findings are supported by numerical simulation.

In addition, the presence or absence of neutrophil survival factors was investigated in specimens collected from cats with FIP. Furthermore, it was investigated whether macrophages, one of the target cells of FIPV infection, produce neutrophil survival factors (TNF-alpha, GM-CSF, and G-CSF). We showed that virus-infected macrophages overproduce neutrophil survival factors, and these factors act on neutrophils and up-regulate their survival. These observations suggest that sustained production of neutrophil survival factors by macrophages during FCoV infection is sufficient for neutrophil survival and contributes to development of granulomatous lesions.","publish_time":"2009-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Takano, Tomomi; Azuma, Natsuko; Satoh, Miyuki; Toda, Ayako; Hashida, Yoshikiyo; Satoh, Ryoichi; Hohdatsu, Tsutomu","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8053c5eb9a0e8e0c41c12bf072c8e19607ffa527.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086964.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-009-0371-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19343474/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs1MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["absence of neutrophil survival factors","Neutrophils of cats","sustained production of neutrophil survival factors","cell survival rate","wild cats","infiltration of neutrophils","typical finding of FIP","FCoV infection","development of granulomatous lesions","virus-infected macrophages","viral disease","GM-CSF","feline coronavirus","G-CSF","fatal disease of domestic","Feline infectious peritonitis","target cells of FIPV infection","TNF-alpha","presence","specimens","changes","observations","reason","addition","study"],"language":"en"},

The duration of immunity provided by an inactivated FeLV vaccine, Versifel FeLV, when administered to cats of the target age was determined. Kittens received two vaccinations when aged 7 to 9 weeks old, and were subsequently challenged up to 36 months later with the FeLV-A Glasgow isolate. RESULTS: In all studies, all of the younger aged control kittens showed persistent FeLV p27 antigenaemia confirming that the challenge virus was severe and efficacious. In contrast, the control cats did not show the required level of persistent antigenaemia, with a maximum of 45% cats affected in the middle duration study and only 10% in the longer study. However, apart from one animal in the short duration study, all of the cats vaccinated with Versifel FeLV were negative for persistent antigenaemia and can be considered treatment successes. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we have shown that although age-related resistance to infection with a virulent FeLV challenge is evident from as early as 10 months of age, vaccination with Versifel FeLV may aid in the protection of cats from FeLV related disease up to three years after primary vaccination as kittens.","publish_time":"2012-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilson, Stephen; Greenslade, Juliet; Saunders, Gillian; Holcroft, Catherine; Bruce, Lynn; Scobey, Andy; Childers, Tedd; Sture, Gordon; Thompson, James","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/849541788c0fe480a2fb9e13b20f3937e759b249.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3433334.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-8-125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22839692/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs1MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Versifel FeLV","persistent FeLV p27 antigenaemia","virulent FeLV challenge","FeLV related disease","control cats","inactivated FeLV vaccine","protection of cats","short duration study","middle duration study","challenge virus","required level of persistent antigenaemia","younger aged control kittens","duration of immunity","months of age","longer study","CONCLUSION","primary vaccination","target age","Feline leukaemia virus","years","infection","pathogen","BACKGROUND","age-related resistance","fatal illness","products","studies","animal","maximum","high demand","treatment successes","vaccinations","Glasgow isolate","contrast","weeks old","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

To construct the multi-functional DNA (MF-DNA) as a bioprobe, the 3 W J was introduced. The proposed AIV detection bioprobe should contain three functionalities: target recognition, signal amplification, and connection to substrate. To achieve this goal, each piece of the DNA 3 W J was tailored to a hemagglutinin (HA) binding aptamer, FAM dye and thiol group, respectively. The assembly of each DNA 3 W J functional fragment was then confirmed by TBM-Native PAGE. Moreover, the hAuSN was immobilized on the indium-tin-oxide (ITO) substrate for LSPR measurement. The DNA 3 W J was immobilized onto the hAuSN electrode through the thiol-group of DNA 3 W J.

The co-evolutionary history of bats with viruses has been hypothesized to have shaped the bat-virus relationship, allowing both to exist in equilibrium. Progress in understanding bat-virus interactions and the isolation of bat-borne viruses has been accelerated in recent years by the development of susceptible bat cell lines. Viral sequences similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) have been detected in bats, and filoviruses such as Marburg virus have been isolated from bats, providing definitive evidence for the role of bats as the natural host reservoir. Although viruses can be readily detected in bats using molecular approaches, virus isolation is far more challenging. One of the limitations in using traditional culture systems from non-reservoir species is that cell types and culture conditions may not be compatible for isolation of bat-borne viruses. There is, therefore, a need to develop additional bat cell lines that correspond to different cell types, including less represented cell types such as immune cells, and culture them under more physiologically relevant conditions to study virus host interactions and for virus isolation. In this review, we highlight the current progress in understanding bat-virus interactions in bat cell line systems and some of the challenges and limitations associated with cell lines. Future directions to address some of these challenges to better understand host-pathogen interactions in these intriguing mammals are also discussed, not only in relation to viruses but also other pathogens carried by bats including bacteria and fungi.","publish_time":"2018-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Banerjee, Arinjay; Misra, Vikram; Schountz, Tony; Baker, Michelle L.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71ac098f605346dbce9c89ab4bb450c5426c41d4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114677.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2018.02.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29454637/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170217308201; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170217308201","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs1MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus isolation","isolation of bat","bat-virus relationship","understanding bat-virus interactions","additional bat cell lines","Marburg virus","bat cell line systems","role of bats","Abstract Bats","study virus host interactions","development of susceptible bat cell lines","represented cell types","different cell types","co-evolutionary history of bats","host-pathogen interactions","variety of emerging viruses","culture conditions","natural host reservoir","severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus","traditional culture systems","challenges","limitations","significant disease","relevant conditions","natural reservoirs","current progress","clinical disease","non-reservoir species","Viral sequences similar","domestic animals","SARS-CoV","humans","immune cells","recent years","pathogens","definitive evidence","need","molecular approaches","intriguing mammals","bacteria","filoviruses","review","fungi","Future directions","equilibrium"],"language":"en"},

A cluster of dominant T-cell epitopes of SARS CoV-N protein was found in the N-terminus (amino acids 76\u2013114). On the basis of this study, four different plasmids were constructed: (i) DNA encoding the unmodified N (p-N) or N(70\u2212122) (p-N(70\u2212122)) as an endogenous cytoplasmic protein or (ii) DNA encoding a lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP) chimera with N (p-LAMP/N) or N(70\u2212122) (p-LAMP/N(70\u2212122)). The immune responses of mice to these four constructs were evaluated. The results showed marked differences in the responses of the immunized mice. A single priming immunization with the p-LAMP/N construct was sufficient to elicit an antibody response. Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay indicated that p-LAMP/N(70\u2212122) and p-LAMP/N plasmids both elicited a greater IFN-\u03B3 response than p-N. p-N and p-N(70\u2212122) constructs induced low or undetectable levels of cytokine secretion.

These findings show that DNA vaccines, even epitope-based DNA vaccines using LAMP as chimera, can elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses.","publish_time":"2009-09-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, K; Sun, K; Srinivasan, K N; Salmon, J; Marques, E T; Xu, J; August, J T","journal":"Gene Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bcf1bc15c1b56c4dd0cc08b1eaa1cee1a6411e0e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091638.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19727132/; https://doi.org/10.1038/gt.2009.92","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs1NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["p-N","N construct","N plasmids","unmodified N","N-terminus","p-LAMP","different forms of SARS CoV-N plasmid","cluster of dominant T-cell epitopes of SARS CoV-N protein","immune responses of mice","immunized mice","\u03B3 responses of Balb","cellular immune responses","long-lasting T-cell memory response","chimera","greater IFN-\u03B3 response","epitope-based DNA vaccines","antibody response","c mice","different plasmids","endogenous cytoplasmic protein","constructs","lysosome-associated membrane protein","previous study","additional boost","Gupta et","ELISpot","assay","undetectable levels of cytokine secretion","months","Enzyme-linked immunospot","single priming immunization","marked differences","immunizations","results","spectrum of interferon","amino acids","basis","findings","software"],"language":"en"},

To study the replication of coronavirus genome, six monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) RdRp were generated and characterized. His-tagged RdRp was expressed in baculovirus, purified and used as immunogen to produce mAbs. The TGEV RdRp was recognized by these mAbs in the context of virus infection by immunofluorescence analysis and Western blot. Epitope mapping by Pepscan indicated that RdRp mAbs recognized four non-overlapping linear epitopes located in a 62-amino acid region of the N-terminal domain, suggesting that this region may constitute an immunodominant domain.

The full-length genome of QdCoV detected in quails with enteritis in Poland has similar organization as Middle Eastern viruses although there is no NSP7c gene. The overall degree of nucleotide sequence identity was 92.4\u201392.6% between Polish PL/G032/2015 and Middle Eastern UAE-HKU30 QdCoV isolates. The sequences of the individual genes show similar nucleotide identities in the range of 91.4\u201394.7% with the exception of the S gene with lower identity of 85.6\u201385.7%. The most variable part of the S gene is its fragment encoding the N-terminal domain of the S protein which is responsible for receptor binding. The amino acid homology in this region between PL/G032/2015 and UAE-HKU30 QdCoVs was 74.5\u201374.7%.

To address the deficiencies in our understanding of the molecular events characterizing acute respiratory illness-induced asthma exacerbations, we undertook a transcriptional profiling study of the nasal mucosa over the course of acute respiratory illness amongst individuals with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis and no underlying respiratory disease. METHODS: Transcriptional profiling experiments were performed using the Agilent Whole Human Genome 4X44K array platform. Time point-based microarray and principal component analyses were conducted to identify and distinguish acute respiratory illness-associated transcriptional profiles over the course of our study. Gene enrichment analysis was conducted to identify biological processes over-represented within each acute respiratory illness-associated profile, and gene expression was subsequently confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: We found that acute respiratory illness is characterized by dynamic, time-specific transcriptional profiles whose magnitudes of expression are influenced by underlying respiratory disease and the mucosal repair signature evoked during acute respiratory illness. Most strikingly, we report that people with asthma who experience acute respiratory illness-induced exacerbations are characterized by a reduced but prolonged inflammatory immune response, inadequate activation of mucosal repair, and the expression of a newly described exacerbation-specific transcriptional signature. CONCLUSION: Findings from our study represent a significant contribution towards clarifying the complex molecular interactions that typify acute respiratory illness-induced asthma exacerbations.","publish_time":"2014-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"McErlean, Peter; Berdnikovs, Sergejs; Favoreto, Silvio; Shen, Junqing; Biyasheva, Assel; Barbeau, Rebecca; Eisley, Chris; Barczak, Andrea; Ward, Theresa; Schleimer, Robert P; Erle, David J; Boushey, Homer A; Avila, Pedro C","journal":"Genome Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d311746113fa03b25d129db6c7acc6182499d679.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3971347.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24433494/; https://doi.org/10.1186/gm520","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs2MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Agilent Whole Human Genome"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["course of acute respiratory illness","acute respiratory illness-induced exacerbations","acute respiratory illness-induced asthma exacerbations","acute respiratory illness-associated profile","underlying respiratory disease","transcriptional profiling study","history of asthma","leading cause of asthma exacerbations","time-specific transcriptional profiles","Transcriptional profiling experiments","gene expression","described exacerbation-specific transcriptional signature","mucosal repair signature","magnitudes of expression","inadequate activation of mucosal repair","molecular events","complex molecular interactions","Gene enrichment analysis","Time point-based microarray","Agilent","prolonged inflammatory immune response","nasal mucosa","allergic rhinitis","individuals","Human Genome 4X44K array platform","principal component analyses","significant contribution","mechanisms","biological processes over-","understanding","quantitative polymerase chain reaction","Findings","association","METHODS","people","BACKGROUND","deficiencies","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

To facilitate the dynamic and efficient allocation of service resources, it is crucial to understand the factors linked with use of the services and number of hospital admissions arising from PE link service. METHODS: We initially use the Poisson generalized linear model (GLM) with polynomial effect functions of relevant covariates. If the time series of residuals from fitting the Poisson GLM reveals significant serial correlation, a Poisson generalized linear autoregressive moving average (GLARMA) model is refitted to the data to account for the auto-correlation among the time series of daily call numbers. If the data is overdispersed relative to the best fitting Poisson GLARMA model, then the negative binomial GLARMA model is refitted to account for any overdispersion. In all the models, dummy variables for weekdays and months are included to account for any cyclic trends due weekday effect or month of the year effect. The secular time trend is modeled by a polynomial function of calendar time over the study period. Finally any critical temperatures are identified by visually inspecting the graph of the effect function of temperature. RESULTS: The weekday and month effects are both significant with Monday seeing more PE Link calls than Sunday and June seeing less than January. Temperature has significant effect on the PE Link call rate with the effect highly nonlinear. A critical temperature, below which excessive increase in PE link calls that lead to hospital admissions, is identified to be around 15 \u00B0C. CONCLUSION: Identifying a threshold temperature which generates an excessive increase in the expected number of PE Link calls would be useful in service provision planning and support for elderly in need of hospital admission.","publish_time":"2015-08-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Feng; Yip, Paul SF","journal":"BMC Med Inform Decis Mak","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3065f9bd3f5cbaad08a1f0e35f5781ccd0857cd7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4654920.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26590158/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-015-0191-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs2NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Hong Kong Senior Citizen Home Safety Association","Poisson GLM"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["PE link service","significant effect","weekday effect","effect function of temperature","Personal Emergency Link Service","year effect","expected number of PE Link calls","Poisson GLM","linear model","service provision","account","best fitting Poisson GLARMA model","threshold temperature","total care service","number of hospital admissions","time series of daily","time series of residuals","negative binomial GLARMA model","polynomial function of calendar time","polynomial effect functions of relevant covariates","emergency relief","emergency contact","excessive increase","significant serial correlation","efficient allocation of service resources","secular time trend","older adults","data","use","need of hospital admission","auto-correlation","month effects","critical temperatures","Hong Kong Senior Citizen Home Safety Association","linear autoregressive moving average","elderly","support","response","weekdays","telephone system","services","cyclic trends","rate","unexpected long cold spell","dummy variables","months","study period","models","factors","RESULTS","clock","numbers","graph","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","overdispersion","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Based on an approach developed in shake flask cultures, this strategy was established in benchtop bioreactors, comprising the growth of suspension AGE1.CR.pIX cells to high cell densities in a chemically defined medium before infection with the MVA-CR19 virus strain. First, a perfusion regime was established to optimize the cell growth phase. Second, a fed-batch regime was chosen for the initial infection phase to facilitate virus uptake and cell-to-cell spreading. Afterwards, a switch to perfusion enabled the continuous supply of nutrients for the late stages of virus propagation. With maximum infectious titers of 1.0 \u00D7 10(10) IU/mL, this hybrid fed-batch/perfusion strategy increased product titers by almost one order of magnitude compared to conventional batch cultivations. Finally, this strategy was also applied to the production of influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus considered for manufacturing of inactivated vaccines. Using the same culture system, a total number of 3.8 \u00D7 10(10) virions/mL was achieved. Overall, comparable or even higher cell-specific virus yields and volumetric productivities were obtained using the same cultivation systems as for the conventional batch cultivations. In addition, most viral particles were found in the culture supernatant, which can simplify further downstream operations, in particular for MVA viruses. Considering the current availability of well-described perfusion/cell retention technologies, the present strategy may contribute to the development of new approaches for viral vaccine production.

In bats, the only known species of the genus is Babesia vesperuginis. However, except a few old reports, the host range and geographical distribution of this bat parasite have been poorly studied. This study aimed to investigate the presence of piroplasms in tissues of bats collected in four different countries from eastern and central Europe: Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania. METHODS: A total of 461 bat carcasses (24 species) were collected between 2001 and 2016 from caves, mines and buildings. PCR was performed using specific primers targeting a portion of the 18S rDNA nuclear gene and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 mitochondrial gene, followed by sequencing. RESULTS: The results of this study show for the first time the presence of B. vesperuginis in bats in central and eastern Europe. The phylogenetic analysis of the 18S rDNA nuclear gene revealed no variability between the sequences and the phylogenetic analysis of the cox1 mitochondrial gene proved that B. vesperuginis could be divided into two subclades. CONCLUSION: Our study showed a broad geographical distribution of B. vesperuginis in European bats, reporting its presence in five new host species (M. cf. alcathoe, M. bechsteinii, M. myotis, Pi. nathusii and V. murinus) and three new countries.

We aimed to describe the CT findings across different timepoints throughout the disease course. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (confirmed by next-generation sequencing or RT-PCR) who were admitted to one of two hospitals in Wuhan and who underwent serial chest CT scans were retrospectively enrolled. Patients were grouped on the basis of the interval between symptom onset and the first CT scan: group 1 (subclinical patients; scans done before symptom onset), group 2 (scans done \u22641 week after symptom onset), group 3 (\u003E1 week to 2 weeks), and group 4 (\u003E2 weeks to 3 weeks). Imaging features and their distribution were analysed and compared across the four groups. FINDINGS: 81 patients admitted to hospital between Dec 20, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. The cohort included 42 (52%) men and 39 (48%) women, and the mean age was 49\u00B75 years (SD 11\u00B70). The mean number of involved lung segments was 10\u00B75 (SD 6\u00B74) overall, 2\u00B78 (3\u00B73) in group 1, 11\u00B71 (5\u00B74) in group 2, 13\u00B70 (5\u00B77) in group 3, and 12\u00B71 (5\u00B79) in group 4. The predominant pattern of abnormality observed was bilateral (64 [79%] patients), peripheral (44 [54%]), ill-defined (66 [81%]), and ground-glass opacification (53 [65%]), mainly involving the right lower lobes (225 [27%] of 849 affected segments). In group 1 (n=15), the predominant pattern was unilateral (nine [60%]) and multifocal (eight [53%]) ground-glass opacities (14 [93%]). Lesions quickly evolved to bilateral (19 [90%]), diffuse (11 [52%]) ground-glass opacity predominance (17 [81%]) in group 2 (n=21). Thereafter, the prevalence of ground-glass opacities continued to decrease (17 [57%] of 30 patients in group 3, and five [33%] of 15 in group 4), and consolidation and mixed patterns became more frequent (12 [40%] in group 3, eight [53%] in group 4). INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 pneumonia manifests with chest CT imaging abnormalities, even in asymptomatic patients, with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progressed to or co-existed with consolidations within 1\u20133 weeks. Combining assessment of imaging features with clinical and laboratory findings could facilitate early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.

Study Design Prospective cohort study. Methods Compound growth rates were calculated using cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases from January 21, 2020, to March 31, 2020 in all 3,139 US counties. Compound growth was chosen as it gives a single number that can be used in machine learning to represent speed of virus spread during defined time intervals. Statistical analyses and a random forest machine learning model were used to analyze the data for differences in counties with and without shelter in place orders. Results Statistical analyses revealed that the March 16 presidential recommendation (limiting gatherings to \u003C 10 people) lowered the compound growth rate of COVID-19 for all counties in the US by 6.6%, and the counties that implemented SIP after March 16 had a further reduction of 7.8% over the counties with no SIP after March 16. A random forest machine learning model was built to predict compound growth rate after a SIP order and was found to have an accuracy of 92.3%. The random forest found that population, longitude, and population per square mile were the most important features when predicting the effect of SIP. Conclusions Shelter in place orders were found to be effective at reducing the growth rate of COVID-19 cases in the US.

Efficient eukaryotic \u22121 PRF requires an optimally placed stimulator structure downstream of the frameshifting site and different strategies targeting viral \u22121 PRF stimulators have been developed. However, accessing particular \u22121 PRF stimulator information represents a bottle-neck in combating the emerging epidemic viral pathogens such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Recently, an RNA hairpin upstream of frameshifting site was shown to act as a cis-element to attenuate \u22121 PRF with mechanism unknown. Here, we show that an upstream duplex formed in-trans, by annealing an antisense to its complementary mRNA sequence upstream of frameshifting site, can replace an upstream hairpin to attenuate \u22121 PRF efficiently. This finding indicates that the formation of a proximal upstream duplex is the main determining factor responsible for \u22121 PRF attenuation and provides mechanistic insight.

Nidoviruses are characterized by their polycistronic plus-stranded RNA genome, the production of subgenomic mRNAs and the conservation of a specific array of replicase domains, including key RNA-synthesizing enzymes. Coronaviruses (26\u201334 kilobases) have the largest known RNA genomes and their replication presumably requires a processive RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and enzymatic functions that suppress the consequences of the typically high error rate of viral RdRps. The arteriviruses have significantly smaller genomes and form an intriguing package with the coronaviruses to analyse viral RdRp evolution and function. The RdRp domain of nidoviruses resides in a cleavage product of the replicase polyprotein named non-structural protein (nsp) 12 in coronaviruses and nsp9 in arteriviruses. In all nidoviruses, the C-terminal RdRp domain is linked to a conserved N-terminal domain, which has been coined NiRAN (nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyl transferase). Although no structural information is available, the functional characterization of the nidovirus RdRp and the larger enzyme complex of which it is part, has progressed significantly over the past decade. In coronaviruses several smaller, non-enzymatic nsps were characterized that direct RdRp function, while a 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exoribonuclease activity in nsp14 was implicated in fidelity.

We now recognize three classes of viral membrane fusion proteins based on structural criteria and four mechanisms of fusion triggering. After reviewing general features of viral membrane fusion proteins and viral fusion in endosomes, we delve into three characterized mechanisms for viral fusion triggering in endosomes: by low pH, by receptor binding plus low pH, and by receptor binding plus the action of a protease. We end with a discussion of viruses that may employ novel endosomal fusion triggering mechanisms. A key take home message is that enveloped viruses that enter cells by fusing in endosomes traverse the endocytic pathway until they reach an endosome that has all of the environmental conditions (pH, proteases, ions, intracellular receptors, and lipid composition) to (if needed) prime and (in all cases) trigger the fusion protein and to support membrane fusion.","publish_time":"2016-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"White, Judith M.; Whittaker, Gary R.","journal":"Traffic","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb763cf6326926404f8d13028d5c3aea6a358a83.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4866878.xml.json","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/tra.12389; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26935856/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tra.12389","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ari Helenius"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral fusion triggering","mechanisms of fusion triggering","mechanisms of viral membrane fusion proteins","endosomes","classes of viral membrane fusion proteins","novel endosomal fusion triggering mechanisms","general features of viral membrane fusion proteins","field of enveloped virus fusion","low pH","characterized mechanisms","different enveloped viruses","receptor binding","discussion of viruses","endosomal cues","structural criteria","proteases","seminal paper","intracellular receptors","structures","environmental conditions","home message","Journal of Cell Biology","great deal","lipid composition","Ari Helenius","intervening years","action","endocytic pathway","cells","cases"],"language":"en"},

The highest MHC variability, both in terms of the number of individual alleles and gene copies, has so far been found in passerine birds; this is probably attributable to passerine adaptation to both a wide geographic range and a diverse array of habitats. If extraordinary high MHC variation and duplication rates are adaptive features under selection during the evolution of ecologically and taxonomically diverse species, then similarly diverse MHC architectures should be found in bats. Bats are an extremely species-rich mammalian group that is globally widely distributed. Many bat species roost in multitudinous groups and have high contact rates with pathogens, conspecifics, and allospecifics. We have characterized the MHC class I diversity in 116 Panamanian Seba\u2019s short-tailed bats (Carollia perspicillata), a widely distributed, generalist, neotropical species. We have detected a remarkable individual and population-level diversity of MHC class I genes, with between seven and 22 alleles and a unique genotype in each individual. This diversity is comparable with that reported in passerine birds and, in both taxonomic groups, further variability has evolved through length polymorphisms. Our findings support the hypothesis that, for species with a geographically broader range, high MHC class I variability is particularly adaptive. Investigation of the details of the underlying adaptive processes and the role of the high MHC diversity in pathogen resistance are important next steps for a better understanding of the role of bats in viral evolution and as carriers of several deadly zoonotic viruses.

Current evidence indicates that these viruses may employ such strategies to avert the host immune response.

Since viral proteins interact with key regulators of the host nuclear transport machinery, viruses have served as invaluable tools of discovery that led to the identification of novel constituents of nuclear transport pathways.

Novel therapeutic intervention requires knowledge of intracellular pathways responsible for viral replication, specifically those untargeted by antiretroviral drugs. An understudied phenomenon is the nucleolar localization of Rev phosphoprotein, which completes nucleocytoplasmic transport of unspliced/partially spliced HIV mRNA through multimerization with intronic cis-acting targets\u2014the Rev-response element (RRE). Rev contains a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) comprising the COOH terminus of the arginine-rich motif for accumulation within nucleoli\u2014speculated as the interaction ground for Rev with cellular proteins mediating mRNA-independent nuclear export and splicing. Functionality of Rev nucleolar access during HIV-1 production and infection was investigated in the context of deletion and single-point mutations within Rev-NoLS. Mutations induced upon Rev-NoLS are hypothesized to inactivate the HIV-1 infectious cycle. HIV-1(HXB2) replication ceased with Rev mutations lacking nucleolar access due to loss or replacement of multiple arginine residues. Rev mutations missing single arginine residues remained strictly nucleolar in pattern and participated in proviral production, however, with reduced efficiency. Viral RNA packaging also decreased in efficiency after expression of nucleolar-localizing mutations. These results were observed during propagation of variant HIV-1(NL4-3) containing nucleolar-localizing mutations within the viral backbone (M4, M5, and M6). Lentiviral particles produced with Rev single-point mutations were transducible at extremely low frequency. Similarly, HIV-1(NL4-3) Rev-NoLS variants lost infectivity, unlike virulent WT (wild type) HIV-1(NL4-3). HIV-1(NL4-3) variants were capable of CD4(\u002B) host entry and reverse transcription as WT HIV-1(NL4-3), but lacked ability to complete a full infectious cycle. We currently reveal that viral integration is deregulated in the presence of Rev-NoLS mutations.","publish_time":"2018-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arizala, Jerlisa Ann C.; Takahashi, Mayumi; Burnett, John C.; Ouellet, Dominique L.; Li, Haitang; Rossi, John J.","journal":"AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f0ec075fb3dafe5c5815a641fc8ae543b30f36fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6238656.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1089/aid.2017.0306; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29804468/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs1NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COOH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Rev mutations","Rev single","presence of Rev","NoLS mutations","Rev-NoLS variants","WT HIV","nucleolar-localizing mutations","nucleolar localization of Rev phosphoprotein","Functionality of Rev nucleolar access","NL4","Rev-response element","spliced HIV mRNA","complete suppression of HIV","expression of nucleolar","propagation of variant HIV","nucleolar localization signal","viral replication","single arginine residues","viral backbone","viral integration","Viral RNA packaging","infectious cycle","replacement of multiple arginine residues","arginine-rich motif","virulent WT","proviral production","reduced efficiency","antiretroviral drugs","Combination antiretroviral therapy","mRNA-independent nuclear export","cellular proteins","knowledge of intracellular pathways responsible","multimerization","loss","intronic cis-acting targets","host entry","infectivity","nucleocytoplasmic transport of unspliced","nucleoli","Novel therapeutic intervention","interaction ground","COOH terminus","reverse transcription","M4","wild type","pattern","splicing","accumulation","M5","capable of CD4","drug resistance","HXB2","understudied phenomenon","persistent latency","low frequency","context of deletion","RRE","infection","Lentiviral particles","results","M6","ability"],"language":"en"},

Much of the existing academic writing focuses on North-South cooperation in global health, and emphasizes the role of security and economic interests by Northern countries as drivers of GHD. Chile presents a favourable environment for an expanded involvement in future GHD activities. However, there is little knowledge about what has been driving Chile\u2019s integration of health into foreign policy, and little effort to appropriate knowledge from international relations theories to better theoretically grasp the emergence of GHD. METHODS: To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a narrative literature review of the driving forces behind Chile\u2019s integration of health into foreign policy. Drawing on a popular analytical framework used in international relations scholarship, we identified driving forces of the integration of health into Chile foreign policy at three levels of analysis. RESULTS: At the international/global level of analysis, the main driving forces were related to national security concerns and compliance with regulations of international organizations. At the regional level, GHD was driven by a commitment to regional solidarity through mutually beneficial cooperation in response to neoliberal reforms; health coordination in emergencies; and protection of indigenous peoples. Finally, at the domestic level, drivers identified include economic interests of various productive sectors and how health regulations might impact those; the high degree of social inequity which impacts on access to healthcare; and management of natural disasters. CONCLUSION: Health actions in the context of international relations in Chile are still mainly motivated by more traditional foreign policy interests rather than by a desire to satisfy health needs per se. This seems to conform with findings of existing GHD scholarship that emphasize the importance of security and economic interests as driving forces of GHD, and how health is often appropriated instrumentally within foreign policy settings to achieve other goals. But the review also reveals that in the context of South-South cooperation (and regional health diplomacy), solidarity and normative considerations can be important driving forces as well. Finally, the review demonstrates that there has been an evolution from chiefly domestically focused health policies (e.g. maternal and child nutrition treatment) towards internationally inspired integrated policies (e.g. maternal and child nutrition promotion aligned with international guidelines).

Study design : One fecal sample was collected from a hospitalized child aged 6 months with acute watery diarrhea and dehydration. The fecal specimen was processed the same day for the rotavirus and adenovirus antigen detection. Results : The sample was positive for rotavirus antigen by one-step membrane test based on immunochromatographic assays (ICA) and enzyme immunoassays (EIA) monoclonal test but it was negative by an EIA polyclonal test, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and RT-PCR assays. In the other hand, the sample was positive for adenovirus antigen by ICA and EIA adenovirus type 40/41. Finally, the sample showed by PAGE an electrophoretic profile resembled that of reovirus.

It is critical to find new treatments. Objective To determine whether convalescent plasma transfusion may be beneficial in the treatment of critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Design, Setting, and Participants Case series of 5 critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who met the following criteria: severe pneumonia with rapid progression and continuously high viral load despite antiviral treatment; Pao2/Fio2 \u003C300; and mechanical ventilation. All 5 were treated with convalescent plasma transfusion. The study was conducted at the infectious disease department, Shenzhen Third People\u0027s Hospital in Shenzhen, China, from January 20, 2020, to March 25, 2020; final date of follow-up was March 25, 2020. Clinical outcomes were compared before and after convalescent plasma transfusion. Exposures Patients received transfusion with convalescent plasma with a SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody (IgG) binding titer greater than 1:1000 (end point dilution titer, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) and a neutralization titer greater than 40 (end point dilution titer) that had been obtained from 5 patients who recovered from COVID-19. Convalescent plasma was administered between 10 and 22 days after admission. Main Outcomes and Measures Changes of body temperature, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (range 0-24, with higher scores indicating more severe illness), Pao2/Fio2, viral load, serum antibody titer, routine blood biochemical index, ARDS, and ventilatory and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) supports before and after convalescent plasma transfusion. Results All 5 patients (age range, 36-65 years; 2 women) were receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of treatment and all had received antiviral agents and methylprednisolone. Following plasma transfusion, body temperature normalized within 3 days in 4 of 5 patients, the SOFA score decreased, and Pao2/Fio2 increased within 12 days (range, 172-276 before and 284-366 after). Viral loads also decreased and became negative within 12 days after the transfusion, and SARS-CoV-2-specific ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers increased following the transfusion (range, 40-60 before and 80-320 on day 7). ARDS resolved in 4 patients at 12 days after transfusion, and 3 patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment. Of the 5 patients, 3 have been discharged from the hospital (length of stay: 53, 51, and 55 days), and 2 are in stable condition at 37 days after transfusion. Conclusions and Relevance In this preliminary uncontrolled case series of 5 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS, administration of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody was followed by improvement in their clinical status. The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment, and these observations require evaluation in clinical trials.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shen, Chenguang; Wang, Zhaoqin; Zhao, Fang; Yang, Yang; Li, Jinxiu; Yuan, Jing; Wang, Fuxiang; Li, Delin; Yang, Minghui; Xing, Li; Wei, Jinli; Xiao, Haixia; Yang, Yan; Qu, Jiuxin; Qing, Ling; Chen, Li; Xu, Zhixiang; Peng, Ling; Li, Yanjie; Zheng, Haixia; Chen, Feng; Huang, Kun; Jiang, Yujing; Liu, Dongjing; Zhang, Zheng; Liu, Yingxia; Liu, Lei","journal":"JAMA","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32219428/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.4783","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Shenzhen Third People\u0027s Hospital","Exposures Patients","Sequential Organ Failure Assessment","ARDS","ECMO","SOFA"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["convalescent plasma transfusion","days","ill patients","Exposures Patients","administration of convalescent plasma","ARDS","COVID","specific antibody","antiviral treatment","serum antibody titer","Fio2","Pao2","SARS-CoV","time of treatment","weeks of treatment","mechanical ventilation","end point dilution titer","binding titer greater","neutralization titer greater","specific ELISA","age range","Clinical outcomes","neutralizing antibody titers","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","high viral load","severe pneumonia","severe illness","Shenzhen","specific therapeutic agents","SOFA score","study design","Viral loads","antiviral agents","following criteria","clinical trials","clinical status","acute respiratory distress syndrome","Participants Case series","Importance Coronavirus disease","Measures Changes of body temperature","preliminary uncontrolled case series","People\u0027s Hospital","Main Outcomes","infectious disease department","Sequential Organ Failure Assessment","rapid progression","routine blood biochemical index","ventilatory","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","definitive statement","Relevance","ECMO","IgG","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","limited sample size","potential effectiveness","substantial mortality","Setting","observations","evaluation","improvement","pandemic","higher scores","Conclusions","years","China","women","stable condition","laboratory","Objective","length of stay","new treatments","final date of follow-up","methylprednisolone","infection","admission"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN: This was a retrospective, multicenter clinical study. SETTING: This study used a multicenter dataset from 4 hospitals in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: Patients and health care providers with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV from January 23 to 31, 2020, at the Wuhan Union Hospital, the Wuhan Children\u0027s Hospital, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, and the Wuhan Fourth Hospital in Wuhan, China. INTERVENTIONS: Anesthetic management and infection control guidelines for emergency procedures for patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were drafted and applied in 4 hospitals in Wuhan. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Cross-infection in the operating rooms of the 4 hospitals was effectively reduced by implementing the new measures and procedures. The majority of patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection or suspected infection were female (23 [62%] of 37), and the mean age was 41.0 years old (standard deviation 19.6; range 4-78). 10 (27%) patients had chronic medical illnesses, including 4 (11%) with diabetes, 8 (22%) with hypertension, and 8 (22%) with digestive system disease.

We explore the interactions between HuNoV and concanavalin A (Con A), which could facilitate the development of a sensitive detection tool for HuNoV. Biophysical studies including hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) revealed that when the metal coordinated region of Con A, which spans Asp16 to His24, is converted to nine alanine residues (mCon AMCR), the affinity for HuNoV (GII.4) diminishes, demonstrating that this Ca2\u002B and Mn2\u002B coordinated region is responsible for the observed virus-protein interaction. The mutated carbohydrate binding region of Con A (mCon ACBR) does not affect binding affinity significantly, indicating that MCR of Con A is a major region of interaction to HuNoV (GII.4). The results further contribute to the development of a HuNoV concentration tool, Con A-immobilized polyacrylate beads (Con A-PAB), for rapid detection of genotypes from genogroups I and II (GI and GII). This method offers many advantages over currently available methods, including a short concentration time. HuNov (GI and GII) can be detected in just 15 min with 90% recovery through Con A-PAB application. In addition, this method can be used over a wide range of pH values (pH 3.0 \u2013 10.0). Overall, this rapid and sensitive detection of HuNoV (GI and GII) will aid in the prevention of virus transmission pathways, and the method developed here may have applicability for other foodborne viral infections.","publish_time":"2017-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Duwoon; Lee, Hee-Min; Oh, Kyung-Seo; Ki, Ah Young; Protzman, Rachael A.; Kim, Dongkyun; Choi, Jong-Soon; Kim, Min Ji; Kim, Sung Hyun; Vaidya, Bipin; Lee, Seung Jae; Kwon, Joseph","journal":"Biomaterials","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b27bd7226c65b62ca0a72fa49ab96c7d877234c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112440.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961217301436; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0142961217301436; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28288347/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.03.006","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SPR","GII"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sensitive detection of HuNoV","GII","HuNoV concentration tool","small amounts of HuNoV","sensitive detection tool","rapid detection of genotypes","major region of interaction","metal coordinated region","available methods","Abstract Rapid methods","mutated carbohydrate binding region","binding affinity","development","mCon AMCR","observed virus-protein interaction","mCon ACBR","PAB application","foodborne disease outbreaks","short concentration time","foodborne viral infections","wide range of pH values","prevention of virus transmission pathways","mass spectrometry","deuterium exchange","HDX","reliable techniques","surface plasmon resonance","clinical treatment of human norovirus","SPR","hydrogen","aquatic environments","Biophysical studies","applicability","Mn2","genogroups","immobilized polyacrylate beads","alanine residues","Ca2","advantages","His24","recovery","interactions","concanavalin","Asp16","results","addition"],"language":"en"},

The respective enzymes are thus excellent targets for antiviral intervention. In cell culture, activation of Ebola virus, as well as SARS- and MERS-coronavirus can be accomplished by the endosomal cysteine proteases, cathepsin L (CTSL) and cathepsin B (CTSB). In addition, SARS- and MERS-coronavirus can use serine proteases localized at the cell surface, for their activation. However, it is currently unclear which protease(s) facilitate viral spread in the infected host. We report here that the cysteine protease inhibitor K11777, ((2S)-N-[(1E,3S)-1-(benzenesulfonyl)-5-phenylpent-1-en-3-yl]-2-{[(E)-4-methylpiperazine-1-carbonyl]amino}-3-phenylpropanamide) and closely-related vinylsulfones act as broad-spectrum antivirals by targeting cathepsin-mediated cell entry. K11777 is already in advanced stages of development for a number of parasitic diseases, such as Chagas disease, and has proven to be safe and effective in a range of animal models. K11777 inhibition of SARS-CoV and Ebola virus entry was observed in the sub-nanomolar range. In order to assess, whether cysteine or serine proteases promote viral spread in the host, we compared the antiviral activity of an optimized K11777-derivative with that of camostat, an inhibitor of TMPRSS2 and related serine proteases. Employing a pathogenic animal model of SARS-CoV infection, we demonstrated that viral spread and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV is driven by serine rather than cysteine proteases and can be effectively prevented by camostat. Camostat has been clinically used to treat chronic pancreatitis, and thus represents an exciting potential therapeutic for respiratory coronavirus infections. Our results indicate that camostat, or similar serine protease inhibitors, might be an effective option for treatment of SARS and potentially MERS, while vinyl sulfone-based inhibitors are excellent lead candidates for Ebola virus therapeutics.","publish_time":"2015-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Yanchen; Vedantham, Punitha; Lu, Kai; Agudelo, Juliet; Carrion, Ricardo; Nunneley, Jerritt W.; Barnard, Dale; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan; McKerrow, James H.; Renslo, Adam R.; Simmons, Graham","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1229bfb6b2481a4afada0a99d545513d3b673c42.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4774534.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354215000248; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.01.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25666761/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354215000248","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs3OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-coronavirus","host cell proteases","related serine proteases","treatment of SARS","pathogenesis of SARS","K11777 inhibition of SARS","camostat","Ebola virus entry","activation of Ebola virus","endosomal cysteine proteases","emerging MERS-coronavirus","cysteine protease inhibitor K11777","Ebola virus therapeutics","viral spread","pathogenic animal model of SARS","similar serine protease inhibitors","cathepsin-mediated cell entry","cell culture","cell surface","respiratory coronavirus infections","CoV infection","cathepsin B","infected host","optimized K11777-derivative","order","range of animal models","excellent targets","inhibitor of TMPRSS2","antiviral activity","effective option","antiviral intervention","excellent lead candidates","related vinylsulfones act","sub-nanomolar range","vinyl sulfone-based inhibitors","broad-spectrum antivirals","CTSL","diverse viruses","number of parasitic diseases","cells","envelope glycoproteins","advanced stages of development","respective enzymes","Chagas disease","CTSB","phenylpent","benzenesulfonyl","results","addition","chronic pancreatitis"],"language":"en"},

Data from spiking studies quantifying the viral filtration performance of cellulosic filters are detailed, i.e., first, the virus reduction capacity of regenerated cellulose hollow fiber filters in the manufacturing process of blood products and, second, the efficiency of virus recovery/concentration from water samples by the viradel (virus adsorption\u2013elution) method using charge modified, electropositive cellulosic filters or conventional electronegative cellulose ester microfilters. Viral analysis of field water samples by the viradel technique is also surveyed.

We also investigated the impact of the initial concentration of proteins and sodium chloride on the persistence of infectious CVB4 on surfaces. Viral suspensions (\u003E10(4.5) TCID(50)) were applied to petri dish lids and dried under the air flow of a biosafety cabinet. The recovered viral preparations were titered on appropriate cell lines. Enveloped viruses persisted for less than 5 days while CVB4 and MVM persisted for weeks. However, repetitive cycles of drying and resuspension had a stronger virucidal effect on CVB4 than on H1N1 and HSV-1. These repetitive cycles had no effect on the infectious titer of MVM. When exposed to drying, the initial concentrations of bovine serum albumin (from 0 to 90 mg mL(\u22121)), fetal calf serum (from 0 to 100%), and sodium chloride (from 0 to 300 mg mL(\u22121)) affected the viability of CVB4. CVB4 was more likely to be inactivated by drying in a protein-rich medium, whereas the impact of drying was reduced in the presence of sodium chloride. The results of the present study demonstrated that the resistance of viruses to drying, as suggested by iterative drying, was not due to the heterogeneity of viral subpopulations, but was influenced by media compositions and component concentrations, as illustrated in the model of CVB4.","publish_time":"2015-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Firquet, Swan; Beaujard, Sophie; Lobert, Pierre-Emmanuel; San\u00E9, Famara; Caloone, Delphine; Izard, Daniel; Hober, Didier","journal":"Microbes Environ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2108a4d24bbdc526870d33ae20c9eed3f826c989.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4462923.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25843687/; https://doi.org/10.1264/jsme2.me14145","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MVM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viability of CVB4","model of CVB4","impact of drying","enveloped-viruses","iterative drying","persistence of infectious CVB4","viability of non-enveloped viruses","resistance of viruses","presence of sodium chloride","H1N1","infectious titer of MVM","HSV","present study","repetitive cycles","Viral suspensions","surfaces","minute virus of mice","recovered viral preparations","heterogeneity of viral subpopulations","initial concentrations of bovine serum albumin","herpes simplex virus type","component concentrations","initial concentration of proteins","stronger virucidal effect","fetal calf serum","air flow","resuspension","coxsackievirus B4","petri dish lids","appropriate cell lines","influenza","media compositions","biosafety cabinet","protein-rich medium","days","results","weeks","TCID"],"language":"en"},

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan. Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough. Metagenomic RNA sequencing(4) of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here \u2018WH-Human 1\u2019 coronavirus (and has also been referred to as \u20182019-nCoV\u2019). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China(5).

Eight treatment groups representing two AHP concentrations (1:16 and 1:32) in a 10% propylene glycol solution, two contact times in a -10 \u00B0C freezer (40 min and 60 min), and two levels of fecal contamination (5 mL and 10 mL) in addition to negative and positive control groups were evaluated. Forty 3-week-old pigs, intragastrically inoculated with the contents of the coupons after treatment, were used as a bioassay to determine the infectivity of PEDV after treatment. Infectivity was determined by detection of virus with a nucleocapsid (N) gene-based quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) on rectal swabs collected from the inoculated pigs on days three and seven post-inoculation. RESULTS: All post-treatment swabs from the negative control coupons were negative for PEDV via RT-qPCR. All post-treatment swabs collected from coupons in the AHP disinfectant treatment groups and the positive control group were positive for PEDV via RT-qPCR. For the bioassay, no rectal swabs from pigs in the negative control (0 of 4) or the AHP disinfectant treatment groups (0 of 32) were positive for PEDV. Rectal swabs from all pigs within the positive control group (4 of 4) were positive for PEDV by RT-qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this study, 1:16 and 1:32 dilutions of the AHP disinfectant successfully inactivated PEDV in swine feces on metal surfaces when applied at -10 \u00B0C with 40 or 60 min of contact time. This study also suggests that a positive RT-qPCR result for PEDV on an environmental sample should be expected when the AHP disinfectant is applied under freezing conditions, but does not necessarily indicate that an infectious dose of PEDV remains after disinfection.

The vaccine encodes a fusion protein composed of a truncated HBV core protein, mutated polymerase protein, and two envelope domains. In this study, we assessed the immunogenicity of Ad-HBV administered to cynomolgus monkeys during a non-clinical safety assessment. METHODS: The virus was subcutaneously administered at 1.0 \u00D7 10(9) viral particles (VP)/animal (low-dose group), 1.0 \u00D7 10(10) VP/animal (mid-dose group), and 1.0 \u00D7 10(11) VP/animal (high-dose group); the control groups were administered an Ad5-null virus (1.0 \u00D7 10(11) VP/animal) and saline only. RESULTS: Except for inflammatory cell infiltration under the skin at the injection sites and transient elevation of body temperature and serum albumin, no Ad-HBV-related toxic effects were noted in any treatment group. Moreover, interferon (IFN)-\u03B3 enzyme-linked immunospot assays showed that Ad-HBV induced the targeting of T cells to a broad spectrum of HBV-specific epitopes spanning all three of the selected HBV immunogens (core, polymerase, and envelope domains) in a dose-dependent manner. Although anti-Ad antibody was produced in all groups (except for the saline control), the antibody titers were significantly lower in the high-dose Ad-HBV group than in the group that received the same dose of the Ad-null empty vector. In addition, the IFN-\u03B3 and IL-2 expression levels in the liver were significantly improved for the mid-dose, high-dose, and Ad-null control group (p \u003C 0.05), but not for the low-dose group. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, this safety assessment indicates that the Ad-HBV candidate vaccine is a potent specific immunotherapeutic agent, supporting its further clinical development as an anti-HBV infection vaccine.

Following RIDT, the residual swab was placed into viral transport medium and tested for influenza using Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and for 20 pathogens using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction respiratory pathogen panel. Numbers of viruses in each of 7 categories (influenza A, influenza B, coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus/enterovirus) across the 3 years were compared using \u03C72.

Here we found that empiric 2-month therapy with oral NTZ was associated in the decline/elimination of RV antigen from lesions in a PID patient with RV positive granulomas, while peginterferon treatment had no effect. In addition, we characterized the effects of NTZ on cell culture models of persistent RV infection. NTZ significantly inhibited RV replication in a primary culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and Vero and A549 epithelial cell lines in a dose dependent manner with an average 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.35 \u03BCg/ml (1.1 \u03BCM).

Although HPIV-4 has been associated with mild ARTIs for years, recent investigations have also associated HPIV-4 infection with severe respiratory syndromes and with outbreaks of ARTIs in children. Objectives To characterize the role of HPIV-4 and its clinical features in children with acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTIs) in Beijing, China. Study design Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 2009 hospitalized children with ALRTIs between March 2007 and April 2010. RT-PCR and PCR analyses were used to identify HPIV types and other known respiratory viruses. Results HPIVs were detected in 246 (12.2%) patients, of whom 25 (10.2%) were positive for HPIV-4, 11 (4.5%) for HPIV-2, 51 (20.7%) for HPIV-1, 151 (61.4%) for HPIV-3, and 8 (3.3%) were co-detected with different types of HPIVs. Like HPIV-3, HPIV-4 was detected in spring, summer, and late fall over the study period. Seasonal incidence varied for HPIV-1 and -2. The median patient age was 20 months for HPIV-4 infections and 7\u201311 months for HPIV-1, -2, and -3 infections, but the clinical manifestations did not differ significantly between HPIV-1, -2, -3, and -4 infections. Moreover, co-detection of HPIV-4 (44%) with other respiratory viruses was lower than that of HPIV-1 (62.7%), HPIV-2 (63.6%), and HPIV-3 (72.7%).

In the context of disease emergence from wildlife, wildlife and habitat should be conserved, which in turn will preserve vital ecosystem structure and function, which has broader implications for human wellbeing and environmental sustainability, while simultaneously minimizing the spillover of pathogens from wild animals into human beings. In this review, we propose a novel framework for the holistic and interdisciplinary investigation of zoonotic disease emergence and its drivers, using the spillover of bat pathogens as a case study.

While there is an abundance of literature documenting corticosteroid related osteonecrosis, there is no consensus as to the relative risk of osteonecrosis after administration of steroids via parenteral, oral, topical, inhaled and other routes. This risk is an important prognostic indicator because identification and conservative intervention can potentially reduce morbidity associated with aggressive surgical treatment of osteonecrosis. This paper provides insight into establishing guidelines related to the risk of developing osteonecrosis as a result of corticosteroid use. Case studies, retrospective studies and prospective studies in humans on different corticosteroids and varied dosages were assessed. Most cases of osteonecrosis are secondary to systemically administered corticosteroids and/or high dose daily therapy, particularly in patients with underlying comorbidities including connective tissue diseases, hyperlipidemia, or previous trauma. Previous case reports of osteonecrosis related to inhaled or topical use of steroids are complicated by the fact that in the great majority of cases, the patients are also treated with systemic steroids prior to the development of osteonecrosis. Based on the literature, a set of recommendations regarding the risk of osteonecrosis in patients on steroids was formulated.","publish_time":"2010-07-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Powell, Christian; Chang, Christopher; Naguwa, Stanley M.; Cheema, Gurtej; Gershwin, M.

Early identification of the pathological agent causing these infections is essential to avoid unnecessary antibiotic use and improve patient management. Multiplex PCR techniques were recently developed to detect multiple viral pathogens using a single PCR reaction. In this study, we identify viral pathogens in children with respiratory infections. We collected 194 nasopharyngeal aspirates from infants (2\u201324 months old) with lower respiratory tract infections treated at the Vietnam National Children\u0027s Hospital between November 2014 and June 2015 and assessed the presence of 16 virus types and subtypes by multiplex PCR using the xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) assay. Overall, 73.7% of the samples were positive for at least one virus, and 24.2% corresponded to infections with multiple viruses. The most common viruses were respiratory syncytial virus and enterovirus/rhinovirus. These viruses were more frequent among younger patients (2\u20135 months old) and caused symptoms similar to those of bronchiolitis and pneumonia. The most common clinical manifestation caused by respiratory tract infection was bronchiolitis. Elevated neutrophils levels were associated with adenovirus infection. Our results showed that the xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) can effectively detect multiple viruses causing respiratory infections in children and that the nasopharyngeal aspirates are a good sample choice to detect respiratory viruses in children. Applying this approach in the clinical setting would improve patient management and allow early diagnosis, thus avoiding the unnecessary use of antibiotics.","publish_time":"2020-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pham, Hien T.; Nguyen, Phuc T.

It is widely accepted that CoV human transmission is driven by the interactions of its spike protein (S-protein) with human receptor on host cell surface; so, quantitative evaluation of these interactions may be used to assess the human transmission capability of CoVs. However, quantitative methods directly using viral genome data are still lacking. Here, we perform large-scale protein-protein docking to quantify the interactions of 2019-nCoV S-protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) with human receptor ACE2, based on experimental SARS-CoV S-RBD-ACE2 complex structure. By sampling a large number of thermodynamically probable binding conformations with Monte Carlo algorithm, this approach successfully identified the experimental complex structure as the lowest-energy receptor-binding conformations, and hence established an experiment-based strength reference for evaluating the receptor-binding affinity of 2019-nCoV via comparison with SARS-CoV. Our results show that this binding affinity is about 73% of that of SARS-CoV, supporting that 2019-nCoV may cause human transmission similar to that of SARS-CoV. Thus, this study presents a method for rapidly assessing the human transmission capability of a newly emerged CoV and its mutant strains, and demonstrates that post-genome analysis of protein-protein interactions may provide early scientific guidance for viral prevention and control.","publish_time":"2020-02-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Qiang; Herrmann, Andreas","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/836190d366ba8e34c3a5df8a24d17a36fd503505.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9a7c425acef3eafc0c37b95b8b90b4b60c66106d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.01.930537","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CoV human transmission","protein interactions","human receptor ACE2","human transmission similar","human transmission ability","nCoV S-protein receptor-binding domain","spike protein","large-scale protein-protein docking","receptor-binding affinity","experimental SARS-CoV S-RBD","emerged CoV","human transmission capability of CoVs","post-genome analysis of protein","lowest-energy receptor-binding conformations","probable binding conformations","genome evolution","experimental complex structure","ACE2 complex structure","viral genome data","viral prevention","quantitative evaluation","quantitative methods","experiment-based strength reference","early scientific guidance","approach","Monte Carlo algorithm","host cell surface","MERS","Wuhan respiratory syndrome","serious threats","mutant strains","global public health","control","large number","animal coronavirus","comparison","outbreaks","results","study"],"language":"en"},

Due to the difficulty in isolating and growing this virus in cell culture, few vaccine studies using cell culture propagated PEDV have been performed on U.S. strains in pigs. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the humoral immune response to the selected inactivated PEDV vaccine candidate in a dose-titration manner. RESULTS: PEDV was isolated from a pig with diarrhea and complete genome sequencing found \u003E99% nucleotide identity to other U.S. PEDV. Inactivated adjuvanted monovalent vaccines were administered intramuscularly to five week old pigs in a dose titration experimental design, ranging from 6.0-8.0 log(10) tissue culture infective dose (TCID(50)/mL), to evaluate immunogenicity using a fluorescent foci neutralization assay (FFN), fluorescent microsphere immunoassay (FMIA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on sera. Pigs vaccinated with 8.0 log(10) TCID(50)/mL inactivated virus showed significantly higher FFN titers as well as FMIA and ELISA values than 6.0 log(10) TCID(50)/mL vaccinates and the negative controls. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the immunogenicity of a PEDV inactivated viral vaccine with a U.S. strain via dose-titration. A future vaccination-challenge study would illustrate the efficacy of an inactivated vaccine and help evaluate protective FFN titers and ELISA and FMIA responses.","publish_time":"2015-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Collin, Emily A; Anbalagan, Srivishnupriya; Okda, Faten; Batman, Ron; Nelson, Eric; Hause, Ben M","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/72e1f47796b2283c03f3d7aa4f6044592f8c198d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4404228.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-015-0357-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25881296/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","FMIA"],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["inactivated vaccine","inactivated virus","selected inactivated PEDV vaccine candidate","log","TCID","dose-titration manner","vaccine studies","viral vaccine","cell culture","transmissible virus","tissue culture infective dose","dose titration experimental design","protective FFN titers","higher FFN titers","FMIA responses","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","ELISA values","immunogenicity","Inactivated adjuvanted monovalent vaccines","RESULTS","week old pigs","fluorescent foci neutralization assay","swine industry","fluorescent microsphere immunoassay","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","future vaccination-challenge study","help","humoral immune response","complete genome sequencing","efficacy","BACKGROUND","nucleotide identity","tremendous losses","sera","isolating","difficulty","CONCLUSIONS","strains","negative controls","objective"],"language":"en"}]}

Since the first confirmed ASF outbreak in China on 3 August 2018, 156 ASF outbreaks were detected in 32 provinces. About 1,170,000 pigs were culled in order to halt further spread. There is no effective treatment or vaccine for it and the present molecular diagnosis technologies have trade-offs in sensitivity, specificity, cost and speed, and none of them cater perfectly to ASF control. Thus, a technology that overcomes the need for laboratory facilities, is relatively low cost, and rapidly and sensitively detects ASFV would be highly valuable. Here, we describe an RAA-Cas12a-based system that combines recombinase aided amplification (RAA) and CRISPR/Cas12a for ASFV detection. The fluorescence intensity readout of this system detected ASFV p72 gene levels as low as 10 aM. For on-site ASFV detection, lateral-flow strip readout was introduced for the first time in the RAA-Cas12a based system (named CORDS, Cas12a-based On-site and Rapid Detection System). We used CORDS to detect target DNA highly specifically using the lateral-flow strip readout and the assay displayed no cross-reactivity to other 13 swine viruses including classical swine fever (CSF). CORDS could identify the ASFV DNA target at femtomolar sensitivity in an hour at 37\u00B0C, and only requires an incubator. For ease of use, the reagents of CORDS were lyophilized to three tubes and remained the same sensitivity when stored at 4\u00B0C for at least 7 days. Thus, CORDS provide a rapid, sensitive and easily operable method for ASFV on-site detection. Lyophilized CORDS can withstand long-term transportation and storage, and is ready for field-based applications.","publish_time":"2019-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bai, Jing; Lin, Haosi; Li, Haojian; Zhou, Yang; Liu, Junshan; Zhong, Guorui; Wu, Luting; Jiang, Weifan; Du, Hongli; Yang, Jinyi; Xie, Qingmei; Huang, Lizhen","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c1318a0ed68a50f13ef04c2cd0741d2e7016104.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6916198.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6916198/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozc00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ASF","ASFV","CRISPR","Rapid Detection System","CSF"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["on-site ASFV detection","ASFV on-site detection","based system","Lyophilized CORDS","ASFV DNA target","RAA-Cas12a","reagents of CORDS","Rapid Detection System","classical swine fever","swine viruses","African swine fever virus","ASFV p72 gene levels","ASF outbreaks","ASF control","lateral-flow strip readout","mortality rate of hemorrhagic African swine fever","femtomolar sensitivity","target DNA","low cost","confirmed ASF outbreak","field-based applications","fluorescence intensity readout","domestic pigs","trade-offs","recombinase aided amplification","operable method","CRISPR","present molecular diagnosis technologies","wild boars","storage","specificity","assay","China","laboratory facilities","long-term transportation","vaccine","cross-reactivity","hour","CSF","need","speed","time","ease of use","effective treatment","technology","provinces","tubes","incubator","days","order"],"language":"en"},

The current study investigated the prevalence and risk factors of BRSV in cattle in the Nineveh Province, Iraq. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between September 2017 and September 2018, 450 serum samples were collected from non-vaccinated cattle of different ages and breeds for BRSV testing. The epidemiological information of the animals was recorded. The prevalence of the disease was determined using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. RESULTS: The prevalence of BRSV was 83.11%, and it was significantly (p\u003C0.05) higher in cattle aged greater than 7 months-1.5 years than in older animals; in imported cattle than in Native animals; and in animals originating from large herds (100 animals) than in those from smaller herds (40 animals). There was no significant difference between BRSV prevalence in male and female animals. When samples from different regions of the Nineveh Governorate were compared, the northern region was associated with the highest prevalence of the disease. Samples harvested in the winter displayed the highest BRSV titer, compared to those collected during the other seasons. CONCLUSION: BRSV is prevalent in cattle from the Nineveh Governorate. Risk factors such as animal age, origin, herd size, and the herd\u2019s geographical location are associated with an increased prevalence of the disease in this region. Routine vaccination programs should be adopted to reduce the prevalence of BRSV.","publish_time":"2019-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hussain, Khder Jassiem; Al-Farwachi, Maab Ibrahim; Hassan, Sadam Dhahir","journal":"Vet World","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/437a7f66e0cb7f9fdf9d6b3ff4da80939e9ac546.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6925036.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6925036/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozgw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BRSV"],"locations":["Iraq"],"keyphrases":["prevalence of BRSV","BRSV prevalence","BRSV testing","highest prevalence","risk factors of BRSV","older animals","Native animals","female animals","increased prevalence","highest BRSV titer","imported cattle","disease","Nineveh Governorate","non-vaccinated cattle of different ages","Nineveh Province","serum samples","different regions","northern region","large herds","smaller herds","herd size","interstitial edema","animal age","breeds","Bovine respiratory syncytial virus","indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit","main causes of severe pneumonia","AIM","origin","herd\u2019s geographical location","BACKGROUND","months","emphysema","years","significant difference","winter","current study","Iraq","CONCLUSION","Routine vaccination programs","epidemiological information","RESULTS","MATERIALS","METHODS","seasons"],"language":"en"},

The present study investigated the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of TCs in a mouse model of respiratory distress. METHODS: The mouse model of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was established by intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). After instillation of TCs culture medium, lung injury was assessed, and angiogenesis markers, including CD31 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), were detected by immunofluorescence. Bioinformatics analysis was used to screen significantly differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) in cultured TCs stimulated with LPS, and the regulation of downstream angiogenesis genes by these miRNAs was analysed and verified. PI3K subunits and pathways were evaluated by using a PI3K p110\u03B1 inhibitor to study the involved mechanisms. RESULTS: In ARDS mice, instillation of TCs culture medium ameliorated LPS-induced inflammation and lung injury and increased the protein levels of CD31 and eNOS in the injured lungs. A total of 7 miRNAs and 1899 mRNAs were differentially regulated in TCs stimulated with LPS. Functional prediction analysis showed that the differentially expressed mRNAs were enriched in angiogenesis-related processes, which were highly correlated with miR-21a-3p. Culture medium from TCs with miR-21a-3p inhibition failed to promote angiogenesis in mouse models of LPS-induced ARDS. In cultured TCs, LPS stimulation upregulated the expression of miR-21a-3p, which further targeted the transcription factor E2F8 and decreased Notch2 protein expression. TCs culture medium enhanced hemangioendothelioma endothelial cells (EOMA cells) proliferation, which was blocked by the miR-21a-3p inhibitor. The PI3K p110\u03B1 inhibitor decreased vascular endothelial growth factor levels in LPS-stimulated TCs and reversed the enhancing effect of TCs culture medium on EOMA cells proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: TCs exerted protective effects under inflammatory conditions by promoting angiogenesis via miR-21a-3p. The PI3K p110\u03B1 subunit and transcriptional factor E2F8 could be involved in this process.","publish_time":"2019-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Yile; Yang, Yajie; Liang, Tao; Hu, Yan; Tang, Haihong; Song, Dongli; Fang, Hao","journal":"J Transl Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc257d55fbc9cfebd9755c7f34e4cd58bd49f12a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6933909.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6933909/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozkx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","EOMA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LPS-stimulated TCs","cultured TCs","protective effect of TCs","enhancing effect of TCs culture medium","instillation of TCs culture medium ameliorated LPS-induced inflammation","TCs culture medium enhanced hemangioendothelioma endothelial cells","LPS stimulation","mouse models of LPS","expression of miR","PI3K p110\u03B1 inhibitor","angiogenesis markers","p inhibitor","miRNAs","EOMA cells proliferation","PI3K p110\u03B1 subunit","interstitial cells","induced ARDS","PI3K subunits","angiogenesis-related processes","mouse model of respiratory distress","vascular endothelial growth factor levels","transcription factor E2F8","transcriptional factor E2F8","lung injury","protein levels of CD31","ARDS mice","eNOS","regulation of downstream angiogenesis genes","mRNAs","involved mechanisms","p inhibition","mouse model of acute respiratory distress syndrome","decreased Notch2 protein expression","intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide","endothelial nitric oxide synthase","protective effects","Bioinformatics analysis","present study","Functional prediction analysis","inflammatory conditions","tissue protection","injured lungs","METHODS","RESULTS","pathways","CONCLUSIONS","microRNAs","repair","total","BACKGROUND","Telocytes","immunofluorescence"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: In this study, we used data from the literature about methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and developed an ordinary differential equations based mathematical model to quantify the impact of contact heterogeneity on MRSA transmission in a hypothetical 6-bed intensive care unit (ICU). The susceptible patients are divided into two types, these who are cared by the same nurse as the MRSA infected patient (Type 1) and these who are not (Type 2). RESULTS: The results showed that the mean MRSA concentration on three kinds of susceptible patient nearby surfaces was significantly linearly associated with the hand-touch frequency (p \u003C 0.05). The noncompliance of daily cleaning on patient nearby high-touch surfaces (HTSs) had the most impact on MRSA transmission. If the HTSs were not cleaned, the MRSA exposure to Type 1 and 2 susceptible patients would increase 118.4% (standard deviation (SD): 33.0%) and 115.4% (SD: 30.5%) respectively. The communal surfaces (CSs) had the least impact, if CSs were not cleaned, the MRSA exposure to Type 1 susceptible patient would only increase 1.7% (SD: 1.3).

One of the only treatments is supportive: mechanical ventilation. However, improperly set mechanical ventilation can further increase the risk of death in patients with ARDS. Recent studies suggest that ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) is caused by exaggerated regional lung strain, particularly in areas of alveolar instability subject to tidal recruitment/derecruitment and stress-multiplication. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that if a ventilation strategy can maintain stable lung inflation and homogeneity, regional dynamic strain would be reduced and VILI attenuated. A time-controlled adaptive ventilation (TCAV) method was developed to minimize dynamic alveolar strain by adjusting the delivered breath according to the mechanical characteristics of the lung. The goal of this review is to describe how the TCAV method impacts pathophysiology and protects lungs with, or at high risk of, acute lung injury. We present work from our group and others that identifies novel mechanisms of VILI in the alveolar microenvironment and demonstrates that the TCAV method can reduce VILI in translational animal ARDS models and mortality in surgical/trauma patients. Our TCAV method utilizes the airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) mode and is based on opening and collapsing time constants, which reflect the viscoelastic properties of the terminal airspaces. Time-controlled adaptive ventilation uses inspiratory and expiratory time to (1) gradually \u201Cnudge\u201D alveoli and alveolar ducts open with an extended inspiratory duration and (2) prevent alveolar collapse using a brief (sub-second) expiratory duration that does not allow time for alveolar collapse. The new paradigm in TCAV is configuring each breath guided by the previous one, which achieves real-time titration of ventilator settings and minimizes instability induced tissue damage. This novel methodology changes the current approach to mechanical ventilation, from arbitrary to personalized and adaptive. The outcome of this approach is an open and stable lung with reduced regional strain and greater lung protection.","publish_time":"2020-01-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nieman, Gary F.; Gatto, Louis A.; Andrews, Penny; Satalin, Joshua; Camporota, Luigi; Daxon, Benjamin; Blair, Sarah J.; Al-khalisy, Hassan; Madden, Maria; Kollisch-Singule, Michaela; Aiash, Hani; Habashi, Nader M.","journal":"Ann Intensive Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f45468609cea65308db7f7b36d0cd9503261543.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6944723.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6944723/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzExNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","VILI","TCAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mechanical ventilation","adaptive ventilation","ventilation-induced lung injury","regional lung strain","ventilation strategy","dynamic alveolar strain","alveolar collapse","acute lung injury","alveolar ducts","alveolar microenvironment","expiratory time","stable lung inflation","regional dynamic strain","reduced regional strain","greater lung protection","time constants","airway pressure release ventilation","TCAV method impacts pathophysiology","areas of alveolar instability subject","mechanical characteristics","novel mechanisms of VILI","Mortality","high risk","expiratory duration","extended inspiratory duration","translational animal ARDS models","current approach","delivered breath","risk of death","novel methodology","trauma patients","acute respiratory distress syndrome","tidal recruitment","derecruitment","lungs","homogeneity","real-time titration of ventilator settings","APRV","brief","viscoelastic properties","group","stress-multiplication","tissue damage","Recent studies","terminal airspaces","nudge","alveoli","treatments","new paradigm","present work","outcome","review","goal"],"language":"en"},

TLRs are instrumental in activating inflammatory responses in innate immune cells, but their function in adaptive immune cells is less well understood. Here we show that synthetic ligands of TLR8 boosted T cell receptor signaling, resulting in increased cytokine production and upregulation of surface activation markers. Adjuvant TLR8 stimulation, but not TLR7 or TLR9, further promoted T helper cell differentiation towards Th1 and Th17. In addition, we found that endosomal HIV induced cytokine secretion from CD4\u002B T cells in a TLR8-specific manner. TLR8 engagement also enhanced HIV-1 replication and potentiated the reversal of latency in patient-derived T cells. The adjuvant TLR8 activity in T cells can contribute to viral dissemination in the lymph node and low-grade inflammation in HIV patients. In addition, it can potentially be exploited for therapeutic targeting and vaccine development.","publish_time":"2020-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Me\u00E5s, Hany Zekaria; Haug, Markus; Beckwith, Marianne Sandvold; Louet, Claire; Ryan, Liv; Hu, Zhenyi; Landskron, Johannes; Nordb\u00F8, Svein Arne; Task\u00E9n, Kjetil; Yin, Hang; Dam\u00E5s, Jan Kristian; Flo, Trude Helen","journal":"Nat Commun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7563f3897d50bf1fa4ae5df16d91c3c1fa58e474.json; document_parses/pdf_json/30dbeba55ccec8e99f2154ed35dc28d2d2f39c76.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6952430.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6952430/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzE0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T cell receptor","patient-derived T cells","endosomal HIV","T helper cell differentiation","innate immune cells","adaptive immune cells","TLR8 engagement","Adjuvant TLR8 stimulation","adjuvant TLR8 activity","HIV patients","HIV infection","synthetic ligands of TLR8","TLR8-specific manner","endosomal uptake","endosomal Toll","cell transmission results","TLRs","addition","target CD4","viral dissemination","cytokine secretion","viral ssRNA genome","increased cytokine production","potential exposure","virus","lymph node","inflammatory responses","function","low-grade inflammation","upregulation of surface activation markers","reversal of latency","TLR9","TLR7","replication","Th17","receptors","therapeutic targeting","vaccine development"],"language":"en"},

This requires an evaluation of the long-term impact of such a program on the burden of influenza across all age groups, using a transmission model that accounts for the seasonal variability in vaccine effectiveness and the shorter duration of protection following vaccination as compared to natural infection. METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis based on a stochastic dynamic transmission model that has been calibrated to reported GP visits with influenza-like illness in the Netherlands over 11 seasons (2003/2004 to 2014/2015). We analyzed the costs and effects of extending the current program with vaccination of children aged 2\u201316 years at 50% coverage over 20 consecutive seasons. We measured the effects in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and we adopted a societal perspective. RESULTS: The childhood vaccination program is estimated to have an average incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of \u20AC3944 per QALY gained and is cost-effective in the general population (across 1000 simulations; conventional Dutch threshold of \u20AC20,000 per QALY gained). The childhood vaccination program is not estimated to be cost-effective for the target-group itself with an average ICER of \u20AC57,054 per QALY gained. Uncertainty analyses reveal that these ICERs hide a wide range of outcomes. Even though introduction of a childhood vaccination program decreases the number of infections, it tends to lead to larger epidemics: in 23.3% of 1000 simulations, the childhood vaccination program results in an increase in seasons with a symptomatic attack rate larger than 5%, which is expected to cause serious strain on the health care system. In 6.4% of 1000 simulations, the childhood vaccination program leads to a net loss of QALYs. These findings are robust across different targeted age groups and vaccination coverages. CONCLUSIONS: Modeling indicates that childhood influenza vaccination is cost-effective in the Netherlands. However, childhood influenza vaccination is not cost-effective when only outcomes for the children themselves are considered. In approximately a quarter of the simulations, the introduction of a childhood vaccination program increases the frequency of seasons with a symptomatic attack rate larger than 5%. The possibility of an overall health loss cannot be excluded.","publish_time":"2020-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Boer, Pieter T.; Backer, Jantien A.; van Hoek, Albert Jan; Wallinga, Jacco","journal":"BMC Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a6bb55b79b0b0c3bf1f8d2ee2c00938264c5a19.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6958762.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6958762/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzE2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["QALY"],"locations":["Netherlands"],"keyphrases":["influenza vaccination program","childhood influenza vaccination","childhood vaccination program results","vaccination of children","vaccination coverages","current program","simulations","shorter duration of protection following vaccination","burden of influenza","Netherlands","frequency of seasons","consecutive seasons","symptomatic attack rate larger","cost-effectiveness analysis","average ICER","introduction","effects","larger epidemics","average incremental cost-effectiveness ratio","net loss of QALYs","overall health loss","different targeted age groups","stochastic dynamic transmission model","health care system","wide range of outcomes","quality-adjusted life-years","increase","vaccine effectiveness","ICERs","seasonal variability","illness","conventional Dutch threshold","serious strain","findings","Modeling","natural infection","target-group","general population","number of infections","present study","possibility","GP visits","long-term impact","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","Uncertainty analyses","evaluation","costs","METHODS","quarter","societal perspective"],"language":"en"},

The Bacteremia Antibiotic Length Actually Needed for Clinical Effectiveness (BALANCE) pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT) determined that it was feasible to enroll and randomize intensive care unit (ICU) patients with bloodstream infection to 7 versus 14 days of treatment, and served as the vanguard for the ongoing BALANCE main RCT. We performed this BALANCE-Ward pilot RCT to examine the feasibility and impact of potentially extending the BALANCE main RCT to include patients hospitalized on non-ICU wards. METHODS: We conducted an open pilot RCT among a subset of six sites participating in the ongoing BALANCE RCT, randomizing patients with positive non-Staphylococcus aureus blood cultures on non-ICU wards to 7 versus 14 days of antibiotic treatment. The co-primary feasibility outcomes were recruitment rate and adherence to treatment duration protocol. We compared feasibility outcomes, patient/pathogen characteristics, and overall outcomes among those enrolled in this BALANCE-Ward and prior BALANCE-ICU pilot RCTs. We estimated the sample size and non-inferiority margin impacts of expanding the BALANCE main RCT to include non-ICU patients. RESULTS: A total of 134 patients were recruited over 47 site-months (mean 2.9 patients/site-month, median 1.0, range 0.1\u20134.4 patients/site-month). The overall recruitment rate exceeded the BALANCE-ICU pilot RCT (mean 1.10 patients/site-month, p \u003C 0.0001). Overall protocol adherence also exceeded the adherence in the BALANCE-ICU pilot RCT (125/134, 93% vs 89/115, 77%, p = 0.0003). BALANCE-Ward patients were older, with lower Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, and higher proportions of infections caused by Escherichia coli and genito-urinary sources of bloodstream infection. The BALANCE-Ward pilot RCT patients had an overall 90-day mortality rate of 17/133 (12.8%), which was comparable to the 90-day mortality rate in the ICU pilot RCT (17/115, 14.8%) (p = 0.65). Simulation models indicated there would be minimal sample size and non-inferiority margin implications of expanding enrolment to increasing proportions of non-ICU versus ICU patients. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to enroll non-ICU patients in a trial of 7 versus 14 days of antibiotics for bloodstream infection, and expanding the BALANCE RCT hospital-wide has the potential to improve the timeliness and generalizability of trial results.

METHODS: Retrospective cost analysis. Costs and savings were calculated from the hospital perspective using financial records. Costs were categorized to determine the major areas of expenditure and savings. RESULTS: We report that controlling a SARS outbreak in a teaching hospital over an 8-week period cost $12 million Canadian. Lost revenue and labour accounted for two thirds of the costs incurred while excess spending on services, materials, supplies and renovation of existing space accounted for the remaining one third.

METHODS: Timeloss claims data were collected for 1992\u20132002 from the Association of Workers\u2019 Compensation Boards of Canada. Labour Force data from Statistics Canada were used to calculate injury rates. The Occupational Health and Safety Agency for Healthcare in British Columbia coordinated with provincial occupational health and safety agencies in Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia to analyze injury data and collate prevention measures in their regions. RESULTS: The national timeloss injury rate declined from 4.3 to 3.7 injuries per 100 personyears since 1998. Musculoskeletal injuries consistently comprised the majority of timeloss claims. Needlestick injuries, infectious diseases and stress-related claims infrequently resulted in timeloss claims although they are known to cause great concern in the workplace. Prevention measures taken in the various provinces related to safer equipment (lifts and electric beds), return-to-work programs, and violence prevention initiatives. Different eligibility criteria as well as adjudication policies confounded the comparison of injury rates across provinces. DISCUSSION: Since 2000, all provinces experienced healthcare restructuring and increased workload in an aging workforce. Despite these increased risks, injury rates have decreased. Attribution for these trends is complex, but there is reason to believe that focus on prevention can further decrease injuries. While occupational health is a provincial jurisdiction, harmonizing data in addition to sharing data on successful prevention measures and best practices may improve workplace conditions and thereby further reduce injury rates for higher risk healthcare sector occupations.","publish_time":"2005-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yassi, Annalee; Gilbert, Mark; Cvitkovich, Yuri","journal":"Canadian Journal of Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/450d9a74c152c6a27fb844ec29dd76f20416109d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6976203/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzIzMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Association of Workers\u2019 Compensation Boards of Canada","Labour Force","Statistics Canada","Occupational Health and Safety Agency","Columbia"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["injury data","Timeloss claims data","workplace injuries","successful prevention measures","comparison of injury rates","provincial occupational health","national timeloss injury rate","majority of timeloss claims","Needlestick injuries","Musculoskeletal injuries","Analysis of workers\u2019 compensation data","Labour Force data","violence prevention initiatives","safety trends","provinces experienced healthcare restructuring","stress-related claims","safety agencies","Safety Agency","higher risk healthcare sector occupations","various provinces","Statistics Canada","workplace conditions","Association of Workers\u2019 Compensation Boards of Canada","increased workload","provincial jurisdiction","increased risks","Ontario","British Columbia","best practices","lifts","safer equipment","adjudication policies","Quebec","infectious diseases","addition","Nova Scotia","return","electric beds","work programs","insight","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","Different eligibility criteria","aging workforce","reason","focus","METHODS","Attribution","great concern","regions","DISCUSSION","personyears"],"language":"en"},

To increase mvPC\u2019s immunogenicity, we added a synthetic adjuvant (RS09) to the mvPC design. The selected mvPC epitopes are homologous against all currently available annotated reference sequences of 22 C. albicans strains, thus offering a higher coverage and greater protective response.

Currently, expensive and time-consuming biological assays can only determine a very small portion of all RPIs, which calls for computational approaches to help biologists efficiently and correctly find candidate RPIs. Here, we integrated a successful computing algorithm, conjoint triad feature (CTF), and another method, chaos game representation (CGR), for representing RNA-protein pairs and by doing so developed a prediction model based on these representations and random forest (RF) classifiers. When testing two benchmark datasets, RPI369 and RPI2241, the combined method (CTF\u002BCGR) showed some superiority compared with four existing tools. Especially on RPI2241, the CTF\u002BCGR method improved prediction accuracy (ACC) from 0.91 (the best record of all published works) to 0.95. When independently testing a newly constructed dataset, RPI1449, which only contained experimentally validated RPIs released between 2014 and 2016, our method still showed some generalization capability with an ACC of 0.75.

The current prophylaxis and therapeutic interventions for IAV requires frequent changes due to the continuous antigenic drift and antigenic shift of IAV. Emerging evidence indicates that the host microRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in intricate host-pathogen interaction networks. Cellular miRNAs may directly target virus to inhibit its infection and be developed as potential anti-virus drugs. METHODS: In this study, we established a broad-spectrum anti-IAV miRNA screening method using miRanda software. The screened miRNAs were further verified by luciferase assay, viral protein expression assay and virus replication assay. RESULTS: Five cellular miRNAs (miR-188-3p, miR-345-5p, miR-3183, miR-15-3p and miR-769-3p), targeting 99.96, 95.31, 92.9, 94.58 and 97.24% of human IAV strains recorded in NCBI, respectively, were chosen for further experimental verification. Finally, we found that miR-188-3p downregulated PB2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels by directly targeted the predicted sites on PB2 and effectively inhibited the replication of IAV (H1N1, H5N6 and H7N9) in A549 cells.

The aim of the present study was to develop a human-compatible formulation of the PfCyRPA vaccine candidate and confirming its activity in preclinical studies. Recombinant PfCyRPA expressed in HEK 293 cells was chemically coupled to phosphoethanolamine and then incorporated into the membrane of unadjuvanted influenza virosomes approved as antigen delivery system for humans. Laboratory animals were immunised with the virosome-based PfCyRPA vaccine to determine its immunogenic properties and in particular, its capacity to elicit parasite binding and growth-inhibitory antibodies. The vaccine elicited in mice and rabbits high titers of PfCyRPA-specific antibodies that bound to the blood-stage parasites. At a concentration of 10 mg/mL, purified total serum IgG from immunised rabbits inhibited parasite growth in vitro by about 80%. Furthermore, in a P. falciparum infection mouse model, passive transfer of 10 mg of purified total IgG from PfCyRPA vaccinated rabbits reduced the in vivo parasite load by 77%. Influenza virosomes thus represent a suitable antigen delivery system for the induction of protective antibodies against the recombinant PfCyRPA, designating it as a highly suitable component for inclusion into a multivalent and multi-stage virosomal malaria vaccine.","publish_time":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tamborrini, Marco; Hauser, Julia; Sch\u00E4fer, Anja; Amacker, Mario; Favuzza, Paola; Kyungtak, Kwak; Fleury, Sylvain; Pluschke, Gerd","journal":"NPJ Vaccines","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7abdca8783f18240fde2423af2f7c957cd7c4470.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6994490.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6994490/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzI4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HEK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PfCyRPA vaccine candidate","Recombinant PfCyRPA","PfCyRPA vaccinated rabbits","virosome-based PfCyRPA vaccine","rabbits high titers of PfCyRPA","blood-stage parasites","cross-reactive malaria vaccine","promising blood-stage candidate antigen","red blood cells","multi-stage virosomal malaria vaccine","suitable antigen delivery system","parasite growth","immunised rabbits","specific antibodies","malaria parasites","induction of protective antibodies","growth-inhibitory antibodies","inclusion","cysteine-rich protective antigen","falciparum merozoites","parasite binding","Plasmodium falciparum","total IgG","parasite load","red blood cell invasion process","total serum IgG","falciparum infection mouse model","membrane of unadjuvanted influenza virosomes","suitable component","key role","various geographical strains","passive transfer","capacity","human-compatible formulation","immunogenic properties","activity","mice","conserved protein","entry","present study","humans","HEK","preclinical studies","aim","Laboratory animals","phosphoethanolamine","concentration"],"language":"en"},

One milliliter of albuterol (2.5 mg/mL) was used in each run (n = 3). Collection filter was placed at the trachea and was removed after each run. Drug was eluted from the filter and assayed with UV spectrophotometry (276 nm). RESULTS: When nebulizer was placed close to patient, inhaled dose was higher with inspiration synchronized than continuous aerosol generation at all gas flows (p = 0.05) except at 5 L/min. When placed at the inlet of humidifier, compared to continuous, inspiration synchronized aerosol generated higher inhaled dose with gas flow set below 50% of patient inspiratory flow [23.9 (20.6, 28.3)% vs 18.1 (16.7, 19.6)%, p \u003C 0.001], but lower inhaled dose with gas flow set above 50% of patient inspiratory flow [3.5 (2.2, 9.3)% vs 9.9 (8.2, 16.4)%, p = 0.001]. Regardless of breathing pattern, continuous aerosol delivered greater inhaled dose with nebulizer placed at humidifier than close to patient at all gas flows except at 5 L/min. CONCLUSION: When the HFNC gas flow was set higher than 50% of patient inspiratory flow, no significant advantage was found in inspiration synchronized over continuous aerosol. However, inspiration synchronized aerosol generated 30% more inhaled dose than continuous with gas flow set below 50% of patient inspiratory flow, regardless of nebulizer placement. Continuous nebulizer needs to be placed at the inlet of humidifier.","publish_time":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Jie; Wu, Wei; Fink, James B.","journal":"Intensive Care Med Exp","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d318426d91d1a7ff8b8fb5088c29bfbf62f320d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6994578.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6994578/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzI4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VMN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patient inspiratory flow","HFNC gas flow","Continuous nebulizer","inspiration","continuous aerosol generation","higher inhaled dose","gas flows","greater inhaled dose","increased inhaled dose","lower inhaled dose","aerosol delivery","continuous vibrating mesh nebulizer","high-flow nasal cannula","inlet of humidifier vs close","nebulizer placement","VMN","HFNC system","run","breathing pattern","spontaneous breathing","Collection filter","use","noninvasive ventilation","different positions","significant advantage","critical care ventilator","temperature","dual-chamber model lung","adult manikin","UV spectrophotometry","trachea","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","METHODS","nm","RESULTS","milliliter of albuterol","Drug"],"language":"en"},

It is associated with long-term disability. Ultrasonography is a reliable tool to quantify muscle mass, but studies that evaluate muscle quality at the critically ill bedside are lacking. Shear wave ultrasound elastography (SWE) provides spatial representation of soft tissue stiffness and measures of muscle quality. The reliability and reproducibility of SWE in critically ill patients has never been evaluated. METHODS: Two operators tested in healthy controls and in critically ill patients the intra- and inter-operator reliability of the SWE using transversal and longitudinal views of the diaphragm and limb muscles. Reliability was calculated using the intra-class correlation coefficient and a bootstrap sampling method assessed their consistency. RESULTS: We collected 560 images. Longitudinal views of the diaphragm (ICC 0.83 [0.50\u20130.94]), the biceps brachii (ICC 0.88 [0.67\u20130.96]) and the rectus femoris (ICC 0.76 [0.34\u20130.91]) were the most reliable views in a training set of healthy controls. Intra-class correlation coefficient for inter-operator reproducibility and intra-operator reliability was above 0.9 for all muscles in a validation set of healthy controls. In critically ill patients, inter-operator reproducibility and intra-operator 1 and 2 reliability ICCs were respectively 0.92 [0.71\u20130.98], 0.93 [0.82\u20130.98] and 0.92 [0.81\u20130.98] for the diaphragm; 0.96 [0.86\u20130.99], 0.98 [0.94\u20130.99] and 0.99 [0.96\u20131] for the biceps brachii and 0.91 [0.51\u20130.98], 0.97 [0.93\u20130.99] and 0.99 [0.97\u20131] for the rectus femoris. The probability to reach intra-class correlation coefficient greater than 0.8 in a 10,000 bootstrap sampling for inter-operator reproducibility was respectively 81%, 84% and 78% for the diaphragm, the biceps brachii and the rectus femoris respectively.

In this study, we evaluated the use of a bioaerosol sampling method to noninvasively detect and quantify airborne influenza A virus (IAV) densities in a public elementary school. Air samples were collected from multiple locations in the school, two days per week, throughout an eight-week sampling period during influenza season. Real-time RT-PCR targeting the IAV M gene revealed detectable IAV on five occasions in densities ranging from 2.0 \u00D7 10(\u22121) to 1.9 \u00D7 10(4). No significant differences in IAV densities were related to student presence/absence. The majority of IAV-associated particles were \u22644 \u03BCm in diameter, and theoretical calculations indicate infectious thresholds after minutes of exposure.

To better understand the dynamics of this outbreak, 182 full genome HPAI H5N2 sequences isolated from commercial layer chicken and turkey production premises were analyzed using evolutionary models able to accommodate epidemiological and geographic information. Epidemiological compartmental models embedded in a phylogenetic framework provided evidence that poultry type acted as a barrier to the transmission of virus among midwestern poultry farms. Furthermore, after initial introduction, the propagation of HPAI cases was self-sustainable within the commercial poultry industries. Discrete trait diffusion models indicated that within state viral transitions occurred more frequently than inter-state transitions. Distance and sample size were very strongly supported as associated with viral transition between county groups (Bayes Factor \u003E 30.0).

Infection of WT mice with pathogenic, but not acutely cleared CHIKV, induced MyD88-dependent recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils to the dLN. Blocking this influx improved lymphocyte accumulation, dLN organization, and CHIKV-specific B cell responses.

Inflammatory status (IL-6, IL- 1\u03B2, C-reactive protein) and oxidative stress status (malondialdehyde, total antioxidant capacity), at the baseline, at the 5th day, and at the end of the study (10th day) will be measured. Clinical and nutritional status will be assessed three times during the intervention. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) questionnaire for assessment of organ failure will be filled out every other day. The mortality rate will be calculated within 28 days of the start of the intervention. Weight, body mass index, and body composition will be measured. All analyses will be conducted by an initially assigned study arm in an intention-to-treat analysis. DISCUSSION: We expect that supplementation of 150 mg pycnogenol for 10 days will improve clinical and nutritional status and reduce the inflammation and oxidative stress of the TBI patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (ref: NCT03777683) at 12/13/2018.","publish_time":"2020-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Malekahmadi, Mahsa; Moradi Moghaddam, Omid; Islam, Sheikh Mohammed Shariful; Tanha, Kiarash; Nematy, Mohsen; Pahlavani, Naseh; Firouzi, Safieh; Zali, Mohammad Reza; Norouzy, Abdolreza","journal":"Trials","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e685facdd88913927d4dce39021f48d77d230e6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7014642.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7014642/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzM0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TBI","clinicaltrials.gov"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nutritional status","oxidative stress status","inflammatory status of TBI patients","days","pycnogenol supplementation","effect of pycnogenol","intervention group","inflammation","assessment of organ failure","TRIAL REGISTRATION","OBJECTIVE","Sequential Organ Failure Assessment","randomized controlled trial","body composition","control group","infection rate","study arm","mortality rate","body mass index","SOFA","questionnaire","malondialdehyde","total antioxidant capacity","C-reactive protein","socioeconomic problems","major health","BACKGROUND","Traumatic brain injury","immunonutrition formulas","world","intention","placebo","Weight","baseline","work","end","times","enteral formula","ref","start","Block randomization","NCT03777683","analysis","duration","METHODS","ingredients","DISCUSSION","analyses"],"language":"en"},

While virus-host interactions are promising targets for antivirals, there is only limited knowledge regarding the interactions of EBOV with cellular host factors. Recently, we performed a genome-wide siRNA screen that identified the nuclear RNA export factor 1 (NXF1) as an important host factor for the EBOV life cycle. NXF1 is a major component of the nuclear mRNA export pathway that is usurped by many viruses whose life cycles include nuclear stages. However, the role of NXF1 in the life cycle of EBOV, a virus replicating in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, remains unknown. In order to better understand the role of NXF1 in the EBOV life cycle, we performed a combination of co-immunoprecipitation and double immunofluorescence assays to characterize the interactions of NXF1 with viral proteins and RNAs. Additionally, using siRNA-mediated knockdown of NXF1 together with functional assays, we analyzed the role of NXF1 in individual aspects of the virus life cycle. With this approach we identified the EBOV nucleoprotein (NP) as a viral interaction partner of NXF1. Further studies revealed that NP interacts with the RNA-binding domain of NXF1 and competes with RNA for this interaction. Co-localization studies showed that RNA binding-deficient, but not wildtype NXF1, accumulates in NP-derived inclusion bodies, and knockdown experiments demonstrated that NXF1 is necessary for viral protein expression, but not for viral RNA synthesis. Finally, our results showed that NXF1 interacts with viral mRNAs, but not with viral genomic RNAs. Based on these results we suggest a model whereby NXF1 is recruited into inclusion bodies to promote the export of viral mRNA:NXF1 complexes from these sites. This would represent a novel function for NXF1 in the life cycle of cytoplasmically replicating viruses, and may provide a basis for new therapeutic approaches against EBOV, and possibly other emerging viruses.","publish_time":"2020-01-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wendt, Lisa; Brandt, Janine; Bodmer, Bianca S.; Reiche, Sven; Schmidt, Marie Luisa; Traeger, Shelby; Hoenen, Thomas","journal":"Cells","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a068f1ec98befb3d767ba602df5f314604f0aee8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7017048.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7017048/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzM1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBOV","NP","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["interactions of NXF1","role of NXF1","NXF1 complexes","wildtype NXF1","viral interaction partner of NXF1","EBOV life cycle","life cycle of EBOV","RNA-binding domain of NXF1","interactions of EBOV","virus life cycle","siRNA-mediated knockdown of NXF1","viral RNA synthesis","viral proteins","viral mRNAs","export of viral mRNA","EBOV nucleoprotein","viral genomic RNAs","life cycles","life cycle of cytoplasmically replicating viruses","virus-host interactions","viral protein expression","nuclear RNA export factor","RNA binding-deficient","NP-derived inclusion bodies","Ebola virus","severe outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fever","cytoplasmic inclusion bodies","nuclear mRNA export pathway","nuclear stages","important host factor","emerging viruses","results","cellular host factors","Co-localization studies","knockdown experiments","functional assays","double immunofluorescence assays","combination of co-immunoprecipitation","genome-wide siRNA screen","antivirals","individual aspects","major component","basis","promising targets","new therapeutic approaches","humans","limited knowledge","novel function","sites","model","order"],"language":"en"},

Quantification of RV deformation by speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) is a recently available and reproducible technique that provides an integrated analysis of the RV. However, data are scarce regarding its use in critically ill patients. The aim of this study was to assess its feasibility and clinical usefulness in moderate\u2013severe ARDS patients. RESULTS: Forty-eight ARDS patients under invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) were consecutively enrolled in a prospective observational study. A full transthoracic echocardiography was performed within 36 h of MV initiation. STE-derived and conventional parameters were recorded. Strain imaging of the RV lateral, inferior and septal walls was highly feasible (47/48 (98%) patients). Interobserver reproducibility of RV strain values displayed good reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) \u003E 0.75 for all STE-derived parameters) in ARDS patients. ROC curve analysis showed that lateral, inferior, global (average of the 3 RV walls) longitudinal systolic strain (LSS) and global strain rate demonstrated significant diagnostic values when compared to several conventional indices (TAPSE, S\u2032, RV FAC). A RV global LSS value \u003E \u2212 13.7% differentiated patients with a TAPSE \u003C vs \u003E 12 mm with a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 83%. Regarding clinical outcomes, mortality and cumulative incidence of weaning from MV at day 28 were not different in patients with normal versus abnormal STE-derived parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Global STE assessment of the RV was highly achievable and reproducible in moderate\u2013severe ARDS patients under MV and additionally correlated with several conventional parameters of RV function. In our cohort, STE-derived parameters did not provide any incremental value in terms of survival or weaning from MV prediction.

While feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) manipulates the host early innate immune response in many different ways, the host could activate the antiviral response to counteract it through some unknown mechanisms. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) which serve as a class of regulatory factors in the host, participate in the regulation of the host innate immune response against virus infection. In this study, we found that the expression levels of miR-26a were significantly upregulated upon FHV-1 infection. Furthermore, FHV-1 infection induced the expression of miR-26a via a cGAS-dependent pathway, and knockdown of cellular cGAS significantly blocked the expression of miR-26a induced by poly (dA:dT) or FHV-1 infection. Next, we investigated the biological function of miR-26a during viral infection. miR-26a was able to increase the phosphorylation of STAT1 and promote type I IFN signaling, thus inhibiting viral replication. The mechanism study showed that miR-26a directly targeted host SOCS5. Knockdown of SOCS5 increased the phosphorylation of STAT1 and enhanced the type I IFN-mediated antiviral response, and overexpression of suppressor of the cytokine signalling 5 (SOCS5) decreased the phosphorylation of STAT1 and inhibited the type I IFN-mediated antiviral response. Meanwhile, with the knockdown of SOCS5, the upregulated expression of phosphorylated STAT1 and the anti-virus effect induced by miR-26a were significantly inhibited. Taken together, our data demonstrated a new strategy of host miRNAs against FHV-1 infection by enhancing IFN antiviral signaling.","publish_time":"2019-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Jikai; Li, Zhijie; Huang, Jiapei; Yin, Hang; Tian, Jin; Qu, Liandong","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37215fa618869df1820d22f28bace99ea9ceb1fc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7020096.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7020096/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzM2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of miR","virus infection","viral infection","FHV","IFN antiviral","host cells","targeted host SOCS5","expression levels of miR","phosphorylation of STAT1","Knockdown of SOCS5","innate immune response","type","biological function of miR","new strategy of host miRNAs","upregulated expression of phosphorylated STAT1","virus replication","viral replication","various antiviral responses","knockdown of cellular cGAS","anti-virus effect","mechanism study","cGAS-dependent pathway","different ways","overexpression of suppressor","dT","regulation","class of regulatory factors","cytokine","data","poly","feline herpesvirus","unknown mechanisms","MicroRNAs"],"language":"en"},

We sought to evaluate whether a very early start of VP, even without completing the initial fluid loading, might impact clinical outcomes in septic shock. METHODS: A total of 337 patients with sepsis requiring VP support for at least 6 h were initially selected from a prospectively collected database in a 90-bed mixed-ICU during a 24-month period. They were classified into very-early (VE-VPs) or delayed vasopressor start (D-VPs) categories according to whether norepinephrine was initiated or not within/before the next hour of the first resuscitative fluid load. Then, VE-VPs (n = 93) patients were 1:1 propensity matched to D-VPs (n = 93) based on age; source of admission (emergency room, general wards, intensive care unit); chronic and acute comorbidities; and lactate, heart rate, systolic, and diastolic pressure at vasopressor start. A risk-adjusted Cox proportional hazard model was fitted to assess the association between VE-VPs and day 28 mortality. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed also including those patients requiring VP support for less than 6 h. RESULTS: Patients subjected to VE-VPs received significantly less resuscitation fluids at vasopressor starting (0[0\u2013510] vs. 1500[650\u20132300] mL, p \u003C 0.001) and during the first 8 h of resuscitation (1100[500\u20131900] vs. 2600[1600\u20133800] mL, p \u003C 0.001), with no significant increase in acute renal failure and/or renal replacement therapy requirements. VE-VPs was related with significant lower net fluid balances 8 and 24 h after VPs. VE-VPs was also associated with a significant reduction in the risk of death compared to D-VPs (HR 0.31, CI95% 0.17\u20130.57, p \u003C 0.001) at day 28. Such association was maintained after including patients receiving vasopressors for \u003C 6 h. CONCLUSION: A very early start of vasopressor support seems to be safe, might limit the amount of fluids to resuscitate septic shock, and could lead to better clinical outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ospina-Tasc\u00F3n, Gustavo A.; Hernandez, Glenn; Alvarez, Ingrid; Calder\u00F3n-Tapia, Luis E.; Manzano-Nunez, Ramiro; S\u00E1nchez-Ortiz, Alvaro I.; Qui\u00F1ones, Egardo; Ruiz-Yucuma, Juan E.; Aldana, Jos\u00E9 L.; Teboul, Jean-Louis; Cavalcanti, Alexandre Biasi; De Backer, Daniel; Bakker, Jan","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba70a3e0048ad5ceb40996cb574dd2275a45b15a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7023737.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7023737/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzM3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VE-VPs","D-VPs","patients","early start of VP","early start of vasopressor support","VP support","start of vasopressors","septic shock","delayed vasopressor","h of resuscitation","resuscitation fluids","significant increase","significant reduction","day","association","significant lower net fluid balances","acute renal failure","initial fluid loading","resuscitative fluid load","better clinical outcomes","acute comorbidities","risk of death","renal replacement therapy requirements","risk-adjusted Cox proportional hazard model","emergency room","general wards","intensive care unit","heart rate","lactate","source of admission","diastolic pressure","age","Optimal timing","sepsis","bed mixed-ICU","hour","total","BACKGROUND","CI95","categories","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","mortality","propensity","month period","database","METHODS","norepinephrine","sensitivity analysis","advance"],"language":"en"},

BALF and OPS identified respiratory pathogen infections in 57 (75%) and 49 (64.5%) patients, respectively (P \u003E 0.05). The etiology analysis revealed that viruses were responsible for 53.7% of the patients, whereas bacteria accounted for 32.9% and Mycoplasma pneumoniae for 13.4%. The leading 5 pathogens identified were respiratory syncytial virus, Streptococcus pneumoniaee, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and adenovirus, and they accounted for 74.2% of etiological fraction. For detection of any pathogen, the overall detection rate of BALF (81%) was marginally higher than that (69%) of OPS (p = 0.046). The differences in the frequency distribution and sensitivity for most pathogens detected by two sampling methods were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, BALF and OPS had similar microbiological yields. Our results indicated the clinical value of OPS testing in pediatric patients with respiratory illness.","publish_time":"2020-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Zhan-Ying; Deng, Hua; Hua, Li-Dong; Lei, Wen; Zhang, Chang-Bin; Dai, Qi-Qiang; Tao, Wei-Jing; Zhang, Liang","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a26d25e059d3adb5bbc81c9b87d3da87e9a8f4ae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7036252.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7036252/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":["BALF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["paired OPS","BALF specimens","paired BALF","respiratory viruses","respiratory illness","key respiratory pathogens","detection rates of OPS","respiratory pathogen infections","respiratory syncytial virus","Respiratory tract infection","paired specimens","clinical value of OPS","overall detection rate of BALF","pediatric patients","young children","hospitalized children","RTI","study","suspension microarray","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","bacteria","RESULTS","microbiological findings","sampling methods","similar microbiological yields","leading cause of morbidity","Haemophilus influenzae","Streptococcus pneumoniaee","oropharyngeal swab","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","performance","frequency distribution","sensitivity","adenovirus","BACKGROUND","differences","studies","etiology analysis","hospitalization","primary purpose","CONCLUSIONS","etiological fraction","samples"],"language":"en"},

Dysbiosis in critically ill patients may make them prone to hospital-acquired infections, sepsis, multi-organ failure (MOF), energy homeostasis disturbance, muscle wasting, and cachexia. Modulation of gut microbiota through synbiotics can be considered as a potential treatment for muscle wasting and macronutrient homeostasis disturbances. METHODS: This is a prospective, single-center, double-blind, parallel randomized controlled trial with the aim to evaluate the effects of synbiotic supplementation on energy and macronutrient homeostasis and muscle wasting in critically ill patients. A total of 40 hemodynamically stable, adult, critically ill patients who receive enteral nutrition via a nasogasteric tube (NGT) in the 24\u201348 h after admission to critical care will be included in this study. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive Lactocare (ZistTakhmir) capsules 500 mg every 12 h or a placebo capsule, which contains only the sterile maize starch and is similar to synbiotic capsules for 14 days. The synbiotic and placebo capsules will be given through the nasogastric tube, separately from gavage, after feeding. DISCUSSION: Gut microbiota modulation through synbiotics is proposed to improve clinical prognosis and reduce infectious complications, ventilator dependency, and length of ICU stay by improving energy and macronutrient homeostasis and reducing muscle protein catabolism.

We aimed to audit clinical practices before and after introduction of a national guideline in Wales on RDS management. Anonymised, prospective data on all infants born at \u003C34 weeks of gestation and cared for at one of the participating neonatal units in Wales were collected in two six-month time periods in 2015 and 2018. A national guideline was introduced in 2016 by the Wales Neonatal Network. Data collection included areas of antenatal management, delivery room stabilisation, invasive and non-invasive respiratory support, surfactant treatment and elements of supportive care. Univariate and multivariate methods were used to compare data between the two epochs. Comparing care before and after introduction of the national guideline, areas of significant improvement include use of targeted tidal volume ventilation, use of caffeine therapy, oxygen therapy post-surfactant and increasing early use of parenteral nutrition. Areas of poorer management included levels of positive end expiratory pressures and timing of introduction of enteral feeds. Little variation was seen between level two and three units, although gestational age was a significant independent variable for several practices, including delayed cord clamping, stabilisation with intubation, early enteral feeding and caffeine administration. A national guideline for management of RDS in Wales has significantly improved practice in several areas. However, despite a large volume of high-quality evidence and robust guidance, there remains a significant variation in some elements of best practice for RDS management. Further work should focus on education and training, especially for elements requiring cross-departmental work.","publish_time":"2020-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Course, Christopher; Chakraborty, Mallinath","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5bdb25ef472b227be6461c0437926c20babf8a55.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7044423.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7044423/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQzOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RDS","Wales Neonatal Network"],"locations":["Wales"],"keyphrases":["RDS management","management of RDS","national guideline","areas of antenatal management","Areas of poorer management","areas of significant improvement","significant variation","Wales Neonatal Network","caffeine therapy","timing of introduction","elements of best practice","elements of supportive care","Data collection","prospective data","early use of parenteral nutrition","early enteral feeding","significant independent variable","participating neonatal units","use of targeted tidal volume ventilation","surfactant treatment","oxygen therapy post-surfactant","caffeine administration","enteral feeds","improved practice","clinical practices","Little variation","delivery room stabilisation","non-invasive respiratory support","Respiratory Distress Syndrome","cross-departmental work","large volume of high-quality evidence","intubation","levels of positive end expiratory pressures","robust guidance","delayed cord clamping","gestational age","commonest diagnosis","infants","training","premature birth","multivariate methods","education","six-month time periods","weeks of gestation","epochs"],"language":"en"},

We planned a prospective cohort study to determine the impact of ARI during infancy on the pulmonary function test indices at 3 years of age. METHODS: A cohort of normal, full-term newborns were followed up 6 monthly and during ARI episodes. Infant pulmonary function tests (IPFTs) were performed at baseline and each follow-up visit using tidal breathing flow-volume loop, rapid thoracoabdominal compression (RTC) and raised volume RTC manoeuvres. During each ARI episode, nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested for respiratory pathogens by real-time PCR. RESULTS: We screened 3421 neonates; 310 were enrolled; IPFT was performed in 225 (boys: 125 (55.6%)) at 3 years. During infancy, 470 ARI episodes were documented in 173 infants. At 3 years, children with history of any ARI episode during infancy had lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1.0)), forced expiratory volume in 0.75 s (FEV(0.75)), forced expiratory volume in 0.5 s (FEV(0.5)), forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of FVC (FEF(25\u201375)), and maximal expiratory flow at 25% of FVC (MEF(25)) as compared with those without any ARI episode during infancy. The ratio of tidal expiratory flow (TEF) at 25% or 50% of tidal expiratory volume to peak TEF (TEF(50) or TEF(25)/peak TEF) at 3 years was significantly increased in children who had ARI in infancy. CONCLUSIONS: ARI during infancy is associated with impaired pulmonary function indices such as increased resistance and decreased forced expiratory flow and volume at 3 years of age.","publish_time":"2020-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Prawin; Mukherjee, Aparna; Randev, Shivani; Medigeshi, Guruprasad R; Jat, Kana Ram; Kapil, Arti; Lodha, Rakesh; Kabra, Sushil Kumar","journal":"BMJ Open Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b399adcfb1d563f2c836e2c924fb0c090fca961a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7047475.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7047475/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQ0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARI","RTC","IPFT","FVC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infancy","tidal expiratory volume","forced expiratory flow","lower forced expiratory volume","impact of ARI","ARI episodes","maximal expiratory flow","ratio of tidal expiratory flow","peak TEF","tidal breathing flow-volume loop","years of age","volume RTC manoeuvres","FEV","pulmonary function test indices","impaired pulmonary function indices","Infant pulmonary function tests","respiratory pathogens","children","FVC","Acute respiratory infections","developing respiratory system","long-term impact","increased resistance","cohort of normal","prospective cohort study","rapid thoracoabdominal compression","follow-up visit","IPFTs","ARIs","nasopharyngeal aspirates","history","full-term newborns","INTRODUCTION","baseline","neonates","real-time PCR","METHODS","infants","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","boys","FEF","MEF"],"language":"en"},

However, most microarray assays are labour\u2010intensive and time\u2010consuming to perform. This study describes the development and initial evaluation of a multiplex reverse transcription (RT)\u2010PCR and novel accompanying automated electronic microarray assay for simultaneous detection and differentiation of seven important viruses that affect swine (foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease virus [FMDV], swine vesicular disease virus [SVDV], vesicular exanthema of swine virus [VESV], African swine fever virus [ASFV], classical swine fever virus [CSFV], porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus [PRRSV] and porcine circovirus type 2 [PCV2]). The novel electronic microarray assay utilizes a single, user\u2010friendly instrument that integrates and automates capture probe printing, hybridization, washing and reporting on a disposable electronic microarray cartridge with 400 features. This assay accurately detected and identified a total of 68 isolates of the seven targeted virus species including 23 samples of FMDV, representing all seven serotypes, and 10 CSFV strains, representing all three genotypes. The assay successfully detected viruses in clinical samples from the field, experimentally infected animals (as early as 1 day post\u2010infection (dpi) for FMDV and SVDV, 4 dpi for ASFV, 5 dpi for CSFV), as well as in biological material that were spiked with target viruses. The limit of detection was 10 copies/\u03BCl for ASFV, PCV2 and PRRSV, 100 copies/\u03BCl for SVDV, CSFV, VESV and 1,000 copies/\u03BCl for FMDV. The electronic microarray component had reduced analytical sensitivity for several of the target viruses when compared with the multiplex RT\u2010PCR. The integration of capture probe printing allows custom onsite array printing as needed, while electrophoretically driven hybridization generates results faster than conventional microarrays that rely on passive hybridization. With further refinement, this novel, rapid, highly automated microarray technology has potential applications in multipathogen surveillance of livestock diseases.","publish_time":"2017-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Erickson, A.; Fisher, M.; Furukawa\u2010Stoffer, T.; Ambagala, A.; Hodko, D.; Pasick, J.; King, D.

The largest outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outside the Middle East occurred in South Korea in 2015 and resulted in 186 laboratory-confirmed infections, including 36 (19%) deaths. Some hospitals were considered epicenters of infection and voluntarily shut down most of their operations after nearly half of all transmissions occurred in hospital settings. However, the ways that MERS-CoV is transmitted in healthcare settings are not well defined. Methods. We explored the possible contribution of contaminated hospital air and surfaces to MERS transmission by collecting air and swabbing environmental surfaces in 2 hospitals treating MERS-CoV patients. The samples were tested by viral culture with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using MERS-CoV Spike antibody, and electron microscopy (EM). Results. The presence of MERS-CoV was confirmed by RT-PCR of viral cultures of 4 of 7 air samples from 2 patients\u0027 rooms, 1 patient\u0027s restroom, and 1 common corridor. In addition, MERS-CoV was detected in 15 of 68 surface swabs by viral cultures. IFA on the cultures of the air and swab samples revealed the presence of MERS-CoV. EM images also revealed intact particles of MERS-CoV in viral cultures of the air and swab samples. Conclusions.

During viral encephalomyelitis, the absence of CD4 T cells decreases CD8 T cell activity and impedes viral control in the central nervous system (CNS). By contrast, the absence of B7-H1 enhances CD8 T-cell function and accelerates viral control, but increases morbidity. However, the relative contribution of CD4 T cells to CD8 function in the CNS, in the absence of B7-H1, remains unclear. METHODS: Wild-type (WT) and B7-H1(\u2212/\u2212) mice were infected with a gliatropic coronavirus and CD4 T cells depleted to specifically block T helper function in the CNS. Flow cytometry and gene expression analysis of purified T-cell populations from lymph nodes and the CNS was used to directly monitor ex vivo T-cell effector function. The biological affects of altered T-cell responses were evaluated by analysis of viral control and spinal-cord pathology. RESULTS: Increased anti-viral activity by CD8 T cells in the CNS of B7-H1(\u2212/\u2212) mice was lost upon depletion of CD4 T cells; however, despite concomitant loss of viral control, the clinical disease was less severe. CD4 depletion in B7-H1(\u2212/\u2212) mice also decreased inducible nitric oxide synthase expression by microglia and macrophages, consistent with decreased microglia/macrophage activation and reduced interferon (IFN)-\u03B3. Enhanced production of IFN-\u03B3, interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-21 mRNA was seen in CD4 T cells from infected B7-H1(\u2212/\u2212) compared with WT mice, suggesting that over-activated CD4 T cells primarily contribute to the increased pathology. CONCLUSIONS: The local requirement of CD4 T-cell help for CD8 T-cell function is not overcome if B7-H1 inhibitory signals are lost. Moreover, the increased effector activity by CD8 T cells in the CNS of B7-H1(\u2212/\u2212) mice is attributable not only to the absence of B7-H1 upregulation on major histocompatibility complex class I-presenting resident target cells, but also to enhanced local CD4 T-cell function. B7-H1-mediated restraint of CD4 T-cell activity is thus crucial to dampen both CD8 T-cell function and microglia/macrophage activation, thereby providing protection from T-cell-mediated bystander damage.","publish_time":"2012-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Phares, Timothy W; Stohlman, Stephen A; Hinton, David R; Bergmann, Cornelia C","journal":"J Neuroinflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c59d6e789176b928523129adb96ca495720a3b4a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3545890.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-2094-9-269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23237504/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CD8 T cells","CD8 T-cell function","CD8 T cell activity","absence of CD4 T cells","depletion of CD4 T cells","T-cell effector function","local CD4 T-cell function","T helper function","Anti-viral CD8 T-cell activity","mediated restraint of CD4 T-cell activity","over-activated CD4 T cells","relative contribution of CD4 T cells","local requirement of CD4 T-cell help","CNS of B7","infected B7-H1","CD8 function","absence of B7","biological affects of altered T-cell responses","CD4 depletion","inhibitory B7-H1 interactions","B7-H1 inhibitory signals","gene expression analysis of purified T-cell populations","H1 upregulation","analysis of viral control","Increased anti-viral activity","viral encephalomyelitis","resident target cells","WT mice","increased effector activity","concomitant loss of viral control","decreased microglia","mediated help","increased pathology","macrophage activation","Enhanced production of IFN","mediated bystander damage","spinal-cord pathology","inducible nitric oxide synthase expression","macrophages","major histocompatibility complex class","reduced interferon","lymph nodes","central nervous system","protection","gliatropic coronavirus","Flow cytometry","clinical disease","interleukin","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","mRNA","Wild-type","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","morbidity","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Potential societal benefits of having few beds include lower costs for health care and less futile intensive care at the end of life. With added ICU beds for a population, mortality benefit should accrue, but there is still the question of whether the addition of beds always means that more lives will be saved or whether there is a point at which no additional mortality benefit is gained. With an abundance of ICU beds may come the possibility of increasing harm in the forms of unnecessary costs, poor quality of deaths (ie, excessively intensive), and iatrogenic complications. The possibility of harm may be likened to the concept of falling off a Starling curve, which is traditionally used to describe worsening heart function when overfilling occurs.

Members of this virus family are positive-strand RNA viruses and replicate their genome in close association with reorganized intracellular host cell membrane compartments. This evolutionarily conserved strategy facilitates efficient viral genome replication and contributes to evasion from host cell cytosolic defense mechanisms. We have previously described the identification of a small-compound inhibitor, K22, which exerts a potent antiviral activity against a broad range of coronaviruses by targeting membrane-bound viral RNA replication. To analyze the antiviral spectrum of this inhibitor, we assessed the inhibitory potential of K22 against several members of the Flaviviridae family, including the reemerging Zika virus (ZIKV). We show that ZIKV is strongly affected by K22. Time-of-addition experiments revealed that K22 acts during a postentry phase of the ZIKV life cycle, and combination regimens of K22 together with ribavirin (RBV) or interferon alpha (IFN-\u03B1) further increased the extent of viral inhibition. Ultrastructural electron microscopy studies revealed severe alterations of ZIKV-induced intracellular replication compartments upon infection of K22-treated cells. Importantly, the antiviral activity of K22 was demonstrated against several other members of the Flaviviridae family. It is tempting to speculate that K22 exerts its broad antiviral activity against several positive-strand RNA viruses via a similar mechanism and thereby represents an attractive candidate for development as a panviral inhibitor.","publish_time":"2018-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garc\u00EDa-Nicol\u00E1s, Obdulio; V\u0027kovski, Philip; Vielle, Nathalie J.; Ebert, Nadine; Z\u00FCst, Roland; Portmann, Jasmine; Stalder, Hanspeter; Gaschen, V\u00E9ronique; Vieyres, Gabrielle; Stoffel, Michael; Schweizer, Matthias; Summerfield, Artur; Engler, Olivier; Pietschmann, Thomas; Todt, Daniel; Alves, Marco P.; Thiel, Volker; Pfaender, Stephanie","journal":"Antimicrob Agents Chemother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/21a9444b2cd05fcac9c082ca87fac36e91086b6c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6201103.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.01206-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30181371/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral activity of K22","infection of K22","K22 acts","Flaviviridae family","combination regimens of K22","inhibitory potential of K22","virus family Flaviviridae","viral RNA replication","broad antiviral activity","Members","positive-strand RNA viruses","potent antiviral activity","emerging viruses","antiviral spectrum","intracellular replication compartments","efficient viral genome replication","severe alterations of ZIKV","ZIKV life cycle","panviral inhibitor","reorganized intracellular host cell membrane compartments","reemerging Zika virus","small-compound inhibitor","extent of viral inhibition","host cell cytosolic defense mechanisms","broad range of coronaviruses","evasion","close association","ribavirin","postentry phase","Ultrastructural electron microscopy studies","similar mechanism","interferon alpha","attractive candidate","widespread morbidity","RBV","conserved strategy","IFN-\u03B1","development","mortality","addition experiments","treated cells","world","identification","Time"],"language":"en"},

A pragmatic clinical classification is episodic (viral) wheeze and multiple-trigger wheeze. Diagnostic difficulties include other conditions that give rise to noisy breathing which could be misinterpreted as wheeze. Most preschool children with wheeze do not need rigorous investigations. Primary prevention is not possible but avoidance of environmental tobacco smoke exposure should be strongly encouraged. Bronchodilators provide symptomatic relief in acute wheezy episodes but the evidence for using oral steroids is conflicting for children presenting to the Emergency Department [ED]. Parent initiated oral steroid courses cannot be recommended. High dose inhaled corticosteroids [ICS] used intermittently are effective in children with frequent episodes of moderately severe episodic (viral) wheeze or multiple-trigger wheeze, but this associated with short term effects on growth and cannot be recommended as a routine. Maintenance treatment with low to moderate continuous ICS in pure episodic (viral) wheeze is ineffective. Whilst low to moderate dose regular ICS work in multi-trigger wheeze, the medication does not modify the natural history of the condition. Even if there is a successful trial of treatment with ICS, a break in treatment should be given to see if the symptoms have resolved or continuous therapy is still required.

The syndrome affects newborn calves and is characterized by pancytopenia, severe bleeding and high lethality. So far, a causative role of infectious or toxic agents has been ruled out. Instead, the syndrome is induced after ingestion of colostrum, the first milk that supplies the calf with maternal antibodies. In analogy to similar diseases in humans it has therefore been postulated that BNP is caused by alloreactive, maternal antibodies. There is a striking association between BNP and a previous vaccination of the respective dams with a particular vaccine against Bovine Virus Diarrhoea (BVD). This association has led to a suspension of the marketing authorisation for the vaccine, by the European Commission. The current study investigates the role of this vaccine in the pathogenesis of BNP. By flow cytometry we were able to demonstrate that sera of BNP dams (dams that gave birth to a BNP calf) harbour alloreactive antibodies binding to surface antigens on bovine leukocytes. A significantly weaker alloreactivity was observed with sera of non-BNP dams that have been vaccinated with the same vaccine but delivered healthy calves. No binding was seen with non-BVD-vaccinated control cows and animals that were vaccinated with other inactivated BVD vaccines so far not associated with BNP. The binding is functionally relevant, because opsonization of bovine leukocytes with alloantibodies led to an elevated cytophagocytosis by bovine macrophages. To test whether the vaccine induces alloreactive antibodies two strategies were employed: Guinea pigs were vaccinated with a panel of commercially available BVD-vaccines. Only the incriminated vaccine induced antibodies binding surface antigens on bovine leukocytes. Additionally, two calves were repeatedly vaccinated with the suspected vaccine and the development of alloreactivity was monitored. In dependence of the number of booster immunizations the induction of alloreactive antibodies could be observed. Finally, by affinity purification we were able to directly demonstrate that BNP associated alloantibodies cross react with the bovine kidney cell line used for vaccine production. Together this provides strong evidence that this particular BVD vaccine has the potential to induce BNP associated alloantibodies.","publish_time":"2011-07-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bastian, Max; Holsteg, Mark; Hanke-Robinson, Heidrun; Duchow, Karin; Cussler, Klaus","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dd8738920d2fdd2f606f249d47665b32dc33f1ea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126856.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X11007213; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21605614/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X11007213; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.05.012","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BNP","Bovine Virus Diarrhoea","European Commission"],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["BNP calf","particular vaccine","pathogenesis of BNP","particular BVD vaccine","sera of BNP dams","vaccine production","suspected vaccine","incriminated vaccine","sera of non-BNP dams","bovine macrophages","maternal antibodies","binding","opsonization of bovine leukocytes","harbour alloreactive antibodies","induction of alloreactive antibodies","Bovine Virus Diarrhoea","non-BVD-vaccinated control cows","Abstract Bovine Neonatal Pancytopenia","available BVD-vaccines","inactivated BVD vaccines","bovine kidney cell line","respective dams","surface antigens","alloantibodies cross","newborn calves","syndrome","healthy calves","development of alloreactivity","striking association","weaker alloreactivity","causative role of infectious","birth","previous vaccination","number of booster immunizations","panel","animals","strategies","potential","elevated cytophagocytosis","Germany","toxic agents","severe bleeding","high lethality","milk","new emerging disease","strong evidence","Guinea pigs","analogy","similar diseases","humans","dependence","ingestion of colostrum","suspension","marketing authorisation","current study","neighbouring countries","flow cytometry","affinity purification","European Commission"],"language":"en"},

Various vaccination strategies against toxoplasmosis in rodent models have been used in the past few decades; however, effective vaccines remain a challenge. A recombinant adenovirus vaccine expressing ubiquitin-conjugated multi-stage antigen segments (Ad-UMAS) derived from different life-cycle stages of T. gondii was constructed previously. Here, we compared the immune responses and protection effects in vaccination of mice with Ad-UMAS by five vaccination routes including intramuscular (i.m.), intravenous (i.v.), subcutaneous (s.c.), intraoral (i.o.), and intranasal (i.n.). Much higher levels of T. gondii-specific IgG and IgA antibodies were detected in the sera of the intraoral and intranasal vaccination groups on day 49 compared with controls (p \u003C 0.05). The percentages of CD8(\u002B) T-cells in mice immunized intranasally and intraorally were larger than in mice immunized intramuscularly (p \u003C 0.05). The highest level of IL-2 and IFN-\u03B3 was detected in the group with nasal immunization, and splenocyte proliferation activity was significantly enhanced in mice immunized via the oral and nasal routes. Furthermore, the higher survival rate (50%) and lower cyst numbers observed in the intraoral and intranasal groups all indicate that Ad-UMAS is far more effective in protecting mice against T. gondii infection via the mucosal route. Ad-UMAS could be an effective and safe mucosal candidate vaccine to protect animals and humans against T. gondii infection.","publish_time":"2017-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Ting; Yin, Huiquan; Li, Yan; Zhao, Lingxiao; Sun, Xiahui; Cong, Hua","journal":"Parasite","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f446f5b176d426f14b28a4898d83c43291ae82d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5399536.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1051/parasite/2017013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28367800/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccination of mice","Ad-UMAS","gondii infection","Toxoplasma gondii","vaccination routes","intranasal vaccination groups","intranasal groups","gondii-specific IgG","Various vaccination strategies","animals","humans","effective vaccines","Toxoplasmosis","nasal routes","safe mucosal candidate vaccine","nasal immunization","mucosal route","higher levels","recombinant adenovirus vaccine","higher survival rate","ubiquitin","multi-stage antigen segments","day","cause of congenital disease","protection effects","obligate intracellular protozoan","abortion","IgA antibodies","splenocyte proliferation activity","rodent models","sera","T-cells","different life-cycle stages","immune responses","lower cyst numbers","highest level of IL","IFN-\u03B3","decades","past","controls","percentages of CD8","challenge"],"language":"en"},

For example, APOBEC3G deaminates cytosines to hypermutate reverse transcribed viral DNA; IFITM3 alters membranes to inhibit virus membrane fusion; MXA/B oligomerize on viral protein complexes to inhibit virus replication; SAMHD1 decreases dNTP intracellular concentrations to prevent reverse transcription of retrovirus genomes; tetherin prevents release of budding virions from cells; Viperin catalyzes formation of a nucleoside analogue that inhibits viral RNA polymerases; and ZAP binds virus RNAs to target them for degradation. We also discuss countermeasures employed by specific viruses against these restriction factors, and mention secondary functions of several of these factors in modulating immune responses.

Infectious bronchitis is an acute, highly contagious, viral disease of chickens, characterized by rales, coughing, and sneezing. Because secreted phospholipases A2 (sPLA2) are involved in inflammatory processes, the gene expressions of sPLA2s were investigated in both healthy chickens and chickens with infectious bronchitis and lung inflammation. The draft chicken genome was first scanned using human sPLA2 sequences to identify chicken sPLA2s (ChPLA2), chicken total mRNA were isolated and RT-PCR experiments were performed to amplify and then sequence orthologous cDNAs. Full-length cDNA sequences of ChPLA2-IB, -IIA, -IIE, -V and -X were cloned. The high degree of sequence identity of 50\u201370% between the avian and mammalian (human and mouse) sPLA2 orthologs suggests a conservation of important enzymatic functions for these phospholipases. Quantitation by qPCR of the transcript levels of ChPLA2-IB, -IIA, -IIE, -V and -X in several tissues from healthy chicken indicated that the expression patterns and mRNA levels diverged among the phospholipases tested. In chicken with infectious bronchitis, an over expression of ChPLA2-V was observed in lungs and spleen in comparison with healthy chicken. These findings suggest that ChPLA2-V could be a potential biomarker for lung inflammation. Conversely, a down regulation of ChPLA2-IB, -IIA and -X was observed in lungs and spleen in case of infectious bronchitis. A significant increase in the expression level of ChPLA2-X and ChPLA2-IB was also noticed in pancreas. No or minor changes have been detected in the expression of ChPLA2-IIE in lungs and small intestine, but it shows a significant increase in several infected tissues.","publish_time":"2012-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karray, Aida; Ben Ali, Yassine; Boujelben, Jamil; Amara, Sawsan; Carri\u00E8re, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric; Gargouri, Youssef; Bezzine, Sofiane","journal":"Biochimie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d6ae4c59fec3d179498f49316591883513d9661.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117035.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300908411003282; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2011.08.013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300908411003282; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21893157/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ChPLA2-IB","expression of ChPLA2","ChPLA2-V","regulation of ChPLA2","expression level of ChPLA2","chicken sPLA2s","transcript levels of ChPLA2","case of infectious bronchitis","Abstract Infectious bronchitis","Full-length cDNA sequences of ChPLA2","healthy chickens","chicken total mRNA","lungs","IIE","IIA","draft chicken genome","expression patterns","human sPLA2 sequences","sPLA2 orthologs","spleen","mRNA levels","significant increase","lung inflammation","viral disease of chickens","secreted phospholipases A2","important diseases","infected tissues","gene expressions of sPLA2s","conservation of important enzymatic functions","high degree of sequence identity","mouse","poultry","inflammatory processes","RT-PCR experiments","potential biomarker","mammalian","qPCR","small intestine","comparison","major economic losses","Quantitation","rales","findings","minor changes","orthologous cDNAs","sneezing","pancreas"],"language":"en"},

Meanwhile, since helicase is the most well-defined G-quadruplex-related protein, the most extensive research on the relationship between helicase and G-quadruplexes, and its meaning in drug design, is emphasized.","publish_time":"2019-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Zhi-Yin; Wang, Xiao-Na; Cheng, Sui-Qi; Su, Xiao-Xuan; Ou, Tian-Miao","journal":"Molecules","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33cf03ea72e45ea6d6beeccc91c5145807544728.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6384609.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules24030396; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678288/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["G-quadruplexes","G-quadruplex structures","well-defined G-quadruplex","feasibility of G","quadruplex ligands","anti-tumor drugs","related protein","potential anti-tumor agents","related binding proteins","helicase","novel promising anti-tumor strategy","cancer-related genes","Different kinds of small molecules","special secondary structure of nucleic acids","DNA damage repair","transcription","guanine-rich sequences of genome","translation of oncogenes","extensive research","relationship","regulation of replication","basis","meaning","application","drug design","review"],"language":"en"},

Contact tracing using smartphone technology is a powerful tool that may be employed to limit disease transmission during an epidemic or pandemic; yet, contact tracing apps present significant privacy concerns regarding the collection of personal data such as location. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop an effective contact tracing smartphone app that respects user privacy by not collecting location information or other personal data. METHODS: We propose the use of an anonymized graph of interpersonal interactions to conduct a novel form of contact tracing and have developed a proof-of-concept smartphone app that implements this approach. Additionally, we developed a computer simulation model that demonstrates the impact of our proposal on epidemic or pandemic outbreak trajectories across multiple rates of adoption. RESULTS: Our proof-of-concept smartphone app allows users to create \u201Ccheckpoints\u201D for contact tracing, check their risk level based on their past interactions, and anonymously self-report a positive status to their peer network. Our simulation results suggest that higher adoption rates of such an app may result in a better controlled epidemic or pandemic outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed smartphone-based contact tracing method presents a novel solution that preserves privacy while demonstrating the potential to suppress an epidemic or pandemic outbreak. This app could potentially be applied to the current COVID-19 pandemic as well as other epidemics or pandemics in the future to achieve a middle ground between drastic isolation measures and unmitigated disease spread.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yasaka, Tyler M; Lehrich, Brandon M; Sahyouni, Ronald","journal":"JMIR Mhealth Uhealth","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7144575.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32240973/; https://doi.org/10.2196/18936","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effective contact tracing smartphone app","novel form of contact tracing","concept smartphone app","proposed smartphone-based contact tracing method","pandemic outbreak trajectories","smartphone technology","novel coronavirus disease","tracing apps present significant privacy concerns","user privacy","multiple rates of adoption","novel solution","higher adoption rates","proof","better controlled epidemic","disease transmission","simulation results","high death rates","unmitigated disease spread","collection of personal data","past interactions","location information","current COVID","computer simulation model","anonymized graph of interpersonal interactions","epidemiologic models","drastic isolation measures","severe consequences","urgent public health crisis","middle ground","self-report","positive status","impact","risk level","proposal","future","study","users","checkpoints","peer network","powerful tool","course","epidemics","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","approach","potential","intervention","response","OBJECTIVE","aim","pandemics","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

However, to date, no commercial vaccine is available. In this study, structural proteins of MERS-CoV were expressed in silkworm larvae and Bm5 cells for the development of vaccine candidates against MERS-CoV and diagnostic methods. The spike (S) protein of MERS-CoV lacking its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (S\u0394TM) was secreted into the hemolymph of silkworm larvae using a bombyxin signal peptide and purified using affinity chromatography. The purified S\u0394TM forms small nanoparticles as well as the full-length S protein and has the ability to bind human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), which is a receptor of MERS-CoV. These results indicate that bioactive S\u0394TM was expressed in silkworm larvae. To produce MERS-CoV-like particles (MERS-CoV-LPs), the coexpression of spike proteins was performed in Bm5 cells and envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins secreted E and M proteins extracellularly, suggesting that MERS-CoV-LPs may be formed. However, this S protein was not displayed on virus-like particles (VLPs) even though E and M proteins were secreted into the culture supernatant. By surfactant treatment and mechanical extrusion using S protein- or three structural protein-expressing Bm5 cells, S protein-displaying nanovesicles with diameters of approximately 100-200 nm were prepared and confirmed by immuno-TEM. The mechanical extrusion method is favorable for obtaining uniform recombinant protein-displaying nanovesicles from cultured cells. The purified S\u0394TM from silkworm larvae and S protein-displaying nanovesicles from Bm5 cells may lead to the development of nanoparticle-based vaccines against MERS-CoV and the diagnostic detection of MERS-CoV.","publish_time":"2019-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kato, Tatsuya; Takami, Yoshihiro; Kumar Deo, Vipin; Park, Enoch Y.","journal":"Journal of Biotechnology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5557f847ae1466924fdbb0c9c0adaa0d416680da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114102.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168165619308879; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168165619308879; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2019.10.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614169/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV","protein of MERS","structural proteins of MERS","receptor of MERS","full-length S protein","Bm5 cells","diagnostic detection of MERS","proteins secreted E","uniform recombinant protein","cultured cells","nanovesicles","hemolymph of silkworm larvae","coexpression of spike proteins","bioactive S\u0394TM","purified S\u0394TM forms small nanoparticles","development of vaccine candidates","mechanical extrusion method","development of nanoparticle","commercial vaccine","diagnostic methods","Abstract Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","bombyxin signal peptide","ability","based vaccines","membrane","surfactant treatment","DPP4","human dipeptidyl peptidase","cytoplasmic domains","envelope","diameters","affinity chromatography","VLPs","study","deaths","nm","results","culture supernatant","immuno-TEM","infections","countries"],"language":"en"},

We examined skin and lung tissues from 5 patients with severe COVID-19 characterized by respiratory failure (n=5) and purpuric skin rash (n=3). The pattern of COVID-19 pneumonitis was predominantly a pauci-inflammatory septal capillary injury with significant septal capillary mural and luminal fibrin deposition and permeation of the inter-alveolar septa by neutrophils. No viral cytopathic changes were observed and the diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with hyaline membranes, inflammation, and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, hallmarks of classic ARDS, were not prominent. These pulmonary findings were accompanied by significant deposits of terminal complement components C5b-9 (membrane attack complex), C4d, and mannose binding lectin (MBL)-associated serine protease (MASP)2, in the microvasculature, consistent with sustained, systemic activation of the alternative and lectin-based complement pathways. The purpuric skin lesions similarly showed a pauci-inflammatory thrombogenic vasculopathy, with deposition of C5b-9 and C4d in both grossly involved and normally-appearing skin. In addition, there was co-localization of COVID-19 spike glycoproteins with C4d and C5b-9 in the inter-alveolar septa and the cutaneous microvasculature of two cases examined. In conclusion, at least a subset of sustained, severe COVID-19 may define a type of catastrophic microvascular injury syndrome mediated by activation of complement pathways and an associated procoagulant state. It provides a foundation for further exploration of the pathophysiologic importance of complement in COVID-19, and could suggest targets for specific intervention.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Magro, Cynthia; Mulvey, J.

As additional point mutations are necessary for further expansions, epistasis among host range mutations can potentially affect the mutational neighborhood and frequency of niche expansion. We mapped the mutational neighborhood of host range expansion using three genotypes of the dsRNA bacteriophage phi6 (wildtype and two isogenic host range mutants) on the novel host Pseudomonas syringae pv. atrofaciens (PA). Sanger sequencing of fifty PA mutant clones for each genotype and population Illumina sequencing both revealed the same high frequency mutations allowing infection of PA. Wildtype phi6 had at least nine different ways of mutating to enter the novel host, eight of which are in p3 (host attachment protein gene), and 13/50 clones had unchanged p3 genes. However, the two isogenic mutants had dramatically restricted neighborhoods: only one or two mutations, all in p3. Deep sequencing revealed that wildtype clones without mutations in p3 likely had changes in p12 (morphogenic protein), a region that was not polymorphic for the two isogenic host range mutants. Sanger sequencing confirmed that 10/13 of the wildtype phi6 clones had nonsynonymous mutations in p12 and two others had point mutations in p9 and p5 \u2013 none of these genes had previously been associated with host range expansion in phi6. We demonstrate, for the first time, epistatic constraint in an RNA virus due to host range mutations themselves, which has implications for models of serial host range expansion. Importance RNA viruses mutate rapidly and frequently expand their host ranges to infect novel hosts, leading to serial host shifts. Using an RNA bacteriophage model system (Pseudomonas phage phi6), we studied the impact of pre-existing host range mutations on another host range expansion. Results from both clonal Sanger and Illumina sequencing show extant host range mutations dramatically narrow the neighborhood of potential host range mutations compared to wildtype phi6. This research suggests that serial host shifting viruses may follow a small number of molecular paths to enter additional novel hosts. We also identified new genes involved in phi6 host range expansion, expanding our knowledge of this important model system in experimental evolution.","publish_time":"2018-08-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Lele; Pasricha, Mansha Seth; Stemate, Dragos; Crespo-Bellido, Alvin; Gagnon, Jacqueline; Duffy, Siobain","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1393bc2b0d76024e8956897be8dbef922b663c50.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e4e5e67fd4f75548dffab7f75484bc14fa15c0c2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/394080","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs3MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sanger","Deep"],"organizations":["PA","Illumina","PA.

In a large metropolitan of Thailand\u2019s capital city Bangkok, most respiratory infections are rarely confirmed by molecular diagnostics. We therefore examined the frequency of RSV, hMPV, and influenza virus in 8,842 patients who presented influenza-like illness and sought medical care at a large hospital in Bangkok between 2016 and 2017. Using a multiplex real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 30.5% (2,699/8,842) of nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples tested positive for one or more of these viruses. Influenza virus comprised 17.3% (1,528/8,842), of which the majority were influenza A/H3N2. Such infection was most prevalent among adults and the elderly. RSV was identified in 11.4% (1,011/8,842) and were mostly ON1 and BA9 genotypes. Of the hMPV-positive samples (3.6%, 318/8,842), genotypes A2, B1, and B2 were detected. A small number of individuals experienced co-infections (1.8%, 155/8,842), most commonly between RSV and influenza A/H3N2. RSV and hMPV co-infections were also found, but mainly in young children. Viral respiratory tract infection peaked locally in the rainy season (June to September). These findings support the utility of rapid nucleic acid testing of RSV, hMPV, and influenza virus in patients with ILI.","publish_time":"2019-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thongpan, Ilada; Suntronwong, Nungruthai; Vichaiwattana, Preeyaporn; Wanlapakorn, Nasamon; Vongpunsawad, Sompong; Poovorawan, Yong","journal":"PeerJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa1d2145aa1af1e5232d8d425f36f4e9bb20f392.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6462397.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30997293/; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.6748","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs3MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","ILI"],"locations":["Thailand","Bangkok"],"keyphrases":["influenza virus","respiratory infections","frequency of RSV","respiratory syncytial virus","hMPV co-infections","risk of seasonal influenza","respiratory viruses","hMPV-positive samples","illness","Viral respiratory tract infection","patients","adults","H3N2","utility of rapid nucleic acid testing of RSV","large hospital","swab samples","genotypes A2","BA9 genotypes","young children","large metropolitan of Thailand\u2019s capital city Bangkok","multiplex real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction","world","medical care","human metapneumovirus","populated urban centers","RT-PCR","NP","small number of individuals","findings","B1","B2","rainy season","molecular diagnostics","ON1","elderly","majority"],"language":"en"},

The resultant effect on the developing neonatal microbiota is unknown. Study Design: Stool and groin skin swabs were collected from infants in a shared-space NICU (old NICU) and a single-family room NICU (new NICU) on the same hospital campus. Metagenomic sequencing was performed and data analyzed by CosmosID bioinformatics software package. Results: There were no significant differences between the cohorts in gestational age, length of stay, and delivery mode; infants in the old NICU received significantly more antibiotics (p = 0.03). Differentially abundant antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence associated genes were found between the cohorts in stool and skin, with more differentially abundant antimicrobial resistance genes in the new NICU. The entire bacterial microbiota analyzed to the genus level significantly differed between cohorts in skin (p = 0.0001) but not in stool samples. There was no difference in alpha diversity between the two cohorts. DNA viruses and fungi were detected but did not differ between cohorts. Conclusion: Differences were seen in the resistome and virulome between the two cohorts with more differentially abundant antimicrobial resistance genes in the new NICU. This highlights the influence that different NICU environments can have on the neonatal microbiota. Whether the differences were due to the new NICU being a single-family NICU or located in a newly constructed building warrants exploration.

However, despite undergoing replication in the cytoplasm, the structural proteins of some of these RNA viruses localize to the nucleus at specific times in the virus life cycle, primarily early in infection. Limited evidence suggests that this enhances successful viral replication by interfering with or inhibiting the host antiviral response. Nucleocapsid proteins of RNA viruses have a well-established, essential cytoplasmic role in virus replication and assembly. Intriguingly, nucleocapsid proteins of some RNA viruses also localize to the nucleus/nucleolus of infected cells. Their nuclear function is less well understood although significant advances have been made in recent years. This review will focus on the nucleocapsid protein of cytoplasmic enveloped RNA viruses, including their localization to the nucleus/nucleolus and function therein. A greater understanding of the nuclear localization of nucleocapsid proteins has the potential to enhance therapeutic strategies as it can be a target for the development of live-attenuated vaccines or antiviral drugs.","publish_time":"2015-06-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wulan, Wahyu N.; Heydet, Deborah; Walker, Erin J.; Gahan, Michelle E.; Ghildyal, Reena","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e546530d3c2507a91afb8ed59c87cac0c8b501da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4451415.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26082769/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2015.00553","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Nucleocapsid proteins of RNA viruses","nucleocapsid protein of cytoplasmic enveloped RNA viruses","nucleus","nuclear localization of nucleocapsid proteins","virus replication","structural proteins","virus life cycle","cytoplasm of infected cells","nucleolus of infected cells","nuclear function","non-segmented single stranded RNA genomes","successful viral replication","antiviral drugs","essential cytoplasmic role","host antiviral response","specific times","development of live","attenuated vaccines","potential","assembly","greater understanding","target","significant advances","therapeutic strategies","recent years","Limited evidence","review","infection"],"language":"en"},

In fact, influenza virus itself does not make critical contribution to mortality induced by influenza, but \u0022cytokine storm\u0022 produced by the excessive immune response triggered by the virus can result in inflammatory reaction of lung tissues and fatal lung tissue injury, and thus increase influenza mortality. Therefore, besides antiviral drugs, immunosuppression drugs should also be included in infection treatment. PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: Complement is the center of inflammatory reaction. If complement system is over activated, the body will have strong inflammatory reaction or tissue injury, resulting in pathological process. Many studies have proved that, inflammatory injury of lung tissues caused by influenza virus is closely related to complement activation. Therefore, inhibiting complement activation can significantly reduce inflammatory injury in lung tissues. As complement is both a physiological defense and pathological damage medium, systematic inhibition may result in side effects including infection. Therefore, we design targeting complement inhibitors for complement activation sites, i.e. with CR2 as targeting vector, complement inhibitors like CD59 and Crry are targeted to inflammatory sites to specially inhibit the complement activation in local injury, thus local inflammatory reaction is inhibited. TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: CR2-CD59 and CR2-Crry targeting complement inhibitors are fusion-expressed, and their biological activity is examined via in vivo and in vitro tests. CR2 targeting complement inhibitors are used to treat mouse influenza viral pneumonia model, with PBS treatment group as the control. The survival and lung tissue injury of the mice is observed and the effect of CR2 targeting complement inhibitors on pneumonia induced by influenza virus is evaluated. IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: CR2 targeting complement inhibitors are expected to be ideal drugs for viral pneumonia.","publish_time":"2010-02-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Chuanfu; Xu, Yuanyong; Jia, Leili; Yang, Yutao; Wang, Yong; Sun, Yansong; Huang, Liuyu; Qiao, Fei; Tomlinson, Stephen; Liu, Xuelin; Zhou, Yusen; Song, Hongbin","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c92099607cfae94a24e03a111d12994535cc2eae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2829536.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20144216/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-7-30","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PBS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["complement inhibitors","complement activation","targeting","influenza virus","inflammatory injury of lung tissues","inflammatory reaction of lung tissues","inflammatory sites","influenza mortality","local inflammatory reaction","local injury","strong inflammatory reaction","center of inflammatory reaction","CR2-Crry","CR2-CD59","fatal lung tissue injury","effect of CR2","activation sites","HYPOTHESIS","mouse influenza viral pneumonia model","ideal drugs","antiviral drugs","immunosuppression drugs","infection treatment","pathological process","pathological damage medium","PBS treatment group","systematic inhibition","physiological defense","respiratory disease","critical contribution","excessive immune response","body","mice","cytokine storm","human health","effects","control","BACKGROUND","vector","survival","IMPLICATIONS","fact","PRESENTATION","studies","biological activity","tests"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to quantify the variation in individual test-day milk yield and somatic cell count, risk of reproductive failure after first service of dairy cows, and risk of death of calves and heifers according to the BCV and BRSV status of the herd. Three types of status were defined for BCV and BRSV infections, based on 1) the dynamics over a 7-mo period of BCV- and BRSV-specific antibody levels in pooled milk of primiparous cows; 2) the possible occurrence of presumably BCV- and BRSV-related clinical outbreaks; and 3) the combination of both pieces of information. A total of 36,184 test days, 2,716 cows with a first service, and 4,104 calves and heifers in 65 Swedish herds were included in the analyses. Animal performance associated with BCV and BRSV infections was quantified using hierarchical mixed generalized and survival models, after adjustment for covariates known to influence the performance under study. A significant reduction in milk yield was observed for cows in presumably BRSV recently infected herds, as well as in herds having a presumably BRSV-related clinical outbreak (of 0.57 and 0.91kg/d, respectively), compared with cows in presumably infection-free herds. There was also a significant increase in somatic cell count (of 12,000 cells/mL) for cows located in herds with a BRSV outbreak. The risk of failure after first service, as well as the risk of death in calf and heifer, was numerically higher in BRSV-infected herds, although this was not statistically significant. In contrast, BCV infection herd status, as defined in the present study, was not significantly associated with any production losses in animals from infected herds compared with those in infection-free herds.","publish_time":"2010-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beaudeau, F.; Ohlson, A.; Emanuelson, U.","journal":"Journal of Dairy Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c635d21a8dd780ebae0bfe87fd7ef1d7d717c4ec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094670.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030210001256; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20338429/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022030210001256; https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2009-2511","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BCV","BRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BRSV-infected herds","BRSV infections","BRSV status","BRSV outbreak","Swedish herds","infection-free herds","BRSV-related clinical outbreaks","BCV infection herd status","service of dairy cows","BRSV-specific antibody levels","mo period of BCV","risk of failure","risk of death","pooled milk of primiparous cows","animal performance","risk of reproductive failure","somatic cell count","heifers","calves","types of status","associated effects","significant increase","significant reduction","present study","individual test-day milk yield","test days","bovine respiratory syncytial virus","economic impact of bovine coronavirus","survival models","accurate estimates","variation","adjustment","covariates","calf","production losses","animals","cells","possible occurrence","contrast","combination","pieces of information","dynamics","total","analyses"],"language":"en"},

The species richness and greater genetic diversity of African lyssaviruses, along with the lack of antibody cross-reactivity among them, has led to the hypothesis that Africa is the origin of lyssaviruses. This hypothesis was tested using a probabilistic phylogeographical approach. The nucleoprotein gene sequences from 153 representatives of 16 lyssavirus species, collected between 1956 and 2015, were used to develop a phylogenetic tree which incorporated relevant geographic and temporal data relating to the viruses. In addition, complete genome sequences from all 16 (putative) species were analysed. The most probable ancestral distribution for the internal nodes was inferred using three different approaches and was confirmed by analysis of complete genomes. These results support a Palearctic origin for lyssaviruses (posterior probability = 0.85), challenging the \u2018out of Africa\u2019 hypothesis, and suggest three independent transmission events to the Afrotropical region, representing the three phylogroups that form the three major lyssavirus clades.","publish_time":"2016-12-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hayman, David T.

To maintain alveolar fluid homeostasis, both the integrity of the alveolar\u2013capillary barrier and the expression of epithelial ion channels and pumps are necessary to establish a vectorial ion gradient. However, during pulmonary infection, auto- and/or paracrine-acting mediators induce pathophysiological changes of the alveolar\u2013capillary barrier, altered expression of epithelial Na,K-ATPase and of epithelial ion channels including epithelial sodium channel and cystic fibrosis membrane conductance regulator, leading to the accumulation of edema and impaired alveolar fluid clearance. These mediators include classical pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TGF-\u03B2, TNF-\u03B1, interferons, or IL-1\u03B2 that are released upon bacterial challenge with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Mycoplasma pneumoniae as well as in viral infection with influenza A virus, pathogenic coronaviruses, or respiratory syncytial virus. Moreover, the pro-apoptotic mediator TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, extracellular nucleotides, or reactive oxygen species impair epithelial ion channel expression and function. Interestingly, during bacterial infection, alterations of ion transport function may serve as an additional feedback loop on the respiratory inflammatory profile, further aggravating disease progression.

METHODS: We collected epidemiological and clinical information of patients with COVID-19 admitted to a makeshift Fangcang hospital between 7 and 26 February, 2020. The waiting time of each step during the medical care-seeking process was also analysed. RESULTS: Of the 205 patients with COVID-19 infection, 31% had presumed transmission from a family member. 10% of patients had hospital-related transmission. It took as long as a median of 6 days from the first medical visit to receive the COVID-19 nucleic acid test and 10 days from the first medical visit to hospital admission, indicating early recognition of COVID-19 was not achieved at the early stage of the outbreak, although these delays were shortened later. After clinical recovery from COVID-19, which took a mean of 21 days from illness onset, there was still a substantial proportion of patients who had persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic evaluation process of suspected patients needs to be accelerated at the epicentre of the outbreak and early isolation of infected patients in a healthcare setting rather than at home is urgently required to stop the spread of the virus. Clinical recovery is not an appropriate criterion to release isolated patients and as long as 4 weeks\u0027 isolation for patients with COVID-19 is not enough to prevent the spread of the virus.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hua, Jing; Chen, Rongzhang; Zhao, Liming; Wu, Xiaodong; Guo, Qian; He, Chunfeng; Li, Tian; Ren, Xiaoyu; Liu, Zhongmin; Li, Qiang; Wang, Feilong","journal":"ERJ Open Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05e927bcfb70558d87be44161993af366ee9af6f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7184112.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00142-2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363205/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["process of patients","isolated patients","clinical information of patients","early recognition of COVID","early isolation of infected patients","substantial proportion of patients","diagnostic evaluation process of suspected patients","medical care","medical visit","days","clinical recovery","clinical features","hospital admission","early stage","infection","hospital-related transmission","spread","makeshift Fangcang hospital","weeks\u0027 isolation","presumed transmission","useful information","persistent SARS-CoV","appropriate criterion","step","healthcare","places","nucleic acid test","illness onset","coronavirus disease","family member","China","similar outbreaks","mean","CONCLUSIONS","Wuhan","epicentre","waiting time","METHODS","home","delays","median","RESULTS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

The virus genome replicates via a negative-sense RNA intermediate. The NCRs and their complementary sequences in the negative-sense RNA are the sites for assembly of the RNA replicase complex thereby regulating the RNA synthesis and virus replication. In this study, we show that the 55-kDa polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) interacts in vitro with both the 5\u2032-NCR of the positive-sense genomic RNA - 5NCR(\u002B), and its complementary sequence in the negative-sense replication intermediate RNA - 3NCR(-). The interaction of viral RNA with PTB was validated in infected cells by JEV RNA co-immunoprecipitation and JEV RNA-PTB colocalization experiments. Interestingly, we observed phosphorylation-coupled translocation of nuclear PTB to cytoplasmic foci that co-localized with JEV RNA early during JEV infection. Our studies employing the PTB silencing and over-expression in cultured cells established an inhibitory role of PTB in JEV replication. Using RNA-protein binding assay we show that PTB competitively inhibits association of JEV 3NCR(-) RNA with viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5 protein), an event required for the synthesis of the plus-sense genomic RNA. cAMP is known to promote the Protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated PTB phosphorylation. We show that cells treated with a cAMP analogue had an enhanced level of phosphorylated PTB in the cytoplasm and a significantly suppressed JEV replication. Data presented here show a novel, cAMP-induced, PTB-mediated, innate host response that could effectively suppress JEV replication in mammalian cells.","publish_time":"2014-12-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bhullar, Deepika; Jalodia, Richa; Kalia, Manjula; Vrati, Sudhanshu","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/06f33aa8d51ad1c6081cd855c8d274d47e1ee74e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4278868.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25545659/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0114931","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PTB","JEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA synthesis","JEV RNA-PTB colocalization experiments","viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","JEV RNA co-immunoprecipitation","negative-sense RNA intermediate","positive-sense RNA genome","positive-sense genomic RNA","negative-sense replication intermediate RNA","interaction of viral RNA","plus-sense genomic RNA","RNA replicase complex","RNA-protein binding assay","PTB silencing","association of JEV","JEV infection","suppressed JEV replication","mediated PTB phosphorylation","inhibitory role of PTB","translocation of nuclear PTB","virus replication","enhanced level of phosphorylated PTB","cultured cells","infected cells","NS5 protein","mammalian cells","Protein kinase","virus genome replicates","cAMP analogue","NCRs","kDa polypyrimidine tract-binding protein","Japanese encephalitis virus","complementary sequences","single open reading frame","cytoplasmic foci","over-expression","assembly","sites","PKA","innate host response","non-coding regions","studies","event","novel","Data","study"],"language":"en"},

The present study was envisaged for carrying out thorough investigation of the disease among working dogs of organised kennels situated in different agro-climatic zones of India as comprehensive understanding of the disease from this country was pertinently lacking. During the study period of three years (2012\u20132014), 330 dogs suspected for babesiosis were examined for clinicopathology by their physical examination, haematological and biochemical parameters estimation, while the detection of apicomplexan parasites was confirmed by using various diagnostic techniques i.e. by conventional microscopy, by two different Babesia specific 18S rRNA based PCR protocols (conventional/simple PCR and nested PCR assays) followed by sequencing of obtained PCR amplicons for Babsesia spp. identification. Out of 330 clinical cases screened 5.15% (17/330), 9.09% (30/330) and 15.45% (51/330) were found to be positive in microscopic examination, simple- and nested- PCR assay, respectively. Comparative statistical analyses of these diagnostic assay results revealed that significant difference exists among the three diagnostic methodologies and thus it is recommended that the nested PCR technique be relied upon as a screening molecular assay and also for epidemiological studies of the disease in this country. Phylogenetic analysis based on 18S rRNA depicted the monophyletic nature and clonal expansion among all the B. gibsoni, under study. Sequencing results of PCR amplicons revealed that B. gibsoni has predominantly established itself over B. vogeli as former was incriminated in 47 cases while latter was confirmed in only four animals. Based on the clinical severity, these 51 affected animals were classified into three main groups\u2019 of 17 animals each viz., apparently healthy-, simple or uncomplicated babesiosis- and atypical or complicated babesiosis- group. Haematological and biochemical profiling of these dogs confirmed the characteristics findings of infection by both the Babesia spp. It was observed that the infection by small form of Babesia (B. gibsoni) is posing a significant therapeutic challenge and chemosterilization by commonly prescribed anti-protozoal drugs was not achieved as clinical relapses were often observed. The clinical signs, sequence based confirmation and severity of the infection suggested that there is a positive selection of B. gibsoni (smaller form) over B. vogeli (larger form) in this country and raises serious concerns as prognosis in former is considered to be poor compared to latter. Thus, these findings have opened new paradigms for planning of pragmatic control strategies against this emerging canine health problem.","publish_time":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mittal, Mitesh; Kundu, Krishnendu; Chakravarti, Soumendu; Mohapatra, Jajati K.; Singh, V.

BRSV is spread by horizontal contact causing a constant presence of seropositive animals that favors viral circulation throughout the year. Moreover, reinfections with BRSV are frequent between animals regardless of their age as BRSV does not confer long-lasting protective immunity. Several studies have demonstrated the circulation of BRSV in cattle from different regions of the world; however, little is known about the dynamics of BRSV infection in cows before and after they begin lactation. The aim of this work was to study the dynamics of BRSV neutralizing antibodies from birth up to 36 months of age in a closed dairy herd of Argentina specifically around the lactation period. Passive maternal antibodies against BRSV started to decrease monthly and became almost undetectable at 8 months of age. We detected two potential infection points at months 11 and 27 after birth, in which 30% and 45% of the animals showed seroconversion, respectively. Specifically, an increase in the proportion of seropositive cows after the start of lactation suggests that they became reinfected around the time they began lactating. We demonstrate the importance of understanding BRSV dynamics in a closed dairy herd to review the vaccination schedule of the animals to achieve protection against BRSV infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ferella, Alejandra; Aguirreburualde, Mar\u00EDa Sol Perez; Sammarruco, Ayelen; Parre\u00F1o, Viviana; Santos, Mar\u00EDa Jos\u00E9 Dus; Mozgovoj, Marina","journal":"Rev Argent Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/badabf9bbba3c57b9a5d73a572908e67a056d2f8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0325754120300274?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0325754120300274","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BRSV"],"locations":["Argentina"],"keyphrases":["circulation of BRSV","dynamics of BRSV infection","importance of understanding BRSV dynamics","months of age","cattle","closed dairy herd of Argentina","constant presence of seropositive animals","start of lactation","birth","lactation period","proportion of seropositive cows","potential infection points","respiratory disease","viral circulation","Passive maternal antibodies","Abstract Bovine respiratory syncytial virus","vaccination schedule","relevant agents responsible","horizontal contact","different regions","protection","long-lasting protective immunity","world","increase","beef farms","year","work","studies","reinfections","time","aim","seroconversion"],"language":"en"},

We provide a full description of a fatal case of MERS-CoV infection and associated phylogenetic analyses. METHODS: We report data for a patient who was admitted to the Klinikum Schwabing (Munich, Germany) for severe acute respiratory infection. We did diagnostic RT-PCR and indirect immunofluorescence. From time of diagnosis, respiratory, faecal, and urine samples were obtained for virus quantification. We constructed a maximum likelihood tree of the five available complete MERS-CoV genomes. FINDINGS: A 73-year-old man from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, was transferred to Klinikum Schwabing on March 19, 2013, on day 11 of illness. He had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2008, and had received several lines of treatment. The patient died on day 18, due to septic shock. MERS-CoV was detected in two samples of bronchoalveolar fluid. Viral loads were highest in samples from the lower respiratory tract (up to 1\u00B72 \u00D7 10(6) copies per mL). Maximum virus concentration in urine samples was 2691 RNA copies per mL on day 13; the virus was not present in the urine after renal failure on day 14. Stool samples obtained on days 12 and 16 contained the virus, with up to 1031 RNA copies per g (close to the lowest detection limit of the assay). One of two oronasal swabs obtained on day 16 were positive, but yielded little viral RNA (5370 copies per mL). No virus was detected in blood. The full virus genome was combined with four other available full genome sequences in a maximum likelihood phylogeny, correlating branch lengths with dates of isolation. The time of the common ancestor was halfway through 2011. Addition of novel genome data from an unlinked case treated 6 months previously in Essen, Germany, showed a clustering of viruses derived from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. INTERPRETATION: We have provided the first complete viral load profile in a case of MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV might have shedding patterns that are different from those of severe acute respiratory syndrome and so might need alternative diagnostic approaches.

This frameshift occurs at a slippery sequence on the viral messenger RNA and is stimulated by a specific structure, downstream of the shift site. While in group M, the most abundant HIV-1 group, the frameshift stimulatory signal is an extended bulged stem-loop, we show here, using a combination of mutagenesis and probing studies, that it is a pseudoknot in group O. The mutagenesis and probing studies coupled to an in silico analysis show that group O pseudoknot is a hairpin-type pseudoknot with two coaxially stacked stems of eight base-pairs (stem 1 and stem 2), connected by single-stranded loops of 2nt (loop 1) and 20nt (loop 2). Mutations impairing formation of stem 1 or stem 2 of the pseudoknot reduce frameshift efficiency, whereas compensatory changes that allow re-formation of these stems restore the frameshift efficiency to near wild-type level. The difference between the frameshift stimulatory signal of group O and group M supports the hypothesis that these groups originate from a different monkey to human transmission.","publish_time":"2003-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baril, Martin; Dulude, Dominic; Steinberg, Sergey V; Brakier-Gingras, L\u00E9a","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/529ec3aea953247d8b078659de2981068bc182f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127721.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283603007848; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283603007848","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["frameshift efficiency","group O pseudoknot","frameshift stimulatory signal of group O","ribosomal frameshift","formation of stem","hairpin-type pseudoknot","extended bulged stem-loop","probing studies","Abstract Human immunodeficiency virus type","near wild-type level","stacked stems","abundant HIV","human transmission","combination of mutagenesis","silico analysis","Pol","slippery sequence","compensatory changes","viral messenger RNA","base-pairs","precursor","different monkey","Gag","single-stranded loops","re-formation","specific structure","groups","hypothesis","difference","shift site","enzymatic activities","Mutations"],"language":"en"},

Our study was undertaken to further understand hMPV-associated illness, compare clinical characteristics of hMPV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and establish the utility of routine screening for hMPV. We retrospectively identified hMPV-associated illnesses described among children with respiratory symptoms admitted to a tertiary care center in southeast Michigan during the 2006\u20132007 respiratory viral season. A convenience sample of 256 nasopharyngeal specimens was subjected to nucleic acid extraction and amplification to identify those specimens positive for hMPV. A medical record review was undertaken to retrieve demographic and clinical data of patients with hMPV, comparing them to RSV-positive patients and patients evaluated for respiratory symptoms who were negative for hMPV and RSV. We found that hMPV was the second most commonly identified virus after RSV. hMPV-positive patients were older than RSV-positive patients. Among hMPV-positive patients, pneumonia was diagnosed in 37.5% and bronchiolitis in 31.2%, peribronchial cuffing was present on chest radiographs of 37.5%, antibiotic treatment was used in 81.2%, and admission to the ICU was seen in 37.5%. Finally, hMPV-positive patients were more likely to have fever than RSV-positive patients or patients negative for hMPV and RSV. We concluded that hMPV is a major pathogen associated with hospitalization of children and with the same severity of illness as RSV but in a slightly older population. Because of the apparent prevalence and severity of illness, routine screening should be implemented.","publish_time":"2010-08-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Akhras, Nour; Weinberg, Jason B.; Newton, Duane","journal":"Infect Dis Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3d3ee0b012a09d8de42c13d046f42ebd291e76e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3892583.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24470892/; https://doi.org/10.4081/idr.2010.e12","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hMPV-positive patients","RSV-positive patients","hMPV-associated illnesses","clinical characteristics of hMPV","respiratory illness","specimens positive","clinical data of patients","respiratory symptoms","respiratory syncytial virus","severity of illness","hospitalization of children","identified virus","respiratory viral season","discovered virus","utility of routine screening","nasopharyngeal specimens","older population","tertiary care center","chest radiographs","peribronchial cuffing","nucleic acid extraction","amplification","demographic","fever","southeast Michigan","major pathogen","apparent prevalence","convenience sample","medical record review","pneumonia","antibiotic treatment","bronchiolitis","Human metapneumovirus","admission","ICU","study"],"language":"en"},

Clinical manifestations are diverse and range from mild arthritis to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). DAH is a rare and devastating complication of SLE that carries a mortality rate of up to 50%, despite aggressive therapy. CASE REPORT: A 21-year-old primigravida at 16 weeks gestation presents with a productive cough, rash, sore throat, and high-grade fever. Chest x-ray suggested multifocal pneumonia. Patient deteriorated despite antibiotics and intravenous (IV) fluids. She developed worsening anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Autoimmune work-up was positive for Coombs, antinuclear antibody, anti-smith antibody, and hypocomplementemia. Skin biopsy was consistent with SLE. SLE vasculitis was suspected. She required mechanical intubation for rapid respiratory deterioration, with CT thorax suggesting ARDS. Bronchoscopy was done and confirmed DAH. Her course was further complicated with retinopathy and acute pancreatitis associated with SLE. She was treated with IV steroids, IV cyclophosphamide, and plasmapheresis, with significant clinical improvement and successful extubation. She delivered a healthy baby at 32 weeks gestation. CONCLUSIONS: Early recognition and initiation of treatment is critical to survival in DAH and requires a high index of clinical suspicion. Treatment includes high-dose steroids, cyclophosphamide, and plasma exchange. Pregnancy increases the risk of adverse outcome in SLE. Seven cases of DAH in pregnant patients with SLE have been reported. Here, we report a catastrophic presentation of DAH, acute pancreatitis, and retinopathy in a pregnant patient with newly diagnosed SLE.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yousif, Patrick A.; Moshrefi, Hameadreza; Meysami, Alireza; Alkhatib, Ayad H.","journal":"Am J Case Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c09b22405179712017331fe8edd5da9f4c8761c8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7176590.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.921299; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32284523/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["IV"],"organizations":["DAH","SLE","ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosed SLE","SLE vasculitis","cases of DAH","confirmed DAH","devastating complication of SLE","catastrophic presentation of DAH","Clinical Procedure","Clinical manifestations","rash","autoimmune disease","significant clinical improvement","retinopathy","high index of clinical suspicion","acute pancreatitis","cyclophosphamide","weeks gestation","Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage Symptoms","Rare disease Background","sore throat Medication","high-dose steroids","productive cough","antinuclear antibody","year-old primigravida","initiation of treatment","high-grade fever","pregnant patients","Autoimmune work","CASE REPORT","year-old Final Diagnosis","anti-smith antibody","Rheumatology OBJECTIVE","dyspnea","Systemic lupus erythematosus","rapid respiratory deterioration","Coombs","range","mild arthritis","Specialty","autoantibody production","multiple organs","CT thorax","plasmapheresis","survival","Early recognition","young women","inflammation","mechanical intubation","successful extubation","risk of adverse outcome","Female","plasma exchange","Chest x-ray","multifocal pneumonia","worsening anemia","leukopenia","thrombocytopenia","child","Pregnancy","CONCLUSIONS","ARDS","hypocomplementemia","antibiotics","healthy baby","Skin biopsy","mortality rate","fluids","years","Bronchoscopy","aggressive therapy","course"],"language":"en"},

In skeletal muscle, recent studies have demonstrated that eIF3f plays a central role in skeletal muscle size maintenance. Accordingly, eIF3f overexpression results in hypertrophy through modulation of protein synthesis via the mTORC1 pathway. Importantly, eIF3f was described as a target of the E3 ubiquitin ligase MAFbx/atrogin-1 for proteasome-mediated breakdown under atrophic conditions. The biological importance of the MAFbx/atrogin-1-dependent targeting of eFI3f is highlighted by the finding that expression of an eIF3f mutant insensitive to MAFbx/atrogin-1 polyubiquitination is associated with enhanced protection against starvation-induced muscle atrophy. A better understanding of the precise role of this subunit should lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches to prevent or limit muscle wasting that prevails in numerous physiological and pathological states such as immobilization, aging, denervated conditions, neuromuscular diseases, AIDS, cancer, diabetes.

Thus, there is an unmet clinical need for a non-invasive and reliable test to differentiate between malignant and benign breast lesions in order to avoid subjecting patients with abnormal mammograms to unnecessary follow-up diagnostic procedures. Serum samples from 116 malignant breast lesions and 64 benign breast lesions were comprehensively profiled for 2,083 microRNAs (miRNAs) using next-generation sequencing. Of the 180 samples profiled, three outliers were removed based on the principal component analysis (PCA), and the remaining samples were divided into training (n = 125) and test (n = 52) sets at a 70:30 ratio for further analysis. In the training set, significantly differentially expressed miRNAs (adjusted p \u003C 0.01) were identified after correcting for multiple testing using a false discovery rate. Subsequently, a predictive classification model using an eight-miRNA signature and a Bayesian logistic regression algorithm was developed. Based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis in the test set, the model could achieve an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9542. Together, this study demonstrates the potential use of circulating miRNAs as an adjunct test to stratify breast lesions in patients with abnormal screening mammograms.","publish_time":"2019-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Loke, Sau Yeen; Munusamy, Prabhakaran; Koh, Geok Ling; Chan, Claire Hian Tzer; Madhukumar, Preetha; Thung, Jee Liang; Tan, Kiat Tee Benita; Ong, Kong Wee; Yong, Wei Sean; Sim, Yirong; Oey, Chung Lie; Lim, Sue Zann; Chan, Mun Yew Patrick; Ho, Teng Swan Juliana; Khoo, Boon Kheng James; Wong, Su Lin Jill; Thng, Choon Hua; Chong, Bee Kiang; Tan, Ern Yu; Tan, Veronique Kiak-Mien; Lee, Ann Siew Gek","journal":"Cancers (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2883a8e6fafe65f0dc49b8e2aa1b1f4640f1a8d7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6966622.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers11121872; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31769433/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["malignant breast lesions","benign breast lesions","test set","breast cancer screening","abnormal mammograms","adjunct test","reliable test","curve analysis","abnormal screening mammograms","positive mammograms","Serum samples","remaining samples","training set","principal component analysis","subjecting patients","potential use of circulating miRNAs","high rates of false","false discovery rate","predictive classification model","order","miRNA signature","unnecessary follow-up diagnostic procedures","PCA","gold standard","Bayesian logistic regression algorithm","unmet clinical need","multiple testing","characteristic","study","receiver","area","mammography","concern","AUC","generation sequencing","adjusted p","outliers","microRNAs"],"language":"en"},

Five-week-old conventional pigs were inoculated intratracheally with the Lelystad strain of PRRSV and received 5 days later one or two intratracheal LPS administrations. The necessary controls were included. After LPS administration, pigs were intensively monitored for clinical signs. Additionally, some pigs were euthanatized after a second LPS administration for broncho-alveolar cell analysis and virological examinations of the lungs. Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) cells were counted and differentiated. Lung suspensions and BAL fluids were titrated for PRRSV. Exposure of pigs to PRRSV only resulted in a fever for time periods ranging from 1 to 5 days and slight respiratory signs. Exposure of pigs to LPS only resulted in general signs, characterized by fever and depression, but respiratory signs were slight or absent. PRRSV\u2013LPS exposed pigs, on the other hand, developed severe respiratory signs upon LPS exposure, characterized by tachypnoea, abdominal breathing and dyspnoea. Besides respiratory signs, these pigs also showed enhanced general signs, such as fever and depression. Lung neutrophil infiltration was similar in non-infected and PRRSV-infected pigs upon LPS exposure.

We also conducted a series of measurements to validate the simulations. The ventilation rates (dilution level) for infection and non-infection were determined based on these scenarios. The safe ventilation rate for eliminating airborne viral infection is to dilute the air emitted from a SARS patient by 10000 times with clean air. Dilution at lower volumes, specifically 1000 times, is insufficient for protecting non-infected people from SARS exposure and the risk of infection is very high.

In this study, we discovered a panel of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against MERS-CoV, which mapped to a wide range of regions on the spike (S) protein of the virus. In addition to mAbs with neutralizing epitopes located on the receptor-binding domain, one mAb, 5F9, which binds to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the MERS-CoV S1 subunit, showed efficient neutralizing activity against the wild-type MERS-CoV strain EMC/2012, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 0.2 \u03BCg/mL. We concluded that a novel neutralizing epitope for MERS-CoV also resides on the NTD of the S protein, indicating that the NTD might be important during the viral infection process.

Currently, air toxicity is monitored only for single or limited number of known toxicants, thus failing to fully warn against possible hazardous air. Here, using a photoionization detector (PID) or GC-MS/FID we found that within minutes living rats emitted distinctive profiles of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) via breath when exposed to various airborne toxicants such as endotoxin, O3, ricin, and CO2. Compared to background indoor air, when exposed to ricin or endotoxin aerosols breath-borne VOC levels, especially that of carbon disulfide, were shown to decrease, while elevated levels were observed for O3 and CO2 exposures. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a clear contrast in breath-borne VOCs profiles of rats among different toxicant exposures. MicroRNA regulations such as miR-33, miR-146a and miR-155 from rats\u2019 blood samples also suggested varying mechanisms used by the rats in combating different air toxicant challenges. By integrating living rats, breath sampling, and VOC online detection, we pioneered a system that can real-time monitor air toxicity without the need of detecting specific species.

This continuously presents the host immune system with new challenges. On the other side of the trenches, an increasingly well\u2010adjusted host immune response, shaped by coevolutionary history, makes a pathogen\u0027s life a rather complicated endeavor. It is, therefore, no surprise that pathogens either escape detection or modulate the host immune response, often by redirecting normal cellular pathways to their advantage. For the purpose of this chapter, we focus mainly on the manipulation of the class I and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen presentation pathways and the ubiquitin (Ub)\u2010proteasome system by both viral and bacterial pathogens. First, we describe the general features of antigen presentation pathways and the Ub\u2010proteasome system and then address how they are manipulated by pathogens. We discuss the many human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)\u2010encoded immunomodulatory genes that interfere with antigen presentation (immunoevasins) and focus on the HCMV immunoevasins US2 and US11, which induce the degradation of class I MHC heavy chains by the proteasome by catalyzing their export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)\u2010membrane into the cytosol, a process termed ER dislocation. US2\u2010 and US11\u2010mediated subversion of ER dislocation ensures proteasomal degradation of class I MHC molecules and presumably allows HCMV to avoid recognition by cytotoxic T cells, whilst providing insight into general aspects of ER\u2010associated degradation (ERAD) which is used by eukaryotic cells to purge their ER of defective proteins. We discuss the similarities and differences between the distinct pathways co\u2010opted by US2 and US11 for dislocation and degradation of human class I MHC molecules and also a putatively distinct pathway utilized by the murine herpes virus (MHV)\u201068 mK3 immunoevasin for ER dislocation of murine class I MHC. We speculate on the implications of the three pathogen\u2010exploited dislocation pathways to cellular ER quality control. Moreover, we discuss the ubiquitin (Ub)\u2010proteasome system and its position at the core of antigen presentation as proteolysis and intracellular trafficking rely heavily on Ub\u2010dependent processes. We add a few examples of manipulation of the Ub\u2010proteasome system by pathogens in the context of the immune system and such diverse aspects of the host\u2013pathogen relationship as virus budding, bacterial chromosome integration, and programmed cell death, to name a few. Finally, we speculate on newly found pathogen\u2010encoded deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) and their putative roles in modulation of host\u2013pathogen interactions.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Loureiro, Joana; Ploegh, Hidde L.","journal":"Advances in Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/276cfd64618fb1aebf7050880805c550149b310f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112114.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065277606920069; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065277606920069","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsyNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCMV","MHC","ER"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["proteasome system","ER dislocation of murine class","host immune system","degradation of human class","exploited dislocation pathways","proteasomal degradation of class","general aspects of ER","mediated subversion of ER dislocation","distinct pathways","MHC molecules","general features of antigen presentation pathways","core of antigen presentation","US11","ER of defective proteins","well\u2010adjusted host immune response","modulation of host","bacterial pathogens","cellular ER quality control","normal cellular pathways","HCMV immunoevasins US2","associated degradation","pathogen relationship","pathogen interactions","MHC heavy chains","murine herpes virus","diverse aspects","eukaryotic cells","human cytomegalovirus","examples of manipulation","bacterial chromosome integration","cytotoxic T cells","high replication rates","major histocompatibility complex","viruses","insight","mK3 immunoevasin","small genomes","coevolutionary history","intracellular trafficking","pathogen\u0027s life","DUBs","MHV","membrane","putative roles","proteolysis","detection","cytosol","programmed cell death","position","context","immunomodulatory genes","endoplasmic reticulum","recognition","ERAD","export","new challenges","deubiquitinating enzymes","complicated endeavor","similarities","differences","advantage","trenches","dependent processes","mutations","surprise","implications","purpose","chapter"],"language":"en"},

Due to their high mutation rates, RNA viruses quickly evade selective pressures and can adapt to a new host. Therefore, new antiviral approaches are urgently needed, which target more than one specific virus variant and which would optimally prevent development of viral resistance. Among the family of coronaviruses (CoV), several human pathogenic strains (HCoV) are known to cause respiratory diseases and are implied in enteric diseases. While most strains contribute to common cold-like illnesses, others lead to severe infections. One of these viruses is the newly emerged (2012), highly pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) of zoonotic origin. MERS-CoV causes a severe respiratory infection with a high mortality rate of 35 %. There is no specific treatment or infection prevention available. Here, we show that the bacterial ribonuclease Binase is able to inhibit the replication of MERS-CoV and of the low-pathogenic human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) in cell culture. We demonstrate that at non-toxic concentrations, Binase decreased the titers of MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E. On a molecular level, Binase treatment reduced (i) the viral subgenomic RNAs and (ii) the viral nucleocapsidprotein (N) and non-structural protein 13 (nsp13) accumulation. Furthermore, we show that the quantity of the replication/transcription complexes within the infected cells is diminished. Thus, the data obtained might allow further development of new anti-coronaviral approaches affecting viral replication, independent of the specific virus strain.","publish_time":"2016-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"M\u00FCller, Christin; Ulyanova, Vera; Ilinskaya, Olga; Pleschka, Stephan; Shah Mahmud, Raihan","journal":"Bionanoscience","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd6a89895aea06a692a54a1801a13e6583e956b4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7090624.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32219056/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12668-016-0341-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsyNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV","replication of MERS","viral replication","HCoV","respiratory diseases","titers of MERS","viral nucleocapsidprotein","Binase treatment","specific treatment","RNA viruses","severe respiratory infection","human pathogenic strains","development of viral resistance","low-pathogenic human coronavirus","viral subgenomic RNAs","new antiviral approaches","specific virus strain","specific virus variant","new host","enteric diseases","pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","development of new anti-coronaviral approaches","bacterial ribonuclease Binase","dangerous communicable diseases","severe infections","high mutation rates","high mortality rate","infection prevention available","non-structural protein","transcription complexes","illnesses","selective pressures","infected cells","nsp13","accumulation","non-toxic concentrations","quantity","molecular level","zoonotic origin","cell culture","family of coronaviruses","data"],"language":"en"},

We generated and characterized an N-reactive monoclonal antibody (mAb) 3E9 from mice immunized with recombinant N protein.

APN expression is dysregulated in inflammatory diseases as well as in several types of cancer. Therefore, inhibitors of APN may be effective against cancer and inflammation. By virtual screening and enzymatic assays, we identified three non-competitive inhibitors (\u03B1 \u003E 1) of the porcine and human APN with Ki values in the \u03BCM range. These non-peptidic compounds lack the classical zinc-binding groups (ZBG) present in most of the APN inhibitors. Molecular docking simulations suggested the novel inhibitors suppress APN activity by an alternative mechanism to Zn coordination: they interacted with residues comprising the S1 and S5\u2032 subsites of APN. Of note, these compounds also inhibited the porcine aminopeptidase A (pAPA) using a competitive inhibition mode. This indicated differences in the binding mode of these compounds with APN and APA. Based on sequence and structural analyses, we predicted the significance of targeting human APN residues: Ala-351, Arg-442, Ala-474, Phe-896 and Asn-900 for improving the selectivity of the identified compounds. Remarkably, the intraperitoneal injection of compounds BTB07018 and JFD00064 inhibited APN activity in rat brain, liver and kidney indicating good bio-distribution of these inhibitors in vivo.

Previously, a DNA vaccine encoding a 15 kDa sandfly (Phlebotomus papatasi) salivary protein (PpSP15) and recombinant nonpathogenic Leishmania tarentolae secreting PpSP15 have been shown to induce protective immunity against Leishmania major in mice, demonstrating that PpSP15 is a promising vaccine candidate. In this study, we developed a fermentation process in yeast with a yield of ~1g PpSP15/L and a scalable purification process consisting of only 2 chromatographic purification steps with high binding capacity for PpSP15, suggesting that PpSP15 can be produced economically. The biophysical/biochemical analysis of the purified PpSP15 indicated that the protein was of high purity (\u003E97%) and conformationally stable between pH 4.4 and 9.0. More importantly, the recombinant protein had a defined structure similar to that of the related PdSP15 from Phlebotomus duboscqi, implying the suitability of the yeast expression system for producing a correctly folded PpSP15.","publish_time":"2020-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Wen-Hsiang; Nyon, Mun Peak; Poongavanam, Mohan V.; Liu, Zhuyun; Biter, Amadeo B.; Kundu, Rakhi T.; Strych, Ulrich; Hotez, Peter J.; Bottazzi, Maria Elena","journal":"J Pharm Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c10988e4f107c4fa8bc2ea3dae8df800de06ce9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125844.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32070701/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022354920300770; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022354920300770; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xphs.2020.02.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["purified PpSP15","folded PpSP15","recombinant nonpathogenic Leishmania tarentolae secreting PpSP15","recombinant protein","Leishmania major","salivary protein","parasite Leishmania","DNA vaccine","available licensed vaccine","scalable purification process","promising vaccine candidate","Phlebotomus papatasi","Phlebotomus duboscqi","fermentation process","high purity","neglected tropical disease","chromatographic purification steps","high binding capacity","major health problem","yeast expression system","kDa sandfly","subtropical countries","need","suitability","defined structure similar","yield","mice","limited drug treatments","Abstract Cutaneous leishmaniasis","regions of conflict","related PdSP15","protective immunity","biochemical analysis","therapeutic interventions","political instability","conformationally stable","study","sandflies"],"language":"en"},

In particular, the number of CD4(\u002B) lymphocytes in tissues decreases during the evolution of FIP lesions. This decrease is most likely due to increased lymphocyte apoptotic rate. In contrast, cats infected with the Feline Coronavirus (FCoV) develop a follicular hyperplasia in the peripheral lymph nodes. The current study was devised to evaluate the possible pathogenic role of shifts in circulating lymphocyte subsets in FIP. Peripheral blood from cats with FIP was evaluated and compared with peripheral blood from clinically healthy cats living in both FCoV-free and FCoV-endemic catteries. Blood from cats with diseases other than FIP was also examined in order to define the diagnostic relevance of the changes. Lymphocyte subsets were analysed by flow cytometry, using a whole blood indirect immunofluorescence technique and mAbs specific for feline CD5, CD4, CD8, CD21. The results of the current study suggest that cats recently infected with FCoV that do not develop the disease have a transient increase in T cells; cats from groups with high prevalence of FIP have a moderate but persistent decrease in T cell subsets; cats with FIP have a very severe decrease in all the subsets of lymphocytes. Moreover, during FIP many lymphocytes do not express any membrane antigen, most likely due to early apoptosis. Cats with diseases other than FIP also had decreased number of lymphocytes: as a consequence, the diagnostic relevance of these findings is very low. Nevertheless, the lack of flow cytometric changes had a high negative predictive value (NPV), thus allowing to exclude FIP from the list of possible diagnoses in cats with normal cytograms.","publish_time":"2003-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paltrinieri, Saverio; Ponti, Wilma; Comazzi, Stefano; Giordano, Alessia; Poli, Giorgio","journal":"Vet Immunol Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/683429912186a7b0c1f2e61bbd5f3897232ec22a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119655.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242703001569; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242703001569","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Feline Coronavirus","FIP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["healthy cats","high prevalence of FIP","evolution of FIP lesions","subsets of lymphocytes","Peripheral blood","circulating lymphocyte subsets","FCoV-free","T cell subsets","peripheral lymph nodes","decreased number of lymphocytes","feline CD5","Feline Coronavirus","persistent decrease","number of CD4","severe decrease","FCoV-endemic catteries","diagnostic relevance","diseases","current study","blood indirect immunofluorescence technique","feline infectious peritonitis","T cells","flow cytometry","lack of flow cytometric changes","increased lymphocyte apoptotic rate","list of possible diagnoses","high negative predictive value","possible pathogenic role of shifts","mAbs specific","groups","lymphoid depletion evident","follicular hyperplasia","spleen","lymphopenic","transient increase","NPV","CD8","normal cytograms","consequence","tissues","membrane antigen","CD21","findings","order","early apoptosis","results","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Its etiology is multifactorial, arising from predisposing environmental stress conditions as well as the action of several different respiratory pathogens. This situation has hindered the development of effective control strategies. Although different type of vaccines are available, many currently marketed vaccines are based on inactivated cultures of the main viral and bacterial agents involved in this pathology. The molecular composition of commercial veterinary vaccines is a critical issue. The present work aims to define at the proteomic level the most relevant valence of a line of commercial respiratory vaccines widely used in Central and South America. Since Mannheimia haemolytica is responsible for most of the disease associated morbid-mortality, we focused on the main proteins secreted by this pathogen, in particular Leukotoxin A, its main virulence factor. By Western blot analysis and mass spectrometry, Leukotoxin A was identified as a major component of M. haemolytica culture supernatants. We also identified other ten M. haemolytica proteins, including outer membrane proteins, periplasmic transmembrane solute transporters and iron binding proteins, which are relevant to achieve protective immunity against the pathogen. This work allowed a detailed molecular characterization of this vaccine component, providing evidence of its quality and efficacy. Furthermore, our results contributed to the identification of several proteins of interest as subunit vaccine candidates.","publish_time":"2016-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tucci, Paula; Estevez, Ver\u00F3nica; Becco, Lorena; Cabrera-Cabrera, Florencia; Grotiuz, Germ\u00E1n; Reolon, Eduardo; Mar\u00EDn, M\u00F3nica","journal":"Heliyon","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64f48f817331fc485485f543207eee3d76f1b022.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0a003aa69f43cee4357f1e943df79a8b87c0a88e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5035357.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405844016310933; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844016310933","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs0MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South America"],"keyphrases":["main proteins","haemolytica proteins","marketed vaccines","line of commercial respiratory vaccines","outer membrane proteins","iron binding proteins","different type of vaccines","Bovine Respiratory Disease","molecular composition of commercial veterinary vaccines","costly disease","vaccine component","different respiratory pathogens","Mannheimia haemolytica","main virulence factor","haemolytica culture supernatants","relevant valence","major component","particular Leukotoxin","present work","detailed molecular characterization","subunit vaccine candidates","periplasmic transmembrane solute transporters","inactivated cultures","mass spectrometry","beef","action","Western blot analysis","predisposing environmental stress conditions","bacterial agents","dairy cattle industry","evidence","critical issue","development of effective control strategies","proteomic level","quality","protective immunity","South America","morbid-mortality","efficacy","situation","etiology","pathology","identification","results"],"language":"en"},

An oligonucleotide microarray system was developed in this study. The wild type and vaccine strains of canine distemper virus (CDV), influenza virus, canine herpesvirus (CHV), Bordetella bronchiseptica and Mycoplasma cynos were detected and differentiated simultaneously on a microarray chip. The detection limit is 10, 10, 100, 50 and 50 copy numbers for CDV, influenza virus, CHV, B. bronchiseptica and M. cynos, respectively. The clinical test results of nasal swab samples showed that the microarray had remarkably better efficacy than the multiplex PCR-agarose gel method. The positive detection rate of microarray and agarose gel was 59.0% (n=33) and 41.1% (n=23) among the 56 samples, respectively. CDV vaccine strain and pathogen co-infections were further demonstrated by the microarray but not by the multiplex PCR-agarose gel.

The Chinese Government has carried out a series of emergency preparedness education and training programmes to improve the emergency preparedness capability of rural public health personnel nationwide. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and develop a participatory emergency preparedness training programme for rural public health personnel. Study design The research emphasizes the major components of instructional design, including assessing, designing, delivering and evaluating training. The approach is an integrated system with results from one phase influencing the next, so that a series of steps are followed when developing, implementing and evaluating emergency preparedness training. Methods The 226 participants were rural public health personnel from 84 different rural centres for disease control and prevention in China. The programme was evaluated by anonymous questionnaires and semi-structured interviews held prior to training, immediately post-training and 12-months after training (follow-up). Results The emergency preparedness training resulted in positive shifts in knowledge and skills for rural public health personnel. At follow-up, the knowledge and skill scores of participants declined slightly compared with the post-test levels (P \u003E0.05). However, there was a significant increase compared with the pre-test levels (P \u003C0.01). Moreover, more than 90% of participants reported that this training provided a valuable learning experience and reinforced the importance of emergency preparedness. Conclusions The emergency preparedness training programme was effective and feasible in improving the performance of rural public health personnel on emergency response. Further studies are needed to test the efficacy of the training approach for competency improvement.","publish_time":"2010-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, C.; Xiang, H.; Xu, Y.; Hu, D.; Zhang, W.; Lu, J.; Sun, L.; Nie, S.","journal":"Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e74b1ca47c70a922c934811c06bebb0afaaccd7c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111611.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350610000594; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20378134/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2010.02.020; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350610000594","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["emergency preparedness capability of rural public health personnel","training approach","participatory emergency preparedness training programme","importance of emergency preparedness","training programmes","post-training","performance of rural public health personnel","public health emergencies","series of emergency preparedness education","emergency response","different rural centres","knowledge","follow-up","results","study","skill scores of participants","pre-test levels","post-test levels","series of steps","major components of instructional design","avian influenza","outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome","skills","positive shifts","disease control","semi-structured interviews","anonymous questionnaires","prevention","infrastructure","new priority","valuable learning experience","research","integrated system","efficacy","months","Conclusions","Summary Objectives","competency improvement","China","significant increase","phase","assessing","Methods","Chinese Government","studies","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Methods: A retrospective study examined medical records from a 10\u2010year period and identified 11 alpacas with confirmed diaphragmatic paralysis admitted to Washington State University and Colorado State University Veterinary Teaching Hospitals between September 2003 and October 2009. Results: The 11 alpacas ranged in age from 2 to 12 months. Fluoroscopic imaging confirmed the presence of bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis in the 7 alpacas that were imaged. Arterial blood gas analyses showed hypercapnea, hypoxemia, and low oxygen saturation. Seven alpacas died or were euthanized between 2 and 60 days after onset of respiratory signs. Histopathologic examination of tissues found phrenic nerve degeneration in the 6 alpacas that were necropsied and additional long nerves examined demonstrated degeneration in 2 of these animals. Two animals had spinal cord lesions and 2 had diaphragm muscle abnormalities. No etiologic agent was identified in the alpacas.

However, the distribution of phenotypic effects caused by genome-wide random homologous recombination has never been formally investigated. Previous data on the subject have promoted the implicit view that most viral recombinant genomes are likely to be deleterious or lethal if the nucleotide identity of parental sequences is below 90%. We decided to challenge this view by creating a bank of near-random recombinants between two viral species of the genus Begomovirus (Family Geminiviridae) exhibiting 82% nucleotide identity, and by testing infectivity and in planta accumulation of recombinant clones randomly extracted from this bank. The bank was created by DNA-shuffling\u2014a technology initially applied to the random shuffling of individual genes, and here implemented for the first time to shuffle full-length viral genomes. Together with our previously described system allowing the direct cloning of full-length infectious geminivirus genomes, it provided a unique opportunity to generate hundreds of \u201Cmosaic\u201D virus genomes, directly testable for infectivity. A subset of 47 randomly chosen recombinants was sequenced, individually inoculated into tomato plants, and compared with the parental viruses. Surprisingly, our results showed that all recombinants were infectious and accumulated at levels comparable or intermediate to that of the parental clones. This indicates that, in our experimental system, despite the fact that the parental genomes differ by nearly 20%, lethal and/or large deleterious effects of recombination are very rare, in striking contrast to the common view that has emerged from previous studies published on other viruses.","publish_time":"2011-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vuillaume, Florence; Th\u00E9baud, Ga\u00EBl; Urbino, Cica; Forfert, Nad\u00E8ge; Granier, Martine; Froissart, R\u00E9my; Blanc, St\u00E9phane; Peterschmitt, Michel","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/822233763421a1e054abbc49c00a8726cb3ebfe1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3088723.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21573141/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002028","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Recombination"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["parental genomes","viral recombinant genomes","full-length viral genomes","random recombinants","parental clones","parental viruses","nucleotide identity of parental sequences","direct cloning of full-length infectious geminivirus genomes","viral species","large deleterious effects of recombination","implicit view","common view","bank of near","genome-wide random homologous recombination","random shuffling of individual genes","virus evolution","testing infectivity","planta accumulation of recombinant clones","DNA-shuffling","described system","previous studies","experimental system","Previous data","distribution of phenotypic effects","emergence of new pathotypes","Family Geminiviridae","genus Begomovirus","evident impact","hundreds","mosaic","striking contrast","unique opportunity","subject","technology","fact","levels comparable","time","results","immense literature","tomato plants","subset"],"language":"en"},

Because of high mutation and recombination rates, genome replication by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases leads to populations of closely related viruses, so-called \u2018quasispecies\u2019. Standard (short-read) sequencing technologies are ill-suited to reconstruct large numbers of full-length haplotypes of (i) RNA virus genomes and (ii) subgenome-length (sg) RNAs comprised of noncontiguous genome regions. Here, we used a full-length, direct RNA sequencing (DRS) approach based on nanopores to characterize viral RNAs produced in cells infected with a human coronavirus. Using DRS, we were able to map the longest (\u223C26 kb) contiguous read to the viral reference genome. By combining Illumina and nanopore sequencing, we reconstructed a highly accurate consensus sequence of the human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E genome (27.3 kb). Furthermore, using long reads that did not require an assembly step, we were able to identify, in infected cells, diverse and novel HCoV-229E sg RNAs that remain to be characterized. Also, the DRS approach, which circumvents reverse transcription and amplification of RNA, allowed us to detect methylation sites in viral RNAs. Our work paves the way for haplotype-based analyses of viral quasispecies by demonstrating the feasibility of intra-sample haplotype separation. Even though several technical challenges remain to be addressed to exploit the potential of the nanopore technology fully, our work illustrates that direct RNA sequencing may significantly advance genomic studies of complex virus populations, including predictions on long-range interactions in individual full-length viral RNA haplotypes.","publish_time":"2019-08-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Viehweger, Adrian; Krautwurst, Sebastian; Lamkiewicz, Kevin; Madhugiri, Ramakanth; Ziebuhr, John; H\u00F6lzer, Martin; Marz, Manja","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36e602b7081e7bb8a1cfeaa2fb92b0c43abd4fef.json; document_parses/pdf_json/daf8cc4808449d252b72d48113f1149a55f92ba3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/483693","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsxMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Standard","Illumina"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral RNAs","viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases","direct RNA sequencing","amplification of RNA","individual full-length viral RNA haplotypes","viral reference genome","Sequence analyses of RNA virus genomes","nanopore sequencing","haplotype-based analyses of viral quasispecies","E sg RNAs","genome replication","sequencing technologies","DRS approach","noncontiguous genome regions","human coronavirus","infected cells","work","large numbers of full-length haplotypes","genomic studies of complex virus populations","novel HCoV","related viruses","contiguous read","nanopore technology","accurate consensus sequence","feasibility of intra-sample haplotype separation","long-range interactions","predictions","recombination rates","reverse transcription","high mutation","exceptional genetic plasticity","way","subgenome-length","nanopores","methylation sites","assembly step","potential","Standard","Illumina","long reads","technical challenges"],"language":"en"},

This study was aimed to compare the strength of associations between different cognitive and affective measures of risk and self-reported protective behaviors in a series of ten cross-sectional surveys conducted throughout the first wave of influenza A/H1N1 pandemic. METHODS: All surveys were conducted using questionnaire-based telephone interviews, with random digit dialing to recruit adults from the general population. Measures of anxiety and worry (affective) and perceived risk (cognitive) regarding A/H1N1 were made in 10 serial surveys. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the cognitive/affective-behavioral associations in each survey while multilevel logistic models were conducted to estimate the average effects of each cognitive/affective measure on adoption of protective behaviors throughout the ten surveys. RESULTS: Excepting state anxiety, other affective measures including \u201Canticipated worry\u201D, \u201Cexperienced worry\u201D and \u201Ccurrent worry\u201D specific to A/H1N1 risk were consistently and strongly associated with adoption of protective behaviors across different survey periods. However, the cognitive-behavioral associations were weaker and inconsistent across the ten surveys. Perceived A/H1N1 severity relative to SARS had stronger associations with adoption of protective behaviors in the late epidemic periods than in the early epidemic periods. CONCLUSION: Risk-specific worries appear to be significantly associated with the adoption of protective behaviors at different epidemic stages, whereas cognitive measures may become more important in understanding people\u2019s behavioral responses later in epidemics. Future epidemic-related psycho-behavioral research should include more affective-loaded measures of risk.","publish_time":"2014-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liao, Qiuyan; Cowling, Benjamin J; Lam, Wendy WT; Ng, Diane MW; Fielding, Richard","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/90706dd8b172f0aeb996ea828c356155c32e0682.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3986671.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-14-169; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24674239/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsxMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cognitive measures","affective-behavioral associations","affective measures of risk","cognitive-behavioral associations","adoption of protective behaviors","H1N1 risk","affective-loaded measures of risk","Measures of anxiety","perceived risk","stronger associations","self-reported protective behaviors","different epidemic stages","strength of associations","behavioral indices","late epidemic periods","early epidemic periods","major epidemic","cross-sectional surveys","serial surveys","different survey periods","Risk-specific worries","experienced worry","anticipated worry","current worry","H1N1 pandemic","Future epidemic-related psycho-behavioral research","understanding people\u2019s behavioral responses","H1N1 severity relative","multilevel logistic models","Multivariate logistic regression models","Excepting state anxiety","SARS","series","random digit","questionnaire-based telephone interviews","adults","epidemics","wave of influenza","average effects","RESULTS","studies","CONCLUSION","general population","BACKGROUND","study","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Here, we present an alternative strategy for creating virus-resistant cells and animals by ectopic expression of a nucleic acid hydrolyzing catalytic 3D8 single chain variable fragment (scFv), which has both DNase and RNase activities. HeLa cells (SCH7072) expressing 3D8 scFv acquired significant resistance to DNA viruses. Virus challenging with Herpes simplex virus (HSV) in 3D8 scFv transgenic cells and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay based on direct DNA cleavage analysis revealed that the induced resistance in HeLa cells was acquired by the nucleic acid hydrolyzing catalytic activity of 3D8 scFv. In addition, pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection in WT C57BL/6 mice was lethal, whereas transgenic mice (STG90) that expressed high levels of 3D8 scFv mRNA in liver, muscle, and brain showed a 56% survival rate 5 days after PRV intramuscular infection. The antiviral effects against DNA viruses conferred by 3D8 scFv expression in HeLa cells as well as an in vivo mouse system can be attributed to the nuclease activity that inhibits viral genome DNA replication in the nucleus and/or viral mRNA translation in the cytoplasm.

The present review aimed to summarize the evidence for the association between fruit and vegetable intake, risk of asthma/wheeze and immune responses. Databases including PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL and EMBASE were searched up to June 2016. Studies that investigated the effects of fruit and vegetable intake on risk of asthma/wheeze and immune responses were considered eligible (n = 58). Studies used cross-sectional (n = 30), cohort (n = 13), case-control (n = 8) and experimental (n = 7) designs. Most of the studies (n = 30) reported beneficial associations of fruit and vegetable consumption with risk of asthma and/or respiratory function, while eight studies found no significant relationship. Some studies (n = 20) reported mixed results, as they found a negative association between fruit only or vegetable only, and asthma. In addition, the meta-analyses in both adults and children showed inverse associations between fruit intake and risk of prevalent wheeze and asthma severity (p \u003C 0.05). Likewise, vegetable intake was negatively associated with risk of prevalent asthma (p \u003C 0.05). Seven studies examined immune responses in relation to fruit and vegetable intake in asthma, with n = 6 showing a protective effect against either systemic or airway inflammation. Fruit and vegetable consumption appears to be protective against asthma.","publish_time":"2017-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hosseini, Banafshe; Berthon, Bronwyn S.; Wark, Peter; Wood, Lisa G.","journal":"Nutrients","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9dd7a29452ebf3285c47109ce0c72e2099347622.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5409680.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu9040341; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28353635/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsxODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fruit intake","risk of asthma","vegetable intake","Studies","risk of prevalent asthma","reduced intake of fruit","asthma severity","development of asthma","effects of fruit","vegetable consumption","beneficial associations of fruit","risk of prevalent wheeze","immune responses","Evidence","inverse associations","protective effect","negative association","children","adults","vegetables","critical role","PubMed","Cochrane","CINAHL","meta-analyses","airway inflammation","respiratory function","Databases","EMBASE","mixed results","case-control","addition","present review","significant relationship","designs","allergies","cohort"],"language":"en"},

Due to limited genomic and transcriptomic data, the biosynthetic pathway of glycyrrhizin, the major bioactive compound in G. uralensis, is currently unclear. Identification of candidate genes involved in the glycyrrhizin biosynthetic pathway will significantly contribute to the understanding of the biosynthetic and medicinal chemistry of this compound. RESULTS: We used the 454 GS FLX platform and Titanium regents to produce a substantial expressed sequence tag (EST) dataset from the vegetative organs of G. uralensis. A total of 59,219 ESTs with an average read length of 409 bp were generated. 454 ESTs were combined with the 50,666 G. uralensis ESTs in GenBank. The combined ESTs were assembled into 27,229 unique sequences (11,694 contigs and 15,535 singletons). A total of 20,437 unique gene elements representing approximately 10,000 independent transcripts were annotated using BLAST searches (e-value \u2264 1e-5) against the SwissProt, KEGG, TAIR, Nr and Nt databases. The assembled sequences were annotated with gene names and Gene Ontology (GO) terms. With respect to the genes related to glycyrrhizin metabolism, genes encoding 16 enzymes of the 18 total steps of the glycyrrhizin skeleton synthesis pathway were found. To identify novel genes that encode cytochrome P450 enzymes and glycosyltransferases, which are related to glycyrrhizin metabolism, a total of 125 and 172 unigenes were found to be homologous to cytochrome P450s and glycosyltransferases, respectively. The cytochrome P450 candidate genes were classified into 32 CYP families, while the glycosyltransferase candidate genes were classified into 45 categories by GO analysis. Finally, 3 cytochrome P450 enzymes and 6 glycosyltransferases were selected as the candidates most likely to be involved in glycyrrhizin biosynthesis through an organ-specific expression pattern analysis based on real-time PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Using the 454 GS FLX platform and Titanium reagents, our study provides a high-quality EST database for G. uralensis. Based on the EST analysis, novel candidate genes related to the secondary metabolite pathway of glycyrrhizin, including novel genes encoding cytochrome P450s and glycosyltransferases, were found. With the assistance of organ-specific expression pattern analysis, 3 unigenes encoding cytochrome P450s and 6 unigenes encoding glycosyltransferases were selected as the candidates most likely to be involved in glycyrrhizin biosynthesis.","publish_time":"2010-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Ying; Luo, Hong-Mei; Sun, Chao; Song, Jing-Yuan; Sun, Yong-Zhen; Wu, Qiong; Wang, Ning; Yao, Hui; Steinmetz, Andr\u00E9; Chen, Shi-Lin","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9bbf07c4bf022a0695b79b87cb4299f6a8d18831.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2886062.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-11-268; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20423525/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsxOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Glycyrrhiza","G. uralensis"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel genes","cytochrome P450 candidate genes","novel candidate genes","biosynthetic pathway of glycyrrhizin","glycyrrhizin biosynthetic pathway","glycyrrhizin biosynthesis","glycyrrhizin metabolism","glycosyltransferases","cytochrome P450s","uralensis ESTs","glycosyltransferase candidate genes","Identification of candidate genes","cytochrome P450 enzymes","secondary metabolite pathway of glycyrrhizin","EST analysis","glycyrrhizin skeleton synthesis pathway","unigenes","Glycyrrhiza uralensis","combined ESTs","total steps","organ-specific expression pattern analysis","gene names","GS FLX platform","Gene Ontology","unique gene elements","unique sequences","assembled sequences","candidates","high-quality EST database","Titanium regents","Titanium reagents","assistance of organ","e-value","medicinal chemistry","major bioactive compound","popular medicinal plants","dataset","substantial expressed sequence tag","study","independent transcripts","transcriptomic data","TAIR","Nr","BLAST searches","CYP families","real-time PCR","KEGG","SwissProt","vegetative organs of","average","understanding","Nt databases","world","length","contigs","categories","flavoring of food","tobacco","bp","singletons","terms","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","GenBank","respect","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The present study demonstrated for the first time that a virus belonging to the Arteriviridae family activates NF-\u03BAB in MARC-145 cells and alveolar macrophages. In porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)-infected cells, NF-\u03BAB activation was characterized by translocation of NF-\u03BAB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, increased DNA binding activity, and NF-\u03BAB-regulated gene expression. NF-\u03BAB activation was increased as PRRSV infection progressed and in a viral dose-dependent manner. UV-inactivation of PRRSV significantly reduced the level of NF-\u03BAB activation. Degradation of I\u03BAB protein was detected late in PRRSV infection, and overexpression of the dominant negative form of I\u03BAB\u03B1 (I\u03BAB\u03B1DN) significantly suppressed NF-\u03BAB activation induced by PRRSV. However, I\u03BAB\u03B1DN did not affect viral replication and viral cytopathic effect. PRRSV infection induced oxidative stress in cells by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), and antioxidants inhibited NF-\u03BAB DNA binding activity in PRRSV-infected cells, suggesting ROS as a mechanism by which NF-\u03BAB was activated by PRRSV infection. Moreover, NF-\u03BAB-dependent expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 was observed in PRRSV-infected cells, an observation which implies that NF-\u03BAB activation is a biologically significant aspect of PRRSV pathogenesis. The results presented here provide a basis for understanding molecular pathways of pathology and immune evasion associated with disease caused by PRRSV.","publish_time":"2005-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Sang-Myeong; Kleiboeker, Steven B.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89e162115392f120533361ea7ed71657dfb6e05e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111765.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682205004526; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682205004526","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsxOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ROS"],"organizations":["PRRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["suppressed NF-\u03BAB activation","PRRSV infection","level of NF","translocation of NF","PRRSV-infected cells","NF-\u03BAB DNA binding activity","significant aspect of PRRSV pathogenesis","increased DNA binding activity","ROS","viral replication","I\u03BAB\u03B1DN","MMP","viral dose-dependent manner","viral cytopathic effect","immune evasion","dependent expression of matrix metalloproteinase","adaptive immune function","respiratory syndrome virus","regulated gene expression","nucleus","MARC","antioxidants","critical regulator of innate","dominant negative form of I\u03BAB\u03B1","molecular pathways of pathology","reactive oxygen species","oxidative stress","overexpression","cytoplasm","cell proliferation","observation","Abstract Nuclear factor-kappaB","Arteriviridae family","basis","disease","mechanism","time","alveolar macrophages","Degradation of I\u03BAB protein","UV-inactivation","present study","survival","results"],"language":"en"},

With the experience of improved and discharged COVID-19 patients, timely respiratory rehabilitation intervention may improve prognosis, maximize functional preservation and improve quality of life (QoL), but there lacks of studies worldwide exploring the outcome of this intervention. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of 6-week respiratory rehabilitation training on respiratory function, QoL, mobility and psychological function in elderly patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This paper reported the findings of an observational, prospective, quasi-experimental study, which totally recruited 72 participants, of which 36 patients underwent respiratory rehabilitation and the rest without any rehabilitation intervention. The following outcomes were measured: pulmonary function tests including plethysmography and diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), functional tests (6-min walk distance test), Quality of life (QoL) assessments (SF-36 scores), activities of daily living (Functional Independence Measure, FIM scores), and mental status tests (SAS anxiety and SDS depression scores). RESULTS: After 6 weeks of respiratory rehabilitation in the intervention group, there disclosed significant differences in FEV1(L), FVC(L), FEV1/FVC%, DLCO% and 6-min walk test. The SF-36 scores, in 8 dimensions, were statistically significant within the intervention group and between the two groups. SAS and SDS scores in the intervention group decreased after the intervention, but only anxiety had significant statistical significance within and between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Six-week respiratory rehabilitation can improve respiratory function, QoL and anxiety of elderly patients with COVID-19, but it has little significant improvement on depression in the elderly.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Kai; Zhang, Weitong; Yang, Yadong; Zhang, Jinpeng; Li, Yunqian; Chen, Ying","journal":"Complement Ther Clin Pract","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db1ab75e8050686b4647202de133b4d09c928b38.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f778c6317cdc3e2c4aa7a8c7734fa13da10723eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118596.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32379637/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctcp.2020.101166; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1744388120304278; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1744388120304278","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsyMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Functional Independence Measure","SDS","SAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory function","timely respiratory rehabilitation intervention","weeks of respiratory rehabilitation","intervention group","psychological function","anxiety of elderly patients","week respiratory rehabilitation training","physical function","QoL","pulmonary function tests","SDS scores","functional tests","FIM scores","SDS depression scores","SAS anxiety","discharged COVID","significant differences","significant improvement","functional preservation","quality of life","DLCO","significant statistical significance","FEV1","SF","FVC","groups","mental status tests","Functional Independence Measure","distance test","diffusing lung capacity","carbon monoxide","plethysmography","mobility","activities of daily living","prognosis","corona virus disease","assessments","rest","quasi-experimental study","findings","Different degrees of disorders","effects","experience of improved","following outcomes","paper","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","participants","RESULTS","dimensions","studies","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

The main concern with all replication-competent vaccines, including the rVSV filovirus GP vectors, is their safety. To address this concern, we performed a neurovirulence study using 21 cynomolgus macaques where the vaccines were administered intrathalamically. Seven animals received a rVSV vector expressing the Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) GP; seven animals received a rVSV vector expressing the Lake Victoria marburgvirus (MARV) GP; three animals received rVSV-wild type (wt) vector, and four animals received vehicle control. Two of three animals given rVSV-wt showed severe neurological symptoms whereas animals receiving vehicle control, rVSV-ZEBOV-GP, or rVSV-MARV-GP did not develop these symptoms. Histological analysis revealed major lesions in neural tissues of all three rVSV-wt animals; however, no significant lesions were observed in any animals from the filovirus vaccine or vehicle control groups.

Several in vitro and in vivo experimental models have been used to study TB pathogenesis and induction of immune response during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Precision cut lung tissue slices (PCLTS) is an experimental model, in which all the usual cell types of the organ are found, the tissue architecture and the interactions amongst the different cells are maintained. PCLTS in good physiological conditions, monitored by MTT assay and histology, were infected with either virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Rv or the TB vaccine strain Mycobacterium bovis BCG. Histological analysis showed that bacilli infecting lung tissue slices were observed in the alveolar septa, alveolar light spaces, near to type II pneumocytes, and inside macrophages.

The unavailability of specific vaccines and anti-viral drug for nCoV, science demands sincere efforts in the field of drug design and discovery for COVID-19. The novel coronavirus main protease (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro) play a crucial role during the disease propagation, and hence SARS-CoV-2 Mpro represents as a drug target for the drug discovery. Herein, we have applied bioinformatics approach for screening of chemical compounds from Indian spices as potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDBID: 6Y84). The structure files of Indian spices chemical compounds were taken from PubChem database or Zinc database and screened by molecular docking, by using AutoDock-4.2, MGLTools-1.5.6, Raccoon virtual screening tools. Top 04 hits based on their highest binding affinity were analyzed. Carnosol exhibited highest binding affinity -8.2 Kcal/mol and strong and stable interactions with the amino acid residues present on the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Arjunglucoside-I (-7.88 Kcal/mol) and Rosmanol (-7.99 Kcal/mol) also showed a strong and stable binding affinity with favourable ADME properties. These compounds on MD simulations for 50ns shows strong hydrogen-bonding interactions with the protein active site and remains stable inside the active site. Our virtual screening results suggest that these small chemical molecules can be used as potential inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and may have an anti-viral effect on nCoV. However, further validation and investigation of these inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 main protease are needed to claim their candidacy for clinical trials.","publish_time":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Umesh,; Kundu, Debanjan; Selvaraj, Chandrabose; Singh, Sanjeev Kumar; Dubey, Vikash Kumar","journal":"Journal of biomolecular structure \u0026 dynamics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362243/; https://doi.org/10.1080/07391102.2020.1763202","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsyODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rosmanol"],"organizations":["ADME"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","active site of SARS","Mpro","potent inhibitors of SARS","screening of chemical compounds","stable binding affinity","nCoV","drug discovery","Kcal","novel coronavirus main protease","anti-viral drug","highest binding affinity","stable interactions","drug target","coronavirus disease","protein active site","structure files of Indian spices chemical compounds","field of drug design","potential inhibitors","virtual screening results","COVID","strong hydrogen-bonding interactions","Raccoon virtual screening tools","small chemical molecules","anti-viral effect","PubChem database","Zinc database","disease propagation","amino acid residues present","science","favourable ADME properties","efforts","unavailability of specific vaccines","global health crisis","MD simulations","molecular docking","MGLTools","crucial role","bioinformatics approach","PDBID","Rosmanol","AutoDock","pandemic","candidacy","6Y84","investigation","hits","Carnosol","human population","clinical trials","validation","Arjunglucoside"],"language":"en"},

Although several vaccines against these viruses are commercially available there is room for improvement, especially in the case of PRRSV. The ability of arteriviruses to counteract the immune response is thought to decrease the efficacy of the current modified live virus vaccines. We have recently shown that the deubiquitinase (DUB) activity of EAV papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) is important for the inhibition of innate immune activation during infection. A vaccine virus lacking PLP2 DUB activity may therefore be more immunogenic and provide improved protection against subsequent challenge than its DUB-competent counterpart. To test this hypothesis, twenty Shetland mares were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Two groups were vaccinated, either with DUB-positive (n =9) or DUB-negative (n =9) recombinant EAV. The third group (n =2) was not vaccinated. All horses were subsequently challenged with the virulent KY84 strain of EAV. Both vaccine viruses proved to be replication competent in vivo. In addition, the DUB-negative virus provided a similar degree of protection against clinical disease as its DUB-positive parental counterpart. Owing to the already high level of protection provided by the parental virus, a possible improvement due to inactivation of PLP2 DUB activity could not be detected under these experimental conditions. Taken together, the data obtained in this study warrant further in vivo investigations into the potential of using DUB-mutant viruses for the improvement of arterivirus vaccines.","publish_time":"2015-07-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Kasteren, Puck B.; Knaap, Robert C.M.; van den Elzen, Paul; Snijder, Eric J.; Balasuriya, Udeni B.R.; van den Born, Erwin; Kikkert, Marjolein","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6dd1ec85b2f97b3abdee90713f44171377b378cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117436.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25975520/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113515001637; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2015.04.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113515001637","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV","EAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DUB-negative virus","DUB-mutant viruses","DUB-competent counterpart","parental virus","inactivation of PLP2 DUB activity","DUB-positive parental counterpart","vaccine viruses","respiratory syndrome virus","activity of EAV papain","recombinant EAV","current modified live virus vaccines","improvement of arterivirus vaccines","prototypic equine arteritis virus","stranded RNA viruses","improved protection","family of positive","possible improvement","groups","virulent KY84 strain of EAV","similar degree of protection","high level of protection","immune response","replication competent","Abstract Arteriviruses","ability of arteriviruses","case of PRRSV","inhibition of innate immune activation","clinical disease","subsequent challenge","efficacy","protease","infection","potential","investigations","room","addition","deubiquitinase","hypothesis","Shetland mares","study","experimental conditions","data","horses"],"language":"en"},

The detection method is used to confirm the presence of biomarkers visually and measure absorbance of the colored compounds at a specific wavelength. In this study, we propose a colorimetric assay based on an extended form of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) self-assembly shielded gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) under positive electrolyte (e.g., 0.1 M MgCl(2)) for detection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). This platform is able to verify the existence of viral molecules through a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) shift and color changes of AuNPs in the UV\u2013vis wavelength range. We designed a pair of thiol-modified probes at either the 5\u2032 end or 3\u2032 end to organize complementary base pairs with upstream of the E protein gene (upE) and open reading frames (ORF) 1a on MERS-CoV. The dsDNA of the target and probes forms a disulfide-induced long self-assembled complex, which protects AuNPs from salt-induced aggregation and transition of optical properties.

An RT-RPA assay targeting a recent epidemic human norovirus strain (GII.4 New Orleans) was developed and evaluated in this study. The assay successfully detected purified norovirus RNA from multiple patient outbreak isolates and had a limit of detection of 3.40 \u00B1 0.20 log(10) genomic copies (LGC), which is comparable to most other reported isothermal norovirus amplification methods. The assay also detected norovirus in directly boiled stool, and displayed better resistance to inhibitors than a commonly used RT-qPCR assay. The assay was specific, as it did not amplify genomes from 9 non-related enteric viruses and bacteria. The assay detected norovirus in some samples in as little as 6 min, and the entire detection process can be performed in less than 30 min.

METHODS: Results were compared from community surveys measuring health care-seeking for pneumonia defined as: (1) cough and difficulty breathing for \u2A7E2 days; or, (2) provider-diagnosed pneumonia. Surveys were conducted in six sites in Guatemala, Kenya and Thailand; these sites also conduct, active, hospital- and population-based disease surveillance for pneumonia. RESULTS: Frequency of self-reported pneumonia during the preceding year ranged from 1.1% (Thailand) to 6.3% (Guatemala) and was highest in children aged \u003C5 years and in urban sites. The proportion of persons with pneumonia who sought hospital-based medical services ranged from 12% (Guatemala, Kenya) to 80% (Thailand) and was highest in children \u003C5 years of age. Hospitals and private provider offices were the most common places where persons with pneumonia sought health care. The most commonly cited reasons for not seeking health care were: (a) mild illness; (b) already recovering; and (3) cost of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Health care-seeking patterns varied widely across countries. Using results from standardized health care utilization surveys to adjust facility-based surveillance estimates of pneumonia allows for more accurate and comparable estimates.","publish_time":"2012-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deutscher, Meredith; Beneden, Chris Van; Burton, Deron; Shultz, Alvin; Morgan, Oliver W.; Chamany, Shadi; Jordan, Hannah T.; Zhang, Xingyou; Flannery, Brendan; Feikin, Daniel R.; Olack, Beatrice; Lindblade, Kim A.; Breiman, Robert F.; Olsen, Sonja J.","journal":"J Epidemiol Glob Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b744ff5e6423a317c001ec96701a3b96a5213d8d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103994.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210600612000196; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jegh.2012.03.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23856423/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210600612000196","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Guatemala","Kenya","Thailand"],"keyphrases":["facility-based surveillance estimates of pneumonia","standardized health care utilization surveys","global burden of pneumonia","Results","Thailand","Guatemala","Frequency of self-reported pneumonia","surveillance methodology","population-based disease surveillance","community surveys","children","urban sites","Kenya","comparable estimates","proportion of persons","years of age","private provider offices","differences","behaviors","common places","preceding year","inter-country comparisons","patterns","Hospitals","medical services","cited reasons","CONCLUSIONS","mild illness","difficulty","METHODS","BACKGROUND","cost of treatment","cough","days","countries"],"language":"en"},

A total of 27 Korean strains from 1998 to 2013 were analyzed (excluding the noncoding regions) and divided into two groups for comparison of the spike (S), ORF3, envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) genes with those of reference strains, vaccine strains, and previously identified strains based on phylogenetic analysis. Analysis of the selection patterns of PEDV isolated in Korea indicated positive selection of nine nonsynonymous sites in the S and N proteins and negative selection at 97 sites for all of the proteins. Interestingly, eight nonsynonymous mutations in S showed no significant pattern change over the 15-year period, and one of eight mutation sites was found only in IC05TK, GN05DJ, and KNU0802 in the epidemic years 2005 and 2008. These eight mutations were also present during the epidemic years in China. Furthermore, of the signs of positive selection in the S protein, the conservative substitutions were more frequent than radical substitutions in PEDVs, suggesting that the evolution of Korean strains has been slow. Serological cross-reactivity was detected between three field PEDVs and two vaccine strains, with different serum neutralization titers. In conclusion, although Korean PEDVs have been evolving slowly, their diverse antigenicity and genetics imply that multilateral efforts to prevent future PED outbreaks are required.

Method Our study is a descriptive record-based review and analysis of travel-associated diseases over a 14 year time period from 1999 to 2013. The data was sourced from the communicable disease surveillance system, and central public health laboratory results. Results From 1999 to 2013 there were a combined total of 7022 cases of cholera, chikungunya, dengue, filariasis, leptospirosis, meningococcal infection, poliomyelitis, measles, schistosomiasis, viral hepatitis (A), typhoid and para-typhoid reported to and subsequently investigated by the Department of Communicable Diseases. Among these cases, 558 (7.9%) were attributed to travel. Fifty percent of these patients were admitted to hospitals. Conclusion Travel-associated infections account for about 8% of notifiable infections in Oman and have low mortality rate. However, some travel-associated infections are considered as a threat to polio eradication and measles elimination programs. Furthermore, some can cause outbreaks that can overwhelm the healthcare system.","publish_time":"2015-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Abri, Seif S.; Abdel-Hady, Doaa M.; Al Mahrooqi, Salem S.; Al-Kindi, Hanan S.; Al-Jardani, Amina K.; Al-Abaidani, Idris S.","journal":"Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7561f6f673645ac67d7c6204ff64bff7068834a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110695.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893915001416; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2015.08.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26363628/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893915001416","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Department of Communicable Diseases"],"locations":["Oman"],"keyphrases":["analysis of travel","related infections","burden of travel","Conclusion Travel-associated infections account","emergence of infections","Oman","notifiable infections","associated diseases","Department of Communicable Diseases","communicable disease surveillance system","cases of cholera","healthcare system","para-typhoid","measles elimination programs","central public health laboratory results","filariasis","leptospirosis","dengue","poliomyelitis","meningococcal infection","descriptive record-based review","threat","chikungunya","polio eradication","schistosomiasis","expatriate population workforce","viral hepatitis","increase","study","number of travelers","low mortality rate","year time period","Summary Background","Method","combined total","patients","decades","outbreaks","data","percent","hospitals","paper"],"language":"en"},

It is estimated that each adult in the United States experiences two to four respiratory infections annually. The morbidity of these infections is measured by an estimated 75 million physician visits per year, almost 150 million days lost from work, and more than $10 billion In costs for medical care. Serotypes of the rhinoviruses account for 20 to 30 percent of episodes of the common cold. However, the specific causes of most upper respiratory infections are undefined. Pneumonia remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality for nonhospitalized adults despite the widespread use of effective antimicrobial agents. There are no accurate figures on the number of episodes of pneumonia that occur each year in ambulatory patients. In younger adults, the atypical pneumonia syndrome Is the most common clinical presentation; Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the most frequently Identified causative agent. Other less common agents include Legionelia pneumophila, influenza viruses, adenoviruses, and Chiamydia. More than half a million adults are hospitalized each year with pneumonia. Persons older than 65 years of age have the highest rate of pneumonia admissions, 11.5 per 1,000 population. Pneumonia ranks as the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. The pathogens responsible for community-acquired pneumonlas are changing. Forty years ago, Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for the majority of infections. Today, a broad array of community-acquired pathogens have been implicated as etiologic agents Including Leglonella species, gram-negative bacilli, Hemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and nonbacterial pathogens. Given the diversity of pathogenic agents, it has become imperative for clinicians to establish a specific etiologic diagnosis before initiating therapy or to consider the diagnostic possibilities and treat with antimicrobial agents that are effective against the most likely pathogens.","publish_time":"1985-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garibaldi, Richard A.","journal":"The American Journal of Medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0002934385903614; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0002934385903614","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs0Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pneumonia","Streptococcus"],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["common agents","etiologic agents","upper respiratory infections","majority of infections","atypical pneumonia syndrome","nonhospitalized adults","younger adults","nonbacterial pathogens","pathogens responsible","likely pathogens","Abstract Upper respiratory tract infections","diversity of pathogenic agents","highest rate of pneumonia admissions","widespread use of effective antimicrobial agents","common clinical presentation","common types of infectious diseases","specific etiologic diagnosis","United States experiences","important cause of morbidity","years of age","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","percent of episodes","specific causes","Streptococcus pneumoniae","number of episodes","leading cause of death","broad array of community","Hemophilus influenzae","gram-negative bacilli","Staphylococcus aureus","influenza viruses","Leglonella species","mortality","Legionelia pneumophila","adenoviruses","therapy","clinicians","diagnostic possibilities","rhinoviruses account","Chiamydia","accurate figures","Persons older","physician visits","pneumonlas","ambulatory patients","costs","medical care","Serotypes","days","population","causative agent","work"],"language":"en"},

However, the inhibitory effects of serine protease inhibitors on influenza virus infection of human airway epithelial cells, and on their production of inflammatory cytokines are unclear. Methods Primary cultures of human tracheal epithelial cells were treated with four types of serine protease inhibitors, including camostat, and infected with A/Sendai-H/108/2009/(H1N1) pdm09 or A/New York/55/2004(H3N2). Results Camostat reduced the amounts of influenza viruses in the supernatants and viral RNA in the cells. It reduced the cleavage of an influenza virus precursor protein, HA0, into the subunit HA1. Camostat also reduced the concentrations of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1 in the supernatants. Gabexate and aprotinin reduced the viral titers and RNA levels in the cells, and aprotinin reduced the concentrations of TNF-\u03B1 in the supernatants. The proteases transmembrane protease serine S1 member (TMPRSS) 2 and HAT (human trypsin-like protease: TMPRSS11D), which are known to cleave HA0 and to activate the virus, were detected at the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm. mRNA encoding TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and TMPRSS11D was detectable in the cells, and the expression levels were not affected by camostat. Conclusions These findings suggest that human airway epithelial cells express these serine proteases and that serine protease inhibitors, especially camostat, may reduce influenza viral replication and the resultant production of inflammatory cytokines possibly through inhibition of activities of these proteases.","publish_time":"2015-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yamaya, Mutsuo; Shimotai, Yoshitaka; Hatachi, Yukimasa; Lusamba Kalonji, Nadine; Tando, Yukiko; Kitajima, Yasuo; Matsuo, Kaori; Kubo, Hiroshi; Nagatomi, Ryoichi; Hongo, Seiji; Homma, Morio; Nishimura, Hidekazu","journal":"Pulmonary Pharmacology \u0026 Therapeutics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0da6e2166a2e2a6eae8147a6516b466b40ea47e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110702.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pupt.2015.07.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1094553915000747; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26166259/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094553915000747","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs0MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus infection of human airway epithelial cells","types of serine protease inhibitors","entry of influenza virus","influenza viral replication","inhibitory effects of serine protease inhibitors","amounts of influenza viruses","proteases transmembrane protease serine S1 member","influenza virus precursor protein","Results Camostat","supernatants","Abstract Background Serine proteases act","Methods Primary cultures of human tracheal epithelial cells","human trypsin","viral RNA","viral titers","resultant production of inflammatory cytokines","concentrations of TNF","RNA levels","TMPRSS11D","aprotinin","cytokines interleukin","HA0","proteolytic cleavage","expression levels","IL","HAT","hemagglutinin","findings","inhibition of activities","tumor necrosis factor","TMPRSS2","TMPRSS4","New York","pdm09","H1N1","mRNA","Gabexate","Conclusions","Sendai-H","cell membrane","subunit HA1","cytoplasm","H3N2"],"language":"en"},

However, instability of these plasmids resulting from cryptic expression of SFV envelope proteins in Escherichia coli represents a problem both for the development of SFV-based vectors and for SFV research. In this study, an infectious plasmid of SFV, pCMV-SFV4, was constructed; its toxic effect was eliminated by intron insertion in the capsid protein encoding region. When transfected into mammalian cells, the plasmid clone was highly infectious and produced virus with properties identical to those of wild-type SFV. The inserted intron was efficiently and properly removed from the RNA genome of SFV. Therefore, this novel and stabilized infectious SFV plasmid represents a superior tool for basic studies of SFV as well as for biotechnological applications.","publish_time":"2007-12-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u00DClper, Liane; Sarand, Inga; Rausalu, Kai; Merits, Andres","journal":"J Virol Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c50d7c79c00a459773899b5df6bd92a718601fba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172237.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016609340700417X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016609340700417X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs0NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SFV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of SFV","SFV genome","infectious plasmid of SFV","SFV research","stabilized infectious SFV plasmid","RNA genome of SFV","basic studies of SFV","wild-type SFV","cryptic expression of SFV envelope proteins","plasmid clones","development of expression vectors","high efficiency of viral protein expression","superior tool","attractive tool","based vectors","produced virus","capsid protein","properties identical","intron insertion","inserted intron","Semliki Forest virus","genus Alphavirus","broad host range","Escherichia coli","problem","cDNA","plasmids","pCMV-SFV4","novel","toxic effect","region","mammalian cells","study","immune response","instability","biotechnological applications"],"language":"en"},

In the field of functional urology, there are clinical situations with a high risk of complication if management is delayed and a great heterogeneity of advisable reprogramming times after cancellation. A prioritization of functional urology procedures is necessary to adapt management during the COVID-19 crisis and to better organize post-epidemic recovery. MATERIAL AND METHODS The advice of AFU scientific committees in the field of functional urology (neuro-urology, female and perineology, male LUTS) was requested and supplemented by a review of the currently available recommendations on the subject of urology and COVID-19. These opinions were combined to draw up temporary recommendations to help reorganize practices during the epidemic and prepare the post-critical phase. RESULTS Most of the recommendations available on career-oriented social networks (Twitter, LinkedIn) or in literature concern cancer or general urology. Eight out of ten propose a cancellation of all functional urology procedures without distinction. But the 3 AFU committees covering the field of functional urology have identified three clinical situations in which surgical procedures that can be maintained during the COVID-19 epidemic (priority level A): conclusion of a neuromodulation test in progress (implantation or explantation), botulinum toxin A bladder injections for unbalanced neurologic bladder, cystectomy and ileal conduit for urinary fistula in perineal bedsore or refractory unbalanced neurologic bladder with acute renal failure and vesico-enteric or prostato-pubic fistulas. Management adaptation of the other pathologies are proposed, as well as the application of 3 priority levels (B, C, D) for rescheduled procedures for a better management of the post-crisis activity resumption. CONCLUSION The joint functional urology committees indicate that there are specific clinical situations in this field that demand non-delayed care during COVID crisis. They underline the need to establish a hierarchy for the cancelled surgeries, in order to reduce the arm of long reschedule delays and to optimize post-lockdown activity resumption.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Michel, Floriane; Gaillet, Sarah; Cornu, Jean Nicolas; Robert, Gr\u00E9goire; Game, Xavier; Ph\u00E9, V\u00E9ronique; Karsenty, Gilles","journal":"Prog Urol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/305b3f9a55c148a0f75dc9ff6ac9d46061f87862.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418734/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.purol.2020.04.007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs5OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AFU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["field of functional urology","neuro-urology","general urology","subject of urology","management of urology patient","prioritization of functional urology procedures","joint functional urology committees","COVID crisis","better management","Management adaptation","post-epidemic recovery","post-crisis activity resumption","AFU committees","rescheduled procedures","available recommendations","recommendations available","surgical procedures","specific clinical situations","post-lockdown activity resumption","refractory unbalanced neurologic bladder","bladder injections","conclusion","temporary recommendations","post-critical phase","cancellation","advice of AFU scientific committees","priority levels","non-delayed care","perineal bedsore","ileal conduit","acute renal failure","cystectomy","urinary fistula","LinkedIn","vesico-enteric","career-oriented social networks","botulinum toxin","implantation","Twitter","explantation","female","literature concern cancer","great heterogeneity of advisable reprogramming times","progress","METHODS","perineology","neuromodulation test","high risk of complication","prostato-pubic fistulas","delays","male LUTS","hierarchy","order","cancelled surgeries","application","MATERIAL","practices","distinction","arm","pathologies","review","RESULTS","need","opinions"],"language":"en"},

Piglets (n = 62) derived from 6 sows were assigned to one of 6 different treatments using a randomized block design which provided for allocation of all treatments to all sows\u0027 litters. Each treatment was designed to achieve a different level of circulating anti-PEDV antibody via intraperitoneally administration of concentrated serum antibody. Piglets were orally inoculated with PEDV (USA/IN/2013/19338E, 1 x 10(3) TCID(50) per piglet) 24 hours later and then monitored for 14 days. Piglets remained with their dam throughout the experiment. Sow milk samples, piglet fecal samples, and data on piglet clinical signs, body weight, and body temperature were collected daily. Fecal samples were tested by PEDV real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. Serum, colostrum, and milk were tested for PEDV IgG, IgA, and virus-neutralizing antibody. The data were evaluated for the effects of systemic PEDV antibody levels on growth, body temperature, fecal shedding, survival, and antibody response. The analysis showed that circulating antibody partially ameliorated the effect of PEDV infection. Specifically, antibody-positive groups returned to normal body temperature faster and demonstrated a higher rate of survivability than piglets without PEDV antibody. When combined with previous literature on PEDV, it can be concluded that both systemic antibodies and maternal secretory IgA in milk contribute to the protection of the neonatal pig against PEDV infections. Overall, the results of this experiment suggested that passively administered circulating antibodies contributed to the protection of neonatal piglets against PEDV infection.","publish_time":"2016-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Poonsuk, Korakrit; Gim\u00E9nez-Lirola, Luis Gabriel; Zhang, Jianqiang; Arruda, Paolo; Chen, Qi; Correa da Silva Carrion, Lucas; Magtoto, Ronaldo; Pineyro, Pablo; Sarmento, Luciana; Wang, Chong; Sun, Yaxuan; Madson, Darin; Johnson, John; Yoon, Kyoung-Jin; Zimmerman, Jeffrey; Main, Rodger","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/996fc493a4d72390383d242d35515dc8144bb36d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4822964.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0153041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27050556/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","PEDV IgG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-PEDV antibody","PEDV IgG","PEDV infections","antibody response","effects of systemic PEDV antibody levels","contribution of circulating antibody","effect of PEDV infection","antibody-positive groups","protection of neonatal piglets","administration of concentrated serum antibody","protection of na\u00EFve piglets","passive antibody transfer model","piglet fecal samples","PEDV real-time reverse transcriptase PCR","circulating antibodies","normal body temperature","body weight","Sow milk samples","fecal shedding","systemic antibodies","different treatments","data","experiment","piglet clinical signs","different level","maternal secretory IgA","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","growth","survival","allocation","randomized block design","higher rate of survivability","sows\u0027 litters","colostrum","USA","previous literature","dam","results","TCID","hours","analysis","days"],"language":"en"},

However, recent worldwide respiratory outbreaks discourage routine use of nebulization. Previous studies have shown that combined budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort(\u00AE), AstraZeneca) is effective as both a maintenance and reliever anti-asthmatic medication. METHODS: We performed a randomized, open-label study from March until August 2011 to compare the bronchodilatory effects of Symbicort(\u00AE )vs. nebulized salbutamol in acute exacerbation of mild to moderate asthmatic attack in an emergency department. Initial objective parameters measured include the oxygen saturation, peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and respiratory rate. During clinical reassessment, subjective parameters [i.e., Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and 5-point Likert scale of breathlessness] and the second reading of the objective parameters were measured. For the 5-point Likert scale, the patients were asked to describe their symptom relief as 1, much worse; 2, a little worse; 3, no change; 4, a little better; 5, much better. RESULTS: Out of the total of 32 patients enrolled, 17 patients (53%) were randomized to receive nebulized salbutamol and 15 (47%) to receive Symbicort(\u00AE). For both treatment arms, by using paired t- and Wilcoxon signed rank tests, it was shown that there were statistically significant improvements in oxygen saturation, PEFR and respiratory rate within the individual treatment groups (pre- vs. post-treatment). Comparing the effects of Symbicort(\u00AE )vs. nebulized salbutamol, the average improvement of oxygen saturation was 1% in both treatment arms (p = 0.464), PEFR 78.67 l/min vs. 89.41 l/min, respectively (p = 0.507), and respiratory rate 2/min vs. 2/min (p = 0.890).

Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (NHAR), located in the North-west, is one of the poorest provinces in China and national surveys have shown TB has been hyper endemic in NHAR for several decades. As no active surveys had been undertaken since the initiation of the DOTS control program across all of NHAR. METHODS: A retrospective study was undertaken of all clinical records of TB patients registered from January 2005 to September 2009. Poisson regression was performed to investigate the change in incidence over time and accounted for age, sex and county. Length of time on treatment, disease severity and patient delay were assessed by county. RESULTS: More than 30% of patients had been on treatment for over 12 months and 10% for over 3 years, reflecting drug-resistance or failure of DOTS. More than 93% of patients had grade III disease at time of diagnosis and \u003E15% of patients had severe disease grade IV-V in some NHAR counties. Further, 8.8% of patients were not diagnosed for over 6 months from the onset of symptoms; this was as high as 20% in some counties. The reported incidence of TB is most likely grossly underestimated and the data indicate TB is a major public health concern in NHAR. CONCLUSIONS: It is clear that active surveillance is necessary to determine the full extent of the burden of TB in NHAR. New control and treatment strategies for TB are required that increase awareness in the health-care system and at the individual and community level.","publish_time":"2012-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Yu Rong; McManus, Donald P; Gray, Darren J; Wang, Xiao Ling; Yang, Shu Kun; Ross, Allen G; Williams, Gail M; Ellis, Magda K","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0043d044273b8eb1585d3a66061e9b4e03edc062.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3543161.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-12-1110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23259484/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjszOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ningxia Hui"],"organizations":["NHAR"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["NHAR counties","burden of TB","clinical records of TB patients","reported incidence of TB","devastating disease","disease severity","treatment strategies","time of diagnosis","Length of time","active surveys","county","months","severe disease grade IV-V","DOTS control program","national surveys","New control","failure of DOTS","active surveillance","health-care system","high rate of mortality","major public health concern","rapid transmission","China","patient delay","reflecting drug-resistance","poorest provinces","hyper endemic","individual","Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region","initiation","awareness","age","retrospective study","years","BACKGROUND","Tuberculosis","extent","decades","data","change","sex","community level","onset of symptoms","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","Poisson regression","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

In view of this, HCWs were evaluated for their knowledge of and attitude towards MERS in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A cross sectional study was performed in two hospitals of Qassim region in Saudi Arabia. A total of 280 healthcare workers were selected to participate in this study. Knowledge and attitude were assessed by using self-administered and pretested questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were carried out to express participants\u2019 demographic information, mean knowledge score and mean attitude score of HCWs. Inferential statistics (Mann\u2013Whitney U test and Kruskal Wallis tests, p \u003C 0.05) were used to examine differences between study variables. Chi squares tests were used to assess the association between study variables and attitude questions. Spearman\u2019s rho correlation was used to identify the association between the knowledge, attitude scores. RESULT: Participants demonstrated good knowledge and positive attitude towards MERS. The mean scores of knowledge and attitude were 9.45 \u00B1 1.69 (based on 13 knowledge questions) and 1.82 \u00B1 0.72 (based on 7 attitude questions). The correlation between knowledge and attitude was significant (correlation coefficient: 0.12; P \u003C0.001). HCWs were less educated about the management (42.4%), source (66%) and consequences of MERS (67.3%), while a majority of them were well aware of the hallmark symptoms (96%), precautionary measures (96%) and hygiene issues (94%). Although the majority of respondents showed positive attitude towards the use of protective measures (1.52 \u00B1 0.84), their attitude was negative towards their active participation in infection control program (2.03 \u00B1 0.97). Gender and experience were significantly associated with knowledge and attitude (P \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study showed that healthcare workers in Qassim region of Saudi Arabia have good knowledge and positive attitude towards MERS. Yet there are areas where low knowledge and negative attitude of HCWs was observed. However, studies are required to assess the knowledge and attitude of HCWs at national level so that effective interventions could be designed as surveillance and infection control measures are critical to global public health.","publish_time":"2014-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khan, Muhammad Umair; Shah, Shahjahan; Ahmad, Akram; Fatokun, Omotayo","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/888f3a42d4361d36b3ffbe619427ace11fae0e1b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4300996.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25510239/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-14-1281","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Spearman"],"organizations":["Inferential"],"locations":["Middle East","Qassim","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["positive attitude","attitude questions","attitude scores","negative attitude of HCWs","knowledge questions","good knowledge","mean attitude score of HCWs","low knowledge","mean knowledge score","mean scores of knowledge","study variables","healthcare workers","consequences of MERS","Qassim region of Saudi Arabia","infection control measures","cross sectional study","association","correlation coefficient","precautionary measures","hospitals of Qassim region","infection control program","use of protective measures","Spearman\u2019s rho correlation","Inferential statistics","Descriptive statistics","majority of respondents","Kruskal Wallis tests","Chi squares tests","Whitney U test","express participants\u2019 demographic information","prevalence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","Mann","surveillance","national level","increase","global public health","active participation","effective interventions","areas","METHODS","management","findings","RESULT","hallmark symptoms","pretested questionnaire","source","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","experience","total","differences","risk","hygiene issues","lethal virus","Gender","view","studies"],"language":"en"},

Evidence suggests that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) ameliorates inflammation in animal models of renal disease, implying that HGF might inhibit specific components of the inflammatory response. This study examined the effect of HGF on endothelial E-selectin expression in acute inflammation induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1. In vitro, HGF suppressed TNF-\u03B1-induced cell surface expression of E-selectin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and inhibited E-selectin mediated monocytic adhesion to endothelial monolayers. HGF activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)\u2013Akt that in turn inhibited its downstream transducer glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3. Blockade of the PI3K\u2013Akt pathway with specific inhibitors abrogated HGF induced inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3 and suppression of E-selectin. In addition, selective inhibition of GSK3 activity by lithium suppressed TNF-\u03B1-induced E-selectin expression and monocytic adhesion, reminiscent of the action of HGF. Moreover, ectopic expression of an uninhibitable mutant GSK3\u03B2, in which the regulatory serine-9 is replaced by alanine, abolished HGF\u0027s suppressive effect on endothelial E-selectin. In vivo, administration of exogenous HGF reduced endothelial expression of E-selectin induced by bolus injection of TNF-\u03B1.

Nowadays the capacity of an adjuvant is also measured by the quality as well as the magnitude of the induced immune response, guided by the protective immune response required. Quality includes isotype and IgG subclass responses, T-helper cell responses characterized by the cytokine profile and cytotoxic T cells (CTL). In the early phase of immunization some adjuvants influence the antigen administration and uptake by a so- called depot effect exemplified by aluminium hydroxide gel and oil adjuvants, which possibly is not as desired as alledged. A modern depot is exerted by slow release formulations continuously releasing the antigen over a period of time or by pulses at intervals aiming at \u2018single injection\u2019 vaccine. Great efforts are made to formulate efficient delivery formulations targeting the antigens from the site of administration, to draining lymph nodes or distant lymphatic tissue or to mucosal surfaces by parenteral or mucosal administrations. Nowadays, non-replicating carriers besides replicating vaccines are formulated to induce mucosal immune responses encompassing secretory IgA and CMI. Efforts to evoke immune responses on mucosal membranes distant from the site of administration have resulted mostly in little success. For a long time it was considered that CTL under the restriction of MHC Class I only could be evoked by replicating viruses or intracellular parasites. However, novel adjuvant delivery systems readily induce CTL by delivering the antigen to the APC resulting in intracellular transport to the cytosol for the MHC Class I presentation system, as well as to the endosomal pathway for the MHC Class II presentation.","publish_time":"1996-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morein, Bror; Villacr\u00E9s-Eriksson, Mar\u00EDa; Sj\u00F6lander, Anders; L\u00F6vgren Bengtsson, Karin","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c49595869663e8dff3487af03ed03d87efd3aa1d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242796056978; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242796056978","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsyNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTL","MHC","APC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mucosal immune responses","antigen administration","CTL","mucosal surfaces","mucosal administrations","site of administration","given antigen","mucosal membranes distant","protective immune response","induced immune response","restriction of MHC Class","T-helper cell responses","IgG subclass responses","CMI","replicating vaccines","capacity","quality","novel adjuvant delivery systems","efficient delivery formulations","non-replicating carriers","oil adjuvants","depot effect","modern depot","intracellular transport","presentation system","period of time","intracellular parasites","long time","Great efforts","cell mediated immunity","distant lymphatic tissue","cytotoxic T cells","slow release formulations","enhanced antibody serum titres","cytokine profile","aluminium hydroxide gel","lymph nodes","isotype","antigens","cytosol","secretory IgA","intervals","pulses","magnitude","uptake","early phase of immunization","single injection","endosomal pathway","APC","viruses","efficiency","little success"],"language":"en"},

Cough is a normal physiological defensive reflex responsible for keeping the airways free of obstruction and harmful substances. However, cough is also the most frequent symptom of acute respiratory system diseases and is the most common reason why sick patients visit physicians. The largest diagnostic group associated with chronic cough is asthma or asthma-like syndromes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Furthermore, gastroesophageal reflux, rhinitis/postnasal drip syndrome and unpleasant side effects accompanying the therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) represent other causes of chronic cough. The cough reflex may be elicited by the activation of receptors of non-myelinated nociceptive A\u03B4-fibers and C-fibers and receptors of myelinated A\u03B4-fibers distributed throughout the respiratory tract. In recent times as proper cough receptors are thought to be rapidly adapting receptors (RARs) of myelinated fibers, C-fibers and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) localize on the non-myelinated fibers. As the pathological cough (especially its chronic form) has significant impact on patient\u0027s quality of life, observed either in physical activity or psychosocial domain, various treatment attitudes are used for different forms of cough (acute, subacute, chronic, productive, nonproductive, psychogenic, asthma-associated, or painful). Interest of research in this field is accompanied with the fact, that many antitussive drugs (mainly from the opioid group), which have been the antitussives of choice for decades, are limited by their unpleasant and very often adverse reactions. In this chapter the authors divided the drugs used in the pharmacological treatment of cough into several groups. These include the drugs acting at the level of receptors, the drugs affecting the propagation of cough impulses in afferent nerves, the drugs modulating the central coordination of cough reflex, the drugs acting at the level of efferent nerves, and the drugs affecting the effectors. Efficacy of many antitussive agents is connected with their influence on more than one level of cough reflex. Another group used in the therapy of cough are mucoactive substances that change the dry, irritant and nonproductive cough into the so-called productive cough with nonirritating expectoration. The last-mentioned group in this chapter is demulcerative and hydrating drugs, which can create a defense layer protecting the mucous membranes from other irritant stimuli.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nosalova, Gabriela; Mokry, Juraj; Franova, Sona","journal":"Advances in Phytomedicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/613b280bd1f7e0a0dd50cbf2501da003caf95eb4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1572557X05020064; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1572557X05020064","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsyNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nonproductive cough","therapy of cough","pathological cough","level of cough reflex","causes of chronic cough","proper cough receptors","so-called productive cough","pharmacological treatment of cough","different forms of cough","propagation of cough impulses","central coordination of cough reflex","antitussive drugs","hydrating drugs","receptors of myelinated A\u03B4-fibers","C-fibers","non-myelinated fibers","level of receptors","non-myelinated nociceptive A\u03B4-fibers","chronic form","asthma","activation of receptors","adapting receptors","last-mentioned group","opioid group","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","level of efferent nerves","chapter","largest diagnostic group","normal physiological defensive reflex responsible","expiratory muscles","afferent nerves","harmful substances","mucoactive substances","irritant stimuli","respiratory tract","antitussive agents","various treatment attitudes","frequent symptom of acute respiratory system diseases","attack of powerful expiratory efforts","postnasal drip syndrome","rhinitis","psychosocial domain","effects","active contractions","significant impact","TRPV1","transient receptor potential vanilloid","syndromes","airways free of obstruction","common reason","physical activity","patient\u0027s quality of life","mucous membranes","angiotensin","ACEI","demulcerative","RARs","gastroesophageal reflux","enzyme inhibitors","sick patients","physicians","nonirritating expectoration","recent times","defense layer","decades","deep inspirations","influence","fact","groups","field","antitussives of choice","Efficacy","adverse reactions","authors","research","effectors"],"language":"en"},

SUMO has a critical role in the signaling pathway governing type I interferon (IFN) production, and among the SUMOylation substrates are many IFN-induced proteins. The overall effect of IFN is increasing global SUMOylation, pointing to SUMO as part of the antiviral stress response. Viral agents have developed different mechanisms to counteract the antiviral activities exerted by SUMO, and some viruses have evolved to exploit the host SUMOylation machinery to modify their own proteins. The exploitation of SUMO has been mainly linked to nuclear replicating viruses due to the predominant nuclear localization of SUMO proteins and enzymes involved in SUMOylation. However, SUMOylation of numerous viral proteins encoded by RNA viruses replicating at the cytoplasm has been lately described. Whether nuclear localization of these viral proteins is required for their SUMOylation is unclear. Here, we summarize the studies on exploitation of SUMOylation by cytoplasmic RNA viruses and discuss about the requirement for nuclear localization of their proteins.","publish_time":"2019-12-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"El Motiam, Ahmed; Vidal, Santiago; Seoane, Roc\u00EDo; Bouzaher, Yanis H.; Gonz\u00E1lez-Santamar\u00EDa, Jos\u00E9; Rivas, Carmen","journal":"Proteostasis and Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62e4c8f98091a5807871324d58b035cf6b016073.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7144409.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32274761/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-38266-7_11","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsyNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SUMO","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SUMOylation of numerous viral proteins","exploitation of SUMOylation","predominant nuclear localization of SUMO proteins","global SUMOylation","SUMOylation substrates","IFN-induced proteins","nuclear replicating viruses","host SUMOylation machinery","lysine residues of target proteins","protein subcellular localization","cytoplasmic RNA viruses","antiviral activities","Viral agents","antiviral defense","overall effect of IFN","antiviral stress response","transcription","pathway governing type","innate immunity","DNA repair","stability","biological processes","interferon","different mechanisms","production","requirement","enzymes","critical role","studies","ubiquitin"],"language":"en"},

Although our understanding of coronaviruses has undergone a huge leap after two precedents, the effective approaches to treatment and epidemiological control are still lacking. In this article, we present a succinct overview of the epidemiology, clinical features, and molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. We summarize the current epidemiological and clinical data from the initial Wuhan studies, and emphasize several features of SARS-CoV-2, which differentiate it from SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), such as high variability of disease presentation. We systematize the current clinical trials that have been rapidly initiated after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas the trials on SARS-CoV-2 genome-based specific vaccines and therapeutic antibodies are currently being tested, this solution is more long-term, as they require thorough testing of their safety. On the other hand, the repurposing of the existing therapeutic agents previously designed for other virus infections and pathologies happens to be the only practical approach as a rapid response measure to the emergent pandemic, as most of these agents have already been tested for their safety. These agents can be divided into two broad categories, those that can directly target the virus replication cycle, and those based on immunotherapy approaches either aimed to boost innate antiviral immune responses or alleviate damage induced by dysregulated inflammatory responses. The initial clinical studies revealed the promising therapeutic potential of several of such drugs, including favipiravir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that interferes with the viral replication, and hydroxychloroquine, the repurposed antimalarial drug that interferes with the virus endosomal entry pathway. We speculate that the current pandemic emergency will be a trigger for more systematic drug repurposing design approaches based on big data analysis.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tu, Yung-Fang; Chien, Chian-Shiu; Yarmishyn, Aliaksandr A.; Lin, Yi-Ying; Luo, Yung-Hung; Lin, Yi-Tsung; Lai, Wei-Yi; Yang, De-Ming; Chou, Shih-Jie; Yang, Yi-Ping; Wang, Mong-Lien; Chiou, Shih-Hwa","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/76f9a7fb33535b50d02bf61a1ec4f40f7fedd4f7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7177898.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21072657; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32290293/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsyODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","features of SARS","clinical data","clinical features","current clinical trials","global pandemic","initial clinical studies","current pandemic emergency","emergent pandemic","molecular characteristics of SARS","existing therapeutic agents","systematic drug repurposing design approaches","effective approaches","broad-spectrum antiviral drug","virulent coronavirus","novel coronavirus","immunotherapy approaches","therapeutic antibodies","initial Wuhan studies","virus infections","virus replication cycle","safety","repurposed antimalarial drug","promising therapeutic potential","innate antiviral immune responses","epidemiological control","virus endosomal entry pathway","viral replication","sudden outbreak","global economy","outbreak of COVID","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","big data analysis","dysregulated inflammatory responses","damage","trigger","rapid response measure","precedents","hydroxychloroquine","treatment","epidemiology","genome","practical approach","succinct overview","specific vaccines","huge leap","drugs","favipiravir","introduction","nCoV","high variability of disease presentation","human society","thorough testing","healthcare system","pathologies","understanding of coronaviruses","article","hand","broad categories","solution","China"],"language":"en"},

Viruses often exploit the endocytosis pathways to invade host cells and escape from the endocytic vesicles often in response to low pH. Localization to these endocytic vesicles is essential for IFITM3 to interfere with the cytosolic entry of pH-dependent viruses. However, the nature of the sorting signal that targets IFITM3 to these vesicles is poorly defined. In this study, we report that IFITM3 possesses a Yxx\u03A6 sorting motif, i.e., 20-YEML-23, that enables IFITM3 to undergo endocytosis through binding to the \u03BC2 subunit of the AP-2 complex. IFITM3 accumulates at the plasma membrane as a result of either mutating 20-YEML-23, depleting the \u03BC2 subunit, or overexpressing \u03BC2 mutants. Importantly, blocking endocytosis of IFITM3 abrogates its ability to inhibit pH-dependent viruses. We have therefore identified a critical sorting signal, namely 20-YEML-23, that controls both the endocytic trafficking and the antiviral action of IFITM3. This finding also reveals that as an endocytic protein, IFITM3 first arrives at the plasma membrane before it is endocytosed and further traffics to the late endosomes where it acts to impede virus entry.","publish_time":"2014-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jia, Rui; Xu, Fengwen; Qian, Jin; Yao, Yunfang; Miao, Chunhui; Zheng, Yi-Min; Liu, Shan-Lu; Guo, Fei; Geng, Yunqi; Qiao, Wentao; Liang, Chen","journal":"Cellular Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a7156becf1267cc8dc1f0ef5bc6c8df26e40debd.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2a90bbe3b7b799e0756fb6635289febd70819d37.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4065222.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4065222?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1111/cmi.12262; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24521078/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjszMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["endocytosis of IFITM3","targets IFITM3","endocytic vesicles","antiviral action of IFITM3","endocytic protein","pH-dependent viruses","YEML","\u03BC2 subunit","endocytic trafficking","cytosolic entry of pH","endocytosis pathways","low pH","virus entry","critical sorting signal","wide range of viruses","plasma membrane","overexpressing \u03BC2 mutants","Yxx\u03A6 sorting motif","protein family","host cells","escape","ability","response","binding","interferon","nature","controls","result","Localization","Members","complex","late endosomes","study"],"language":"en"},

The spike is a type I membrane glycoprotein that possesses a conserved transmembrane anchor and an unusual cysteine-rich (cys) domain that bridges the putative junction of the anchor and the cytoplasmic tail. In this study, we examined the role of these carboxyl-terminal domains in spike-mediated membrane fusion. We show that the cytoplasmic tail is not required for fusion but has the capacity to enhance membrane fusion activity. Chimeric spike protein mutants containing substitutions of the entire transmembrane anchor and cys domain with the herpes simplex virus type 1 glycoprotein D (gD-1) anchor demonstrated that fusion activity requires the presence of the A59 membrane-spanning domain and the portion of the cys domain that lies upstream of the cytoplasmic tail. The cys domain is a required element since its deletion from the wild-type spike protein abrogates fusion activity. However, addition of the cys domain to fusion-defective chimeric proteins was unable to restore fusion activity. Thus, the cys domain is necessary but is not sufficient to complement the gD-1 anchor and allow for membrane fusion. Site-specific mutations of conserved cysteine residues in the cys domain markedly reduce membrane fusion, which further supports the conclusion that this region is crucial for spike function. The results indicate that the carboxyl-terminus of the spike transmembrane anchor contains at least two distinct domains, both of which are necessary for full membrane fusion.","publish_time":"2000-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Kevin W.; Sheng, YiWei; Gombold, James L.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fced9d531863f4bbf4bba0e1192adba213298bcf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682200902198; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682200902198","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjszMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cys domain","membrane fusion activity","spike-mediated membrane fusion","spike transmembrane anchor","membrane glycoprotein","A59 membrane","spike function","fusion-defective chimeric proteins","conserved transmembrane anchor","entire transmembrane anchor","wild-type spike protein","Chimeric spike protein mutants","cytoplasmic tail","spike glycoprotein of mouse hepatitis virus strain A59","glycoprotein D","gD","herpes simplex virus type","carboxyl-terminal domains","distinct domains","carboxyl-terminus","required element","Site-specific mutations of conserved cysteine residues","unusual cysteine-rich","substitutions","early events","deletion","infection of cells","role","region","putative junction","presence","capacity","portion","cellular membranes","conclusion","addition","results","study"],"language":"en"},

Investigating the relation between cardiovascular disease and exposure to a complex mixture of air pollutants requires holistic approaches. We assessed the relationship between exposure to multiple air pollutants and the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) in a general population sample. We collected data in the Lille MONICA registry (2008\u20132011) on 3268 incident cases (age range: 35\u201374). Based on 20 indicators, we derived a composite environmental score (SEnv) for cumulative exposure to air pollution. Poisson regression models were used to analyse associations between CHD rates on one hand and SEnv and each single indicator on the other (considered in tertiles, where T3 is the most contaminated). We adjusted models for age, sex, area-level social deprivation, and neighbourhood spatial structure. The incidence of CHD was a spatially heterogeneous (p=0.006). There was a significant positive association between SEnv and CHD incidence (trend p=0.0151). The relative risks [95%CI] of CHD were 1.08 [0.98\u20131.18] and 1.16 [1.04\u20131.29] for the 2nd and 3rd tertile of SEnv exposure. In the single pollutant analysis, PM10, NO2, cadmium, copper, nickel, and palladium were significantly associated with CHD rates. Multiple air pollution was associated with an increased risk of CHD. Single pollutants reflecting road traffic pollution were the most strongly associated with CHD. Our present results are consistent with the literature data on the impact of road traffic on the CHD risk in urban areas.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Occelli, Florent; Lanier, Caroline; Cuny, Damien; Deram, Annabelle; Dumont, Julie; Amouyel, Philippe; Montaye, Mich\u00E8le; Dauchet, Luc; Dallongeville, Jean; Genin, Micha\u00EBl","journal":"Science of The Total Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae5bdff69c84e77d88e9790626c486bb49e2a4f7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112033.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720301182; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720301182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32018947/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.136608","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjszMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHD"],"locations":["Lille MONICA"],"keyphrases":["incidence of CHD","CHD incidence","CHD rates","CHD risk","increased risk of CHD","multiple air pollutants","Single pollutants","individual air pollutants","Multiple air pollution","tertile of SEnv exposure","complex mixture of air pollutants","cardiovascular disease rates","cumulative exposure","road traffic pollution","incidence of coronary heart disease","single indicator","impact of road traffic","single pollutant analysis","literature data","age range","trend p","Poisson regression models","NO2","area-level social deprivation","PM10","sex","hand","copper","cadmium","Abstract Geographical variations","associations","neighbourhood spatial structure","composite environmental score","significant positive association","holistic approaches","nickel","palladium","relationship","present results","urban areas","general population sample","incident cases","Lille MONICA registry","T3","relative risks","indicators","tertiles"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, we showed a suppression of PEDV infection in porcine jejunum intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) by an increase in autophagy. Autophagy was activated by rapamycin at a dose that does not affect cell viability and tight junction permeability. The induction of autophagy was examined by LC3I/LC3II conversion. To confirm the autophagic-flux (entire autophagy pathway), autophagolysosomes were examined by an immunofluorescence assay. Pre-treatment with rapamycin significantly restricted not only a 1 h infection but also a longer infection (24 h) with PEDV, while this effect disappeared when autophagy was blocked. Co-localization of PEDV and autophagosomes suggests that PEDV could be a target of autophagy. Moreover, alleviation of PEDV-induced cell death in IPEC-J2 cells pretreated with rapamycin demonstrates a protective effect of rapamycin against PEDV-induced epithelial cell death. Collectively, the present study suggests an early prevention against PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 cells via autophagy that might be an effective strategy for the restriction of PEDV, and opens up the possibility of the use of rapamycin in vivo as an effective prophylactic and prevention treatment.","publish_time":"2017-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ko, Seongyeol; Gu, Min Jeong; Kim, Cheol Gyun; Kye, Yoon Chul; Lim, Younggap; Lee, Ji Eun; Park, Byung-Chul; Chu, Hyuk; Han, Seung Hyun; Yun, Cheol-Heui","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5f364a7d3d6058bb7c1bd5d16d875ba7c5adb82.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113733.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2017.08.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28842266/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354216305344; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354216305344","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs0MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["alleviation of PEDV","restriction of PEDV","suppression of PEDV infection","induction of autophagy","target of autophagy","Co-localization of PEDV","IPEC-J2 cells","porcine intestinal epithelial cells","h infection","use of rapamycin","entire autophagy pathway","epithelial cell death","porcine jejunum intestinal epithelial cells","protective effect of rapamycin","longer infection","induced cell death","cell viability","present study","Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","early prevention","effective strategy","prevention treatment","IECs","autophagolysosomes","tight junction permeability","autophagic-flux","autophagosomes","dehydration","dose","possibility","increase","LC3II conversion","immunofluorescence assay","pigs","Pre-treatment"],"language":"en"},

Dirofilaria immitis was also common in dogs (34%), with lower prevalences of Wolbachia pipiens (22%), Bartonella sp. (13%), Ehrlichia/Anaplasma spp. (1%), and Mycoplasma haemocanis (1%) observed. Antibodies against panleukopenia virus (67%), Toxoplasma gondii (63%), calicivirus (44%), and herpesvirus 1 (10%) were detected in cats. Feline leukemia virus antigen, feline immunodeficiency virus antibody, or coronavirus antibodies were not detected. Bartonella sp. (44%) infections were common in cats, but only one was infected with M. haemofelis. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Despite their relative seclusion from the rest of the world, cats and dogs of Isabela were exposed to many pathogens found in mainland South America. Parasite prophylaxis, neutering, and strict enforcement of animal movement restrictions would control a majority of the diseases. In the absence of vaccination, a reservoir of susceptible animals remains vulnerable to new disease introductions.","publish_time":"2008-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Levy, J.K.; Crawford, P.C.; Lappin, M.R.; Dubovi, E.J.; Levy, M.G.; Alleman, R.; Tucker, S.J.; Clifford, E.L.","journal":"J Vet Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4476f76585452bab35d93267784c448aaa10960.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166416.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18289290/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1939-1676.2007.0034.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs0NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bartonella"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Galapagos","Isabela","South America"],"keyphrases":["cats","diseases common","dogs of Isabela","importation of dogs","isolation of dogs","prevalence of infectious diseases of dogs","parainfluenza virus","panleukopenia virus","distemper virus","panel of infectious diseases","sentinel diseases of concern","feline immunodeficiency virus antibody","Feline leukemia virus antigen","coronavirus antibodies","Galapagos","Bartonella","absence of vaccination","neutering campaign","mainland populations","reservoir of susceptible animals","mainland South America","prospective cross\u2010sectional study","strict enforcement of animal movement restrictions","DNA evaluation","world","new disease introductions","relative seclusion","Clinical Importance","pathogens","native wildlife","majority","Parasite prophylaxis","Methods","parvovirus","humans","Background","Dirofilaria immitis","health","infections","lower prevalences of Wolbachia","Conclusions","Blood","Toxoplasma gondii","Results","Hypothesis","isolated population","Ehrlichia","Anaplasma","Mycoplasma haemocanis","calicivirus","purpose","adenovirus","herpesvirus","haemofelis"],"language":"en"},

Little is known of the risk factors underlying the disease. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A case-control study with appropriate hospital and matched community controls for each patient was conducted between May 2006 and June 2009. Potential risk factors were assessed using a standardized questionnaire and investigation of throat and rectal S. suis carriage in cases, controls and their pigs, using real-time PCR and culture of swab samples. We recruited 101 cases of S. suis meningitis, 303 hospital controls and 300 community controls. By multivariate analysis, risk factors identified for S. suis infection as compared to either control group included eating \u201Chigh risk\u201D dishes, including such dishes as undercooked pig blood and pig intestine (OR(1) = 2.22; 95%CI = [1.15\u20134.28] and OR(2) = 4.44; 95%CI = [2.15\u20139.15]), occupations related to pigs (OR(1) = 3.84; 95%CI = [1.32\u201311.11] and OR(2) = 5.52; 95%CI = [1.49\u201320.39]), and exposures to pigs or pork in the presence of skin injuries (OR(1) = 7.48; 95%CI = [1.97\u201328.44] and OR(2) = 15.96; 95%CI = [2.97\u201385.72]). S. suis specific DNA was detected in rectal and throat swabs of 6 patients and was cultured from 2 rectal samples, but was not detected in such samples of 1522 healthy individuals or patients without S. suis infection. CONCLUSIONS: This case control study, the largest prospective epidemiological assessment of this disease, has identified the most important risk factors associated with S. suis bacterial meningitis to be eating \u2018high risk\u2019 dishes popular in parts of Asia, occupational exposure to pigs and pig products, and preparation of pork in the presence of skin lesions.

Although rodent models of ZEBOV infection are useful for screening prospective countermeasures, they are frequently not useful for prediction of efficacy in the more stringent non-human primate models. We therefore assessed the efficacy of modified non-immunostimulatory siRNAs in a uniformly lethal non-human primate model of ZEBOV haemorrhagic fever. METHODS: A combination of modified siRNAs targeting the ZEBOV L polymerase (EK-1 mod), viral protein (VP) 24 (VP24-1160 mod), and VP35 (VP35-855 mod) were formulated in SNALPs. A group of macaques (n=3) was given these pooled anti-ZEBOV siRNAs (2 mg/kg per dose, bolus intravenous infusion) after 30 min, and on days 1, 3, and 5 after challenge with ZEBOV. A second group of macaques (n=4) was given the pooled anti-ZEBOV siRNAs after 30 min, and on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 after challenge with ZEBOV. FINDINGS: Two (66%) of three rhesus monkeys given four postexposure treatments of the pooled anti-ZEBOV siRNAs were protected from lethal ZEBOV infection, whereas all macaques given seven postexposure treatments were protected. The treatment regimen in the second study was well tolerated with minor changes in liver enzymes that might have been related to viral infection. INTERPRETATION: This complete postexposure protection against ZEBOV in non-human primates provides a model for the treatment of ZEBOV-induced haemorrhagic fever. These data show the potential of RNA interference as an effective postexposure treatment strategy for people infected with Ebola virus, and suggest that this strategy might also be useful for treatment of other emerging viral infections.

These assays have the potential to greatly enhance efficiency in the clinical laboratory. Choice of primer and probe sequences is critical for accurate diagnosis in the clinic, yet current primer/probe signature design strategies are limited, and signature evaluation methods are lacking. METHODS: We assessed the quality of a signature by predicting the number of true positive, false positive and false negative hits against all available public sequence data. We found real-time PCR signatures described in recent literature and used a BLAST search based approach to collect all hits to the primer-probe combinations that should be amplified by real-time PCR chemistry. We then compared our hits with the sequences in the NCBI taxonomy tree that the signature was designed to detect. RESULTS: We found that many published signatures have high specificity (almost no false positives) but low sensitivity (high false negative rate). Where high sensitivity is needed, we offer a revised methodology for signature design which may designate that multiple signatures are required to detect all sequenced strains. We use this methodology to produce new signatures that are predicted to have higher sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSION: We show that current methods for real-time PCR assay design have unacceptably low sensitivities for most clinical applications. Additionally, as new sequence data becomes available, old assays must be reassessed and redesigned. A standard protocol for both generating and assessing the quality of these assays is therefore of great value. Real-time PCR has the capacity to greatly improve clinical diagnostics. The improved assay design and evaluation methods presented herein will expedite adoption of this technique in the clinical lab.","publish_time":"2008-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lemmon, Gordon H; Gardner, Shea N","journal":"Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a98b0a9e3e89d1aff14a6f64e25374b4e2855a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2566554.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1476-0711-7-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18817537/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NCBI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["real-time PCR signatures","real-time PCR assay design","real-time PCR chemistry","signature evaluation methods","probe signature design strategies","recent years real-time PCR","false negative hits","current methods","high sensitivity","new signatures","false positives","high false negative rate","current primer","probe sequences","low sensitivity","high specificity","published signatures","multiple signatures","clinical applications","clinical laboratory","clinical diagnostics","improved assay design","primer-probe combinations","new sequence data","Choice of primer","old assays","higher sensitivity","quality","available public sequence data","low sensitivities","leading technique","recent literature","revised methodology","number of true positive","accurate diagnosis","nucleic acid detection","BLAST search","NCBI taxonomy tree","quantification","BACKGROUND","adoption","capacity","approach","efficiency","great value","potential","CONCLUSION","sequenced strains","standard protocol","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

RECENT FINDINGS: Increased understanding of the role of pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors in recruiting and directing the immune system has increased the variety of adjuvant formulations being tested in animal models and humans. Across all vaccine platforms, adjuvant formulations have been shown to enhance desirable immune responses such as higher antibody titers and increased functional activity. Although no vaccine formulation has yet succeeded in eliciting broad neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1, the ability of adjuvants to direct the immune response to immunogens suggests they will be critically important in any successful HIV-1 vaccine. SUMMARY: The parallel development of adjuvants along with better HIV-1 immunogens will be needed for a successful AIDS vaccine. Additional comparative testing will be required to determine the optimal adjuvant and immunogen regimen that can elicit antibody responses capable of blocking HIV-1 transmission.","publish_time":"2014-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moody, M.

We sought to characterize the clinical course of COVID-19 among IBD patients and evaluate the association between demographics, clinical characteristics, and immunosuppressant treatments on COVID-19 outcomes. Methods Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (SECURE-IBD) is a large, international registry created to monitor outcomes of IBD patients with confirmed COVID-19. We calculated age-standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and utilized multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with severe COVID-19, defined as intensive care unit admission, ventilator use, and/or death. Results 525 cases from 33 countries were reported (Median age 43 years, 53% men). Thirty-seven patients (7%) had severe COVID-19, 161 (31%) were hospitalized, and 16 patients died (3% case fatality rate). SMRs for IBD patients were 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9-2.6), 1.5 (95% CI 0.7-2.2), and 1.7 (95% CI 0.9-2.5) relative to data from China, Italy, and the US, respectively. Risk factors for severe COVID-19 among IBD patients included increasing age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.02), \u22652 comorbidities (aOR 2.9, 95% CI 1.1-7.8), systemic corticosteroids (aOR 6.9, 95% CI 2.3-20.5), and sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylate use (aOR 3.1, 95% CI 1.3-7.7). TNF antagonist treatment was not associated with severe COVID-19 (aOR 0.9, 95% CI 0.4-2.2). Conclusions Increasing age, comorbidities, and corticosteroids are associated with severe COVID-19 among IBD patients, although a causal relationship cannot be definitively established.

The interplay of meteorological factors during an actual influenza epidemic is less clear, and research into the contribution of wind to epidemic spread is scarce. By applying geostatistics and survival analysis to data from a large outbreak of equine influenza (A/H3N8), we quantified the association between hazard of infection and air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and wind velocity, whilst controlling for premises-level covariates. The pattern of disease spread in space and time was described using extraction mapping and instantaneous hazard curves. Meteorological conditions at each premises location were estimated by kriging daily meteorological data and analysed as time-lagged time-varying predictors using generalised Cox regression. Meteorological covariates time-lagged by three days were strongly associated with hazard of influenza infection, corresponding closely with the incubation period of equine influenza. Hazard of equine influenza infection was higher when relative humidity was \u003C60% and lowest on days when daily maximum air temperature was 20\u201325\u00B0C. Wind speeds \u003E30 km hour(\u22121) from the direction of nearby infected premises were associated with increased hazard of infection. Through combining detailed influenza outbreak and meteorological data, we provide empirical evidence for the underlying environmental mechanisms that influenced the local spread of an outbreak of influenza A. Our analysis supports, and extends, the findings of studies into influenza A transmission conducted under laboratory conditions. The relationships described are of direct importance for managing disease risk during influenza outbreaks in horses, and more generally, advance our understanding of the transmission of influenza A viruses under field conditions.","publish_time":"2012-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Firestone, Simon M.; Cogger, Naomi; Ward, Michael P.; Toribio, Jenny-Ann L.

Numeracy encompasses the ways in which people cope with the mathematical, quantitative, and statistical demands of adult life, and is viewed as an important outcome of schooling and as a foundational skill for all adults. The focus on vulnerability stems from the realization that concerns of policy makers and educators alike often center on populations seen as vulnerable. The paper is organized in five sections. After a brief introduction, Section 2 examines adult numeracy, focusing on five numeracy domains (health, financial, digital, civic, and workplace numeracy), literacy\u2013numeracy linkages, functional and critical aspects of numeracy, and the centrality of numeracy practices, and notes sources of vulnerability for each of these. Section 3 sketches formal, non-formal and informal contexts in which adults learn or develop their numeracy, and examines factors that may be potential sources of vulnerability, including systemic factors and dispositional and affect factors. Section 4 reflects more broadly on the concept of vulnerability, introduces selected aspects of the papers published in this issue of ZDM Mathematics Education, and points to findings regarding adult learners who may be deemed vulnerable. The closing section summarizes conclusions and research directions regarding the intersection of the three core domains. Overall, the paper points to emerging research needs and educational challenges that are relevant to scholars, practitioners, and policy makers interested in developing the numeracy of adults as well as in the mathematics education of younger learners.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gal, Iddo; Grotl\u00FCschen, Anke; Tout, Dave; Kaiser, Gabriele","journal":"ZDM","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ea019e5c43b92016ee89fc1d3f3c80bcbce13930.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131969.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11858-020-01155-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292526/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsyMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZDM Mathematics Education"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["adult numeracy","numeracy of adults","numeracy domains","numeracy linkages","workplace numeracy","critical aspects of numeracy","centrality of numeracy practices","adult education","adult learners","vulnerability stems","concept of vulnerability","notes sources of vulnerability","potential sources of vulnerability","paper points","closing section","intersection","selected aspects","systemic factors","mathematics education of younger learners","policy makers","survey paper","statistical demands of adult life","issue of ZDM Mathematics Education","sketches formal","research directions","selected issues","core domains","emerging research needs","educational challenges","scholars","broad scholarly areas","informal contexts","health","conclusions","realization","literacy","findings","practitioners","papers","people","foundational skill","brief introduction","important outcome of schooling","educators","focus","populations","ways","sections"],"language":"en"},

Interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs), a family of small transmembrane proteins, are critical ISG products. Compelling evidence has implicated that IFITMs can establish an innate immune state to eliminate pathogens efficiently. IFITM proteins can impede broad-spectrum viral infection through various mechanisms. It is generally believed that IFITMs can block the viral entry by suppressing viral membrane fusion. However, some findings indicated that IFITMs might also inhibit viral gene expression and viral protein synthesis and thereby impair viral replication. IFITMs may incorporate into virions during viral assembly and thus reduce the infectivity of nascent virions. The precise inhibitory mechanism of IFITMs on viral infection and replication still requires further exploration. In this review, we highlight the recent findings regarding critical roles of IFITMs in host-virus interaction. We also discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying their functions in antiviral responses.","publish_time":"2019-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liao, Yuan; Goraya, Mohsan Ullah; Yuan, Xu; Zhang, Baoge; Chiu, Shih-Hsin; Chen, Ji-Long","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2d7e294cc9cffc5de442aef23ef615f70e3c746.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6532022.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156602/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsyNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ISG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral replication","viral infections","viral entry","viral assembly","broad-spectrum viral infection","viral gene expression","viral protein synthesis","critical roles of IFITMs","viral membrane fusion","precise inhibitory mechanism of IFITMs","host defense","IFITM proteins","host antiviral immunity","family of small transmembrane proteins","Interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins","host-virus interaction","crucial roles","various mechanisms","molecular mechanisms","recent findings","antiviral responses","critical ISG products","infectivity of nascent virions","expression of numerous IFN-stimulated genes","ISGs","functions","innate immune state","IFNs","pathogens","Interferons","review","exploration","Compelling evidence"],"language":"en"},

We observed a total of 124 (25.6%) parasite-positive specimens that contained one or more parasites, including Giardia duodenalis (12.8%), Cryptosporidium spp. (4.9%), Cystoisospora spp. (4.3%), trichomonads (4.3%), Toxocara canis (3.5%), Trichuris vulpis (0.6%), and Dipylidium caninum (0.2%).

GA inhibits promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes in a dose dependent manner at an IC50 value of 34 \u00B1 3.0 \u03BCM and 20 \u00B1 4.2 \u03BCM respectively. GA was non-toxic against THP-1 macrophage host cell line. GA was found to inhibit recombinant Leishmania donovani HMG-CoA reductase (LdHMGR) enzyme at the half-maximum inhibitory concentration of 24 \u00B1 4.3 \u03BCM indicating the sensitivity and specificity of GA towards the enzyme. However, GA could cause only 30% reduction in HMGR activity when measured in Leishmania promastigotes treated with 34 \u03BCM of GA. Interestingly western blot analysis revealed fivefold reduced HMGR expression in GLA treated promastigotes. To further study the mode of action of GA, we used transgenic parasites overexpressing LdHMGR. Results indicated that \u223C2 fold resistance was exhibited by LdHMGR overexpressing promastigotes to GA with an IC50 value of 74 \u03BCM compared to the wild type parasite. This explained the specific binding of GA to LdHMGR enzyme. There was \u223C2 fold depletion in ergosterol levels in wild type promastigotes compared to the HMGR overexpressors. This data was further validated by exogenous supplementation of GA treated cells with ergosterol and 40% reversal of growth inhibition was observed. The results obtained suggested that GA kills the parasite by affecting sterol biosynthetic pathway, especially by inhibiting the L. donovani HMGR and altering ergosterol levels. The finding from the current study shows that GA is a potential antileishmanial chemotherapeutic agent.","publish_time":"2017-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dinesh, Neeradi; Neelagiri, Soumya; Kumar, Vinay; Singh, Sushma","journal":"Experimental Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14a86f296914eeefb4232f547ffafdd538700291.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094550.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28242356/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2017.02.015; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014489417301194; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014489417301194","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsyNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Leishmania"],"organizations":["GA","HMGR","GLA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specificity of GA","\u03BCM of","exogenous supplementation of GA","specific binding of GA","LdHMGR overexpressing promastigotes","Leishmania promastigotes","LdHMGR enzyme","wild type promastigotes","donovani HMGR","HMGR activity","ergosterol levels","HMGR overexpressors","IC50 value","wild type parasite","present study","antileishmanial agent","current study","mode of action","Results","fivefold reduced HMGR expression","fold depletion","fold resistance","potential antileishmanial chemotherapeutic agent","recombinant Leishmania donovani HMG-CoA reductase","western blot analysis","dose dependent manner","THP","glycyrrhizic acid","intracellular amastigotes","main component of Glycyrrhiza glabra","efficacy","half-maximum inhibitory concentration","cells","macrophage host cell line","transgenic parasites","sterol biosynthetic pathway","reversal of growth inhibition","Abstract","reduction","sensitivity","data","finding"],"language":"en"},

We describe here a novel flavivirus inhibition mechanism that results in interferon-mediated obstruction of tick-borne encephalitis virus particle assembly and involves release of malfunctioning membrane-associated capsid (C) particles. This mechanism is controlled by the activity of the interferon-induced protein viperin, a broad-spectrum antiviral interferon-stimulated gene. Through analysis of the viperin-interactome, we identified the Golgi brefeldin A-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1) as the cellular protein targeted by viperin. Viperin-induced antiviral activity, as well as C-particle release, was stimulated by GBF1 inhibition and knockdown and reduced by elevated levels of GBF1. Our results suggest that viperin targets flavivirus virulence by inducing the secretion of unproductive noninfectious virus particles via a GBF1-dependent mechanism. This as-yet-undescribed antiviral mechanism allows potential therapeutic intervention. IMPORTANCE The interferon response can target viral infection on almost every level; however, very little is known about the interference of flavivirus assembly. We show here that interferon, through the action of viperin, can disturb the assembly of tick-borne encephalitis virus. The viperin protein is highly induced after viral infection and exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity. However, the mechanism of action is still elusive and appears to vary between the different viruses, indicating that cellular targets utilized by several viruses might be involved. In this study, we show that viperin induces capsid particle release by interacting and inhibiting the function of the cellular protein Golgi brefeldin A-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1). GBF1 is a key protein in the cellular secretory pathway and is essential in the life cycle of many viruses, also targeted by viperin, implicating GBF1 as a novel putative drug target.","publish_time":"2017-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vonderstein, Kirstin; Nilsson, Emma; Hubel, Philipp; Nyg\u00E5rd Skalman, Lars\u00E5rd; Upadhyay, Arunkumar; Pasto, Jenny; Pichlmair, Andreas; Lundmark, Richard; \u00D6verby, Anna K.","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0330ede445d96dd0a27f474f945d6ce2e7085f15.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5730767.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01751-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29046456/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjszNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viperin protein","interferon-induced protein viperin","action of viperin","viperin-interactome","GBF1 inhibition","GBF1-dependent mechanism","implicating GBF1","viperin targets flavivirus virulence","undescribed antiviral mechanism","mechanism of action","broad-spectrum antiviral activity","cellular protein Golgi brefeldin","key protein","interferon response","broad-spectrum antiviral interferon-stimulated gene","cellular targets","elevated levels of GBF1","novel flavivirus inhibition mechanism","assembly of tick-borne encephalitis virus","C-particle release","capsid particle release","interference of flavivirus assembly","interferon-mediated obstruction of tick-borne encephalitis virus particle assembly","virus replication","viral infection","Efficient antiviral immunity","viral life cycle","resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor","cellular secretory pathway","different viruses","results","secretion of unproductive noninfectious virus particles","release of malfunctioning membrane-associated capsid","novel putative drug target","diverse steps","multiple layers","potential therapeutic intervention","IMPORTANCE","analysis","study"],"language":"en"},

The model is thereafter parametrized with respect to the highly virulent Schu S4 strain of Francisella tularensis, in the first such study to consider a biologically plausible mathematical model for early human infection with this bacterium.

The distribution of incubation periods is right-skewed up to about 100 organisms and symmetric for larger doses. Moreover, there are some interesting parallels to the hypotheses of some of the classical dose\u2013response models, such as independent action (single-hit model) and individual effective dose (probit model).

On the one hand these inhibitory signals prevent excessive immune mediated pathology but on the other hand they may impair clearance of the pathogen. We studied the influence of the inhibitory CD200-CD200R axis on clearance and pathology in two different virus infection models. We find that lack of CD200R signaling strongly enhances type I interferon (IFN) production and viral clearance and improves the outcome of mouse hepatitis corona virus (MHV) infection, particularly in female mice. MHV clearance is known to be dependent on Toll like receptor 7 (TLR7)-mediated type I IFN production and sex differences in TLR7 responses previously have been reported for humans. We therefore hypothesize that CD200R ligation suppresses TLR7 responses and that release of this inhibition enlarges sex differences in TLR7 signaling. This hypothesis is supported by our findings that in vivo administration of synthetic TLR7 ligand leads to enhanced type I IFN production, particularly in female Cd200(\u2212/\u2212) mice and that CD200R ligation inhibits TLR7 signaling in vitro. In influenza A virus infection we show that viral clearance is determined by sex but not by CD200R signaling. However, absence of CD200R in influenza A virus infection results in enhanced lung neutrophil influx and pathology in females. Thus, CD200-CD200R and sex are host factors that together determine the outcome of viral infection. Our data predict a sex bias in both beneficial and pathological immune responses to virus infection upon therapeutic targeting of CD200-CD200R.","publish_time":"2012-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karnam, Guruswamy; Rygiel, Tomasz P.; Raaben, Matthijs; Grinwis, Guy C.

We analyzed patient characteristics and IMHA management by reoperations after mitral valve surgery. METHODS: We collected medical records from mitral valve patients requiring reoperation due to IMHA. Inclusion criteria: hemoglobin \u003C 100 g/L; positive hemolysis tests and echocardiography results; and exclusion of other hemolysis causes. RESULTS: Data from 25 IMHA cases included 10 (40%) early onset (1.3 (0.3,3.0) months) and 15 (60%) late onset (120 (24,204) months) cases. Early IMHA etiologies included surgical defects (6, 60%), uncontrolled infection (3, 30%) and Bechet\u2019s disease (1, 10%). Late IMHA etiologies included degeneration (13, 87%), new infection (1, 7%) and trauma (1, 7%). There were more mechanical valves (15, 88%) than bio-valves (2, 12%); the main valvular dysfunction was paravalvular leak (16, 64%). IMHA manifestations included jaundice (18, 72%), dark urine (21, 84%), heart failure (16, 64%), acute kidney injury (11, 44%), hepatomegaly (15, 60%), splenomegaly (15, 60%) and pancreatitis (1, 4%). Laboratory results showed decreased hemoglobin (70 \u00B1 14 g/L) and increased bilirubin (72 \u00B1 57 \u03BCmol/L), lactate dehydrogenase (2607 \u00B1 2142 IU/L) and creatinine (136 \u00B1 101 \u03BCmol/L) levels. Creatinine level negatively correlated with hemoglobin level (B = -3.33, S.E. B = 1.31, Exp(B) = 368.15, P = 0.018). Preoperative medications included iron supplements (20, 80%), erythropoietin (16, 64%) and beta-blocker (22, 88%). Two patients died of cardiac causes before reoperation. The other 23 underwent reoperation with long surgical times (aortic cross clamp 124 \u00B1 50 min, cardiopulmonary bypass 182 \u00B1 69 min) and blood transfusions (red blood cells 6 (6, 8) units, plasma 600 (400,800) ml, platelet 1(0,2) units). Postoperative complications included cardiac dysfunction (5, 22%), arrhythmia (10, 43%), sepsis (6, 26%), pulmonary infection (5, 22%), gastrointestinal bleeding (3, 13%), cerebral hemorrhage (2, 9%), chronic renal dysfunction (1, 4%) and surgical hemorrhage (1, 4%). Five (33%) patients died after reoperation from cardiac dysfunction (3, 60%), septic shock (1, 20%) and self-discharge (1, 20%). CONCLUSIONS: IMHA induces severe multi-organ dysfunction, contributing to high mortality. Perioperative management should focus on etiological treatment, organ protection, and blood management.","publish_time":"2020-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jin; Zhang, Hanlin; Fan, Hongyang; Chen, Kang; Zhang, Yuelun; Song, Kaicheng; Ao, Hushan; Yu, Chunhua","journal":"BMC Cardiovasc Disord","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/66b0d4b059ff14a10e2dd12f57ec60de69a444bb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7055100.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7055100/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQ2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IMHA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IMHA management","IMHA cases","IMHA manifestations","Early IMHA etiologies","cardiac dysfunction","Late IMHA etiologies","mitral valve patients","blood management","mitral valve surgery","hemoglobin level","surgical hemorrhage","cardiac causes","main valvular dysfunction","chronic renal dysfunction","severe multi-organ dysfunction","echocardiography results","blood transfusions","Perioperative management","surgical times","surgical defects","Laboratory results","decreased hemoglobin","hemolysis causes","\u03BCmol","Creatinine level","mechanical valves","early onset","pulmonary infection","new infection","uncontrolled infection","units","late onset","months","red blood cells","organ protection","cerebral hemorrhage","bio-valves","positive hemolysis tests","mechanical hemolytic anemia","reoperations","rare catastrophic complication","etiological treatment","medical records","exclusion","aortic cross clamp","BACKGROUND","paravalvular leak","CONCLUSIONS","patient characteristics","degeneration","iron supplements","high mortality","Preoperative medications","lactate dehydrogenase","IU","increased bilirubin","jaundice","Inclusion criteria","Postoperative complications","Data","acute kidney injury","splenomegaly","heart failure","dark urine","erythropoietin","hepatomegaly","sepsis","METHODS","gastrointestinal bleeding","septic shock","arrhythmia","Exp","self-discharge","cardiopulmonary bypass","Bechet\u2019s disease","pancreatitis","beta-blocker","plasma","platelet","levels","trauma"],"language":"en"},

The development and commercialization of the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines illustrate how licensing practices of public research organizations can contribute to high prices of the resulting product and affect accessibility to vulnerable populations. Efforts by the international community to improve access to medicines have recognised this issue and promote the public health-sensitive management of research conducted by public research organizations. This paper explores: how medical knowledge is exchanged between public and private actors; what role inventor scientists play in this process; and how they view the implementation of public health-sensitive knowledge exchange strategies. METHODS: We conducted a systematic qualitative literature review on medical knowledge exchange and qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of public sector scientists working on HPV vaccines. We explored the strategies by which knowledge is exchanged across institutional boundaries, how these strategies are negotiated, and the views of scientists regarding public health-sensitive knowledge exchange. RESULTS: We included 13 studies in the systematic review and conducted seven semi-structured interviews with high-ranking scientists. The main avenues of public-private medical knowledge exchange were publications, formal transfer of patented knowledge, problem-specific exchanges such as service agreements, informal exchanges and collaborative research. Scientists played a crucial role in these processes but appeared to be sceptical of public health-sensitive knowledge exchange strategies, as these were believed to deter corporate interest in the development of new medicines and thus risk the translation of the scientists\u2019 research. CONCLUSION: Medical scientists at public research institutions play a key role in the exchange of knowledge they generate and are concerned about the accessibility of medicines resulting from their research. Their scepticism towards implementing public health-sensitive knowledge management strategies appears to be based on a biased understanding of the costs and risks involved in drug development and a perceived lack of alternatives to private engagement. Scientists could be encouraged to exchange knowledge in a public health-sensitive manner through not-for-profit drug development mechanisms, education on industry engagement, and stronger institutional and legal backing.","publish_time":"2020-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jahn, Rosa; M\u00FCller, Olaf; N\u00F6st, Stefan; Bozorgmehr, Kayvan","journal":"Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4a3f911f8e68bc3aecf6117f10d2e7f3ebde2b6d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7059709.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7059709/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQ3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["exchange of knowledge","public research institutions","public health-sensitive knowledge management strategies","public health-sensitive management of research","sceptical of public health-sensitive knowledge exchange strategies","implementation of public health-sensitive knowledge exchange strategies","public health-sensitive manner","private medical knowledge exchange","Medical scientists","licensing practices of public research organizations","main avenues of public","purposive sample of public sector scientists","collaborative research","scientists\u2019 research","role inventor scientists","high-ranking scientists","views of scientists","formal transfer of patented knowledge","crucial role","development of new medicines","accessibility of medicines","private engagement","key role","qualitative interviews","not-for-profit drug development mechanisms","industry engagement","systematic review","private actors","HPV vaccines","systematic qualitative literature review","industry partners","informal exchanges","resulting product","institutional boundaries","problem-specific exchanges","semi-structured interviews","publications","service agreements","education","interactions","perceived lack of alternatives","high prices","costs","risks","Human Papillomavirus","international community","commercialization","translation","issue","CONCLUSION","vulnerable populations","legal backing","biased understanding","studies","processes","BACKGROUND","scepticism","Efforts","METHODS","paper","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Of all species, pigs are likely to constitute a greater share of the growth in the livestock subsector. However, constraints such as respiratory infectious diseases cause significant economic losses to the pig industry worldwide. Compared to industrialized countries, the occurrence and impacts of respiratory diseases on pig production in Africa is under-documented. Hence, knowledge on prevalence and incidence of economically important swine respiratory pathogens in pigs in Africa is necessary to guide interventions for prevention and control. The purpose of this review was to document the current status of research on five important respiratory pathogens of swine in Africa to inform future research and interventions. The pathogens included were porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PPRSv), porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyopneumoniae), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP) and swine influenza A viruses (IAV). For this review, published articles were obtained using Harzing\u2019s Publish or Perish software tool from GoogleScholar. Articles were also sourced from PubMed, ScienceDirect, FAO and OIE websites. The terms used for the search were Africa, swine or porcine, respiratory pathogens, M. hyopneumoniae, APP, PCV2, PPRSv, IAV, prevention and control. In all, 146 articles found were considered relevant, and upon further screening, only 85 articles were retained for the review. The search was limited to studies published from 2000 to 2019. Of all the studies that documented occurrence of the five respiratory pathogens, most were on IAV (48.4%, n = 15), followed by PCV2 (25.8%, n = 8), PPRSv (19.4%, n = 6), while only one study (3.2%, n = 1) reported APP and M. hyopneumoniae.

Among high risk occupations, leptospirosis includes workers in agriculture and domestic animal industries. Environmental hygiene in the wet market has established a link between the presence of rodents with probability of leptospirosis infection. This study was aimed to compare the level of knowledge, attitude and preventive practice against leptospirosis between healthy Malaysian and non-Malaysian wet market workers in selected wet markets in urban areas of Selangor. A cross-sectional study in the determined area was conducted with the participation of 147 respondents. The respondents were randomly chosen from the list provided by the state agency that regulates these markets. A self-administered bilingual validated questionnaire (English and Bahasa Melayu) was distributed to the selected respondents. There were 68 (48.3%) Malaysian respondents and 79 (53.7%) non-Malaysian respondents. The majority of them were males, who attained formal education and were less than 40 years old. Meanwhile, the respondents earned less than RM3000. Among the Malaysian respondents, 80.9% were aware of leptospirosis as compared to 17.7% of the non-Malaysian colleagues (p \u003C 0.05). All items of knowledge showed that the Malaysian respondents scored higher as compared to non-Malaysian respondents. On attitude towards infection prevention, most Malaysian respondents had a positive attitude, while most non-Malaysian respondents had undecided perception on the majority of crucial attitude items. In practicing preventive measures, there was a marked significant difference in proportion between Malaysian and non-Malaysian respondents for items on \u201CSpecific Protection and Isolation at Source.\u201D There was a significant gap on knowledge, attitude and preventive practice among Malaysian workers as compared to non-Malaysian workers. Therefore, it was highly recommended the health promotion implementation should also provide specific focus on non-Malaysian workers.","publish_time":"2020-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Samsudin, Suhailah; Saudi, Sakinah N.S.; Masri, Norbaya S.; Ithnin, Nur Raihana; T.Z.M.T, Jamaluddin; Hamat, Rukman A.; Wan Mohd, Zahiruddin W.M.; Nazri, Mohd S.; Surianti, Sukeri; Daud, Aziah B.; Abdullah, Munirah N.; Noramira, Nozmi; Osman, Malina","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2dd5fd551f2dc371079986226dd78f9fa5f628fc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7068448.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7068448/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzUwMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-Malaysian respondents","non-Malaysian workers","non-Malaysian colleagues","selected respondents","non-Malaysian wet market workers","positive attitude","items of knowledge","aware of leptospirosis","majority of crucial attitude items","probability of leptospirosis infection","preventive practice","selected wet markets","preventive measures","level of knowledge","specific focus","Specific Protection","significant gap","infection prevention","cross-sectional study","marked significant difference","proportion","undecided perception","English","agriculture","self-administered bilingual validated questionnaire","Bahasa Melayu","urban areas of Selangor","presence of rodents","domestic animal industries","high risk occupations","determined area","Isolation","link","health promotion implementation","males","state agency","Source","endemic","Environmental hygiene","list","participation","formal education","tropical countries","years old","RM3000"],"language":"en"},

This species is also a nuisance due to overwintering in human-made structures. It has caused significant agricultural losses in recent years along the Atlantic seaboard of North America and in continental Europe. Genomic resources will assist with determining the molecular basis for this species\u2019 feeding and habitat traits, defining potential targets for pest management strategies. RESULTS: Analysis of the 1.15-Gb draft genome assembly has identified a wide variety of genetic elements underpinning the biological characteristics of this formidable pest species, encompassing the roles of sensory functions, digestion, immunity, detoxification and development, all of which likely support H. halys\u2019 capacity for invasiveness. Many of the genes identified herein have potential for biomolecular pesticide applications. CONCLUSIONS: Availability of the H. halys genome sequence will be useful for the development of environmentally friendly biomolecular pesticides to be applied in concert with more traditional, synthetic chemical-based controls.","publish_time":"2020-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sparks, Michael E.; Bansal, Raman; Benoit, Joshua B.; Blackburn, Michael B.; Chao, Hsu; Chen, Mengyao; Cheng, Sammy; Childers, Christopher; Dinh, Huyen; Doddapaneni, Harsha Vardhan; Dugan, Shannon; Elpidina, Elena N.; Farrow, David W.; Friedrich, Markus; Gibbs, Richard A.; Hall, Brantley; Han, Yi; Hardy, Richard W.; Holmes, Christopher J.; Hughes, Daniel S.

SVT is typically based on fluorescence imaging and reveals insights into previously unreported infection mechanisms. In this review article, we provide the readers a broad overview of the SVT technique. We first summarize recent advances in SVT, from the choice of fluorescent labels and labeling strategies to imaging implementation and analytical methodologies. We then describe representative applications in detail to elucidate how SVT serves as a valuable tool in virological research.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2010 to January 2014, a total of 350 patients, who required the use of large amounts of hormones, were enrolled into the study. These patients were followed up every three months after starting the hormone therapy. A total of 62 cases were screened, among which nine cases were asymptomatic. Furthermore, 38 patients were diagnosed as stage I and were given low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and vasodilator drugs. Moreover, 22 cases were diagnosed as stage IIa/b and underwent core decompression. In addition, two cases were diagnosed as stage IIc and underwent pedicled bone transplantation. During the follow-up period, ARCO staging was used for radiological evaluation, the HHS score was applied to evaluate for clinical efficacy, and SPSS 22.0 statistical software was used for the data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients were followed up for 24 months. Among these patients, 38 patients were diagnosed with ARCO stage I and underwent systematic therapy. No progress was found in 29 cases (76.3%). Furthermore, three cases progressed to stage IIb (7.8%), four cases progressed to stage IIc (10.5%), two cases progressed to stage III and IV, respectively (2.6%), and 16 cases (80%) did not progress after core decompression. In the 16 cases at stage IIa and four cases at stage IIb, and four cases (20%) progressed in stage III. The HHS score of stage I was 80.42 \u00B1 3.25 before follow-up, while the HHS score was 86.46 \u00B1 8.54 after follow-up, and the difference was statistically significant (P \u003C 0.05). Furthermore, the HHS score of patients with stage IIa/b was 70.38 \u00B1 4.62 before follow-up, while the HHS score was 80.28 \u00B1 6.72 after follow-up, and the difference was statistically significant (P \u003C 0.01). CONCLUSION: MRI remains as the most effective method for the non-invasive diagnosis of osteonecrosis, at present. Enhanced MRI may be able to detect early osteonecrosis, but further research is needed. Drug treatment and core decompression can achieve satisfactory results at the early stage.","publish_time":"2018-06-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fu, Weimin; Liu, Baoyi; Wang, Benjie; Zhao, Dewei","journal":"Int Orthop","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/21ef02ca4f5f19109724ed482d96fae7ab252845.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7079928.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079928/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzU5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARCO","HHS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cases","stage IIa","early stage","HHS score of stage","ARCO stage","stage IIc","stage IIb","HHS score of patients","early osteonecrosis","core decompression","follow-up period","total","early diagnosis","induced osteonecrosis","non-invasive diagnosis of osteonecrosis","difference","study","months","progress","treatment of steroid","ARCO staging","satisfactory results","Drug treatment","Enhanced MRI","systematic therapy","hormone therapy","LMWH","statistical software","low-molecular weight heparin","radiological evaluation","effective method","SPSS","clinical efficacy","pedicled bone transplantation","vasodilator drugs","use of large amounts of hormones","femoral head","present","data analysis","research","OBJECTIVE","CONCLUSION","METHODS","addition"],"language":"en"},

We describe Uganda\u2019s experience in EVD preparedness. RESULTS: On 4 August 2018, the Uganda Ministry of Health (MoH) activated the Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC) and the National Task Force (NTF) for public health emergencies to plan, guide, and coordinate EVD preparedness in the country. The NTF selected an Incident Management Team (IMT), constituting a National Rapid Response Team (NRRT) that supported activation of the District Task Forces (DTFs) and District Rapid Response Teams (DRRTs) that jointly assessed levels of preparedness in 30 designated high-risk districts representing category 1 (20 districts) and category 2 (10 districts). The MoH, with technical guidance from the World Health Organisation (WHO), led EVD preparedness activities and worked together with other ministries and partner organisations to enhance community-based surveillance systems, develop and disseminate risk communication messages, engage communities, reinforce EVD screening and infection prevention measures at Points of Entry (PoEs) and in high-risk health facilities, construct and equip EVD isolation and treatment units, and establish coordination and procurement mechanisms. CONCLUSION: As of 31 May 2019, there was no confirmed case of EVD as Uganda has continued to make significant and verifiable progress in EVD preparedness. There is a need to sustain these efforts, not only in EVD preparedness but also across the entire spectrum of a multi-hazard framework. These efforts strengthen country capacity and compel the country to avail resources for preparedness and management of incidents at the source while effectively cutting costs of using a \u201Cfire-fighting\u201D approach during public health emergencies.","publish_time":"2020-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aceng, Jane Ruth; Ario, Alex R.; Muruta, Allan N.; Makumbi, Issa; Nanyunja, Miriam; Komakech, Innocent; Bakainaga, Andrew N.; Talisuna, Ambrose O.; Mwesigye, Collins; Mpairwe, Allan M.; Tusiime, Jayne B.; Lali, William Z.; Katushabe, Edson; Ocom, Felix; Kaggwa, Mugagga; Bongomin, Bodo; Kasule, Hafisa; Mwoga, Joseph N.; Sensasi, Benjamin; Mwebembezi, Edmund; Katureebe, Charles; Sentumbwe, Olive; Nalwadda, Rita; Mbaka, Paul; Fatunmbi, Bayo S.; Nakiire, Lydia; Lamorde, Mohammed; Walwema, Richard; Kambugu, Andrew; Nanyondo, Judith; Okware, Solome; Ahabwe, Peter B.; Nabukenya, Immaculate; Kayiwa, Joshua; Wetaka, Milton M.; Kyazze, Simon; Kwesiga, Benon; Kadobera, Daniel; Bulage, Lilian; Nanziri, Carol; Monje, Fred; Aliddeki, Dativa M.; Ntono, Vivian; Gonahasa, Doreen; Nabatanzi, Sandra; Nsereko, Godfrey; Nakinsige, Anne; Mabumba, Eldard; Lubwama, Bernard; Sekamatte, Musa; Kibuule, Michael; Muwanguzi, David; Amone, Jackson; Upenytho, George D.; Driwale, Alfred; Seru, Morries; Sebisubi, Fred; Akello, Harriet; Kabanda, Richard; Mutengeki, David K.; Bakyaita, Tabley; Serwanjja, Vivian N.; Okwi, Richard; Okiria, Jude; Ainebyoona, Emmanuel; Opar, Bernard T.; Mimbe, Derrick; Kyabaggu, Denis; Ayebazibwe, Chrisostom; Sentumbwe, Juliet; Mwanja, Moses; Ndumu, Deo B.; Bwogi, Josephine; Balinandi, Stephen; Nyakarahuka, Luke; Tumusiime, Alex; Kyondo, Jackson; Mulei, Sophia; Lutwama, Julius; Kaleebu, Pontiano; Kagirita, Atek; Nabadda, Susan; Oumo, Peter; Lukwago, Robinah; Kasozi, Julius; Masylukov, Oleh; Kyobe, Henry Bosa; Berdaga, Viorica; Lwanga, Miriam; Opio, Joe C.; Matseketse, David; Eyul, James; Oteba, Martin O.; Bukirwa, Hasifa; Bulya, Nulu; Masiira, Ben; Kihembo, Christine; Ohuabunwo, Chima; Antara, Simon N.; Owembabazi, Wilberforce; Okot, Paul B.; Okwera, Josephine; Amoros, Isabelle; Kajja, Victoria; Mukunda, Basnet S.; Sorela, Isabel; Adams, Gregory; Shoemaker, Trevor; Klena, John D.; Taboy, Celine H.; Ward, Sarah E.; Merrill, Rebecca D.; Carter, Rosalind J.; Harris, Julie R.; Banage, Flora; Nsibambi, Thomas; Ojwang, Joseph; Kasule, Juliet N.; Stowell, Dan F.; Brown, Vance R.; Zhu, Bao-Ping; Homsy, Jaco; Nelson, Lisa J.; Tusiime, Patrick K.; Olaro, Charles; Mwebesa, Henry G.; Woldemariam, Yonas Tegegn","journal":"Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8f63367619e3280ad2bdfd4a90a819f169ead2a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7081536.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7081536/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzY5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["10th Ebola Virus Disease","DRC","EVD","Uganda Ministry of Health","National Task Force","NTF","Incident Management Team","National Rapid Response Team","the District Task Forces","World Health Organisation"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EVD preparedness activities","EVD screening","EVD isolation","preparedness efforts","confirmed EVD outbreak","confirmed case of EVD","levels of preparedness","public health emergencies","EVD cross-border transmission","high-risk health facilities","Uganda Ministry of Health","World Health Organisation","country capacity","Public Health Emergency Operations Centre","National Rapid Response Team","District Rapid Response Teams","NTF","MoH","designated high-risk districts","category","District Task Forces","National Task Force","Incident Management Team","management of incidents","PHEOC","DTFs","infection prevention measures","Points of Entry","communities","PoEs","construct","timely detection","entire spectrum","community-based surveillance systems","Ebola Virus Disease","investigation","treatment units","activation","technical guidance","DRRTs","IMT","NRRT","guide","partner organisations","risk communication messages","coordination","ministries","declaration","multi-hazard framework","fighting","approach","verifiable progress","resources","DRC","Uganda\u2019s experience","procurement mechanisms","neighboring countries","costs","BACKGROUND","need","RESULTS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Although an urgent need exists to develop drugs that inhibit betanodavirus infection, there have been no reports about anti-betanodavirus drugs. Recently, it was reported that betanodaviruses were detected in the endosomes of infected cells, suggesting that betanodaviruses enter fish cells by endocytosis. This finding prompted us to examine whether blocking this endosomal pathway could provide a target for antiviral drug development. In this study, we examined the inhibitory effect of several lysosomotropic agents against betanodavirus infection in fish E-11 cells. The presence of 1 mM NH(4)Cl or 1 \u00B5M chloroquine in the medium inhibited the entry of betanodaviruses into cells and inhibited viral infection. The lysosomotropic agents bafilomycin A1 and monensin also inhibited virus-induced cytopathology and virus production.

This virus is prevalent in herds throughout the world and continues to pose a significant threat as newer and more virulent disease phenotypes emerge. In this report we describe the full-length nucleotide sequence of a Canadian PRRSV isolate, designated PA8. A consecutive sequence of 15,411 nucleotides was obtained from a set of overlapping cDNA clones. In order to determine the extent of genetic variation among isolates recovered from swine in Canada and the US, as well as to understand the molecular mechanisms governing the evolution of PRRSV, the full-length sequence of PA8 was compared with that of two US isolates, VR2332 and 16244B. The genomic sequence of PA8 shared 98.2% and 99.2% identity with 16244B and VR2332, respectively. The untranslated regions (UTR) at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the genome were very well conserved. Notable exceptions include an eight nucleotide difference at the 5\u2032 end of the 5\u2032 UTR of VR2332 relative to PA8 and 16244B and a two nucleotide difference in the 3\u2032 UTR of PA8 relative to VR2332 and 16244B. In contrast to PA8 and VR2332, 16244B possessed two nucleotide differences within the RNA pseudoknot structure of the ribosomal frameshift region between open reading frame (ORF)1a and ORF1b. Amino acid differences were distributed throughout the genome, however they appeared to be most extensive in Nsp1\u03B2 and ORF5 of the nonstructural and structural coding regions, respectively, suggesting that the evolutionary pressure to conserve these viral genes is somewhat lower.","publish_time":"2014-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wootton, S.; Yoo, D.; Rogan, D.","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d32b47a1d9eb26e23360b4d5a5654d12dda74737.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086845/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozc2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["full-length sequence of PA8","UTR of PA8 relative","genomic sequence of PA8","designated PA8","full-length nucleotide sequence","UTR of VR2332 relative","nucleotide differences","consecutive sequence","evolution of PRRSV","swine","US isolates","genome","Canadian PRRSV isolate","untranslated regions","respiratory syndrome virus","structural coding regions","Amino acid differences","ribosomal frameshift region","RNA pseudoknot structure","open reading frame","ORF5","extent of genetic variation","viral genes","virulent disease phenotypes","significant threat","important pathogens","set of overlapping cDNA clones","world","evolutionary pressure","Nsp1\u03B2","herds","molecular mechanisms","nucleotides","Notable exceptions","Canada","end","report","order","identity","contrast","ORF1b"],"language":"en"},

To test the effect of differentiation and activation on their susceptibility, AM\u03C6 and BMo were aged, cultivated in either adhesion or suspension and treated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). It was found that freshly isolated PM\u03C6 and BMo were non-permissive to PRRSV. PM\u03C6 remained refractory but a few BMo became susceptible after 1 day cultivation. AM\u03C6 were permissive with a significant increase of their susceptibility after one day cultivation. In a binding assay, it was demonstrated that the attachment of biotinylated PRRSV to AMf is much more efficient than to PM\u03C6 and BMo. Two monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) 41D3 and 41D5 which block PRRSV infection of AM\u03C6 and are directed against a candidate receptor for PRRSV only reacted with the cell membrane of AM\u03C6. PMA treatment of AM\u03C6 blocked PRRSV replication in the cells in a dose-dependent manner. The blocking effect of PMA decreased after 9 h continuous pre-treatment and diminished after 24 h continuous pre-treatment. PMA treatment did not affect the binding of PRRSV and MAb 41D3 and 41D5 to AM\u03C6. Direct or indirect treatment of AM\u03C6 and BMo with LPS or cultivation in suspension did not significantly affect their susceptibility. These results provide clear evidence that PRRSV has a strongly restricted tropism for only some sub-populations of porcine monocytes/macrophages and that some specific states of differentiation and activation of monocytes/macrophages considerably affect their susceptibility.","publish_time":"2014-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Duan, X.; Nauwynck, H.

Ten sets of new textiles (pillow cases, bed sheets, duvet cover, and patient clothing) used by patients in the two single-bed rooms were provided by the sponsors. In the room S-20, the 10 sets of new textiles were washed with Bio-Kil; the room walls, ceiling, and air-conditioning filters were treated with Bio-Kil; and the surfaces of instruments (respirator, telephone, and computer) were covered with Bio-Kil-embedded silicon pads. Room S-19 served as the control. We compared the bacterial count on textiles and environment surfaces as well as air samples between the two rooms. A total of 1,364 samples from 22 different sites in each room were collected. The mean bacterial count on textiles and environmental surfaces in room S-20 was significantly lower than that in room S-19 (10.4 vs 49.6 colony-forming units [CFU]/100 cm(2); P \u003C 0.001).

At the same time, the I7L proteinase exemplifies several interesting challenges from the rational drug design perspective. In the absence of a published I7L X-ray structure, we have built a detailed 3D model of the I7L ligand binding site (S2\u2013S2\u2032 pocket) based on exceptionally high structural conservation of this site in proteases of the ULP family. The accuracy and limitations of this model were assessed through comparative analysis of available X-ray structures of ULPs, as well as energy based conformational modeling. The 3D model of the I7L ligand binding site was used to perform covalent docking and VLS of a comprehensive library of about 230,000 available ketone and aldehyde compounds. Out of 456 predicted ligands, 97 inhibitors of I7L proteinase activity were confirmed in biochemical assays (\u223C20% overall hit rate). These experimental results both validate our I7L ligand binding model and provide initial leads for rational optimization of poxvirus I7L proteinase inhibitors. Thus, fragments predicted to bind in the prime portion of the active site can be combined with fragments on non-prime side to yield compounds with improved activity and specificity.","publish_time":"2007-10-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Katritch, Vsevolod; Byrd, Chelsea M.; Tseitin, Vladimir; Dai, Dongcheng; Raush, Eugene; Totrov, Maxim; Abagyan, Ruben; Jordan, Robert; Hruby, Dennis E.","journal":"J Comput Aided Mol Des","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e6dc4220330dc4299ea6cb20dead9670fc24897.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087885.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087885/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzkyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ULP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["I7L ligand binding site","I7L ligand binding model","inhibitors of I7L proteinase activity","rational optimization of poxvirus I7L proteinase inhibitors","published I7L X-ray structure","D model","vaccinia virus I7L ubiquitin","active site","S2","fragments","available ketone","improved activity","aldehyde compounds","prime portion","ULP family","predicted ligands","comparative analysis of available X-ray structures of ULPs","rational drug design perspective","initial leads","poxviridae","interesting challenges","attractive target","comprehensive library","covalent docking","proteases","pocket","biochemical assays","development of smallpox antiviral drugs","high structural conservation","viral replication","VLS","absence","experimental results","energy","overall hit rate","specificity","conformational modeling","accuracy","limitations","time"],"language":"en"},

It has been 10 years since China implemented its new web-based infection surveillance system, which covers the largest population in the world. Methods In this study, time series data were collected for 28 infectious diseases reported from 2005 to 2014 . Seasonality and long-term trends were explored using decomposition methods. Seasonality was expressed by calculating the seasonal indices. Long-term trends in the diseases were assessed using a linear regression model on the deseasonalized series. Results During the 10-year period, 38 982 567 cases and 126 372 deaths were reported in the system. The proportion of deaths caused by AIDS increased from 12% in 2005 to 78% in 2014. There were six diseases for which the seasonal index range was greater than 2: dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, leptospirosis, anthrax, cerebrospinal meningitis, and measles . Among the 28 diseases, the incidence of syphilis increased fastest, with an average increase of 0.018626/100 000 every month after adjustment for seasonality. Conclusions Effective surveillance is helpful in gaining a better understanding of the infection behaviour of infectious diseases; this will greatly facilitate disease control and management.","publish_time":"2016-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Xingyu; Hou, Fengsu; Li, Xiaosong; Zhou, Lijun; Liu, Yuanyuan; Zhang, Tao","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2bb3b606e583496a278d710b37da6b0d781ea805.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110548.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2016.04.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971216310232; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971216310232; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27094249/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs1MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["surveillance of infection","Seasonality","infection behaviour of infectious diseases","disease control","long-term trends","new web-based infection surveillance system","Conclusions Effective surveillance","deseasonalized series","decomposition methods","proportion of deaths","seasonal indices","public health management","time series data","seasonal index range","leptospirosis","anthrax","dengue fever","Japanese encephalitis","better understanding","linear regression model","cerebrospinal meningitis","China","month","study","year period","largest population","average increase","measles","years","cases","adjustment","Summary Background","incidence of syphilis","Results","world","AIDS"],"language":"en"},

I also analyze responses to a further general attitudinal measure regarding whether the situation in the respondent\u0027s country is getting worse. Responses to all these unhappiness questions show a, ceteris paribus, hill shape in age, with controls and many also do so with limited controls for time and country. Unhappiness is hill-shaped in age and the average age where the maximum occurs is 49 with or without controls. There is an unhappiness curve.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blanchflower, David G.","journal":"J Econ Behav Organ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/87f3424e174af548f4fcf288f59a23c41e1b910a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7188662.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32351257/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268120301414?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167268120301414; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2020.04.022","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs1OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["unhappiness questions","unhappiness curve","average age","strain","different individual characterizations of unhappiness","responses","limited controls","European countries","hill shape","respondent\u0027s country","well-being data files","worry","anxiety","loneliness","depression","pain","stress","sadness","good mental health days","ceteris paribus","bad nerves","panic","phobias","situation","United States","general attitudinal measure","respondents","restless sleep","Gallup World Poll","confidence","time","relationship","difficulties","maximum","worthless person","failure"],"language":"en"},

EV-D68 is now recognized as a re-emerging pathogen; however, due to lack of a permissive animal model for EV-D68, a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis and immune response against EV-D68 has been hampered. Recently, it was shown that EV-D68 has a strong affinity for \u03B12,6-linked sialic acids (SAs) and we have shown previously that \u03B12,6-linked SAs are abundantly present in the respiratory tract of cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus). Thus, we hypothesized that cotton rats could be a potential model for EV-D68 infection. Here, we evaluated the ability of two recently isolated EV-D68 strains (VANBT/1 and MO/14/49), along with the historical prototype Fermon strain (ATCC), to infect cotton rats. We found that cotton rats are permissive to EV-D68 infection without virus adaptation. The different strains of EV-D68 showed variable infection profiles and the ability to produce neutralizing antibody (NA) upon intranasal infection or intramuscular immunization. Infection with the VANBT/1 resulted in significant induction of pulmonary cytokine gene expression and lung pathology. Intramuscular immunization with live VANBT/1 or MO/14/49 induced strong homologous antibody responses, but a moderate heterologous NA response. We showed that passive prophylactic administration of serum with high content of NA against VANBT/1 resulted in an efficient antiviral therapy. VANBT/1-immunized animals showed complete protection from VANBT/1 challenge, but induced strong pulmonary Th1 and Th2 cytokine responses and enhanced lung pathology, indicating the generation of exacerbated immune response by immunization. In conclusion, our data illustrate that the cotton rat is a powerful animal model that provides an experimental platform to investigate pathogenesis, immune response, anti-viral therapies and vaccines against EV-D68 infection.","publish_time":"2016-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patel, Mira C.; Wang, Wei; Pletneva, Lioubov M.; Rajagopala, Seesandra V.; Tan, Yi; Hartert, Tina V.; Boukhvalova, Marina S.; Vogel, Stefanie N.; Das, Suman R.; Blanco, Jorge C.

Fecal samples were randomly collected between July 2010 and September 2011 from 968 calves (7\u201321 days old) on 97 farms. Up to 10 calves were selected and sampled per farm, and feces examined for oocysts by microscopy. C. parvum oocyst shedding was scored semi-quantitatively (0\u20135). A questionnaire about calf-level care and management was completed, and mortality rates were obtained from the French national registration database (BDNI). Bivariable and multivariable analyses of potential risk factors for C. parvum oocyst shedding were conducted using generalized estimating equation (GEE) models (family = Binomial).Overall, 402 out of 968 calves (41.5%) were positive for oocysts, and 25.1% of animals had a shedding score \u003E2. Seven of the 97 farms (7%) were negative for oocysts in all fecal samples. At the time of collection, 375 calves (39%) had diarrhea, and its prevalence strongly correlated with the score for C. parvum oocyst shedding (p \u003C 0.0001). The mortality rate at 90 days was significantly greater for calves with high combined scores of diarrhea and shedding. Factors associated with the shedding of C. parvum were the Normande breed (odds ratio = 1.49; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93\u20132.37), dispensing of colostrum using a bucket (odds ratio = 1.37; 95% CI: 1.00\u20131.89), treatment with halofuginone (odds ratio = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.19\u20131.15) and feeding with fermented milk (odds ratio = 0.32; 95% CI: 0.17\u20130.63). C. parvum is widespread among calves under 21 days old in dairy herds of western France. Shedding of C. parvum is associated with a high incidence of diarrhea and increased risk of mortality in young calves. This study identified some associated calf-level factors, although further investigations are necessary to determine appropriate measures that farmers and veterinary practitioners should take to reduce the prevalence of C. parvum.","publish_time":"2015-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Delafosse, A.; Chartier, C.; Dupuy, M.C.; Dumoulin, M.; Pors, I.; Paraud, C.","journal":"Prev Vet Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad269b34264404569e42f8802840eeef8149431e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172863.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2015.01.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25623968/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587715000203; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587715000203","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs2NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Normandy"],"keyphrases":["shedding of","parvum oocyst shedding","shedding score","odds ratio","young calves","associated calf-level factors","prevalence of","oocysts","days old","dairy farms","increased risk of mortality","calf neonates","multivariable analyses of potential risk factors","calf-level care","high incidence of diarrhea","mortality rates","study","Fecal samples","high combined scores of diarrhea","dairy herds of western France","Cryptosporidium infection","generalized estimating equation","appropriate measures","GEE","models","family","farmers","investigations","management","French national registration database","veterinary practitioners","Normande breed","BDNI","Binomial","Bivariable","Normandy","feces","questionnaire","colostrum","bucket","treatment","halofuginone","fermented milk","animals","confidence interval","microscopy","time of collection"],"language":"en"},

In this study we demonstrate the ability of small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated RNA interference (RNAi) to inhibit the replication of virulent FCoV strain FIPV WSU 79-1146 in an immortalised feline cell line. A panel of eight synthetic siRNAs targeting four different regions of the FCoV genome were tested for antiviral effects. Efficacy was determined by qRT-PCR of intracellular viral genomic and messenger RNA, TCID50 infectivity assay of extracellular virus, and direct IFA for viral protein expression. All siRNAs demonstrated an inhibitory effect on viral replication in vitro. The two most effective siRNAs, targeting the untranslated 5\u2032 leader sequence (L2) and the nucleocapsid gene (N1), resulted in a \u003E95% reduction in extracellular viral titre. Further characterisation of these two siRNAs demonstrated their efficacy when used at low concentrations and in cells challenged with high viral loads. Taken together these findings provide important information for the potential therapeutic application of RNAi in treating FIP.","publish_time":"2011-06-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"McDonagh, Phillip; Sheehy, Paul A.; Norris, Jacqueline M.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a0bbb306cddc7201b312cba0ab8181e971e7b6e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117188.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113511000423; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.01.023; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113511000423; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21367541/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs2ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral replication","effective siRNAs","extracellular viral titre","synthetic siRNAs","viral protein expression","high viral loads","messenger RNA","RNA interference","FCoV genome","Efficacy","virulent biotypes of feline coronavirus","replication of virulent FCoV strain FIPV WSU","effective antiviral treatment","ability of small interfering RNA","development of feline infectious peritonitis","immortalised feline cell line","antiviral effects","potential therapeutic application of RNAi","TCID50 infectivity assay of extracellular virus","fatal immune mediated disease","direct IFA","qRT-PCR","L2","important information","cells","different regions","Abstract Infection","inhibitory effect","nucleocapsid gene","leader sequence","low concentrations","findings","reduction","N1","study","panel","characterisation"],"language":"en"},

The disease is characterised by an episodic, typically unilateral, discomfort with pain-free intervals. The discomfort is triggered, in many cases, by mouth movements. The disease is often recurrent and with time may become unremitting \u2013 12% of cases in this series were euthanased as a consequence of the condition. Sensitisation of trigeminal nerve endings as a consequence of oral disease or tooth eruption appears to be an important factor in the aetiology \u2013 63% of cases had a history of oral lesions and at least 16% experienced their first sign of discomfort during eruption of permanent teeth. External factors can also influence the disease as FOPS events could be directly linked to a situation causing anxiety in 20% of cats.

Fear of illness and uncertainty about the future precipitate anxiety- and stress-related disorders, and several groups have rightfully called for the creation and dissemination of robust mental health screening and treatment programs for the general public and front-line healthcare workers. However, in addition to pandemic-associated psychological distress, the direct effects of the virus itself (several acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2), and the subsequent host immunologic response, on the human central nervous system (CNS) and related outcomes are unknown. We discuss currently available evidence of COVID-19 related neuropsychiatric sequelae while drawing parallels to past viral pandemic-related outcomes. Past pandemics have demonstrated that diverse types of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as encephalopathy, mood changes, psychosis, neuromuscular dysfunction, or demyelinating processes, may accompany acute viral infection, or may follow infection by weeks, months, or longer in recovered patients. The potential mechanisms are also discussed, including viral and immunological underpinnings. Therefore, prospective neuropsychiatric monitoring of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 at various points in the life course, as well as their neuroimmune status, are needed to fully understand the long-term impact of COVID-19, and to establish a framework for integrating psychoneuroimmunology into epidemiologic studies of pandemics.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Troyer, Emily A.; Kohn, Jordan N.; Hong, Suzi","journal":"Brain Behav Immun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b49086072cc3911c754a7a3565606d937581878.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152874.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32298803/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088915912030489X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S088915912030489X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs3MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["past viral pandemic-related outcomes","related neuropsychiatric sequelae","acute viral infection","stress-related disorders","SARS-CoV","addition","Past pandemics","long-term impact of COVID","available evidence of COVID","psychological distress","diverse types of neuropsychiatric symptoms","tremendous impact","acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","prospective neuropsychiatric monitoring of individuals","coronavirus disease","significant psychological stressor","epidemiologic studies of pandemics","treatment programs","CNS","dissemination of robust mental health screening","parallels","general public","human central nervous system","psychosis","neuromuscular dysfunction","demyelinating processes","future precipitate anxiety","mood changes","organizations","uncertainty","creation","facet of individuals\u2019 lives","encephalopathy","subsequent host immunologic response","various points","front-line healthcare workers","months","psychoneuroimmunology","direct effects","life course","framework","Fear of illness","groups","economic sectors","recovered patients","weeks","immunological underpinnings","neuroimmune status","potential mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this study is to quantify public health risk related to the inhalation of airborne infectious agents in public vehicles during transportation based on a mathematical model. METHODS: The reproduction number for the influenza infection in a train (R(A)) was estimated using a model based on the Wells-Riley model. To estimate the influence of environmental parameters, the duration of exposure and the number of passengers were varied. If an infected person will not use a mask and all susceptible people will wear a mask, a reduction in the risk of transmission could be expected. RESULTS: The estimated probability distribution of R(A) had a median of 2.22, and the distribution was fitted to a log-normal distribution with a geometric mean of 2.22 and a geometric standard deviation of 1.53, under the condition that there are 150 passengers, and that 13 ventilation cycles per hour, as required by law, are made. If the exposure time is less than 30 min, the risk may be low. The exposure time can increase the risk linearly. The number of passengers also increases the risk. However, R(A) is fairly insensitive to the number of passengers. Surgical masks are somewhat effective, whereas High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) masks are quite effective. Doubling the rate of ventilation reduces R(A) to almost 1. CONCLUSIONS: Because it is not feasible for all passengers to wear a HEPA mask, and improvement in the ventilation seems to be an effective and feasible means of preventing influenza infection in public trains.","publish_time":"2007-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Furuya, Hiroyuki","journal":"Environmental Health and Preventive Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb9f6cef633c9baf595daae5166b11f88c1271cb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/bf02898153; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2723643?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21431823/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs3MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of passengers","public health risk","risk of transmission","public trains","HEPA mask","reproduction number","estimated probability distribution of R","exposure time","influenza infection","public vehicles","duration of exposure","ventilation cycles","rate of ventilation","mathematical model","log-normal distribution","Wells-Riley model","train commute","geometric mean","rush hour","feasible means","Surgical masks","geometric standard deviation","inhalation of airborne infectious agents","Japan","transportation","High-Efficiency Particulate Air","metropolitan areas","study","influence of environmental parameters","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS","susceptible people","reduction","improvement","infected person","METHODS","condition","median","purpose","CONCLUSIONS","law"],"language":"en"},

To date, specific functions have not been assigned to these UTRs. With reporter assays, we demonstrated that the Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) 5\u2032-UTRs lack internal ribosomal entry site function. However, the 5\u2032-UTRs do differentially regulate cap-dependent translation when placed upstream of a GFP reporter gene. Most dramatically, the 5\u2032-UTR derived from the viral polymerase (L) mRNA strongly suppressed translation of GFP compared to a \u03B2-actin 5\u2032-UTR. The L 5\u2032-UTR is one of four viral genes to possess upstream AUGs (uAUGs), and ablation of each uAUG enhanced translation of the primary ORF (pORF), most dramatically in the case of the L 5\u2032-UTR. The L uAUG was sufficient to initiate translation, is surrounded by a \u201Cweak\u201D Kozak sequence and suppressed pORF translation in a position-dependent manner. Under conditions where eIF2\u03B1 was phosphorylated, the presence of the uORF maintained translation of the L pORF, indicating that the uORF modulates L translation in response to cellular stress. To directly address the role of the L uAUG in virus replication, a recombinant EBOV was generated in which the L uAUG was mutated to UCG. Strikingly, mutating two nucleotides outside of previously-defined protein coding and cis-acting regulatory sequences attenuated virus growth to titers 10\u2013100-fold lower than a wild-type virus in Vero and A549 cells. The mutant virus also exhibited decreased viral RNA synthesis as early as 6 hours post-infection and enhanced sensitivity to the stress inducer thapsigargin. Cumulatively, these data identify novel mechanisms by which EBOV regulates its polymerase expression, demonstrate their relevance to virus replication and identify a potential therapeutic target.","publish_time":"2013-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shabman, Reed S.; Hoenen, Thomas; Groseth, Allison; Jabado, Omar; Binning, Jennifer M.; Amarasinghe, Gaya K.; Feldmann, Heinz; Basler, Christopher F.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/83f15da5d4de38afb2d1ba4b482f66d4e623c11e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3561295.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23382680/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs3NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GFP","EBOV","UCG"],"locations":["Zaire"],"keyphrases":["uAUG enhanced translation","suppressed pORF translation","suppressed translation of GFP","virus replication","cap-dependent translation","mutant virus","viral polymerase","viral genes","wild-type virus","decreased viral RNA synthesis","recombinant EBOV","viral transcriptional units","uORF","regulatory sequences attenuated virus growth","GFP reporter gene","enhanced sensitivity","polymerase expression","cellular stress","upstream AUGs","reporter assays","UTRs lack internal ribosomal entry site function","stress inducer thapsigargin","position-dependent manner","non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses","longer genomes","titers","present","hours post-infection","lethal zoonotic pathogens","Vero","Kozak sequence","ablation","primary ORF","defined protein coding","mRNA","uAUGs","A549 cells","relevance","response","potential therapeutic target","novel mechanisms","\u03B2-actin","Ebolaviruses","data","untranslated regions","presence","Zaire ebolavirus","date","specific functions","eIF2\u03B1","nucleotides","role","conditions","UCG","case"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A total of 20 pathogens, including viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, were detected using molecular sensitive assays, and their associations with the patient\u2019s demographic data and season were analyzed. RESULTS: Viral infectious agents were found in 449 (87.2%) of 515 specimens. Dual and multiple infectious agents were detected in 31.4% and 18.6% of the samples, respectively. Viral infection was predominant in the pediatric environment (90.8%, P \u003C 0.001), male patients (88.0%), and spring (93.8%). Rhinovirus was the most detected virus (51.8%) followed by respiratory syncytial virus A/B (34.4%), coronavirus group (18.5%), adenovirus (17.9%), and parainfluenza viruses 1\u20104 (10.9%). Respiratory Syncytial virus A/B was significantly associated with gender (38.0% male cases vs 28.3% female cases, P = 0.02).

S. pneumoniae was detected in 30.9% of th tested samples. In 18.2% of the negative viral infections, only S. pneumoniae was identified. CONCLUSION: A predominance of the rhinovirus infection was observed in this study. Coronavirus subtypes were described for the first time in Tunisia. The observed different pathogenic profiles across age groups could be helpful to avoid the misclassification of patients presenting with ARIs at the triage level when no standardized protocol is available.

Medicare was born in one province in 1947. It spread across the country through federal cost sharing, and eventually was harmonised through standards in a federal law, the Canada Health Act of 1984. The health-care system is less a true national system than a decentralised collection of provincial and territorial insurance plans covering a narrow basket of services, which are free at the point of care. Administration and service delivery are highly decentralised, although coverage is portable across the country. In the setting of geographical and population diversity, long waits for elective care demand the capacity and commitment to scale up effective and sustainable models of care delivery across the country. Profound health inequities experienced by Indigenous populations and some vulnerable groups also require coordinated action on the social determinants of health if these inequities are to be effectively addressed. Achievement of the high aspirations of Medicare\u0027s founders requires a renewal of the tripartite social contract between governments, health-care providers, and the public. Expansion of the publicly funded basket of services and coordinated effort to reduce variation in outcomes will hinge on more engaged roles for the federal government and the physician community than have existed in previous decades. Public engagement in system stewardship will also be crucial to achieve a high-quality system grounded in both evidence and the Canadian values of equity and solidarity.","publish_time":"2018-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martin, Danielle; Miller, Ashley P; Quesnel-Vall\u00E9e, Am\u00E9lie; Caron, Nadine R; Vissandj\u00E9e, Bilkis; Marchildon, Gregory P","journal":"Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a3d2ceee41401441a21947eb1bd04f0962972786.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7138369.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29483027/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673618301818; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(18)30181-8; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673618301818","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Medicare"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health care","Canadian health-care system","health-care providers","elective care","point of care","social determinants of health","Profound health inequities","system stewardship","Canada Health Act","high-quality system","country","sustainable models of care delivery","true national system","federal government","federal law","narrow basket of services","funded basket of services","federal cost sharing","coordinated effort","coordinated action","service delivery","Public engagement","decentralised collection of provincial","tripartite social contract","Canadian values of equity","territorial insurance plans","population diversity","long waits","renewal","Indigenous populations","governments","outcomes","vulnerable groups","commitment","capacity","evidence","high aspirations of Medicare\u0027s founders","physician community","founding principle","setting of geographical","engaged roles","variation","ability","coverage","need","Achievement","solidarity","Administration","Access","previous decades","Expansion","standards","province"],"language":"en"},

Even if failed transfer of passive immunity (FTPI) is commonly recognized as a main factor affecting calf health and survival, conflicting results are reported in literature about the association between passive immunity (PI) and calf health, especially regarding enteric diseases. Therefore, a prospective cohort study was conducted on 78 calves of three Italian dairy farms during winters of years 2014\u20132016, with the specific aim of evaluating the association between PI and health status of calves within 30 days of age under field conditions. Blood samples were collected between 1 and 5 days of age from each calf included in the study, and disease and mortality occurrence was monitored throughout the first month of life. Additionally, fecal samples were collected from calves with scours before treatment. Blood serum samples were tested by an electrophoretic method for the assessment of immunoglobulin (Ig) concentration, whereas fecal samples were submitted to ELISA test for positivity to Escherichia coli K99, rotavirus, coronavirus, and Cryptosporidium spp. Only enteric diseases occurred in calves of this study. Calves that suffered from diarrhea or died within the first month of life had lower serum Ig concentrations than those that remained healthy or survived (P \u003C .05). Even if not significantly (P = .127), lower serum Ig concentrations were observed in sick calves that had been treated with antibiotics compared to those that had not been treated. The odds of disease and mortality occurrence were 24 (95% CI = 3\u2013231) and 11 (95% CI = 1\u2013111) times higher, respectively, for calves with FTPI (serum Ig concentration \u003C10.0 g/L) than for those with an adequate PI transfer (P \u003C .05). Calves with adequate PI transfer had also a 6-day delay in the age at first disease onset compared to those with FTPI (P \u003C .01). Even if estimated on a small number of calves, those with FTPI had higher risks of enteric infections by rotavirus (odds ratio = 12; 95% CI = 1\u2013137) and Cryptosporidium spp. (odds ratio = 9; 95% CI = 1\u201372) (P \u003C .05). In this study, the PI level influenced the occurrence of enteric diseases and mortality in calves under one month of age, confirming the importance of a proper colostrum provision to calf health and, consequently, to the reduction of antimicrobial use in dairy farming. However, further investigations are needed, particularly focusing on the relationship between PI and specific enteropathogen infections in calves.","publish_time":"2018-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lora, Isabella; Gottardo, Flaviana; Contiero, Barbara; Dall Ava, Brunella; Bonfanti, Lebana; Stefani, Annalisa; Barberio, Antonio","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1ece996da2419d7375b523a314c31334ad097c52.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114084.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2018.01.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587717306463; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29559100/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587717306463","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs5MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PI","FTPI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sick calves","Abstract Calves","health status of calves","small number of calves","calf health","FTPI","mortality occurrence","month of age","occurrence of enteric diseases","adequate PI transfer","PI level","odds of disease","month of life","Blood serum samples","lower serum Ig concentrations","days of age","fecal samples","Blood samples","disease onset","odds ratio","higher risks of enteric infections","rotavirus","association","failed transfer of passive immunity","Cryptosporidium","prospective cohort study","specific enteropathogen infections","dairy farming","times higher","specific aim","Italian dairy farms","Escherichia coli K99","ELISA test","positivity","survival","coronavirus","assessment of immunoglobulin","literature","importance","proper colostrum provision","conflicting results","electrophoretic method","reduction of antimicrobial use","winters of years","main factor","relationship","field conditions","day delay","scours","treatment","diarrhea","antibiotics","investigations"],"language":"en"},

The large amount of data generated provides an opportunity to detect species even at very low levels, provided that computational tools can effectively interpret potentially complex metagenomic mixtures. Data interpretation is complicated by the fact that short sequencing reads can match multiple organisms and by the lack of completeness of existing databases, in particular for viral pathogens. This interpretation problem can be formulated statistically as a mixture model, where the species of origin of each read is missing, but the complete knowledge of all species present in the mixture helps with the individual reads assignment. Several analytical tools have been proposed to approximately solve this computational problem. Here, we show that the use of parallel Monte Carlo Markov chains (MCMC) for the exploration of the species space enables the identification of the set of species most likely to contribute to the mixture. The added accuracy comes at a cost of increased computation time. Our approach is useful for solving complex mixtures involving several related species. We designed our method specifically for the analysis of deep transcriptome sequencing datasets and with a particular focus on viral pathogen detection, but the principles are applicable more generally to all types of metagenomics mixtures.

However, the time sequence of symptom development was rarely discussed. The objective of this study is to chronologically document the time sequence of symptom development in probable SARS cases and compare that of the febrile non-SARS cases, thus providing valuable information for early recognition of the disease. Methods This prospective, descriptive, cohort study was conducted in an academic university hospital in Taipei, Taiwan, from March 14 through May 12, 2003. Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with a temperature of at least 38.0\u00B0C (\u2265100.3\u00B0F) and exposure history were evaluated with a structured protocol. Detailed time sequences of individual symptoms were recorded, and chest radiography and laboratory test results were obtained. Probable SARS cases were determined by the Center of Disease Control Taiwan. Children younger than 15 years and suspected SARS patients with negative polymerase chain reaction results were excluded from final analysis. Results Seventy-nine SARS and 220 non-SARS cases were analyzed. The major clinical symptoms of SARS patients on ED presentation were myalgia, loose stool or diarrhea, nonproductive cough or dyspnea, headache, and chills. Upper airway symptoms, including rhinorrhea and sore throat, were rarely seen in the SARS patients but were common in the non-SARS group. Characteristic symptom sequence, consisting of initial fever accompanied by diarrhea and myalgia and then progressive respiratory symptoms, was identified in 55 SARS patients (69.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60 to 0.80) but only 7 (3.2%; 95% CI 0.008 to 0.05) non-SARS patients. Chest radiographic abnormality may precede lower respiratory tract symptoms in some SARS patients. Conclusion During an outbreak period, recognition of possible SARS cases depends on the heightened awareness of its clinical presentation. Aside from travel and contact history, the time sequence of the accompanying symptoms of SARS should help first-line physicians screen SARS patients at an early stage.","publish_time":"2004-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Shey-Ying; Chiang, Wen-Chu; Ma, Matthew Huei-Ming; Su, Chan-Ping; Hsu, Chiung-Yuan; Chow-In Ko, Patrick; Tsai, Kuang-Chau; Yen, Zui-Shen; Shih, Fuh-Yuan; Chen, Shyr-Chyr; Lin, Shou-Ju; Wang, Jiun-Ling; Chang, Shan-Chwen; Chen, Wen-Jone","journal":"Annals of Emergency Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1cf3629cfea7432f34ada55a60e9cfdada8a07c2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124244.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196064403010667; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064403010667","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs0NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Center of Disease Control Taiwan","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-SARS patients","suspected SARS patients","accompanying symptoms of SARS","probable SARS cases","non-SARS group","major clinical symptoms of SARS patients","febrile non-SARS cases","recognition of possible SARS cases","line physicians screen SARS patients","progressive respiratory symptoms","time sequence of symptom development","lower respiratory tract symptoms","Upper airway symptoms","Detailed time sequences of individual symptoms","Characteristic symptom sequence","myalgia","diarrhea","ED presentation","early recognition","cohort study","clinical presentation","laboratory test results","Abstract Study objective Previous reports","severe acute respiratory syndrome","chest radiography","early stage","contact history","exposure history","Center of Disease Control Taiwan","negative polymerase chain reaction results","Chest radiographic abnormality","loose stool","nonproductive cough","years","valuable information","outbreak period","initial fever","heightened awareness","dyspnea","academic university hospital","rhinorrhea","headache","Taipei","Children younger","final analysis","sore throat","emergency department","Methods","temperature","Conclusion","travel","structured protocol","chills","confidence interval"],"language":"en"},

And, this assay was evaluated for its sensitivity and specificity of detection using real-time turbidity monitoring and visual observation. Results The primer sets orf1ab-4 and S-123 amplified the genes in the shortest times, the mean (\u00B1SD) time was 18 \u00B1 1.32 min and 20 \u00B1 1.80 min, respectively, and 63\u00B0C was the optimum reaction temperature. The sensitivity was 2\u00D7101 copies and 2\u00D7102 copies per reaction with primer sets orf1ab-4 and S-123, respectively. This assay showed no cross-reactivity with other 60 respiratory pathogens. To describe the availability of this method in clinical diagnosis, we collected 130 specimens from patients with clinically suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among them, 58 were confirmed to be positive and 72 were negative by RT-LAMP. The sensiticity was 100% (95% CI 92.3% - 100%), specificity 100% (95% CI 93.7% - 100%).

Here, we show that Xoo-induced rice leaf blight is effectively controlled by niclosamide, an oral antihelminthic drug and molluscicide, which also functions as an anti-tumor agent. Niclosamide directly inhibited the growth of the three Xoo strains PXO99, 10208 and K3a. Niclosamide moved long distances from the site of local application to distant rice tissues. Niclosamide also increased the levels of salicylate and induced the expression of defense-related genes such as OsPR1 and OsWRKY45, which suppressed Xoo-induced leaf wilting. Niclosamide had no detrimental effects on vegetative/reproductive growth and yield. These combined results indicate that niclosamide can be used to block bacterial leaf blight in rice with no negative side effects.","publish_time":"2016-02-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Sung-Il; Song, Jong Tae; Jeong, Jin-Yong; Seo, Hak Soo","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95f0f21246953b8b6258cdf4afd61011c32a686f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4754756.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26879887/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21209","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs2MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Niclosamide"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["niclosamide","Xoo-induced rice leaf blight","bacterial leaf blight","Xoo-induced leaf wilting","Xoo strains PXO99","distant rice tissues","reproductive growth","detrimental effects","grain yield","combined results","bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv","site of local application","expression of defense","related genes","OsPR1","OsWRKY45","huge losses","long distances","oral antihelminthic drug","levels of salicylate","molluscicide","K3a","anti-tumor agent"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we constructed a recombinant porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (vP129/swIL1\u03B2) expressing swine IL-1\u03B2 from the separate subgenomic mRNA inserted between the ORF1b and ORF2 genome region. MARC-145 cells infected with vP129/swIL1\u03B2 secreted 1947pg of IL-1\u03B2 per 2\u00D7105 cells at 36h post-infection. In vitro growth kinetics analysis in MARC-145 cells showed that the vP129/swIL1\u03B2 virus had a similar replication rate as that of parental virus. We further performed in vivo characterization of the vP129/swIL1\u03B2 virus in a nursery pig disease model. The vP129/swIL1\u03B2 infected pigs did not show visible clinical signs, while respiratory distress and lethargy were evident in pigs infected with the parental virus. The expression of various cytokines from peripheral blood mononuclear cells measured by fluorescent microsphere immunoassay showed that IL-1\u03B2, IL-4 and IFN-\u03B3 expression levels were up-regulated in pigs infected with vP129/swIL1\u03B2 at 7 and 14 days post-infection. However, no detectable level of IL-1\u03B2 was found in serum samples from pigs infected with either vP129/swIL1\u03B2 or parental virus. In summary, this study demonstrated a recombinant PRRSV as a useful tool to study the role of different cytokines in disease progression and immune responses, which represents a new strategy for future therapeutic application and vaccine development.","publish_time":"2012-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lawson, Steven R.; Li, Yanhua; Patton, John B.; Langenhorst, Robert J.; Sun, Zhi; Jiang, Zhiyong; Christopher-Hennings, Jane; Nelson, Eric A.; Knudsen, David; Fang, Ying; Chang, Kyeong-Ok","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d477028f06fcfa584056f70ee87cd696511d25ff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114469.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2011.11.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170211004564; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170211004564; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22119401/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs2Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vP129","swIL1\u03B2 virus","swIL1\u03B2 infected pigs","parental virus","swine IL","pg of IL","respiratory syndrome virus","study","detectable level of IL","h post-infection","days post-infection","MARC","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","expression of various cytokines","respiratory distress","disease progression","recombinant PRRSV","role of different cytokines","nursery pig disease model","IFN-\u03B3 expression levels","fluorescent microsphere immunoassay","visible clinical signs","ORF1b","future therapeutic application","new strategy","immune responses","similar replication rate","lethargy","potent inflammatory mediator","separate subgenomic mRNA","vaccine development","useful tool","beta","growth kinetics analysis","ORF2 genome region","serum samples","cytokine interleukin","characterization","summary","immunological adjuvant"],"language":"en"},

Results. A significant association was noted with regards to CD40 tSNPs (rs1535045) between controls and KD patients (P = 0.0405, dominant model). In KD patients, polymorphisms of CD40 (rs4810485) showed significant association with CAL formation (P = 0.0436, recessive model).

Methods A prospective observational study was conducted at the ED of a pediatric tertiary hospital in Ontario, Canada. Patient outcomes (ie, acute asthma episodes and ED visits) were measured at baseline and at 1- and 6-months post-ED discharge. Time trends in outcomes were assessed using the generalized estimating equations method. Multiple conditional logistic regressions were used to model outcomes at 6 months and examine the impact of drug insurance coverage while adjusting for confounders. Results Of the 269 children recruited, 81.8% completed both follow-ups. ED use significantly reduced from 39.4% at baseline to 26.8% at 6 months (P \u003C .001), whereas the level of acute asthma episodes remained unchanged. Children with drug insurance coverage were less likely to have acute asthma episodes (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.36; 95% CI, 0.15\u20130.85; P \u003C .02) or repeat ED visits (AOR = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.20\u20130.99; P \u003C .05) at 6 months. Other risk factors for adverse outcomes included previous adverse asthma events and certain asthma triggers (eg, cold/sinus infection). Washing bed linens in hot water weekly was protective against subsequent acute asthma episodes. Conclusions Our study demonstrated significant improvements in long-term outcomes in children seeking acute care for asthma in the ED.

Each genogroup present a specific highly-conserved motif of six amino acids (between amino acids 86 and 91) in the PCV-2 capsid protein. The aim of this study was to verify whether the motif located in the capsid protein and specific to each PCV-2 genogroup contributes to virulence. Two parental DNA clones, PCV-2a and PCV-2b, were constructed as well as two mutants DNA clones, PCV-2a/motif 2b and PCV-2b/motif 2a by exchanging the capsid motif of each genogroup. The four DNA clones were characterized in vitro as well as in vivo. Cells transfected by the four DNA clones produced infectious viruses. In specific-pathogen-free piglets transfected by the four infectious DNA clones, PCV-2b/motif 2a virulence was not attenuated while the PCV-2a/motif 2b virulence was drastically reduced compared to their parent virulence.

Amid this situation, investigational agents are being used, including chloroquine. We report here the clinical features and therapeutic course of the first reported patient with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia that recovered in Colombia, after the use of chloroquine and clarithromycin. CASE PRESENTATION: A 34-year-old male, returning from Spain, presented with complaints of fever, and cough, and class-II obesity, being hospitalized. The respiratory viruses and bacteria tested by FilmArray(\u00AE) PCR were negative. Two days later, clarithromycin was started because the patient was suspected as community-acquired pneumonia. At the third day, the rRT-PCR confirmed the SARS-CoV-2 infection. A day later, chloroquine was started because of that. His chest computed tomography was performed and showed bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities with consolidation, which suggested viral pneumonia as a differential diagnosis. Progressively his clinical condition improved and at day 9, patient rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 became negative. The patient was discharged and isolated at home per 14 days.

However, the impact of the MERS epidemic on the Saudi economy is unknown. PURPOSE: The present study aimed to evaluate the direct medical costs associated with the management of MERS cases at a tertiary referral hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: The study involved a retrospective chart review of confirmed cases of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections in a tertiary care referral center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from January 2015 to October 2018. The collected data included sociodemographic characteristics, medical information, and the cost of hospitalization of each patient as estimated by micro-costing. RESULTS: A complete set of relevant information was available only for 24 of 44 identified MERS-CoV cases. Patients were mostly females, and the mean age was 52 years. Diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease were the most frequent comorbidities. The length of hospital stay varied from 1 to 31 days, averaging 4.96 \u00B1 7.29 days. Two of the 24 patients died. The total cost of managing a MERS case at the hospital ranged from $1278.41 to $75,987.95 with a mean cost of $12,947.03 \u00B1 $19,923.14.

The main goal of this work is to discuss the impact of the measures on the air quality of the city by comparing the particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and ozone concentrations determined during the partial lockdown with values obtained in the same period of 2019 and also with the weeks prior to the virus outbreak. Concentrations varied with substantial differences among pollutants and also among the three studied monitoring stations. CO levels showed the most significant reductions (30.3\u201348.5%) since they were related to light-duty vehicular emissions. NO2 also showed reductions while PM10 levels were only reduced in the first lockdown week. In April, an increase in vehicular flux and movement of people was observed mainly as a consequence of the lack of consensus about the importance and need of social distancing and lockdown. Ozone concentrations increased probably due to the decrease in nitrogen oxides level.

However, little is known about the risk of infection during hospitalization or its consequences. The aim of this work was to report a series of patients hospitalized on digestive surgery services who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 virus. METHODS: This is a non-interventional retrospective study carried out within three departments of digestive surgery. The clinical, biological and radiological data of the patients who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 were collected from the computerized medical record. RESULTS: From March 1, 2020 to April 5, 2020, among 305 patients admitted to digestive surgery services, 15 (4.9%) developed evident nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2. There were nine men and six women, with a median age of 62 years (35\u201368 years). All patients had co-morbidities. The reasons for hospitalization were: surgical treatment of cancer (n = 5), complex emergencies (n = 5), treatment of complications linked to cancer or its treatment (n = 3), gastroplasty (n = 1), and stoma closure (n = 1). The median time from admission to diagnosis of SARS-Cov-2 infection was 34 days (5\u201361 days). In 12 patients (80%), the diagnosis was made after a hospital stay of more than 14 days (15\u201363 days). At the end of the follow-up, two patients had died, seven were hospitalized with two of them on respiratory assistance, and six patients were discharged post-hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection during hospitalization or following digestive surgery is a real and potentially serious risk. Measures are necessary to minimize this risk in order to return to safe surgical activity.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luong-Nguyen, M.; Hermand, H.; Abdalla, S.; Cabrit, N.; Hobeika, C.; Brouquet, A.; Go\u00E9r\u00E9, D.; Sauvanet, A.","journal":"J Visc Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/136d068ac5d3e5abaedf3a4690b8713a5df3fc88.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7183971.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32381426/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878788620301223; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviscsurg.2020.04.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878788620301223","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs4OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-Cov","risk of infection","series of patients","uninfected patients","risk of SARS","influx of hospital patients","days","diagnosis of SARS","evident nosocomial infection","digestive surgery services","departments of digestive surgery","post-hospitalization","surgical treatment of cancer","serious risk","order","safe surgical activity","treatment of complications","years","median time","median age","drastic reduction","pandemic","admission","non-interventional retrospective study","radiological data","COVID","women","complex emergencies","reasons","stoma closure","computerized medical record","work","METHODS","INTRODUCTION","Measures","co-morbidities","end","follow-up","respiratory assistance","CONCLUSIONS","gastroplasty","virus","consequences","aim","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

We conducted a study aimed at sampling the environment in the King Abdul Aziz International (KAAI) Airport, Pilgrims City, Jeddah, during Hajj season to detect respiratory pathogens. Methods Active air sampling was conducted using air biosamplers, and swabs were used to sample frequently touched surfaces. A respiratory multiplex array was used to detect bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens. Results Of the 58 environmental samples, 8 were positive for at least 1 pathogen. One air sample (1 of 18 samples, 5.5%) tested positive for influenza B virus. Of the 40 surface samples, 7 (17.5%) were positive for pathogens. These were human adenovirus (3 out of 7, 42.8%), human coronavirus OC43/HKU1 (3 out of 7, 42.8%), Haemophilus influenzae (1 out of 7, 14.2%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (1 out of 7, 14.2%). Chair handles were the most commonly contaminated surfaces. The handles of 1 chair were cocontaminated with coronavirus OC43/HKU1 and H influenzae. Conclusion Respiratory pathogens were detected in the air and on surfaces in the KAAI Airport in Pilgrims City. Larger-scale studies based on our study are warranted to determine the role of the environment in transmission of respiratory pathogens during mass gathering events (eg, Hajj) such that public health preventative measures might be better targeted.","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Memish, Ziad A.; Almasri, Malak; Assirri, Abdullah; Al-Shangiti, Ali M.; Gray, Gregory C.; Lednicky, John A.; Yezli, Saber","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3070b290b020128e13189e64839240e22fcafa7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132670.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655314010293; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655314010293; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2014.07.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25465254/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Moraxella"],"organizations":["Pilgrims City"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transmission of respiratory pathogens","viral respiratory pathogens","Conclusion Respiratory pathogens","air sample","air biosamplers","contaminated surfaces","respiratory multiplex array","Hajj season","touched surfaces","Background Respiratory tract infections","Methods Active air sampling","KAAI Airport","Pilgrims City","HKU1","human coronavirus OC43","study","environmental samples","Chair handles","surface samples","H influenzae","Haemophilus influenzae","human adenovirus","King Abdul Aziz International","RTIs","public health preventative measures","Jeddah","mass","events","influenza B virus","role","swabs","Larger-scale studies","Results","variety of organisms","Moraxella catarrhalis"],"language":"en"},

However, it is clear that virally induced metabolic reprogramming can substantially impact infectious outcomes, highlighting the promise of targeting these processes for antiviral therapeutic development.","publish_time":"2015-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goodwin, Christopher M.; Xu, Shihao; Munger, Joshua","journal":"Trends in Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a99dda1c465286a036cb7c217e77e9a054e8910.json; document_parses/pdf_json/327a206d906a71a562dffa0489a0a5d31d96219c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4679435.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2015.08.007; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4679435?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26439298/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0966842X15001961; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966842X15001961","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["metabolic control","metabolic assets","metabolic reprogramming","host\u2019s metabolic resources","variety of metabolic countermeasures","Host cells","core host-pathogen interaction","viral infection","viral changes","replication","organization of specialized compartments","evolved mechanisms","processes","maturation","promise","infectious outcomes","complex interplay","antiviral therapeutic development","production of virion components","Recent studies","dissemination","Viruses","hosts"],"language":"en"},

We illustrate this method using data from the 2009 H1N1 Influenza pandemic in Gauteng Province, South Africa. RESULTS: Our results are consistent with others in showing decreased transmission with age. We show that results can change markedly when we make the account for differential healthcare seeking behaviors by age. CONCLUSIONS: We show substantial heterogeneity in transmission by age group during the Influenza A H1N1 pandemic in South Africa. This information can greatly assist in targeting interventions and implementing social distancing measures.","publish_time":"2014-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"White, Laura F; Archer, Brett; Pagano, Marcello","journal":"Emerg Themes Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/491f229f1a4bc9fb8f4c85097040666e5ad1c455.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3997935.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24656239/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-7622-11-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs5NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Africa"],"keyphrases":["age groups","RESULTS","H1N1 Influenza pandemic","influenza transmission dynamics","H1N1 pandemic","South Africa","reproductive number","decreased transmission","simple method","contact patterns","existing information","potential impact of differential healthcare","Gauteng Province","targeting interventions","Teunis","substantial heterogeneity","social distancing measures","Wallinga","behaviors","methods","data","sensitivity analysis","account","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

While the wild type produced large plaques consisting of fused cells (fusion type) both at 39 and at 32\u00B0, the mutant produced small fusion-type plaques at 39\u00B0, and at 32\u00B0, only after longer incubation, plaques consisting of round dead cells (non-fusion type) were obtained. The mutant grew equally well at both temperatures. Thus, the mutant was cold sensitive in inducing cell fusion, but not in replication or in ultimate cell killing. The cold sensitivity was overcome by the addition of trypsin (0.04 to 0.05%) to the culture medium, but not by treating the virions with trypsin. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the virion proteins failed to detect differences between the wild type and the mutant. In intracellular viral proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-MHV-S rabbit serum, a protein of 68,000 daltons (68K protein) which was present in the wild type-infected cells was absent in the mutant-infected cells, but trypsin treatment or incubation at 39\u00B0 of the mutant-infected cells failed to induce the 68K protein. After six to seven undiluted passages, the mutant segregated varieties of mutants which were partially or totally reverted to the wild type in phenotype, and also those whose cell fusion induction was absent even at 39\u00B0. All these mutants failed to induce the 68K protein in the infected cells. Thus, there was no linkage between the presence of 68K protein and the fusion induction. Trypsin treatment of the infected cells enabled MHV-S to form fusion plaques on otherwise resistant cells, and MHV-2, a producer of non-fusion-type plaques, to form fusion-type plaques. Protease appears to play an important role in MHV-induced cell fusion in general.","publish_time":"1981-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yoshikura, H.; Tejima, S.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/79f669ea3c9705106a2add7bca7f7f9382c5fd31.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682281901781; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682281901781","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Kirsten"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fusion plaques","mutant-infected cells","non-fusion type","wild type-infected cells","small fusion-type plaques","producer of non-fusion-type plaques","cell fusion induction","MHV-induced cell fusion","fused cells","inducing cell fusion","c cells","resistant cells","plaque mutant","round dead cells","large plaques","mutant segregated varieties of mutants","trypsin treatment","ultimate cell","addition of trypsin","mouse hepatitis virus strain MHV","anti-MHV-S rabbit serum","incubation","Kirsten mouse sarcoma virus","virion proteins","cold sensitivity","intracellular viral proteins","BALB","important role","SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis","undiluted passages","differences","replication","daltons","phenotype","Protease","presence","culture medium","linkage","virions","temperatures"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: Develop evidence-based rapid guidelines intended to support patients, clinicians and other health-care professionals in their decisions about treatment and management of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: IDSA formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel of infectious disease clinicians, pharmacists, and methodologists with varied areas of expertise. Process followed a rapid recommendation checklist. The panel prioritized questions and outcomes. Then a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make recommendations. RESULTS: The IDSA guideline panel agreed on 7 treatment recommendations and provided narrative summaries of other treatments undergoing evaluations.

This is a question of intense debate over the last 5 years, though the history of such experiments goes back at least to the synthesis of viable influenza A H1N1 (1918) based on material preserved from the 1918 pandemic. This chapter makes the case that experiments to create potential pandemic pathogens (PPPs) are nearly unique in that they present biosafety risks that extend well beyond the experimenter or laboratory performing them; an accidental release could, as the name suggests, lead to global spread of a virulent virus, a biosafety incident on a scale never before seen. In such cases, biosafety considerations should be uppermost in the consideration of alternative approaches to experimental objectives and design, rather than being settled after the fact, as is appropriately done for most research involving pathogens. The extensive recent discussion of the magnitude of risks from such experiments is briefly reviewed. The chapter argues that, while there are indisputably certain questions that can be answered only by gain-of-function experiments in highly pathogenic strains, these questions are narrow and unlikely to meaningfully advance public health goals such as vaccine production and pandemic prediction. Alternative approaches to experimental influenza virology and characterization of existing strains are in general completely safe, higher throughput, more generalizable, and less costly than creation of PPP in the laboratory and can thereby better inform public health. Indeed, virtually every finding of recent PPP experiments that has been cited for its public health value was predated by similar findings using safe methodologies. The chapter concludes that the unique scientific and public health value of PPP experiments is inadequate to justify the unique risks they entail and that researchers would be well-advised to turn their talents to other methodologies that will be safe and more rewarding scientifically.","publish_time":"2018-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lipsitch, Marc","journal":"Influenza Virus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cdd96b6c68f8dc25c90af77dbf056afbc44d0950.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119956.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30151594/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-8678-1_29","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["function experiments","public health value of PPP experiments","chapter","finding of recent PPP experiments","novel strains of influenza","unique risks","biosafety risks","virulent avian influenza strains","advance public health goals","pathogenic strains","safe methodologies","pandemic prediction","experimental influenza virology","potential pandemic pathogens","characterization of existing strains","synthesis of viable influenza","creation of PPP","magnitude of risks","biosafety incident","laboratory","biosafety considerations","consideration of alternative approaches","virulent virus","experimental objectives","dangerous gain","certain questions","extensive recent discussion","vaccine production","mammals","similar findings","example","airborne transmissibility","global spread","higher throughput","H1N1","design","PPPs","years","lead","researchers","question of intense debate","talents","accidental release","cases","scale","material","history","experimenter","rewarding","fact"],"language":"en"},

In beef cattle, agronomic biofortification with Se is a more practical alternative for Se supplementation, whereby the Se concentration of hay is increased through the use of Se-containing fertilizer amendments. It has been previously demonstrated that agronomic Se biofortification is an effective strategy to improve immunity and performance in Se-replete weaned beef calves. The objective of this experiment was to determine the effects of feeding beef cows Se-enriched alfalfa (Medicago sativa) hay during the last 8 to 12 wk of gestation on passive transfer of antibodies to calves. At 10 wk \u00B1 16 d before calving, 45 cows were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups with 3 pens (5 cows/pen) per treatment: Control cows were fed non-Se-fortified alfalfa hay plus a mineral supplement containing 120 mg/kg Se from sodium selenite, Med-Se cows were fed alfalfa hay fertilized with 45.0 g Se/ha as sodium selenate, and High-Se cows were fed alfalfa hay fertilized with 89.9 g Se/ha as sodium selenate; both the Med-Se and the High-Se groups received mineral supplement without added Se. Colostrum and whole blood (WB) were collected from cows at calving, and WB was collected from calves within 2 h of calving and at 12, 24, 36, and 48 h of age. Concentrations of IgG1 and J-5 Escherichia coli antibody in cow colostrum and calf serum were quantified using ELISA procedures. Selenium concentrations linearly increased in WB (P \u003C 0.001) and colostrum (P \u003C 0.001) of cows and in WB of newborn calves (P \u003C 0.001) with increasing Se concentration in alfalfa hay. Colostrum concentrations of IgG1 (P = 0.03) were increased in cows fed Se-biofortified alfalfa hay, but J-5 E. coli antibody (P = 0.43) concentrations were not. Calf serum IgG1 (P = 0.43) and J-5 E. coli antibody (P = 0.44) concentrations during the first 48 h of age were not affected by prior Se treatment of cows.

We present our recommendations for the management of acute stroke during the COVID-19 pandemics.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dafer, Rima M; Osteraas, Nicholas D; MD, Jose Biller","journal":"J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc80eaadf2d52c502614479f57d56abef5900736.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164903.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1052305720302780?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1052305720302780; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32334918/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.104881","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AIS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rapid spread of COVID","high quality care","management of acute stroke","intensive care","AIS","high standard quality of care","management of acute ischemic stroke","pandemic respiratory disease","Coronavirus disease","personnel","serious public health risk","current practice","medical community","hospital beds","physicians","limited resources","healthcare system","world","patients","guard","modification","recommendations","guidelines","pandemics","aim","suggestions"],"language":"en"},

Thus, the etiological diagnosis of respiratory viral diseases requires the detection of a large number of viruses. In this study, 6 duplex real-time PCR assays, using EvaGreen intercalating dye, were developed to detect 12 major viruses responsible for respiratory diseases: influenza A and B viruses, enteroviruses (including enterovirus spp, and rhinovirus spp), respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses group I (of which CoV 229E and CoV NL63 are part) and II (including CoV OC43 and CoV HKU1), parainfluenza viruses type 1, 2, 3 and 4, human adenoviruses and human bocaviruses. The 2 target viruses of each duplex reaction were distinguishable by the melting temperatures of their amplicons. The 6 duplex real time PCR assays were applied for diagnostic purpose on 202 respiratory samples from 157 patients. One hundred fifty-seven samples were throat swabs and 45 were bronchoalveolar lavages. The results of the duplex PCR assays were confirmed by comparison with a commercial, validated, assay; in addition, the positive results were confirmed by sequencing. The analytical sensitivity of the duplex PCR assays varied from 10(3) copies/ml to 10(4) copies/ml. For parainfluenza virus 2 only it was 10(5) copies/ml. Seventy clinical samples (35%) from 55 patients (30 children and 25 adults) were positive for 1 or more viruses. In adult patients, influenza A virus was the most frequently detected respiratory virus followed by rhinoviruses. In contrast, respiratory syncytial virus was the most common virus in children, followed by enteroviruses, influenza A virus and coronavirus NL63. The small number of samples/patients does not allow us to draw any epidemiological conclusion. Altogether, the results of this study indicate that the 6 duplex PCR assays described in this study are sensitive, specific and cost-effective. Thus, this assay could be particularly useful to identify the main respiratory viruses directly from clinical samples, after nucleic acid extraction, and, also, to screen a large number of patients for epidemiological studies.","publish_time":"2015-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arvia, Rosaria; Corcioli, Fabiana; Ciccone, Nunziata; Della Malva, Nunzia; Azzi, Alberta","journal":"Mol Cell Probes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a487e5cda0d3abdadee013502604c795cb0f736.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127684.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26334289/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0890850815300323; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890850815300323; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcp.2015.08.006","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory samples","respiratory syncytial virus","main respiratory viruses","duplex PCR assays","respiratory diseases","parainfluenza viruses","B viruses","Different viruses","target viruses","large number of viruses","duplex real-time PCR assays","common virus","clinical samples","major viruses responsible","duplex real time PCR assays","duplex reaction","large number of patients","study","CoV NL63","small number of samples","adult patients","copies","similar clinical manifestations of respiratory infections","etiological diagnosis of respiratory viral diseases","CoV HKU1","CoV OC43","positive results","enteroviruses","human metapneumovirus","human adenoviruses","human bocaviruses","children","enterovirus spp","rhinovirus spp","coronavirus NL63","epidemiological studies","epidemiological conclusion","detection","coronaviruses group","diagnostic purpose","EvaGreen intercalating dye","melting temperatures","nucleic acid extraction","comparison","analytical sensitivity","swabs","addition","adults","contrast","bronchoalveolar lavages","amplicons","sequencing","rhinoviruses"],"language":"en"},

Serotype replacement by nonvaccine serotypes is reported in multiple areas around the world. This study is a continuation of previous studies and describes the incidence, serotype distribution, and antibiotic resistance pattern of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes causing IPD at Children\u0027s Medical Center Dallas after introduction of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). METHODS: Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from normally sterile sites were collected from January 1, 1999 to June 30, 2014. Demographic and clinical information was extracted for analysis. Incidence of IPD was calculated using inpatient and emergency center admissions to Children\u0027s Medical Center of Dallas as the denominator. Isolates were serotyped and penicillin/cefotaxime susceptibilities were determined. Selected nontypeable isolates were further characterized by multilocus sequence typing. A \u03C7(2) test and the Cochran\u2013Armitage Trend Test for trend analysis were used to evaluate change in serotype and antibiotic susceptibility patterns over time. RESULTS: Comparison of the different study periods showed a significant reduction in the incidence of IPD in PCV13 era compared with prevaccine era and PCV7 era (P \u003C .05). Children younger than 24 months showed the largest reduction of disease incidence. More than 40% of patients with IPD had a documented comorbidity. Cases of pneumonia continued to decrease in the PCV13 era (P \u003C .002). The most common non-PCV13 serotypes after vaccine introduction were as follows: 23B, 6C, 23A, 9N/L, and 12. Penicillin resistance by meningitis breakpoint decreased significantly in the PCV13 era. CONCLUSIONS: After introduction of PCV13 in Dallas, incidence of IPD caused by strains contained in the vaccine and penicillin resistance continued to decrease. Serotype replacement phenomena and persistence of PCV7 serotypes were documented. Patients with comorbidities represented a large percentage of patients with IPD. Concerns for geographic variation in serotype replacement phenomena arise from the present study.","publish_time":"2016-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gaviria-Agudelo, Claudia L; Jordan-Villegas, Alejandro; Garcia, Carla; McCracken, George H","journal":"J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2514b6a3286c805992743bbf6b8c51a2075c622d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107452.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26907814/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jpids/piw005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":["IPD at Children\u0027s Medical Center Dallas","Children\u0027s Medical Center","IPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Incidence of IPD","PCV13 era","introduction of PCV13","PCV7 era","Serotype replacement phenomena","serotype distribution","common non-PCV13 serotypes","vaccine introduction","prevaccine era","Penicillin resistance","Children\u0027s Medical Center Dallas","Children\u0027s Medical Center of Dallas","nonvaccine serotypes","largest reduction of disease incidence","antibiotic resistance pattern of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes","persistence of PCV7 serotypes","Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates","significant reduction","trend analysis","valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine","present study","nontypeable isolates","emergency center admissions","Armitage Trend Test","different study periods","Invasive pneumococcal disease","large percentage of patients","significant burden","Children younger","documented comorbidity","antibiotic susceptibility patterns","generations of conjugate vaccines","implementation","change","months","Cochran","geographic variation","meningitis breakpoint","Comparison","multiple areas","comorbidities","time","sterile sites","continuation of previous studies","Concerns","BACKGROUND","strains","clinical information","RESULTS","METHODS","denominator","multilocus sequence","cefotaxime susceptibilities","world","CONCLUSIONS","Cases of pneumonia"],"language":"en"},

Wet markets sell live poultry, fish, reptiles, and mammals of every kind. Live-poultry markets (mostly chicken, pigeon, quail, ducks, geese, and a wide range of exotic wild-caught and farm-raised fowl) are usually separated from markets selling fish or red-meat animals, but the stalls can be near each other with no physical separation. Despite the widespread availability of affordable refrigeration, many Asian people prefer live animals for fresh produce. Wet markets are widespread in Asian countries and in countries where Asian people have migrated. Live-poultry markets were the source of the H5N1 bird-influenza virus that transmitted to and killed six of 18people in Hong Kong. Starting point Yi Guan and colleagues (Science 2003; 302: 276\u201378) recently reported the isolation of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) from Himalayan palm civets (Paguna larvata) in wet markets in Shenzen, southern China. These researchers also found serological evidence of infection in raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes pro-cuyoinboides). Serological evidence for SARS CoV in human beings working in these markets, taken together with the earliest cases of SARS in restaurant workers, supports the contention of a potential zoonotic origin for SARS. Where next? Will SARS reappear? This question confronts public-health officials worldwide, particularly infectious disease personnel in those regions of the world most affected by the disease and the economic burden of SARS, including China, Taiwan, and Canada. Will the virus re-emerge from wet markets or from laboratories working with SARS CoV, or are asymptomatic infections ongoing in human beings? Similar questions can be asked about a pandemic of influenza that is probably imminent. Knowledge of the ecology of influenza in wet markets can be used as an early-warning system to detect the reappearance of SARS or pandemic influenza.","publish_time":"2004-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Webster, Robert G","journal":"The Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7dd2342dec468a14a74dded901f70ec7d84a38aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112390.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673603153299; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673603153299","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsyMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Yi Guan"],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Hong Kong","Shenzen","China","Canada"],"keyphrases":["wet markets","Live-poultry markets","SARS CoV","reappearance of SARS","live animals","live poultry","Summary Context Live-animal markets","earliest cases of SARS","economic burden of SARS","Asian people","pandemic of influenza","pandemic influenza","Asian countries","ecology of influenza","invertebrate animals","fish","human beings","world","H5N1 bird-influenza virus","serological evidence of infection","red-meat animals","source of vertebrate","subtropical regions","southern China","infectious disease personnel","widespread availability of affordable refrigeration","raccoon dogs","coronavirus","Paguna larvata","Himalayan palm civets","customers","pigeon","chicken","isolation of severe acute respiratory syndrome","asymptomatic infections ongoing","geese","contention","ducks","restaurant workers","reptiles","Shenzen","Nyctereutes pro-cuyoinboides","public-health officials","wide range of exotic wild","fresh produce","point Yi Guan","colleagues","Science","quail","potential zoonotic origin","laboratories","early-warning system","farm","mammals","researchers","Taiwan","kind","Canada","Hong Kong","stalls","Knowledge","fowl","Similar questions","physical separation"],"language":"en"},

The nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV is highly antigenic and associated with several host-cell interactions. Our previous studies using nuclear magnetic resonance revealed the domain organization of the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein. RNA has been shown to bind to the N-terminal domain (NTD), although recently the C-terminal half of the protein has also been implicated in RNA binding. Here, we report that the C-terminal domain (CTD), spanning residues 248\u2013365 (NP248-365), had stronger nucleic acid-binding activity than the NTD. To determine the molecular basis of this activity, we have also solved the crystal structure of the NP248-365 region. Residues 248\u2013280 form a positively charged groove similar to that found in the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) nucleocapsid protein. Furthermore, the positively charged surface area is larger in the SARS-CoV construct than in the IBV. Interactions between residues 248\u2013280 and the rest of the molecule also stabilize the formation of an octamer in the asymmetric unit. Packing of the octamers in the crystal forms two parallel, basic helical grooves, which may be oligonucleotide attachment sites, and suggests a mechanism for helical RNA packaging in the virus.","publish_time":"2007-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Chun-Yuan; Chang, Chung-ke; Chang, Yi-Wei; Sue, Shih-Che; Bai, Hsin-I; Riang, Lilianty; Hsiao, Chwan-Deng; Huang, Tai-huang","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1ea6be4eecf0093e81b682161122e234bef6b6c0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094638.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283607002616; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283607002616","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsyNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nucleocapsid protein of SARS","SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein","RNA binding","residues","C-terminal domain","virus structure","SARS-CoV construct","helical RNA packaging","N-terminal domain","basic proteins","Abstract Coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins","domain organization","NTD","IBV","viral genomic RNA","C-terminal half","crystal structure","NP248","basic helical grooves","infectious bronchitis virus","crystal forms","stronger nucleic acid-binding activity","host-cell interactions","nuclear magnetic resonance","mechanism","previous studies","octamers","CTD","oligonucleotide attachment sites","formation","surface area","asymmetric unit","molecule","molecular basis","Packing","rest","region","groove similar"],"language":"en"},

Avastroviruses have primarily been associated with infections of poultry, especially chicken, turkey, duck, and guineafowl production systems, but also infect wading birds and doves.

FINDINGS: Virological surveillance was conducted in birds from two sites in Cambodia in 2010. Samples were screened for influenza, astroviruses, coronaviruses, flaviviruses, and paramyxoviruses. A total of 199 birds were tested and an astrovirus was detected in a black-naped monarch (Hypothymis azurea). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first astrovirus detection in a passerine bird. Phylogenetic analysis and nucleotide distances suggest that this avastrovirus forms a distinct lineage and may constitute a fourth avastrovirus group.

The interface formed a conserved hydrophobic cavity suitable for targeted drug screening. By considering the hydrophobic complementarity during the virtual screening step, we identified 5-benzyloxygramine as a new N protein PPI orthosteric stabilizer that exhibits both antiviral and N-NTD protein-stabilizing activities. X-ray crystallography and small-angle X-ray scattering showed that 5-benzyloxygramine stabilizes the N-NTD dimers through simultaneous hydrophobic interactions with both partners, resulting in abnormal N protein oligomerization that was further confirmed in the cell.

In 2016, an estimated 1.6 million confirmed cases, and 18,738 cases were reported in health facilities and communities respectively, with about 8000 estimated deaths. Several studies have estimated malaria prevalence in Cameroon using the analytical techniques at the regional scale. We aimed at identifying malaria clusters and hotspots at the urban-rural geographic scale from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data for households between 2000 and 2015 using ArcGIS for intervention programs. METHODS: To identify malaria hotspots and analyze the pattern of distribution, we used the optimized hotspots toolset and spatial autocorrelation respectively in ArcGIS 10.3 for desktop. We also used Pearson\u2019s Correlation analysis to identify associative environmental factors using the R-software 3.4.1. RESULTS: The spatial distribution of malaria showed statistically significant clustered pattern for the year 2000 and 2015 with Moran\u2019s indexes 0.126 (P \u003C 0.001) and 0.187 (P \u003C 0.001) respectively. Meanwhile, the years 2005 and 2010 with Moran\u2019s indexes 0.001 (P = 0.488) and 0.002 (P = 0.318) respectively, had a random malaria distribution pattern. There exist varying degrees of malaria clusters and statistically significant hotspots in the urban-rural areas of the 12 administrative regions. Malaria cases were associated with population density and some environmental covariates; rainfall, enhanced vegetation index and composite lights (P \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study identified urban-rural areas with high and low malaria clusters and hotspots. Our maps can be used as supportive tools for effective malaria control and elimination, and investments in malaria programs and research, malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment, surveillance, should pay more attention to urban-rural geographic scale.","publish_time":"2018-12-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tewara, Marlvin Anemey; Mbah-Fongkimeh, Prisca Ngetemalah; Dayimu, Alimu; Kang, Fengling; Xue, Fuzhong","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dbd121bc5733e77f68826080a177fb8b0e8d3106.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6286522.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-018-3534-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30526507/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsyODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Moran"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Cameroon"],"keyphrases":["malaria hotspots","Malaria cases","Malaria prevalence","malaria programs","malaria prevention","spatial distribution of malaria","low malaria clusters","random malaria distribution pattern","effective malaria control","urban-rural geographic scale","varying degrees of malaria clusters","urban-rural areas","significant hotspots","regional scale","pattern of distribution","optimized hotspots toolset","Cameroon","Health Survey","significant clustered pattern","health facilities","ArcGIS","confirmed cases","Moran\u2019s indexes","estimated deaths","environmental covariates","major public health problem","spatial autocorrelation","intervention programs","associative environmental factors","enhanced vegetation index","rainfall","elimination","research","investments","Demographic","composite lights","supportive tools","population density","analytical techniques","DHS","diagnosis","attention","Pearson\u2019s Correlation analysis","surveillance","households","data","treatment","study","R-software","communities","administrative regions","BACKGROUND","studies","RESULTS","maps","desktop","years","CONCLUSION","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The continual outbreaks of MERS-CoV highlight the importance of developing antiviral therapeutics. Here, we rationally designed a novel fusion inhibitor named MERS-five-helix bundle (MERS-5HB) derived from the six-helix bundle (MERS-6HB) which was formed by the process of membrane fusion. MERS-5HB consists of three copies of heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and two copies of heptad repeat 2 (HR2) while MERS-6HB includes three copies each of HR1 and HR2. As it lacks one HR2, MERS-5HB was expected to interact with viral HR2 to interrupt the fusion step. What we found was that MERS-5HB could bind to HR2P, a peptide derived from HR2, with a strong affinity value (K(D)) of up to 0.24 nM. Subsequent assays indicated that MERS-5HB could inhibit pseudotyped MERS-CoV entry effectively with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of about 1 \u03BCM. In addition, MERS-5HB significantly inhibited spike (S) glycoprotein-mediated syncytial formation in a dose-dependent manner. Further biophysical characterization showed that MERS-5HB was a thermo-stable \u03B1-helical secondary structure. The inhibitory potency of MERS-5HB may provide an attractive basis for identification of a novel inhibitor against MERS-CoV, as a potential antiviral agent.","publish_time":"2017-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Yaping; Zhang, Huaidong; Shi, Jian; Zhang, Zhe; Gong, Rui","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc180c51f54487e4bbbd129c1cc2e30deacd3181.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5618021.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v9090255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28906430/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsyOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["HB","inhibitory potency of MERS","continual outbreaks of MERS","pseudotyped MERS-CoV entry","viral HR2","copies of heptad","novel fusion inhibitor","novel inhibitor","helix bundle","HR1","fusion step","process of membrane fusion","inhibitory concentration","antiviral therapeutics","potential antiviral agent","thermo-stable \u03B1-helical secondary structure","syncytial formation","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","glycoprotein","identification","inhibited spike","attractive basis","strong affinity value","importance","dose-dependent manner","HR2P","biophysical characterization","Subsequent assays","peptide","addition","high mortality","nM","\u03BCM"],"language":"en"},

Literature search through PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase was completed by 2 reviewers from November 1, 2019 to April 20, 2020. Inclusion criteria were observational case-control or cohort studies on COVID-19 patients with a history of CVD included, which reported outcomes of COVID-19 infection severity, clearly outlined the definition of \u201Csevere disease\u201D and with sample size \u003E10. Data were abstracted independently by 2 authors. Studies were divided into two separate cohorts for analysis: severity (severe vs. non-severe) and mortality (non-survivors vs. survivors). Data was pooled into a meta-analysis to estimate pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each outcome. A total of 18 studies (n= 4,858 patients) were included. Sixteen studies were from China, while 2 were from the United States. Pre-existing CVD was associated with a significantly increased risk of a severe form of COVID-19 (OR= 3.14; 95% CI 2.32-4.24; I(2)=0%; Q= 8.68, p=0.73) and overall risk of COVID-19 all-cause mortality (OR= 11.08; 95% CI: 2.59-47.32; I(2)=55%; p=0.11). However, this study did not find a significant association between previous history of CVD and mortality in severe COVID-19 disease (OR=1.72; 95% CI: 0.97-3.06, I(2)=0%, p=0.46). Pre-existing CVD is associated with worse outcomes among patients with COVID-19. Clinicians and policymakers need to take account of these findings in implementing risk stratification models.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aggarwal, Gaurav; Cheruiyot, Isaac; Aggarwal, Saurabh; Wong, Johnny; Lippi, Giuseppe; Lavie, Carl J.; Henry, Brandon M.; Sanchis-Gomar, Fabian","journal":"Curr Probl Cardiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec11ddf2eedb7f015cd487a816b04acaf95292d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7187816.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0146280620300943; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32402515/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0146280620300943?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2020.100617","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjszMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CVD"],"locations":["China","United States"],"keyphrases":["severe COVID","outcomes of COVID","patients","severe form of COVID","association of CVD","overall risk of COVID","Pre-existing CVD","Observational studies","severe disease","cohort studies","increased mortality","previous history of CVD","meta-analysis of recent studies","worse prognosis","worse outcomes","increased risk","significant association","all-cause mortality","non-survivors","Data","risk stratification models","infection severity","observational case-control","pooled odds ratio","underlying cardiovascular diseases","Cochrane Library","separate cohorts","PubMed","Inclusion criteria","account","findings","definition","Literature search","Embase","sample size","Clinicians","policymakers","study","confidence interval","total","United States","reviewers","authors","China"],"language":"en"},

Not only can these cells support the growth of SARS-CoV infection, but they are also capable of secreting inflammatory cytokines to initiate and, eventually, aggravate host innate inflammatory responses, causing detrimental immune-mediated pathology within the lungs. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of the complex epithelial signaling to SARS-CoV is crucial for paving the way to better understand SARS pathogenesis. Based on microarray-based functional genomics, we report here the global gene response of 2B4 cells, a cloned bronchial epithelial cell line derived from Calu-3 cells. Specifically, we found a temporal and spatial activation of nuclear factor (NF)\u03BAB, activator protein (AP)-1, and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3/7 in infected 2B4 cells at 12-, 24-, and 48-hrs post infection (p.i.), resulting in the activation of many antiviral genes, including interferon (IFN)-\u03B2, -\u03BBs, inflammatory mediators, and many IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We also showed, for the first time, that IFN-\u03B2 and IFN-\u03BBs were capable of exerting previously unrecognized, non-redundant, and complementary abilities to limit SARS-CoV replication, even though their expression could not be detected in infected 2B4 bronchial epithelial cells until 48 hrs p.i. Collectively, our results highlight the mechanics of the sequential events of antiviral signaling pathway/s triggered by SARS-CoV in bronchial epithelial cells and identify novel cellular targets for future studies, aiming at advancing strategies against SARS.","publish_time":"2010-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yoshikawa, Tomoki; Hill, Terence E.; Yoshikawa, Naoko; Popov, Vsevolod L.; Galindo, Cristi L.; Garner, Harold R.; Peters, C.

Although there have been several studies on the pathogenesis of coronaviruses in humans and surrogate animals, there is little information on the interactions of these viruses with their natural bat hosts. We detected a coronavirus in the intestines of 53/174 hibernating little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), as well as in the lungs of some of these individuals. Interestingly, the presence of the virus was not accompanied by overt inflammation. Viral RNA amplified from little brown bats in this study appeared to be from two distinct clades. The sequences in clade 1 were very similar to the archived sequence derived from little brown bats and the sequences from clade 2 were more closely related to the archived sequence from big brown bats. This suggests that two closely related coronaviruses may circulate in little brown bats. Sequence variation among coronavirus detected from individual bats suggested that infection occurred prior to hibernation, and that the virus persisted for up to 4 months of hibernation in the laboratory. Based on the sequence of its genome, the coronavirus was placed in the Alphacoronavirus genus, along with some human coronaviruses, bat viruses and the porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus. The detection and identification of an apparently persistent coronavirus in a local bat species creates opportunities to understand the dynamics of coronavirus circulation in bat populations.","publish_time":"2017-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Subudhi, Sonu; Rapin, Noreen; Bollinger, Trent K.; Hill, Janet E.; Donaldson, Michael E.; Davy, Christina M.; Warnecke, Lisa; Turner, James M.; Kyle, Christopher J.; Willis, Craig K.

Three ejaculates from 20 mixed-breed dogs, of unknown fertility, were collected by digital manipulation. Ejaculate volume and color, sperm motility, sperm vigor, percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa, and membrane integrity (hypoosmotic swelling test and fluorescent staining) were assessed. For each dog, seminal plasma was pooled from all three ejaculates and proteins were separated with SDS-PAGE, using polyacrylamide concentrations of 13% and 22% in the separation gels. After staining, gel images were digitized to estimate molecular weights (MW) and integrated optical density (IOD) of each lane and of individual bands. Total seminal plasma protein concentration was 2.19\u00B11.56g/dL (mean\u00B1SD; range 1.12\u20135.19g/dL). A total of 37 protein bands were identified (although no dog had all 37 bands). In the 13% gel, molecular weights ranged from 100.6 to 17.1kDa, with four bands (49.7, 33.2, 26.4, and 19.5kDa) present in samples from all dogs. In the 22% gel, molecular weights ranged from 15.6 to 3.6kDa, with nine bands (15.6, 13.5, 12.7, 11.7, 10.5, 8.7, 7.8, 5.6, and 4.9kDa) present in samples from all dogs. Combined for both gels, the majority of bands (85%) had molecular weights \u003C17kDa, with B20 (15.6kDa) in high concentrations in samples from all dogs. There were positive correlations (P \u22640.01) between two bands, B4 (67kDa) and B5 (58.6kDa), and sperm motility (r =0.66 and r =0.46), sperm vigor (r =0.56 and r =0.66), percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa (r =0.55 and r =0.59), the hypoosmotic swelling test (r =0.76 and r =0.68), and fluorescent staining (r =0.56 and r =0.59), respectively.

Some resident proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that are known to escape with low efficiency from this organelle to a post ER compartment are recognized by a recycling receptor and brought back to their site of residence. Other ER proteins, however, appear to be retained in the ER by mechanisms that operate in the organelle itself. The mammalian oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) is a protein complex that effects the cotranslational N-glycosylation of newly synthesized polypeptides, and is composed of at least four rough ER-specific membrane proteins: ribophorins I and II (RI and RII), OST48, and Dad1. The mechanism(s) by which the subunits of this complex are retained in the ER are not well understood. In an effort to identify the domains within RII responsible for its ER localization we have studied the fate of chimeric proteins in which one or more RII domains were replaced by the corresponding ones of the Tac antigen, the latter being a well characterized plasma membrane protein that lacks intrinsic ER retention signals and serves to provide a neutral framework for the identification of retention signals in other proteins. We found that the luminal domain of RII by itself does not contain retention information, while the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains contain independent ER localization signals. We also show that the retention function of the transmembrane domain is strengthened by the presence of a flanking luminal region consisting of 15 amino acids.","publish_time":"2000-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fu, Jie; Pirozzi, Gregorio; Sanjay, Archana; Levy, Robert; Chen, Yanru; De Lemos-Chiarandini, Carmen; Sabatini, David; Kreibich, Gert","journal":"European Journal of Cell Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/45e1fd0843735d7ae2c113ba89b0b25204fb8eb5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0171933504700254; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0171933504700254","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs0MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ER proteins","intrinsic ER retention signals","rough ER-specific membrane proteins","independent ER localization signals","specific localization signals","post ER compartment","RII domains","resident proteins","Summary Proteins","identification of retention signals","organelle-specific function","retention function","luminal domain of RII","fate of chimeric proteins","specific compartments","transmembrane domains","retention information","RII responsible","protein complex","characterized plasma membrane protein","flanking luminal region","transport","cotranslational N-glycosylation","presence","order","ribophorins","distal regions","corresponding ones","endomembrane system","neutral framework","endoplasmic reticulum","exocytic pathway","synthesized polypeptides","amino acids","Tac antigen","recycling receptor","OST48","mammalian oligosaccharyltransferase","low efficiency","subunits","Dad1","effort","mechanisms","site of residence"],"language":"en"},

Most of the existing studies assumed that all infected individuals can transmit disease- related information or can be perceived by their neighbors. However, owing to lack of distinct symptoms for patients in the initial stage of infection, the disease information cannot be transmitted in the population, which may lead to the wrong perception of infection risk and inappropriate behavior response. In this work, we divide infected individuals into Exposed-state (without obvious clinical symptoms) individuals and Infected-state (with evident clinical symptoms) individuals, both of whom can spread disease, but only Infected-state individuals can diffuse disease information. Then, in this work we establish UAU-SEIS (Unaware\u2013Aware\u2013Unaware\u2013Susceptible\u2013Exposed\u2013Infected\u2013Susceptible) model in multiplex networks and analyze the effect of asymptomatic infection and the isolation of Infected-state individuals on the density of infection and the epidemic threshold. Furthermore, we extend the UAU-SEIS model by taking the individual heterogeneity into consideration. Combined Markov chain approach and Monte-Carlo Simulations, we find that asymptomatic infection has an effect on the density of infected individuals and the epidemic threshold, and the extent of the effect is influenced by whether Infected-state individuals are isolated or treated. In addition, results show that the individual heterogeneity can lower the density of infected individuals, but cannot enhance the epidemic threshold.","publish_time":"2019-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Tianyu; Long, Ting; Pan, Yaohui; Zhang, Wensi; Dong, Chao; Yin, Qiuju","journal":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c4aa83e7c5b990b8b14fa2f9cf017f3f5b5ffb7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125818.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437119306405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288109/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2019.04.266; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378437119306405","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs0NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Markov"],"organizations":["Monte-Carlo Simulations"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Infected-state individuals","density of infected individuals","isolation of Infected","density of infection","Exposed-state","disease information","epidemic threshold","effect of asymptomatic infection","disease- related information","epidemic spreading","initial stage of infection","obvious clinical symptoms","evident clinical symptoms","wrong perception of infection risk","individual heterogeneity","UAU-SEIS model","lack of distinct symptoms","self-protective behavior","multiplex networks","inappropriate behavior response","Abstract Multiplex network theory","Monte-Carlo Simulations","patients","dynamical interplay","Combined Markov chain approach","understanding","results","extent","existing studies","addition","consideration","population","neighbors"],"language":"en"},

Social distancing is an important public health strategy for controlling the spread of the virus and minimizing its impact on the older adult population. It comes at a cost, however. Loneliness is associated with myriad adverse health outcomes, one of which is impaired immune functioning, which adds even greater risk for corona virus infection, complications and death. Older adults, therefore, are at compound risk, making effective management of loneliness and social isolation in our older patients a high priority target for preventive intervention. In this paper, we describe a cognitive-behavioral framework for social connectedness, including evidence-informed strategies clinicians can use to help patients develop a \u2018Connections Plan\u2019 to stay connected and promote their social, mental, and physical health during \u2018social distancing\u2019 restrictions.

Available therapeutic agents require long term administration with numerous side effects. Therefore, there is a dire need to find alternative treatment options for this disease. Since ancient times, medicinal plants are widely used to cure various diseases with no or less harmful effects. Therefore, this study was designed to find out phytochemicals and investigate antiviral activity of methanol extract of Ajuga bracteosa, Ajuga parviflora, Berberis lycium and Citrus lemon against Hepatitis C Virus (HCV infection). Phytochemical analysis of the plant extract was performed using various chemical tests. Toxicity of the plant extract was determined against using trypan blue exclusion method. Antiviral activity of the selected plant extract was find out against HCV infected HepG2 cells. For this purpose, HepG2 cells were seeded with HCV positive and negative serum and nontoxic doses of plant extract for 24 and 48 h. After this RNA was extracted and viral load was determined using Real-time PCR. Phytochemical analysis showed the presence of flavonoids and phenols in all plant extracts while amino acids, alkaloids and tannins were present in B. lycium and saponins were detected in C. lemon. Toxicity assay showed that all plant extracts were nontoxic at maximum concentration of 200 \u03BCg/ml except B. lycium, which showed mild toxicity at 40 \u03BCg/ml and were extremely toxic at 60 \u03BCg/ml and above doses. Real-time PCR quantitation result revealed that after 24 h treatments A. parviflora showed highest antiviral activity, followed by A. bracteosa, while B. lycium extract had low (35%) and C. lemon has no antiviral effects. The 48 h treatments showed an increase antiviral activity by A. bracteosa followed by A. parviflora and B. lycium while C. lemon showed negative effect.

Chest CT has a higher sensitivity and can play an essential role in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease.

We found that extensive inflammation of the bilateral and respiratory bronchioles in patients with COVID-19 due to excessive activation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemotactic aggregation of T-lymphocytes at the site of inflammation are possible mechanisms underlying chest distress and dyspnea in patients with COVID-19. Short-time and lose-dose use of corticosteroid may be helpful to treat chest tightness and dyspnea in mild COVID-19 patients.

The mental status of patients with COVID-19 who have been quarantined and the interactions between their psychological distress and physiological levels of inflammation have yet to be analyzed. Using a mixed-method triangulation design (QUAN \u002B QUAL), this study investigated and compared the mental status and inflammatory markers of 103 patients who, while hospitalized with mild symptoms, tested positive with COVID-19 and 103 matched controls that were COVID-19 negative. The severity of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) was measured via an on-line survey. Using a convenience sampling technique, qualitative data were collected until the point of data saturation. In addition, a semi-structured interview was conducted among five patients with COVID-19. Peripheral inflammatory markers were also collected in patients, both at baseline and within \u00B1 three days of completing the on-line survey. Results revealed that COVID-19 patients, when compared to non-COVID controls, manifested higher levels of depression (P \u003C 0.001), anxiety (P \u003C 0.001), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (P \u003C 0.001). A gender effect was observed in the score of \u201CPerceived Helplessness\u201D, the subscale of PSS-10, with female patients showing higher scores compared to male patients (Z = 2.56, P = 0.010), female (Z = 2.37, P = 0.018) and male controls (Z = 2.87, P = 0.004). Levels of CRP, a peripheral inflammatory indicator, correlated positively with the PHQ-9 total score (R = .37, P = 0.003, Spearman\u2019s correlation) of patients who presented symptoms of depression. Moreover, the change of CRP level from baseline inversely correlated with the PHQ-9 total score (R = -0.31, P = 0.002), indicative of improvement of depression symptoms. Qualitative analysis revealed similar results with respect to patient reports of negative feelings, including fear, guilt, and helplessness. Stigma and uncertainty of viral disease progression were two main concerns expressed by COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that significant psychological distress was experienced by hospitalized COVID-19 patients and that levels of depressive features may be related to the inflammation markers in these patients. Thus, we recommend that necessary measures should be provided to address depression and other psychiatric symptoms for COVID-19 patients and attention should be paid to patient perceived stigma and coping strategies when delivering psychological interventions.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Qian; Zheng, Yuchen; Shi, Jia; Wang, Jijun; Li, Guanjun; Li, Chunbo; Fromson, John A.; Xu, Yong; Liu, Xiaohua; Xu, Hua; Zhang, Tianhong; Lu, Yunfei; Chen, Xiaorong; Hu, Hao; Tang, Yingying; Yang, Shuwen; Zhou, Han; Wang, Xiaoliang; Chen, Haiying; Wang, Zhen; Yang, Zongguo","journal":"Brain, behavior, and immunity","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50d61e2d02d4ce946a82f473eb9a4af12b8ab9a7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159120306188?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32416290/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0889159120306188","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Spearman"],"organizations":["Corona Virus Disease","QUAN   QUAL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["female patients","hospitalized COVID","symptoms of depression","depression symptoms","mental status of patients","non-COVID controls","mild symptoms","psychiatric symptoms","manifested higher levels of depression","post-traumatic stress symptoms","Levels of CRP","severity of depression","Peripheral inflammatory markers","male controls","total score","inflammation markers","physiological levels of inflammation","patient perceived stigma","significant psychological distress","psychological interventions","similar results","qualitative data","levels of depressive features","matched controls","PHQ","anxiety","Perceived Helplessness","peripheral inflammatory indicator","baseline","on-line survey","higher scores","patient reports of negative feelings","Qualitative analysis","Corona Virus Disease","point of data saturation","change of CRP level","uncertainty of viral disease progression","respect","QUAN","coping strategies","main concerns","fear","mixed-method triangulation design","PTSS","convenience sampling technique","guilt","study","attention","semi-structured interview","subscale of PSS","indicative of improvement","Spearman\u2019s correlation","addition","interactions","days","cause","worldwide pandemic","gender effect","necessary measures","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, a high titer of anti-\u03B1-enolase antibodies was developed in a smaller proportion (7.4%) of these patients than in non-tumor-associated patients and healthy subjects. In the present study, we characterized polyclonal and single-chain variable fragment (scFv) anti-\u03B1-enolase antibodies from immunized chickens. The E. coli-derived recombinant \u03B1-enolase protein was purified to its high homogenicity as verified by SDS-PAGE. After the 4th immunization, a high titer of specific polyclonal anti-\u03B1-enolase antibodies was elicited in immunized chickens and specifically recognized the purified human \u03B1-enolase antigen as determined by Western blot and ELISA. The expressed heavy and light chain variable genes (VH and VL) were isolated from spleen B cells and amplified to construct phage antibody libraries containing scFv molecules. After four rounds of panning selection, the scFv antibodies of randomly chosen clones were expressed and their binding specificity to \u03B1-enolase protein was verified using competitive ELISA, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining. Nucleotide sequence analysis from 10 \u03B1-enolase binding clones showed that 3 (30%) clones used identical heavy and light genes for scFv antibody expression, as represented by EnL5. Notably, amino acid changes in complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) were more frequently observed than those in framework regions (FRs) in all clones, indicating a strong affinity selection through mutations. All together, it is believed that these polyclonal and scFv IgY antibodies may be helpful in the development of molecular diagnostic and therapeutic agents for lung cancers in the future.","publish_time":"2010-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leu, Sy-Jye; Lee, Yu-Ching; Shih, Neng-Yao; Huang, I-Jen; Liu, Ko-Jiunn; Lu, Hsu-Feng; Huang, Shih-Yi; Yang, Yi-Yuan","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0bf614ec42d27fa30f001e67ee0c2ae40fe8ed3b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112641.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20655599/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242710001960; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2010.06.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242710001960","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u03B1-enolase binding clones","scFv antibodies","high titer of anti-\u03B1-enolase antibodies","regulation of \u03B1","high titer of specific polyclonal anti-\u03B1-enolase antibodies","purified human \u03B1-enolase antigen","coli-derived recombinant \u03B1-enolase protein","scFv molecules","scFv antibody expression","light genes","light chain variable genes","high homogenicity","immunized chickens","non-tumor-associated patients","non-small cell lung cancers","single-chain variable fragment","competitive ELISA","binding specificity","framework regions","phage antibody libraries","strong affinity selection","rounds of panning selection","therapeutic agents","development of molecular diagnostic","VL","complementarity","flow cytometry","NSCLC","VH","immunofluorescence staining","healthy subjects","Western blot","Nucleotide sequence analysis","spleen B cells","amino acid changes","mutations","future","immunization","FRs","SDS-PAGE","present study","smaller proportion","CDRs","EnL5"],"language":"en"},

Adaptive heterologous immune responses have broad implications on infection, autoimmunity, allergy and transplant immunology. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved might ultimately open up possibilities for disease prevention, for example by vaccination. METHODS: A structured literature search was performed using Medline and PubMed to provide an overview of the current knowledge on respiratory-virus induced adaptive HI. RESULTS: In HI the immune response towards one antigen results in an alteration of the immune response towards a second antigen. We provide an overview of respiratory virus-induced HI, including viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), coronavirus (CoV) and influenza virus (IV). We discuss T cell receptor (TCR) and humoral cross-reactivity as mechanisms of HI involving those respiratory viruses. Topics covered include HI between respiratory viruses as well as between respiratory viruses and other pathogens. Newly developed vaccines which have the potential to provide protection against multiple virus strains are also discussed. Furthermore, respiratory viruses have been implicated in the development of autoimmune diseases, such as narcolepsy, Guillain\u2013Barr\u00E9 syndrome, type 1 diabetes or myocarditis. Finally, we discuss the role of respiratory viruses in asthma and the hygiene hypothesis, and review our recent findings on HI between IV and allergens, which leads to protection from experimental asthma. CONCLUSION: Respiratory-virus induced HI may have protective but also detrimental effects on the host. Respiratory viral infections contribute to asthma or autoimmune disease development, but on the other hand, a lack of microbial encounter is associated with an increasing number of allergic as well as autoimmune diseases. Future research might help identify the elements which determine a protective or detrimental outcome in HI-based mechanisms.","publish_time":"2018-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pusch, Emanuel; Renz, Harald; Skevaki, Chrysanthi","journal":"Allergo J Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/812e9c5b73d6d3539f601e9e7c5eba4ca245c08f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100437.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226720/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40629-018-0056-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Respiratory-virus induced HI","overview of respiratory virus-induced HI","respiratory syncytial virus","mechanisms of HI","role of respiratory viruses","adaptive HI","HI-based mechanisms","Respiratory viral infections","influenza virus","multiple virus strains","autoimmune disease development","development of autoimmune diseases","Adaptive heterologous immune responses","humoral cross-reactivity","current knowledge","experimental asthma","antigen results","protection","cellular cross-reactivity","detrimental outcome","heterologous immunity","detrimental effects","disease prevention","broad implications","autoimmunity","TCR","Barr\u00E9 syndrome","type","allergy","Medline","Guillain","coronavirus","rhinovirus","narcolepsy","potential","focus","RSV","hygiene hypothesis","structured literature search","lack of microbial encounter","diabetes","example","hand","T cell receptor","increasing number of allergic","elements","CoV","possibilities","recent findings","alteration","CONCLUSION","transplant immunology","METHODS","myocarditis","vaccination","PubMed","allergens","Topics","Future research","developed vaccines","host","better understanding","PURPOSE","pathogens"],"language":"en"},

We report herein that the interferon (IFN) stimulated exoribonuclease gene of 20 KD (ISG20) inhibits HBV replication through degradation of HBV RNA. ISG20 expression was observed at basal level and was highly upregulated upon IFN treatment in hepatocytes, and knock down of ISG20 resulted in elevation of HBV replication and attenuation of IFN-mediated antiviral effect. The sequence element conferring the susceptibility of HBV RNA to ISG20-mediated RNA degradation was mapped at the HBV RNA terminal redundant region containing epsilon (\u03B5) stem-loop. Furthermore, ISG20-induced HBV RNA degradation relies on its ribonuclease activity, as the enzymatic inactive form ISG20(D94G) was unable to promote HBV RNA decay. Interestingly, ISG20(D94G) retained antiviral activity against HBV DNA replication by preventing pgRNA encapsidation, resulting from a consequence of ISG20-\u03B5 interaction. This interaction was further characterized by in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and ISG20 was able to bind HBV \u03B5 directly in absence of any other cellular proteins, indicating a direct \u03B5 RNA binding capability of ISG20; however, cofactor(s) may be required for ISG20 to efficiently degrade \u03B5. In addition, the lower stem portion of \u03B5 is the major ISG20 binding site, and the removal of 4 base pairs from the bottom portion of \u03B5 abrogated the sensitivity of HBV RNA to ISG20, suggesting that the specificity of ISG20-\u03B5 interaction relies on both RNA structure and sequence. Furthermore, the C-terminal Exonuclease III (ExoIII) domain of ISG20 was determined to be responsible for interacting with \u03B5, as the deletion of ExoIII abolished in vitro ISG20-\u03B5 binding and intracellular HBV RNA degradation. Taken together, our study sheds light on the underlying mechanisms of IFN-mediated HBV inhibition and the antiviral mechanism of ISG20 in general.","publish_time":"2017-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Yuanjie; Nie, Hui; Mao, Richeng; Mitra, Bidisha; Cai, Dawei; Yan, Ran; Guo, Ju-Tao; Block, Timothy M.; Mechti, Nadir; Guo, Haitao","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f123d4b1f4b4e7a2f4fab9605258fbe053a2abd1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5388505.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006296; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28399146/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HBV","HBV RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HBV \u03B5","ISG20-\u03B5 binding","degradation of HBV RNA","ISG20-induced HBV RNA degradation","consequence of ISG20","domain of ISG20","specificity of ISG20","ISG20 expression","ISG20-mediated RNA degradation","susceptibility of HBV RNA","sensitivity of HBV RNA","HBV RNA decay","intracellular HBV RNA degradation","direct \u03B5 RNA binding capability of ISG20","antiviral mechanism of ISG20","\u03B5 interaction","HBV DNA replication","RNA structure","elevation of HBV replication","mediated HBV inhibition","HBV RNA terminal redundant region","major ISG20 binding site","enzymatic inactive form ISG20","viral RNA pregenome","lower stem portion of \u03B5","antiviral activity","attenuation of IFN","IFN treatment","underlying mechanisms of IFN","D94G","antiviral effect","ribonuclease activity","DNA genome","deletion of ExoIII","stem-loop","sequence element","C-terminal Exonuclease","epsilon","EMSA","reverse transcription","KD","stimulated exoribonuclease gene","removal","pgRNA encapsidation","electrophoretic mobility shift assay","basal level","cellular proteins","study sheds light","interferon","hepatocytes","absence","base pairs","Hepatitis B virus","addition","cofactor"],"language":"en"},

These types of networks are characterized as multiplex networks. A two-layered multiplex network model (usually composed of a virtual layer sustaining unaware-aware-unaware (UAU) dynamics and a physical one supporting susceptible-infected-recovered-dead (SIRD) process) is presented to investigate the spreading property of fatal epidemics in this manuscript. Due to the incorporation of the virtual layer, the recovered and dead individuals seem to play different roles in affecting the epidemic spreading process. In details, the corresponding nodes on the virtual layer for the recovered individuals are capable of transmitting information to other individuals, while the corresponding nodes for the dead individuals (which are to be eliminated) on the virtual layer should be removed as well. With the coupled UAU-SIRD model, the relationships between the focused variables and parameters of the epidemic are studied thoroughly. As indicated by the results, the range of affected individuals will be reduced by a large amount with the incorporation of virtual layers. Furthermore, the effects of recovery time on the epidemic spreading process are also investigated aiming to consider various physical conditions. Theoretical analyses are also derived for scenarios with and without required time periods for recovery which validates the reducing effects of incorporating virtual layers on the epidemic spreading process.","publish_time":"2019-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Peican; Wang, Xinyu; Li, Shudong; Guo, Yangming; Wang, Zhen","journal":"Applied Mathematics and Computation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/900dde3dc5646686fe481d388e8dd5be375aaba8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112296.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287502/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0096300319301535; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0096300319301535; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amc.2019.02.049","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dead individuals","recovered individuals","process","incorporation of virtual layers","multiplex networks","different layers","complex networks","types of networks","range of affected individuals","dynamics of isolated networks","various relationships","corresponding nodes","layered multiplex network model","effects of recovery time","coupled UAU-SIRD model","spreading property of fatal epidemics","various physical conditions","unaware-aware","different roles","layered properties","reducing effects","time periods","network activities","connections","capable of transmitting information","focused variables","scenarios","parameters","susceptible-infected","existence of common components","manuscript","results","Abstract Numerous efforts","Theoretical analyses","practice","details"],"language":"en"},

In-house molecular diagnostic methods for this virus termed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) allowed sensitive MERS-CoV RNA detection in patient samples. Fast diagnosis is important to manage human cases and trace possible contacts. Objectives The aim of this study was to improve the availability of existing nucleic acid amplification-based diagnostic methods for MERS-CoV infections by providing a real-time RT-PCR kit, including an internal control and two target regions recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). And to validate this kit (RealStar\u00AE MERS-CoV RT-PCR kit 1.0, Altona Diagnostics GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) using clinical samples of one MERS-CoV case from Munich and respiratory samples of patients with other respiratory diseases. Study design An internal amplification control was included into the RT-PCR assays targeting the genomic region upstream of the Envelope gene (upE) and within open reading frame (ORF) 1A. Based on these assays, a ready-to-use real-time RT-PCR kit featuring both the upE and ORF1A assays was developed, validated and compared to the established in-house versions. Results The performance of both RT-PCR assays included in the kit is comparable to the in-house assays. They show high analytical sensitivity (upE: 5.3 copies/reaction; ORF1A: 9.3 copies/reaction), no cross-reactivity with other respiratory pathogens and detected MERS-CoV RNA in patient samples in almost the same manner as the in-house versions.

We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n = 28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n = 18). In addition, we adjust for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase. Results Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9). Conclusions The serial interval of COVID-19 is close to or shorter than its median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The COVID-19 serial interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval may introduce bias.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nishiura, Hiroshi; Linton, Natalie M.; Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R.","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40838e5720bb4e13e5b459e3fb1f1d095ed33549.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e44b1713295bc4efbd758d8886b84fb68c725325.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220301193; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.02.060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32145466/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220301193","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["median serial interval","serial interval of COVID","SARS serial interval","credible interval","serial interval of novel coronavirus","serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome","certain pairs","subset of pairs","secondary cases","days","right truncation","infector-infectee pairs","CrI","dates of illness onset","median incubation period","primary cases","substantial proportion of secondary transmission","published research articles","infectors","infectees","case investigation reports","highest certainty","epidemic","reporting","information","calculations","analyses","Results Accounting","Methods","Abstract Objective","bias","Conclusions","growth phase","dataset","credibility","addition"],"language":"en"},

Antibody plays distinct roles in controlling DENV infections. Neutralizing antibody is protective against DENV infection, whereas sub-neutralizing concentration of antibody can increase DENV infection, termed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Plaque-based assay represents the most widely accepted method measuring neutralizing or enhancing antibodies. RESULTS: In this study, a novel reporter virus-based system was developed for measuring neutralization and ADE activity. A stable Renilla luciferase reporter DENV (Luc-DENV) that can produce robust luciferase signals in BHK-21 and K562 cells were used to establish the assay and validated against traditional plaque-based assay. Luciferase value analysis using various known DENV-specific monoclonal antibodies showed good repeatability and a well linear correlation with conventional plaque-based assays. The newly developed assay was finally validated with clinical samples from infected animals and individuals. CONCLUSIONS: This reporter virus-based assay for neutralizing and enhancing antibody evaluation is rapid, lower cost, and high throughput, and will be helpful for laboratory detection and epidemiological investigation for DENV antibodies.","publish_time":"2014-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Ke-Yu; Zhao, Hui; Jiang, Zhen-You; Li, Xiao-Feng; Deng, Yong-Qiang; Jiang, Tao; Zhu, Shun-Ya; Shi, Pei-Yong; Zhang, Bo; Zhang, Fu-Chun; Qin, E-De; Qin, Cheng-Feng","journal":"BMC Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb6a9f522a87a780723faca7cde002ece6dbfb48.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3930823.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548533/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2180-14-44","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV","ADE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DENV antibodies","Luc-DENV","DENV infections","Neutralizing antibody","reporter virus-based assay","traditional plaque-based assay","developed assay","stable Renilla luciferase reporter DENV","antibody evaluation","sub-neutralizing concentration of antibody","novel reporter virus-based system","various known DENV-specific monoclonal antibodies","conventional plaque-based assays","termed antibody-dependent enhancement","Dengue virus","Luciferase value analysis","robust luciferase signals","ADE activity","good repeatability","linear correlation","vaccine","lower cost","epidemiological investigation","clinical samples","laboratory detection","BHK","high throughput","global public health threat","accepted method","infected animals","individuals","neutralization","study","distinct roles","antiviral therapy","K562 cells","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The objectives of the present study were to identify RV in patients with CAP using three different sampling methods and to compare CAP virus proportions and types with two comparison groups. Methods The study population included 183 adult patients with CAP, 450 control subjects, and 201 patients with nonpneumonic lower respiratory tract infection (NPLRTI). Each participant was sampled by oropharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal swab, and nasopharyngeal washing, and the samples were tested for detection of 12 RVs by multiplex TaqMan Hydrolysis probe-based real-time polymerase chain reaction (Integrated DNA Technology; Coralville, IA). Results At least one RV was identified in 58 patients with CAP (31.7%) compared with 32 (7.1%) in control subjects and 104 (51.7%) in patients with NPLRTI (P \u003C .01 and P \u003C .01, respectively).

In cells infected with coronaviruses, cell cycle perturbation and apoptosis were observed in several reports. However, little is known about how these effects are brought out, and how manipulation of the functions of host cells would influence the replication cycle of coronavirus. In this study, we demonstrate that infection with coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) imposed a growth-inhibitory effect on cultured cells by inducing cell cycle arrest at S and G2/M phases in both p53-null cell line H1299 and Vero cells. This cell cycle arrest was catalyzed by the modulation of various cell cycle regulatory genes and the accumulation of hypophosphorylated RB, but was independent of p53. Proteasome inhibitors, such as lactacystin and NLVS, could bypass the IBV-induced S-phase arrest by restoring the expression of corresponding cyclin/Cdk complexes. Our data also showed that cell cycle arrest at both S- and G2/M-phases was manipulated by IBV for the enhancement of viral replication. In addition, apoptosis induced by IBV at late stages of the infection cycle in cultured cells was shown to be p53-independent. This conclusion was drawn based on the observations that apoptosis occurred in both IBV-infected H1299 and Vero cells, and that IBV infection did not affect the expression of p53 in host cells.","publish_time":"2007-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Frank Q.; Tam, James P.; Liu, Ding Xiang","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af0efc5d9d9fc5e1f93adac59a1da9090d817a20.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103336.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682207002565; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682207002565","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Vero","NLVS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell cycle arrest","cell cycle perturbation","IBV infection","cultured cells","Vero cells","replication cycle of coronavirus","IBV-infected H1299","functions of host cells","modulation of various cell cycle regulatory genes","IBV-induced S-phase arrest","p53-null cell line H1299","expression of p53","independent of p53","p53-independent","induction of apoptosis","infection cycles","G2","phases","Abstract Manipulation","expression of corresponding cyclin","enhancement of viral replication","coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus","accumulation of hypophosphorylated RB","late stages","growth-inhibitory effect","coronaviruses","Cdk complexes","common strategies","observations","lactacystin","NLVS","data","Proteasome inhibitors","conclusion","addition","study","reports","effects"],"language":"en"},

The prevalence of IBV in quail industry in Malaysia was not well documented; therefore, its actual role in the epidemiology of the disease is relatively unknown. This study was to determine the susceptibility of Japanese quail, as one of the species in commercial poultry industry, toward IBV. In addition, it will also give a potential impact on the overall health management in the quail industry even though it had been established that quail are resistant to diseases affecting poultry. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first experimental study on IBV inoculation in quail. In this experimental study, 20 quails were divided into 4 groups (n = 5 for group A, B, and C, n = 5 for control group). The quails in group A, B, and C were infected via intraocular and intranasal routes with 0.2 mL of 10 \u00D7 5 EID50 of the virus. Clinical signs, gross lesions, positive detection of virus, and trachea histopathological scoring were used to assess the susceptibility of these Japanese quails. The results have indicated mild ruffled feathers and watery feces in these inoculated birds. Trachea, lung, and kidney were subjected to one-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for virus detection. The virus was found from trachea and lung samples, whereas it was absent from all kidney samples. Only 3 quails were found with gross lesions. There was a significant difference of tracheal lesion by 0.009 \u00B1 0.845 (P \u003C 0.05) within the treatment groups. In summary, Japanese quails might be susceptible to IBV.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fadhilah, A. S.; Kai, T. H.; Lokman, H. I.; Yasmin, N.A.R.; Hafandi, A.; Hasliza, A.

At the genetic and structural level, HCoV-NL63 is similar to other members of the Coronavirinae subfamily, especially human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). Detailed analysis, however, reveals several unique features of the pathogen. The coronaviral nucleocapsid protein is abundantly present in infected cells. It is a multi-domain, multi-functional protein important for viral replication and a number of cellular processes. The aim of the present study was to characterize the HCoV-NL63 nucleocapsid protein. Biochemical analyses revealed that the protein shares characteristics with homologous proteins encoded in other coronaviral genomes, with the N-terminal domain responsible for nucleic acid binding and the C-terminal domain involved in protein oligomerization. Surprisingly, analysis of the subcellular localization of the N protein of HCoV-NL63 revealed that, differently than homologous proteins from other coronaviral species except for SARS-CoV, it is not present in the nucleus of infected or transfected cells. Furthermore, no significant alteration in cell cycle progression in cells expressing the protein was observed.

Macro domains are also encoded by a set of positive-strand RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of animal cells, including coronaviruses and alphaviruses. The functions of the macro domain are poorly understood, but it has been suggested to be an ADP-ribose-binding module. We have here characterized three novel human macro domain proteins that were found to reside either in the cytoplasm and nucleus [macro domain protein 2 (MDO2) and ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 2] or in mitochondria [macro domain protein 1 (MDO1)], and compared them with viral macro domains from Semliki Forest virus, hepatitis E virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and with a yeast macro protein, Poa1p. MDO2 specifically bound monomeric ADP-ribose with a high affinity (K d =0.15 \u03BCM), but did not bind poly(ADP-ribose) efficiently. MDO2 also hydrolyzed ADP-ribose-1\u2033 phosphate, resembling Poa1p in all these properties. Ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 2 did not show affinity for ADP-ribose or its derivatives, but instead bound poly(A). MDO1 was generally active in these reactions, including poly(A) binding. Individual point mutations in MDO1 abolished monomeric ADP-ribose binding, but not poly(ADP-ribose) binding; in poly(ADP-ribose) binding assays, the monomer did not compete against polymer binding. The viral macro proteins bound poly(ADP-ribose) and poly(A), but had a low affinity for monomeric ADP-ribose. Thus, the viral proteins do not closely resemble any of the human proteins in their biochemical functions. The differential activity profiles of the human proteins implicate them in different cellular pathways, some of which may involve RNA rather than ADP-ribose derivatives.","publish_time":"2009-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Neuvonen, Maarit; Ahola, Tero","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/abb20089fe55f2cb3c95114cbe9cd6c6cc9e087f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094737.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18983849/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002228360801334X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002228360801334X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2008.10.045","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ADP-ribose derivatives","monomeric ADP-ribose binding","viral macro proteins","yeast macro protein","Abstract Macro domain","bound poly","novel human macro domain proteins","viral macro domains","conserved protein domain","human proteins","viral proteins","binding assays","binding module","polymer binding","MDO1","MDO2","ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein","high affinity","low affinity","resembling Poa1p","biochemical functions","hepatitis E virus","Semliki Forest virus","cytoplasm of animal cells","strand RNA viruses","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","mitochondria","Individual point mutations","set of positive","coronaviruses","differential activity profiles","eukaryotes","phosphate","nucleus","different cellular pathways","alphaviruses","reactions","properties","\u03BCM","prokaryotes"],"language":"en"},

A new strain of H1N1 influenza, also known as swine flu was confirmed in the UK in May 2009 and has spread to over 100 countries around the world causing the World Health Organization to declare a global flu pandemic. The primary objectives of this review are to identify the key demographic and attitudinal determinants of three types of protective behaviour during a pandemic: preventive, avoidant, and management of illness behaviours, in order to describe conceptual frameworks in which to better understand these behaviours and to inform future communications and interventions in the current outbreak of swine flu and subsequent influenza pandemics. Methods. Web of Science and PubMed databases were searched for references to papers on severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza/flu, H5N1, swine influenza/flu, H1N1, and pandemics. Forward searching of the identified references was also carried out. In addition, references were gleaned from an expert panel of the Behaviour and Communications sub\u2010group of the UK Scientific Pandemic Influenza Advisory Group. Papers were included if they reported associations between demographic factors, attitudes, and a behavioural measure (reported, intended, or actual behaviour). Results. Twenty\u2010six papers were identified that met the study inclusion criteria. The studies were of variable quality and most lacked an explicit theoretical framework. Most were cross\u2010sectional in design and therefore not predictive over time. The research shows that there are demographic differences in behaviour: being older, female and more educated, or non\u2010White, is associated with a higher chance of adopting the behaviours. There is evidence that greater levels of perceived susceptibility to and perceived severity of the diseases and greater belief in the effectiveness of recommended behaviours to protect against the disease are important predictors of behaviour. There is also evidence that greater levels of state anxiety and greater trust in authorities are associated with behaviour. Conclusions. The findings from this review can be broadly explained by theories of health behaviour. However, theoretically driven prospective studies are required to further clarify the relationship between demographic factors, attitudes, and behaviour. The findings suggest that intervention studies and communication strategies should focus on particular demographic groups and on raising levels of perceived threat of the pandemic disease and belief in the effectiveness of measures designed to protect against it.","publish_time":"2010-12-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bish, Alison; Michie, Susan","journal":"Br J Health Psychol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3e8bcf5b115da5656e780b655650e6cfdaf89de.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185452.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1348/135910710x485826; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20109274/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","World Health Organization","UK Scientific Pandemic Influenza Advisory Group"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["actual behaviour","swine influenza","theories of health behaviour","demographic factors","global flu pandemic","types of protective behaviour","important predictors of behaviour","avian influenza","greater belief","pandemic disease","key demographic","demographic differences","papers","greater levels of perceived susceptibility","subsequent influenza pandemics","UK Scientific Pandemic Influenza Advisory Group","current outbreak of swine flu","greater trust","identified references","levels of perceived threat","particular demographic groups","effectiveness of recommended behaviours","greater levels of state anxiety","new strain of H1N1 influenza","perceived severity","attitudes","evidence","management of illness behaviours","intervention studies","review","findings","Communications sub\u2010group","World Health Organization","driven prospective studies","future communications","effectiveness of measures","severe acute respiratory syndrome","communication strategies","H5N1","attitudinal determinants","order","interventions","avoidant","preventive","authorities","diseases","PubMed databases","expert panel","female","associations","variable quality","design","explicit theoretical framework","non\u2010White","Web of Science","relationship","conceptual frameworks","behavioural measure","higher chance","study inclusion criteria","time","primary objectives","countries","research","addition","Purpose","Methods","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

To understanding the epidemiological role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, we utilized an iterative empirical process in Geographic Information System (GIS) to identify and qualify potential hotspots for maintenance and circulation of MERS-CoV, and produced risk-based surveillance sites in Kenya. Data on camel population and distribution were used to develop camel density map, while camel farming system was defined using multi-factorial criteria including the agro-ecological zones (AEZs), production and marketing practices. Primary and secondary MERS-CoV seroprevalence data from specific sites were analyzed, and location-based prevalence matching with camel densities was conducted. High-risk convergence points (migration zones, trade routes, camel markets, slaughter slabs) were profiled and frequent cross-border camel movement mapped. Results showed that high camel-dense areas and interaction (markets and migration zones) were potential hotspot for transmission and spread. Cross-border contacts occurred with in-migrated herds at hotspot locations. AEZ differential did not influence risk distribution and plausible risk factors for spatial MERS-CoV hotspots were camel densities, previous cases of MERS-CoV, high seroprevalence and points of camel convergences. Although Kenyan camels are predisposed to MERS-CoV, no shedding is documented to date. These potential hotspots, determined using anthropogenic, system and trade characterizations should guide selection of sampling/surveillance sites, high-risk locations, critical areas for interventions and policy development in Kenya, as well as instigate further virological examination of camels.

Two approaches were used to collect data: i) technical visits to the facilities involved with border surveillance and application of a questionnaire survey; ii) application of an online questionnaire survey. It was identified that, for both surveillance systems, more than 55% of the technicians had realized that the BES and its activities have high priority. Eighty percent of North American and 71% of Brazilian border jurisdictions reported an exchange of information between countries. Less than half of the jurisdictions reported that the necessary tools to carry out information exchange were available. Operational attributes of completeness, feedback, reciprocity, and quality of information were identified as weak or of low quality in both systems.

Commercially available vaccines are only partially effective in protection against PRRSV. Moreover, modified live vaccines may allow virus shedding, and could revert generating virulent phenotypes. Therefore, new efficient vaccines are required. Vaccines based on recombinant virus genomes (virus vectored vaccines) against PRRSV could represent a safe alternative for the generation of modified live vaccines. In this paper, current vectored vaccines to protect against PRRSV are revised, including those based on pseudorabies virus, poxvirus, adenovirus, and virus replicons. Special attention has been provided to the use of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) as vector for the expression of PRRSV antigens. This vector has the capability of expressing high levels of heterologous genes, is a potent interferon-\u03B1 inducer, and presents antigens in mucosal surfaces, eliciting both secretory and systemic immunity. A TGEV derived vector (rTGEV) was generated, expressing PRRSV wild type or modified GP5 and M proteins, described as the main inducers of neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune response, respectively. Protection experiments showed that vaccinated animals developed a faster and stronger humoral immune response than the non-vaccinated ones. Partial protection in challenged animals was observed, as vaccinated pigs showed decreased lung damage when compared with the non-vaccinated ones. Nevertheless, the level of neutralizing antibodies was low, what may explain the limited protection observed. Several strategies are proposed to improve current rTGEV vectors expressing PRRSV antigens.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cruz, Jazmina L.G.; Z\u00FA\u00F1iga, Sonia; B\u00E9cares, Martina; Sola, Isabel; Ceriani, Juan E.; Juanola, Sandra; Plana, Juan; Enjuanes, Luis","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b8a5807787e87b541322eb4d45593d7f3e00631.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114413.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2010.06.017; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170210002017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20600388/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170210002017","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs0ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV","TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus vectored vaccines","Abstract PRRSV","available vaccines","current vectored vaccines","expression of PRRSV antigens","virus shedding","pseudorabies virus","virus replicons","generation of modified live vaccines","vaccinated animals","PRRSV wild type","new efficient vaccines","recombinant virus genomes","non-vaccinated ones","vaccinated pigs","Partial protection","Protection experiments","limited protection","use of transmissible gastroenteritis virus","TGEV derived vector","modified GP5","cellular immune response","current rTGEV vectors","level of neutralizing antibodies","stronger humoral immune response","challenged animals","main inducers of neutralizing antibodies","swine herds","important infectious disease","causative agent","high levels of heterologous genes","proteins","decreased lung damage","poxvirus","adenovirus","potent interferon-\u03B1 inducer","safe alternative","mucosal surfaces","capability","great economic losses","paper","systemic immunity","strategies","virulent phenotypes","Special attention"],"language":"en"},

In this preliminary study, we collected 109 fecal specimens during April\u2013July 2011 from a colony of straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) in an urban park (Agodi Gardens) of Ibadan, Nigeria, and analyzed for Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia duodenalis and E. bieneusi using PCR targeting the small subunit rRNA gene, triosephosphate isomerase gene, and ribosomal internal transcribed spacer, respectively. Genotypes of these enteric parasites were determined by DNA sequencing of the PCR products. Altogether, 6 (5.5%), 0 and 16 (14.7%) specimens were positive for Cryptosporidium spp., G. duodenalis, and E. bieneusi, respectively. DNA sequence analysis of the PCR products indicated the presence of two novel Cryptosporidium genotypes named as bat genotype XIV (in 5 specimens) and bat genotype XV (in 1 specimen) and one known E. bieneusi genotype (Type IV in 1 specimen) and two novel E. bieneusi genotypes (Bat1 in 13 specimens and Bat2 in 2 specimens). In phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences, the two novel Cryptosporidium genotypes were genetically related to Bat genotype II previously identified in fruit bats in China and Philippines, whereas the two novel E. bieneusi genotypes were genetically related to Group 5, which contains several known genotypes from primates. With the exception of Type IV, none of the Cryptosporidium and E. bieneusi genotypes found in bats in this study are known human pathogens. Thus, straw-colored fruit bats in Nigeria are mainly infected with host-adapted Cryptosporidium and E. bieneusi genotypes.","publish_time":"2018-12-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Na; Ayinmode, Adekunle B.; Zhang, Hongwei; Feng, Yaoyu; Xiao, Lihua","journal":"Int J Parasitol Parasites Wildl","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d71ce9edcc0e1fdc375e7aadb23b21aea86ff228.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3aa2b50cbe082c95f23df885e74ca9648046d10c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6289945.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221322441830141X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221322441830141X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560054/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijppaw.2018.12.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs1MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":["Nigeria","China","Philippines"],"keyphrases":["novel Cryptosporidium genotypes","Enterocytozoon bieneusi genotypes","known genotypes","bat genotype","host-adapted Cryptosporidium","fecal specimens","human infective potential of Cryptosporidium","colony of straw-colored fruit bats","PCR products","DNA sequencing","DNA sequence analysis","Nigeria","phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences","exception of Type IV","human pathogens","Giardia duodenalis","preliminary study","triosephosphate isomerase gene","small subunit rRNA gene","Eidolon helvum","distribution","urban park","ribosomal internal transcribed spacer","Agodi Gardens","Bat1","presence","Ibadan","enteric parasites","Philippines","China","Bat2","Group","data","primates"],"language":"en"},

Currently, the vaccines of PEDV are only partially effective and there is no specific drug available for treatment of PEDV infection. To exploit the possibility of using RNA interference (RNAi) as a strategy against PEDV infection, five shRNA-expressing plasmids targeting the N, M, and S genes of PEDV were constructed and transfected into Vero cells. The cytopathic effect and MTS assays demonstrated that two shRNAs (pSilencer4.1-M1 and pSilencer4.1-N) were capable of protecting cells against PEDV invasion with very high specificity and efficiency. The two shRNA expression plasmids were also able to inhibit the PEDV replication significantly, as shown by detection of virus titers (TCID(50)/mL). A real-time quantitative RT-PCR further confirmed that the amounts of viral RNAs in cell cultures pre-transfected with these two plasmids were reduced by 95.0 %.

We report our experience in treating SARS patients. Methods From April 27 to May 24, 2003, a total of 36 patients with probable SARS were admitted and treated in a hospital rearranged as a special center for the management of SARS patients. Medical records for the patients were retrospectively reviewed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine factors associated with respiratory failure and intubation. Results Of the 36 patients with probable SARS (median age, 37 years; range, 22-66 years), 9 were male and 27 were female. Thirty-two patients (88.9%) were infected in the hospital setting. All patients presented with fever, and 33 eventually developed lymphopenia during hospitalization. Chest radiography showed no unique pattern, but pleural effusion was not seen. All patients initially received empiric antibacterial therapy against common causative pathogens of atypical pneumonia. Ribavirin was given to all except 1 patient. Twenty-two patients received immunoglobulin therapy, and 32 were given corticosteroids. A total of 20 patients (55.6%) required supplemental oxygen, and 8 (22.2%) were intubated with mechanical ventilatory support. Two of these patients died. A higher body temperature at presentation (median 39.5 vs 38.6\u00B0C), and higher peak values of lactate dehydrogenase (410 vs 282 U/L) and C-reactive protein (10.2 vs 2.5 mg/dL), were associated with subsequent respiratory failure. Multivariate analysis showed that peak level of C-reactive protein was the only independent predictor of respiratory failure and intubation (odds ratio for every increment of 1 mg/dL = 1.45; 95% confidence interval = 1.003, 2.097; p = 0.048). Conclusion All patients with probable SARS who were admitted to hospital presented with fever and lymphopenia. While the efficacy of different treatments could not be evaluated from this retrospective study, a higher value of C-reactive protein was associated with the development of respiratory failure and subsequent intubation.","publish_time":"2005-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Chun-Yu; Huang, Lin-Ju; Lai, Chung-Hsu; Chen, Hsin-Pai; Chen, Te-Li; Fung, Chang-Phone; Li, Cheng-Yi","journal":"Journal of the Chinese Medical Association","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f1486ab56384c1575a8e7bfdaf06fc8df348820f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S172649010970231X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S172649010970231X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs2NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["management of SARS patients","probable SARS","subsequent respiratory failure","C-reactive protein","development of respiratory failure","vs","independent predictor of respiratory failure","higher value of C","subsequent intubation","peak level of C","years","hospital setting","lymphopenia","fever","total","Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome","higher body temperature","higher peak values of lactate dehydrogenase","median age","immunoglobulin therapy","Multivariate analysis","multivariate analyses","empiric antibacterial therapy","common causative pathogens of atypical pneumonia","unique pattern","presentation","odds ratio","factors","special center","emerging viral infectious disease","range","retrospective study","Chest radiography","pleural effusion","increment","Conclusion","mechanical ventilatory support","confidence interval","efficacy of different treatments","Medical records","Results","experience","supplemental oxygen","female","hospitalization","corticosteroids","Methods","Ribavirin"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we present evidence that virion disassembly is a key determinant of reovirus oncolysis. To penetrate cell membranes and initiate infection, the outermost capsid proteins of reovirus must be proteolyzed to generate a disassembled particle called an infectious subviral particle (ISVP). In fibroblasts, this process is mediated by the endo/lysosomal proteases cathepsins B and L. We have analyzed the early events of infection in reovirus-susceptible and -resistant cells. We find that, in contrast to susceptible glioma cells and Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells, reovirus-resistant cancer cells and untransformed NIH3T3 cells restrict virion uncoating and subsequent gene expression. Disassembly-restrictive cells support reovirus infection, as in vitro-generated ISVPs establish productive infection, and pretreatment with poly(I:C) does not prevent infection in cancer cells. We find that the level of active cathepsin B and L is increased in tumors and that disassembly-restrictive glioma cells support reovirus oncolysis when grown as a tumor in vivo.

Since its introduction to the United States in 2013, PEDV has spread quickly across the country and has caused significant financial losses to pork producers. With no fully licensed vaccines currently available in the United States, prevention and control of PEDV disease is heavily reliant on biosecurity measures. Despite proven, effective biosecurity practices, multiple sites and production stages, within and across designated production flows in an Ohio swine operation broke with confirmed PEDV in January 2014, leading the producer and attending veterinarian to investigate the route of introduction. CASE PRESENTATION: On January 12, 2014, several sows within a production flow were noted with signs of enteric illness. Within a few days, illness had spread to most of the sows in the facility and was confirmed by RT-PCR to be PEDV. Within a short time period, confirmed disease was present on multiple sites within and across breeding and post weaning production flows of the operation and mortality approached 100% in neonatal piglets. After an epidemiologic investigation, an outsourced, pelleted piglet diet was identified for assessment, and a bioassay, where na\u00EFve piglets were fed the suspected feed pellets, was initiated to test the pellets for infectious PEDV. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological investigation provided strong evidence for contaminated feed as the source of the outbreak. In addition, feed pellets collected from unopened bags at the affected sites tested positive for PEDV using RT-PCR. However, the bioassay study was not able to show infectivity when feeding the suspected feed pellets to a small number of na\u00EFve piglets. The results highlight the critical need for surveillance of feed and feed components to further define transmission avenues in an effort to limit the spread of PEDV throughout the U.S. swine industry.","publish_time":"2015-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bowman, Andrew S; Krogwold, Roger A; Price, Todd; Davis, Matt; Moeller, Steven J","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e55726d345571690d0e3046664cfac5003c2a89.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4334577.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25881144/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-015-0348-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea","PEDV"],"locations":["United States","U.S."],"keyphrases":["confirmed PEDV","spread of PEDV","infectious PEDV","control of PEDV disease","suspected feed pellets","contaminated feed","surveillance of feed","feed components","neonatal piglets","production stages","multiple sites","designated production flows","weaning production flows","affected sites","severe enteric disease","United States","small number of na\u00EFve piglets","RT-PCR","sows","Ohio swine operation","signs of enteric illness","epidemiological investigation","epidemiologic investigation","biosecurity measures","swine industry","bioassay study","route of introduction","effective biosecurity practices","strong evidence","unopened bags","prevention","significant financial losses","pelleted piglet diet","Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus","infectivity","breeding","mortality","critical need","transmissible coronavirus","pork producers","BACKGROUND","assessment","transmission avenues","source","country","effort","short time period","licensed vaccines","results","veterinarian","CONCLUSIONS","addition","facility","outbreak","CASE PRESENTATION","days"],"language":"en"},

SUMMARY The practice of tattoo is developing more and more all over the world. Infections are known. but chronic inflammatory reactions have often resulted in a variety of clinical manifestations. In addition to allergic reactions, non-allergic reactions prevail in black tattoos and manifest themselves as \u0022papulonodular\u0022 lesions. The importance of biopsy of papulonodular lesions to confirm the diagnosis should be emphasized. Carbon black nanoparticles agglomerate in the dermis over time to form sarcoid granulomas. Pigment-bound foreign-body granuloma and sarcoidosis are often difficult to distinguish. The black color seems to be the most common.

The anti-parasitic effects of ursolic acid against T. gondii-infected cells and T. gondii were evaluated through different specific assays, including immunofluorescence staining and animal testing. Ursolic acid effectively inhibited the proliferation of T. gondii when compared with sulfadiazine, and consistently induced anti-T. gondii activity/effect. In particular, the formation of parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) in host cells was markedly decreased after treating ursolic acid, which was effectively suppressed. Moreover, the survival rate of T. gondii was strongly inhibited in T. gondii group treated with ursolic acid, and then 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) against T. gondii was measured as 94.62 \u03BCg/mL. The T. gondii-infected mice treated with ursolic acid indicated the same survival rates and activity as the normal group. These results demonstrate that ursolic acid causes anti-T. gondii action and effect by strongly blocking the proliferation of T. gondii through the direct and the selective T. gondii-inhibitory ability as well as increases the survival of T. gondii-infected mice. This study shows that ursolic acid has the potential to be used as a promising anti-T. gondii candidate substance for developing effective anti-parasitic drugs.","publish_time":"2018-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choi, Won Hyung; Lee, In Ah","journal":"Pharmaceuticals (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/745f78dadf6e5a2feb79900688cd5fb9ead4d72e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6026977.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ph11020043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29747388/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["The T."],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gondii activity","gondii group","Toxoplasma gondii","gondii action","gondii-infected cells","gondii-infected mice","gondii-inhibitory ability","gondii candidate substance","anti-parasitic effect of ursolic acid","anti-parasitic effects of ursolic acid","effective anti-parasitic drugs","survival rates","proliferation","study","host cells","normal group","inhibitory concentration","immunofluorescence staining","PVM","formation of parasitophorous vacuole membrane","different specific assays","animal testing","potential","results","toxoplasmosis","sulfadiazine","humans","\u03BCg"],"language":"en"},

The camel cDNA contains a 516bp open reading frame encoding a 171 amino acid precursor protein, including a 21 amino acid signal peptide. Sequence analysis revealed high similarity with other mammalian IL-26 homologs and the conservation of IL-10 cytokine family domain structure including key amino acid residues. We also report the identification and cloning of four novel transcript variants produced by alternative splicing at the Exon 3-Exon 4 regions of the gene. Three of the alternative splice variants had premature termination codons and are predicted to code for truncated proteins. The transcript variant 4 (Tv4) having an insertion of an extra 120bp nucleotides in the ORF was predicted to encode a full length protein product with 40 extra amino acid residues. The mRNA transcripts of all the variants were identified in lymph node, where as fewer variants were observed in other tissues like blood, liver and kidney. The expression of Tv2 and Tv3 were found to be up regulated in mitogen induced camel peripheral blood mononuclear cells. IL-26-Tv2 expression was also induced in camel fibroblast cells infected with Camel pox virus in-vitro.

Among them, ORF8 is distinguished in being rapidly evolving, possessing a unique insert and a hypervariable position among SARS-CoV-2 genomes in its predicted ligand-binding groove. We also uncover many Ig proteins from several metazoan viruses which are distinct in sequence and structure but share an architecture comparable to that of CoV Ig domain proteins. Hence, we propose that deployment of Ig domain proteins is a widely-used strategy by viruses, and SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 is a potential pathogenicity factor which evolves rapidly to counter the immune response and facilitate the transmission between hosts.","publish_time":"2020-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Yongjun; Schneider, Theresa; Leong, Matthew; Aravind, L; Zhang, Dapeng","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3172e6bf2b87adbfbac21ff3bc82ad633664460.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e350e1b4aab99c73d0e0d03121b50c059c04fd61.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.977736","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Alpha"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","Ig proteins","CoV Ig domain proteins","deployment of Ig domain proteins","ORF8","SARS-related coronaviruses","sequence","certain Alpha-CoVs","Beta-CoVs","metazoan viruses","novel coronavirus","novel families of immunoglobulin","protein groups","emergent severe respiratory disease","ORF7a","COVID","causative agent","genomes","hypervariable position","architecture comparable","evolutionary analysis","predicted ligand-binding groove","structure","unique insert","potential pathogenicity factor","transmission","strategy","immune response","global health crisis","hosts","humans"],"language":"en"},

Study design Prospective cohort study conducted from January 15, 2012 to January 31, 2013. Infants in the NICU were enrolled if they were inborn, had never been discharged home, and were evaluated for sepsis (at \u003E72 hours of age) and antibiotic therapy was initiated. Infants had a nasopharyngeal specimen collected for detection of respiratory viruses by multiplex polymerase chain reaction within 72 hours of the initiation of antibiotic therapy.

Results During the 13-month study, 8 of 100 infants, or 8 (6%) of the 135 sepsis evaluations, had a respiratory virus detected by polymerase chain reaction (2, enterovirus/rhinovirus; 2, rhinovirus; 2, coronaviruses; and 2, parainfluenza-3 virus). By bivariate analysis, the infants with viral detection were older (41 vs 11 days; P = .007), exposed to individuals with respiratory tract viral symptoms (37% vs 2%; P = .003), tested for respiratory viruses by provider (75% vs 11%; P \u003C .001), and had lower total neutrophil counts (P = .02).

However, the role of IL10 in CD8 T cells remains controversial. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of endogenous IL10 by CD8 T cells in gastric cancer (GC) patients. Using intracellular staining, we found that in both GC patients and healthy controls, the majority of IL10-expressing CD8 T cells also presented concurrent IFNg expression. Interestingly, the frequency of IFNg\u002BIL10\u002B CD8 T cells was significantly higher in GC patients than in healthy controls, while the frequency of IFNg\u002BIL10- CD8 T cells was significantly lower in GC patients than in healthy controls. Compared to the IFNg-IL10- CD8 T cells, both IFNg\u002BIL10- and IFNg\u002BIL10\u002B CD8 T cells presented significantly higher expression of activation/inhibitory markers.

The mechanisms underlying trans- and cis-preferences are not fully understood. Here, we evaluate this concept for hepatitis C virus (HCV), an important cause of chronic liver disease and member of the Flaviviridae family. HCV encodes five nonstructural (NS) genes that are required for RNA replication. To date, only two of these genes, NS4B and NS5A, have been trans-complemented, leading to suggestions that other replicase genes work only in cis. We describe a new quantitative system to measure the cis- and trans-requirements for HCV NS gene function in RNA replication and identify several lethal mutations in the NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B genes that can be complemented in trans, alone or in combination, by expressing the NS3\u20135B polyprotein from a synthetic mRNA. Although NS5B RNA binding and polymerase activities can be supplied in trans, NS5B protein expression was required in cis, indicating that NS5B has a cis-acting role in replicase assembly distinct from its known enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the RNA binding and NTPase activities of the NS3 helicase domain were required in cis, suggesting that these activities play an essential role in RNA template selection. A comprehensive complementation group analysis revealed functional linkages between NS3-4A and NS4B and between NS5B and the upstream NS3\u20135A genes. Finally, NS5B polymerase activity segregated with a daclatasvir-sensitive NS5A activity, which could explain the synergy of this antiviral compound with nucleoside analogs in patients. Together, these studies define several new aspects of HCV replicase structure-function, help to explain the potency of HCV-specific combination therapies, and provide an experimental framework for the study of cis- and trans-acting activities in positive-strand RNA virus replication more generally.","publish_time":"2015-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kazakov, Teymur; Yang, Feng; Ramanathan, Harish N.; Kohlway, Andrew; Diamond, Michael S.; Lindenbach, Brett D.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28f89ac0fa6a72cf3dc315817c2e670c10dec347.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4395149.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004817; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25875808/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","HCV NS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NS5B genes","RNA replication","NS5B RNA binding","replicase genes","study of cis","cis-preferences","cis-acting role","NS5B polymerase activity","positive-strand RNA virus replication","trans-acting activities","potency of HCV","polymerase activities","positive-strand RNA viruses","upstream NS3","RNA template selection","NS4B","HCV NS gene function","NS5B protein expression","NTPase activities","trans-requirements","new aspects of HCV replicase structure-function","genome replication","NS3 helicase domain","daclatasvir-sensitive NS5A activity","replicase assembly distinct","known enzymatic activity","essential role","hepatitis C virus","specific combination therapies","new quantitative system","member","important cause of chronic liver disease","functional linkages","comprehensive complementation group analysis","antiviral compound","NS4A","lethal mutations","nucleoside analogs","experimental framework","patients","synergy","B polyprotein","concept","suggestions","Flaviviridae family","synthetic mRNA","studies","mechanisms","date"],"language":"en"},

We also performed longitudinal studies of three camel herds in Egypt and Jordan to elucidate MERS-CoV infection and transmission. Between 2016 and 2018, a total of 4027 nasal swabs and 3267 serum samples were collected from all countries. Real- time PCR revealed that MERS-CoV RNA was detected in nasal swab samples from Egypt, Senegal, Tunisia, and Saudi Arabia. Microneutralization assay showed that antibodies were detected in all countries. Positive PCR samples were partially sequenced, and a phylogenetic tree was built. The tree suggested that all sequences are of clade C and sequences from camels in Egypt formed a separate group from previously published sequences. Longitudinal studies showed high seroprevalence in adult camels. These results indicate the widespread distribution of the virus in camels.

To test this hypothesis, we have now assayed in gnotobiotic piglets various recombinant PEDVs generated by reverse genetics. Piglets inoculated with CV777 maintained in National Institute of Animal Health, along with piglets infected with a recombinant form of the same virus, developed subclinical to mild diarrhea. In contrast, severe watery diarrhea, dehydration, weight loss, astasia, and high mortality were observed in piglets inoculated with recombinant strains in which the S gene was partially or fully replaced with corresponding sequences from the highly virulent Japanese PEDV isolate OKN-1/JPN/2013. Indeed, symptoms resembled those in piglets inoculated with the OKN-1/JPN/2013, and were especially pronounced in younger piglets.

At a histopathological level, the disease is identified by the presence of large eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions in multiple tissues. To date, no virus or other pathogen has been definitively characterized or associated with the disease. Using a metagenomic approach to search for candidate etiologic agents in snakes with confirmed IBD, we identified and de novo assembled the complete genomic sequences of two viruses related to arenaviruses, and a third arenavirus-like sequence was discovered by screening an additional set of samples. A continuous boa constrictor cell line was established and used to propagate and isolate one of the viruses in culture. Viral nucleoprotein was localized and concentrated within large cytoplasmic inclusions in infected cells in culture and tissues from diseased snakes. In total, viral RNA was detected in 6/8 confirmed IBD cases and 0/18 controls. These viruses have a typical arenavirus genome organization but are highly divergent, belonging to a lineage separate from that of the Old and New World arenaviruses. Furthermore, these viruses encode envelope glycoproteins that are more similar to those of filoviruses than to those of other arenaviruses. These findings implicate these viruses as candidate etiologic agents of IBD. The presence of arenaviruses outside mammals reveals that these viruses infect an unexpectedly broad range of species and represent a new reservoir of potential human pathogens.","publish_time":"2012-08-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stenglein, Mark D.; Sanders, Chris; Kistler, Amy L.; Ruby, J.

Neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection in mice provides a useful tool for studying mechanisms of demyelination in a virus-induced experimental model of MS. This study uses Affymetrix microarray analysis to compare differential spinal cord mRNA levels between mice infected with demyelinating and non-demyelinating strains of MHV to identify host immune genes expressed in this demyelinating disease model. The study reveals that during the acute stage of infection, both strains induce inflammatory innate immune response genes, whereas upregulation of several immunoglobulin genes during chronic stage infection is unique to infection with the demyelinating strain. Results suggest that the demyelinating strain induced an innate-immune response during acute infection that may promote switching of Ig isotype genes during chronic infection, potentially playing a role in antibody-mediated progressive demyelination even after viral clearance.","publish_time":"2016-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Biswas, Kaushiki; Chatterjee, Dhriti; Addya, Sankar; Khan, Reas S.; Kenyon, Lawrence C.; Choe, Alexander; Cohrs, Randall J.; Shindler, Kenneth S.; Das Sarma, Jayasri","journal":"Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b237e0054b0120b98182f96deae4c4fdd3dbde4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106046.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27394164/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clim.2016.07.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1521661616301589; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1521661616301589","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Affymetrix","MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chronic infection","acute infection","chronic stage infection","acute stage of infection","immunoglobulin genes","host immune genes","demyelinating disease model","non-demyelinating strains of MHV","inflammatory innate immune response genes","innate-immune response","mice","Ig isotype genes","study","progressive demyelination","mechanisms of demyelination","experimental model of","presence of immunoglobulin oligoclonal bands","Neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus","differential spinal cord mRNA levels","upregulation","Affymetrix microarray analysis","cerebrospinal fluid of Multiple Sclerosis","patients","role","useful tool","infectious etiology","antigenic targets","hypothesis","viral clearance","antibody","Results"],"language":"en"},

To prove effects of manual acupuncture on common cold, a retrospective chart review was conducted. METHODS Chart data for patients with common cold who were treated with only manual acupuncture with fulfilling Jackson scales and satisfaction at the end of each treatment were collected via multi-centers of Oriental hospitals, Oriental medicine clinics and covalent hospital in South Korea. Totally 187 patients were divided into two groups, Group I (115 patients, within 36 h) and Group II (72 patients, onset time of cold over than 36 h). Finally 120 patients were observed until entire resolution of cold symptoms. RESULTS Group I showed significant decreases the median durations of completely recovery (3 days; 95% CI 3.0-4.0) as compared with Group II (6 days; 95% CI 4.0-7.0, P \u003C 0.001).

Damage\u2010 and pathogen\u2010associated molecular patterns contribute to a self\u2010perpetuating proinflammatory state in ALD. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM\u20101) is a surface receptor that amplifies inflammation induced by toll\u2010like receptors (TLRs) and is expressed on neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages. We hypothesized that TREM\u20101 signaling contributes to proinflammatory pathway activation in ALD. Using an in vivo ALD model in mice, we tested the effects of ligand\u2010independent TREM\u20101 inhibitory peptides that were formulated into human high\u2010density lipoprotein (HDL)\u2010mimicking complexes GF9\u2010HDL and GA/E31\u2010HDL. As revealed in vitro, macrophages endocytosed these rationally designed complexes through scavenger receptors. A 5\u2010week alcohol feeding with the Lieber\u2010DeCarli diet in mice resulted in increased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), liver steatosis, and increased proinflammatory cytokines in the liver. TREM\u20101 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was significantly increased in alcohol\u2010fed mice, and TREM\u20101 inhibitors significantly reduced this increase. TREM\u20101 inhibition significantly attenuated alcohol\u2010induced spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) activation, an early event in both TLR4 and TREM\u20101 signaling. The TREM\u20101 inhibitors significantly inhibited macrophage (epidermal growth factor\u2010like module\u2010containing mucin\u2010like hormone receptor\u2010like 1 [F4/80], clusters of differentiation [CD]68) and neutrophil (lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus G [Ly6G] and myeloperoxidase [MPO]) markers and proinflammatory cytokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 [MCP\u20101], tumor necrosis factor \u03B1 [TNF\u2010\u03B1], interleukin\u20101\u03B2 [IL\u20101\u03B2], macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03B1 [MIP\u20101\u03B1]) at the mRNA level compared to the HDL vehicle. Administration of TREM\u20101 inhibitors ameliorated liver steatosis and early fibrosis markers (\u03B1\u2010smooth muscle actin [\u03B1SMA] and procollagen1\u03B1 [Pro\u2010Col1\u03B1]) at the mRNA level in alcohol\u2010fed mice. However, the HDL vehicle also reduced serum ALT and some cytokine protein levels in alcohol\u2010fed mice, indicating HDL\u2010related effects. Conclusion: HDL\u2010delivered novel TREM\u20101 peptide inhibitors ameliorate early phases of inflammation and neutrophil and macrophage recruitment and activation in the liver and attenuate hepatocyte damage and liver steatosis. TREM\u20101 inhibition represents a promising therapeutic approach for further investigations in ALD.","publish_time":"2018-10-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tornai, David; Furi, Istvan; Shen, Zu T.; Sigalov, Alexander B.; Coban, Sahin; Szabo, Gyongyi","journal":"Hepatol Commun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe2b70a4317057c021120d2281f2d7796c742e86.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6312652.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619998/; https://doi.org/10.1002/hep4.1269","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs0NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["independent TREM","novel TREM","Administration of TREM","liver steatosis","mice","HDL vehicle","macrophage recruitment","increased proinflammatory cytokines","attenuated alcohol","proinflammatory pathway activation","Alcoholic liver disease","week alcohol","macrophage inflammatory protein","inhibited macrophage","peptide inhibitors","mRNA level","tumor necrosis factor \u03B1","early fibrosis markers","serum ALT","early phases of inflammation","early event","self\u2010perpetuating proinflammatory state","neutrophil leukocyte recruitment","Triggering receptor","inhibition","hormone receptor","surface receptor","macrophages","increased serum alanine aminotransferase","monocyte chemoattractant protein","cytokine protein levels","complexes GF9","designed complexes","effects of ligand","related effects","scavenger receptors","ALD model","epidermal growth factor","attenuate hepatocyte damage","induced spleen tyrosine kinase","\u03B1SMA","SYK","smooth muscle actin","locus G","TNF","Ly6G","procollagen1\u03B1","module","myeloperoxidase","lymphocyte antigen","MCP","molecular patterns","inhibitory peptides","MPO","Lieber","DeCarli diet","MIP","Pro\u2010Col1\u03B1","promising therapeutic approach","human high\u2010density lipoprotein","mucin","interleukin","toll","expression","myeloid cells","messenger RNA","E31","investigations","neutrophils","TLRs","pathogen","CD","F4","TLR4","Conclusion","clusters of differentiation","monocytes"],"language":"en"},

Thus, viruses have acquired the capacity to subvert host cell apoptosis, control inflammatory responses, and evade immune reactions. Since the elimination of infected cells via programmed cell death is one of the most ancestral defense mechanisms against infection, disabling host cell apoptosis might represent an almost obligate step in the viral life cycle. Conversely, viruses may take advantage of stimulating apoptosis, either to kill uninfected cells from the immune system, or to induce the breakdown of infected cells, thereby favoring viral dissemination. Several viral polypeptides are homologs of host-derived apoptosis-regulatory proteins, such as members of the Bcl-2 family. Moreover, viral factors with no homology to host proteins specifically target key components of the apoptotic machinery.

For the last three decades, PEDV infection has resulted in significant economic losses in the European and Asian pig industries, but in 2013\u20132014 the disease was also reported in the US, Canada and Mexico. The PED epidemic in the US, from April 2013 to the present, has led to the loss of more than 10% of the US pig population. The disappearance and re-emergence of epidemic PED indicates that the virus is able to escape from current vaccination protocols, biosecurity and control systems. Endemic PED is a significant problem, which is exacerbated by the emergence (or potential importation) of multiple PEDV variants. Epidemic PEDV strains spread rapidly and cause a high number of pig deaths. These strains are highly enteropathogenic and acutely infect villous epithelial cells of the entire small and large intestines although the jejunum and ileum are the primary sites. PEDV infections cause acute, severe atrophic enteritis accompanied by viremia that leads to profound diarrhea and vomiting, followed by extensive dehydration, which is the major cause of death in nursing piglets. A comprehensive understanding of the pathogenic characteristics of epidemic or endemic PEDV strains is needed to prevent and control the disease in affected regions and to develop an effective vaccine. This review focuses on the etiology, epidemiology, disease mechanisms and pathogenesis as well as immunoprophylaxis against PEDV infection.","publish_time":"2015-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jung, Kwonil; Saif, Linda J.","journal":"The Veterinary Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e3f5d7e47d1bc9b0ea5d9f431f9bd583ec5e71a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110711.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023315000787; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023315000787; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2015.02.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25841898/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PED","PEDV"],"locations":["Canada","Mexico"],"keyphrases":["Epidemic PEDV strains","PEDV infections","endemic PEDV strains","PED epidemic","multiple PEDV variants","re-emergence of epidemic PED","acute diarrhea","Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","pathogenic characteristics of epidemic","US pig population","vomiting","profound diarrhea","disease mechanisms","high number of pig deaths","Asian pig industries","major cause of death","high mortality","extensive dehydration","nursing piglets","significant problem","control systems","significant economic losses","seronegative neonatal piglets","jejunum","current vaccination protocols","severe atrophic enteritis","large intestines","family Coronaviridae","villous epithelial cells","ileum","biosecurity","epidemiology","viremia","potential importation","pathogenesis","genera Alphacoronavirus","etiology","enteropathogenic","member","immunoprophylaxis","comprehensive understanding","affected regions","primary sites","disappearance","effective vaccine","review","Canada","Mexico","decades"],"language":"en"},

Following coronavirus injection, TNF-\u03B1 mRNA was detected at higher levels within the retinas, and concentrations of TNF-\u03B1 (p \u003C0.005) and sTNFR1 (p \u003C0.0005) proteins were increased within the sera of BALB/c but not CD-1 mice.

Gene expression of iNOS while initially high in BALB/c mice decreased during the acute phase of infection, while it increased in CD-1 mice. These trends are attributable to differences in monocyte TNFR2 release (p \u003C0.0005) between the strains since sTNFR2 decreased (p \u003C0.01) levels of NO production. These studies demonstrate that retinal degeneration following viral infection is associated with increased release of TNF-\u03B1/TNF receptors combined with a down-regulation of NO.

Myocarditis and myocardial injury were suspected and may even be considered as one of the leading causes for death of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we focused on the condition of the heart, and sought to provide firsthand evidence for whether myocarditis and myocardial injury were caused by COVID-19. Methods We enrolled patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 retrospectively and collected heart-related clinical data, mainly including cardiac imaging findings, laboratory results and clinical outcomes. Serial tests of cardiac markers were traced for the analysis of potential myocardial injury/myocarditis. Results 112 COVID-19 patients were enrolled in our study. There was evidence of myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients and 14 (12.5%) patients had presented abnormalities similar to myocarditis. Most of patients had normal levels of troponin at admission, that in 42 (37.5%) patients increased during hospitalization, especially in those that died. Troponin levels were significantly increased in the week preceding the death. 15 (13.4%) patients have presented signs of pulmonary hypertension. Typical signs of myocarditis were absent on echocardiography and electrocardiogram. Conclusions The clinical evidence in our study suggested that myocardial injury is more likely related to systemic consequences rather than direct damage by the 2019 novel coronavirus. The elevation in cardiac markers was probably due to secondary and systemic consequences and can be considered as the warning sign for recent adverse clinical outcomes of the patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deng, Qing; Hu, Bo; Zhang, Yao; Wang, Hao; Zhou, Xiaoyang; Hu, Wei; Cheng, Yuting; Yan, Jie; Ping, Haiqin; Zhou, Qing","journal":"Int J Cardiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8266bf6f779e996da4d0ba2fb7733abbac7ca5e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7141178.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32291207/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167527320311153; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167527320311153?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2020.03.087","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["patients","evidence of myocardial injury","death of COVID","clinical evidence","analysis of potential myocardial injury","confirmed diagnosis of COVID","Typical signs of myocarditis","heart-related clinical data","recent adverse clinical outcomes","systemic consequences","firsthand evidence","study","Troponin levels","Serial tests of cardiac markers","cardiac imaging findings","novel coronavirus disease","normal levels of troponin","laboratory results","signs of pulmonary hypertension","China","great concern","major public health issue","direct damage","warning sign","Abstract Background","outbreak","international community","admission","Methods","echocardiography","leading causes","Conclusions","abnormalities similar","week","electrocardiogram","Wuhan","elevation","condition","hospitalization"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We carried out a population-based case\u2013control study in the Lombardy region of Italy. A total of 6272 case patients in whom infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence. Information about the use of selected drugs and patients\u2019 clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression. RESULTS: Among both case patients and controls, the mean (\u00B1SD) age was 68\u00B113 years, and 37% were women. The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive drugs, and case patients had a worse clinical profile. Use of ARBs or ACE inhibitors did not show any association with Covid-19 among case patients overall (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.86 to 1.05] for ARBs and 0.96 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.07] for ACE inhibitors) or among patients who had a severe or fatal course of the disease (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.10] for ARBs and 0.91 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.21] for ACE inhibitors), and no association between these variables was found according to sex. CONCLUSIONS: In this large, population-based study, the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more frequent among patients with Covid-19 than among controls because of their higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease. However, there was no evidence that ACE inhibitors or ARBs affected the risk of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mancia, Giuseppe; Rea, Federico; Ludergnani, Monica; Apolone, Giovanni; Corrao, Giovanni","journal":"N Engl J Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e80136035e5ffa6b6ddde90919652f8bf9de48ac.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c3aba434dea29d51120131b59ebf000edfd7d829.json; document_parses/pdf_json/07184faffd44a41b3d891e434895e510430d38f1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206933.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32356627/; https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa2006923","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Regional Health Service"],"locations":["Lombardy"],"keyphrases":["use of ACE inhibitors","ARBs","case patients","use of angiotensin","controls","use of selected drugs","population-based case","risk of COVID","regional databases of health care use","risk of coronavirus disease","adjusted odds ratio","infection","population-based study","non-antihypertensive drugs","potential association","age","Odds ratios","sex","Regional Health Service","control study","confidence intervals","higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","patients\u2019 clinical profiles","worse clinical profile","fatal course","receptor blockers","mean","SARS-CoV","Lombardy region of Italy","associations","beneficiaries","adjustment","SD","Information","enzyme","evidence","municipality of residence","years","confounders","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","variables","total","RESULTS","logistic regression","women","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Existing literature and conference proceedings were examined on syndromic surveillance from 1998 to 2010, focusing on low- and middle-income settings. Based on the 36 unique definitions of syndromic surveillance found in the literature, five commonly accepted principles of syndromic surveillance systems were identified, as well as two fundamental categories: specific and non-specific disease detection. Ultimately, the proposed categorization of syndromic surveillance distinguishes between systems that focus on detecting defined syndromes or outcomes of interest and those that aim to uncover non-specific trends that suggest an outbreak may be occurring. By providing an accurate and comprehensive picture of this field\u2019s capabilities, and differentiating among system types, a unified understanding of the syndromic surveillance field can be developed, encouraging the adoption, investment in, and implementation of these systems in settings that need bolstered surveillance capacity, particularly low- and middle-income countries.","publish_time":"2011-08-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Katz, Rebecca; May, Larissa; Baker, Julia; Test, Elisa","journal":"J Epidemiol Glob Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c198d70a65c91bccd3d21cd49b46deea2ce1c28.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103945.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210600611000050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23856373/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210600611000050; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jegh.2011.06.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["field of syndromic surveillance","syndromic surveillance field","term syndromic surveillance","proposed categorization of syndromic surveillance","unique definitions of syndromic surveillance","accepted principles of syndromic surveillance systems","bolstered surveillance capacity","use of early disease detection surveillance methods","non-specific disease detection","middle-income settings","international spread of disease","refined categorization","Existing literature","non-specific trends","middle-income countries","unified understanding","field\u2019s capabilities","conference proceedings","system types","fundamental categories","increased attention","comprehensive picture","growing concerns","implementation","article","defined syndromes","characteristics","various meanings","adoption","investment","outcomes","decade","outbreak","purpose"],"language":"en"},

It has been used for centuries for the treatment of fever and chills, and has been recently approved for the treatment of malaria due to its endoperoxidase properties. Progressively, research has found that artemisinins displayed multiple pharmacological actions against inflammation, viral infections, and cell and tumour proliferation, making them effective against diseases. Moreover, it has displayed a relatively safe toxicity profile. The use of artemisinins against different respiratory diseases has been investigated in lung cancer models and inflammatory-driven respiratory disorders. These studies revealed the ability of artemisinins in attenuating proliferation, inflammation, invasion, and metastasis, and in inducing apoptosis. Artemisinins can regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03BAB), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), promote cell cycle arrest, drive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and induce Bak or Bax-dependent or independent apoptosis. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive update of the current knowledge of the effects of artemisinins in relation to respiratory diseases to identify gaps that need to be filled in the course of repurposing artemisinins for the treatment of respiratory diseases. In addition, we postulate whether artemisinins can also be repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19 given its anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheong, Dorothy H.J.; Daniel Tan, W.S.; Fred Wong, W.S.; Tran, Thai","journal":"Pharmacol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f85f99e9ba48976302114bd6fcdcbbb5e64ff15.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217791.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104901; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661820312093?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405226/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043661820312093","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bak"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of artemisinins","ability of artemisinins","use of artemisinins","treatment of respiratory diseases","course of repurposing artemisinins","different respiratory diseases","respiratory disorders","treatment of fever","treatment of malaria","treatment of COVID","inflammation","viral infections","tumour proliferation","attenuating proliferation","independent apoptosis","anti-inflammatory properties","endoperoxidase properties","inducing apoptosis","cell cycle arrest","nuclear factor-kappa B","vascular endothelial growth factor","expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines","MMPs","VEGF","reactive oxygen species","NF-\u03BAB","production","multiple pharmacological actions","matrix metalloproteinases","Bak","ROS","current knowledge","lung cancer models","relation","Bax-dependent","peroxide moiety","metastasis","invasion","sesquiterpene lactones","comprehensive update","gaps","herb Artemisia annua","safe toxicity profile","centuries","chills","studies","research","addition","review"],"language":"en"},

Some COVID-19 patients have exhibited widespread neurological manifestations including stroke. Acute ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis have been reported in patients with COVID-19. COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is increasingly recognized as a result of acute infection and is likely caused by inflammation, including inflammatory cytokine storm. Recent studies suggest axonal transport of SARS-CoV-2 to the brain can occur via the cribriform plate adjacent to the olfactory bulb that may lead to symptomatic anosmia. The internalization of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by the binding of the spike glycoprotein of the virus to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on cellular membranes. ACE2 is expressed in several tissues including lung alveolar cells, gastrointestinal tissue, and brain. The aim of this review is to provide insights into the pathophysiological stroke mechanisms in COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 can down-regulate ACE2 and, in turn, over-activate the classical renin-angiotensin system (RAS) axis and decrease the activation of the alternative RAS pathway in the brain.

Morbidity and mortality of the acute viral CNS disease was augmented by the presence of the autoantibodies in all three viral infections. Transfer of serum containing the autoantibodies at the time of infection with MHV was sufficient to reproduce the exacerbated disease. The presence of the autoantibodies was found to result in increased infiltration of mononuclear cells into the brain. Early demyelination was severely augmented in brains and spinal cords of MHV-infected mice with CNS-specific autoantibodies. The antibody-mediated exacerbation was shown to be independent of the complement system but to require expression of Fc receptors, because it was observed in C\u2032-3-deficient but not in Fc receptor-deficient mice. Our study illustrates the possibility that infections can lead to much more profound immunopathology in the presence of an otherwise latent autoimmune condition.","publish_time":"2007-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burrer, Renaud; Buchmeier, Michael J.; Wolfe, Tom; Ting, Joey P.C.; Feuer, Ralph; Iglesias, Antonio; von Herrath, Matthias G.","journal":"The American Journal of Pathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e6a34514d2f17508fbd4ed9b31b2b861f5978968.json; document_parses/pdf_json/57bcd251e2d4f611eddf330ca913ba880dd94576.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1851853.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002944010608796; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc1851853?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002944010608796","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CNS-specific autoantibodies","presence","acute viral CNS disease","viral infections","infected mice","outcome of viral encephalomyelitis","Fc receptor-deficient mice","exacerbated disease","clinical disease","Theiler\u2019s encephalomyelitis virus","spinal cords of MHV","specific antigen","complement system","mouse hepatitis virus","central nervous system","expression of Fc receptors","A59","Coxsackievirus B3","brains","mortality","myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein","time of infection","increased infiltration of mononuclear cells","latent autoimmune condition","Morbidity","antibody-mediated exacerbation","profound immunopathology","Transfer of serum","Early demyelination","study","possibility"],"language":"en"},

The emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a concern for global public health, as there is a lack of efficacious vaccine platforms and antiviral therapeutic strategies. Previously, it was shown that MyD88, an adaptor protein necessary for signaling by multiple TLRs, is a required component of the innate immune response to mouse-adapted SARS-CoV infection in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that TLR3(\u2212/\u2212), TLR4(\u2212/\u2212), and TRAM(\u2212/\u2212) mice are more susceptible to SARS-CoV than wild-type mice but experience only transient weight loss with no mortality in response to infection. In contrast, mice deficient in the TLR3/TLR4 adaptor TRIF are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, showing increased weight loss, mortality, reduced lung function, increased lung pathology, and higher viral titers. Distinct alterations in inflammation were present in TRIF(\u2212/\u2212) mice infected with SARS-CoV, including excess infiltration of neutrophils and inflammatory cell types that correlate with increased pathology of other known causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including influenza virus infections. Aberrant proinflammatory cytokine, chemokine, and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) signaling programs were also noted following infection of TRIF(\u2212/\u2212) mice that were similar to those seen in human patients with poor disease outcome following SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infection. These findings highlight the importance of TLR adaptor signaling in generating a balanced protective innate immune response to highly pathogenic coronavirus infections.","publish_time":"2015-05-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Totura, Allison L.; Whitmore, Alan; Agnihothram, Sudhakar; Sch\u00E4fer, Alexandra; Katze, Michael G.; Heise, Mark T.; Baric, Ralph S.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dcce6e45fd562d7a15633fc5a55aed8d3ce37f49.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4447251.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26015500/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00638-15","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TLR"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV infection","mouse-adapted SARS-CoV infection","following infection of TRIF","mice deficient","TLR4 adaptor TRIF","increased pathology","increased lung pathology","increased weight loss","innate immune responses","pathogenic coronavirus infections","wild-type mice","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","balanced protective innate immune response","pathogenic coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","mortality","TLR3","known causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome","transient weight loss","adaptor protein necessary","importance of TLR adaptor","multiple TLRs","reduced lung function","influenza virus infections","ARDS","inflammatory cell types","excess infiltration of neutrophils","poor disease outcome","chemokine","lack of efficacious vaccine platforms","required component","human patients","interferon-stimulated gene","antiviral therapeutic strategies","sensors","bacteria","programs","fungi","concern","higher viral titers","molecular patterns","ISG","inflammation","emergence","Aberrant proinflammatory cytokine","global public health","Distinct alterations","receptors","findings","MyD88","contrast","pathogens","Toll","TRAM"],"language":"en"}]}

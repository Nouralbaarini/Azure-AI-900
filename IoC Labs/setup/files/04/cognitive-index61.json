However, general use of the technique is hampered by its complexity and the lack of standardization. METHODOLOGY: We here present the development and phase I evaluation of the T. cruzi OligoC-TesT, a simple and standardized dipstick format for detection of PCR amplified T. cruzi DNA. The specificity and sensitivity of the assay were evaluated on blood samples from 60 Chagas non-endemic and 48 endemic control persons and on biological samples from 33 patients, 7 reservoir animals, and 14 vectors collected in Chile. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The lower detection limits of the T. cruzi OligoC-TesT were 1 pg and 1 to 10 fg of DNA from T. cruzi lineage I and II, respectively. The test showed a specificity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 96.6%\u2013100%) on the control samples and a sensitivity of 93.9% (95% CI: 80.4%\u201398.3%), 100% (95% CI: 64.6%\u2013100%), and 100% (95% CI: 78.5%\u2013100%) on the human, rodent, and vector samples, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The T. cruzi OligoC-TesT showed high sensitivity and specificity on a diverse panel of biological samples. The new tool is an important step towards simplified and standardized molecular diagnosis of Chagas disease.","publish_time":"2009-06-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deborggraeve, Stijn; Coronado, Ximena; Solari, Aldo; Zulantay, Ines; Apt, Werner; Mertens, Pascal; Laurent, Thierry; Leclipteux, Thierry; Stessens, Tim; Dujardin, Jean-Claude; Herdewijn, Piet; B\u00FCscher, Philippe","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0c2551d031c6dd3f59392c3f75dffc7b694a186.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2685481.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19503815/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0000450","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":["Chile"],"keyphrases":["cruzi detection","cruzi OligoC-TesT","cruzi DNA","control samples","cruzi lineage","blood samples","vector samples","specificity","control of Chagas disease","diverse panel of biological samples","Chagas non-endemic","endemic control persons","detection of PCR amplified","standardized molecular diagnosis of Chagas disease","high sensitivity","lower detection limits","fg of DNA","standardized dipstick format","important step","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","patients","evaluation","assay","pg","reservoir animals","technique","complexity","vectors","development","new tool","human","rodent","phase","promising tools","general use","lack of standardization","confidence interval","CONCLUSIONS","Chile","METHODOLOGY","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Many studies have recently identified the regulatory mechanisms involved in the interaction between viral infection and autophagy. METHODS: LC3 turnover and the proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway were investigated using western blot analysis. The formation and degradation of autophagosomes were detected using immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: Autophagy was activated by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) NSP3, NSP5 and NSP9, which are two transmembrane proteins and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, respectively. The formation of autophagosomes was induced by NSP3 and NSP5 and developed from the ER; the fusion of these autophagosomes with lysosomes was limited. Although NSP3 and NSP5 are ER transmembrane proteins, these proteins did not activate the ER stress signaling pathways. In addition, the cytoplasmic domain of NSP3 plays a pivotal role in activating autophagy. CONCLUSIONS: The data presented in this study reveal an important relationship between PRRSV NSPs and autophagy and provide new insights that improve our understanding of the involvement of PRRSV NSPs in the autophagy process.

Two different swine enteric coronaviruses (porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and Delta coronavirus) have been isolated from the affected swine population. The disease has been reported from at least 32 states of the United States and other countries, including Mexico, Peru, Dominican Republic, Canada, Columbia, Ecuador, and Ukraine, with repeated outbreaks in previously infected herds. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel mammalian orthoreovirus 3 (MRV3) from diarrheic feces of piglets from these outbreaks in three states and ring-dried swine blood meal from multiple sources. MRV3 could not be isolated from healthy or pigs that had recovered from epidemic diarrhea from four states. Several MRV3 isolates were obtained from chloroform-extracted pig feces or blood meal in cell cultures or developing chicken embryos. Biological characterization of two representative isolates revealed trypsin resistance and thermostability at 90\u00B0C. NextGen sequencing of ultrapurified viruses indicated a strong homology of the S1 segment to mammalian and bat MRV3. Neonatal piglets experimentally infected with these viruses or a chloroform extract of swine blood meal developed severe diarrhea and acute gastroenteritis with 100% mortality within 3 days postinfection. Therefore, the novel porcine MRV3 may contribute to enteric disease along with other swine enteric viruses. The role of MRV3 in the current outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea in the United States remains to be determined, but the pathogenic nature of the virus warrants further investigations on its epidemiology and prevalence.","publish_time":"2015-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thimmasandra Narayanappa, Athmaram; Sooryanarain, Harini; Deventhiran, Jagadeeswaran; Cao, Dianjun; Ammayappan Venkatachalam, Backiyalakshmi; Kambiranda, Devaiah; LeRoith, Tanya; Heffron, Connie Lynn; Lindstrom, Nicole; Hall, Karen; Jobst, Peter; Sexton, Cary; Meng, Xiang-Jin; Elankumaran, Subbiah","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e1253d2bfe05e4fa4a42f9a542ca45c32a1e2264.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4442135.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25991685/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00593-15","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["U.S.","United States","Mexico","Dominican Republic","Ecuador","Ukraine"],"keyphrases":["swine enteric viruses","novel porcine MRV3","MRV3 isolates","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","current outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea","swine industry","bat MRV3","United States","role of MRV3","chloroform extract of swine blood meal","severe diarrhea","ring-dried swine blood meal","different swine enteric coronaviruses","affected swine population","repeated outbreaks","enteric disease","novel mammalian orthoreovirus","diarrheic feces of piglets","pig feces","representative isolates","NextGen sequencing of ultrapurified viruses","Biological characterization","Neonatal piglets","infected herds","cell cultures","thermostability","strong homology","S1 segment","Dominican Republic","acute gastroenteritis","Columbia","Canada","Ecuador","Peru","Mexico","multiple sources","Delta coronavirus","trypsin resistance","mortality","investigations","Ukraine","immense economic losses","countries","chicken embryos","epidemiology","isolation","pigs","pathogenic nature","days postinfection","prevalence"],"language":"en"},

In an unprecedented collective effort, massive amounts of data are now being collected worldwide to estimate the immediate and long-term impact of this pandemic on the health system and the global economy. However, the precise timeline of the disease, its transmissibility, and the effect of mitigation strategies remain incompletely understood. Here we integrate a global network model with a local epidemic SEIR model to quantify the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 in China and the United States. For the outbreak in China, in [Formula: see text] provinces, we found a latent period of 2.56 \u00B1 0.72 days, a contact period of 1.47 \u00B1 0.32 days, and an infectious period of 17.82 \u00B1 2.95 days. We postulate that the latent and infectious periods are disease-specific, whereas the contact period is behavior-specific and can vary between different provinces, states, or countries. For the early stages of the outbreak in the United States, in [Formula: see text] states, we adopted the disease-specific values from China and found a contact period of 3.38 \u00B1 0.69 days. Our network model predicts that\u2014without the massive political mitigation strategies that are in place today\u2014the United States would have faced a basic reproduction number of 5.30 \u00B1 0.95 and a nationwide peak of the outbreak on May 10, 2020 with 3 million infections. Our results demonstrate how mathematical modeling can help estimate outbreak dynamics and provide decision guidelines for successful outbreak control. We anticipate that our model will become a valuable tool to estimate the potential of vaccination and quantify the effect of relaxing political measures including total lockdown, shelter in place, and travel restrictions for low-risk subgroups of the population or for the population as a whole.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peirlinck, Mathias; Linka, Kevin; Sahli Costabal, Francisco; Kuhl, Ellen","journal":"Biomech Model Mechanobiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec65dd386a77991f9db2c668838bd2073aaa83c3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185268.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10237-020-01332-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32342242/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY3LmNzdjs4OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1687986,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:10Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"U/BWvBS8D\u002B5BiljTum2qbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_67.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["United States","China"],"keyphrases":["contact period","United States","days","latent period","outbreak dynamics of COVID","China","global network model","disease-specific values","successful outbreak control","coronavirus disease","global pandemic","place","massive political mitigation strategies","behavior-specific","Formula","effect of mitigation strategies","global economy","population","text","local epidemic SEIR model","effect of relaxing political measures","health system","different provinces","infectious periods","massive amounts of data","World Health Organization","shelter","total lockdown","travel restrictions","decision guidelines","low-risk subgroups","unprecedented collective effort","potential of vaccination","mathematical modeling","transmissibility","long-term impact","valuable tool","basic reproduction number","countries","precise timeline","early stages","results","nationwide peak","infections"],"language":"en"},

Fifty-eight 20-day old quails were individually identified with numbered rings and kept in cages adequate for the species. The birds were fed commercial feed and distilled water ad libitum. They were weighed daily during the first month and every seven days from then on. The birds were randomly distributed into 3 groups; 40 quails (group A) and 8 quails (group B) received 3.5\u00D7106 and 5\u00D7106 N. caninum tachyzoites, respectively, and 10 quails (group C) received placebo. Four quails from group A and one from group C had their blood collected and were euthanized on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 14th, 21th, 30th, 60th, 120th day after infection (DAI), and 4 quails from group B were euthanized on days 60th and 120th DAI. Following euthanasia, the birds were submitted to necropsy, the organs were weighed and fragments were collected for histopathology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and PCR. On the 60th DAI, two dogs were fed tissue obtained from group A quails, and one dog was fed quail tissues from group B.

Extensive metagenomic studies of different organs/tissues from bats have revealed a large number of novel or divergent viruses. To elucidate viral diversity and epidemiological and phylogenetic characteristics, six pooled fecal samples from bats were generated (based on bat species and geographic regions characteristic for virome analysis). These contained 500 fecal samples from six bat species, collected in four geographic regions. Metagenomic analysis revealed a plethora of divergent viruses originally found in bats. Multiple contigs from influenza A virus and coronaviruses in bats shared high identity with those from humans, suggesting possible cross-species transmission, whereas a number of contigs, whose sequences were taxonomically classifiable within Alphapapillomavirus, Betaretrovirus, Alpharetrovirus, Varicellovirus, Cyprinivirus, Chlorovirus and Cucumovirus had low identity to viruses in existing databases, which indicated possible evolution of novel viral species. None of the established caliciviruses and picornaviruses were found in the 500 fecal specimens. Papillomaviruses with high amino acid identity were found in Scotophilus kuhlii and Rhinolophus blythi, challenging the hypotheses regarding the strict host specificity and co-evolution of papillomaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis showed that four bat rotavirus A strains might be tentative G3 strains, according to the Rotavirus Classification Working Group classification.

We sought to describe the prevalence of viruses causing NVHAP and to determine factors independently associated with the isolation of a virus. Methods We identified patients with NVHAP over one year and reviewed their cultures to determine etiologies. Patients with a viral process were compared to those with either negative cultures or a bacterial infection to determine variables independently associated with the recovery of a virus. Results Among 174 cases, cultures were positive in 46.0%, with viruses identified in 22.4%. Bacterial pathogens arose 23.6% of subjects. The most common viruses included rhinovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza. We noted no seasonality in the isolation of viral organisms, and most cases of viral NVHAP developed after more than a week length of stay (LOS). Outcomes in viral NVHAP were similar to those with bacterial NVHAP. Patients with viral and bacterial NVHAP were generally similar. Two variables were independently associated with isolation of a virus: a history of coronary artery disease (adjusted odds ratio: 5.16, 95% CI: 1.14\u201322.44) and a LOS of greater than 10 days prior to NVHAP diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio: 2.97, 95% CI: 1.35\u20136.51).

Positive PCR results were obtained for all 48 isolates. On the other hand, infection with the organism was not detected in the apparently healthy lungs. Hemolysis and hydrogen sulphide (H2S) production, a compound that has previously not been identified as a virulence factor in M. arginini, was evident in 100% of the isolates. The 48 M. arginini isolates were weak in their ability to form biofilm on polystyrene surfaces. All isolates were 100% susceptible to florfenicol and streptomycin and 100% resistant to ciprofloxacin. Resistance to lincomycin, spiromycin, tylosin, doxacyclin and erythromycin was observed at different frequencies. 13 different combinations of antibiotics representing one to four classes were evident with the Macrolide erythromycin being the most represented.

Several professional health organizations have published position papers stating that there is no evidence to change the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in the management of elevated blood pressure in the context of avoiding or treating COVID-19 infection. In this article, we review the evidence on the relationship between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and COVID-19 infection. In agreement with current guidelines, patients with hypertension should continue taking antihypertensive medications as prescribed without interruption. Because ACEIs and ARBs are also used to retard the progression of chronic kidney disease, we suggest that these recommendations also apply to the use of these agents in chronic kidney disease. No differences generally exist between ARBs and ACEIs in terms of efficacy in decreasing blood pressure and improving other outcomes, such as all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and end-stage renal disease. The ACEIs are associated with cough secondary to accumulation of bradykinin and angioedema, and withdrawal rates due to adverse events are lower with ARBs. Given their equal efficacy but fewer adverse events, ARBs could potentially be a more favorable treatment option in patients with COVID-19 at higher risk for severe forms of disease.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sanchis-Gomar, Fabian; Lavie, Carl J.; Perez-Quilis, Carme; Henry, Brandon M.; Lippi, Giuseppe","journal":"Mayo Clin Proc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/47931ee3b584a1e47aa31715c9f6bc2775173198.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025619620303153?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376099/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.03.026; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025619620303153","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs1MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ARBs","COVID","ACEIs","severe forms of disease","Abstract Coronavirus disease","progression of chronic kidney disease","use of angiotensin","end-stage renal disease","renin-angiotensin","patients","worst pandemic disease of modern times","evidence","infection","angiotensin receptor blockers","fewer adverse events","decreasing blood pressure","cardiovascular mortality","terms of efficacy","equal efficacy","management of elevated blood pressure","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","all-cause mortality","myocardial infarction","stroke","heart failure","outcomes","withdrawal rates","higher risk","enzyme inhibitors","accumulation of bradykinin","angioedema","hypertension","aldosterone system","position papers","cough secondary","favorable treatment option","professional health organizations","current guidelines","context","agents","antihypertensive medications","agreement","relationship","interruption","recommendations","differences","article"],"language":"en"},

In the analytic situation the process of introjective identification bridges the gap between the analysand\u2019s and the analyst\u2019s unconscious themes: as a result the psychoanalyst can discover unconscious affects reaching the inner world originally stemming from the unconscious of the analysand/patient.

In this study, we determined the mRNA and protein expression of TMPRSS11D in NSCLC tumorous and matched adjacent normal tissues by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and tissue microarray immunohistochemistry analysis (TMA-IHC) respectively. TMPRSS11D protein expression in tumorous tissues were correlated with NSCLC patients\u2019 clinical characteristics and overall survival. Both TMPRSS11D mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly higher in NSCLC tumorous tissues than in adjacent normal tissues.

However, prognostic role of coinfection remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate relation between respiratory viral confection and illness severity in children. STUDY DESIGN: MEDLINE (through PUBMED), EMBASE, EBSCO, LILACS databases were searched up to March 2015 by two independent reviewers. Studies assessing severity of viral coinfection in patients aged less than 18 years were included. Standardized forms were used for data extraction of population, study design, clinical syndromes, virus combinations compared and severity outcomes. Risk of bias and quality of evidence were assessed through EPHPP and GRADE. Subgroup analysis was performed according to age and viral combinations. RESULTS: Of 5218 records screened, 43 were included in analysis. Viral coinfection did not influence risks of all outcomes assessed: length of stay (mean difference in days in coinfection, \u22120.10 [95% confidence interval: \u22120.51 to 0.31]), length of supplemental oxygen (\u22120.42 [\u22121.05 to 0.20]), need of hospitalization (odds ratio of coinfection, 0.96 [95% confidence interval: 0.61\u20131.51]), supplemental oxygen (0.94 [0.66 to 1.34]), need of intensive care (0.99 [0.64 to 1.54]), mechanical ventilation (0.81 [0.33 to 2.01]) and death (2.22 [0.83 to 5.95]). Sub-analyses according to age and viral combinations have not shown influence of these factors in outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viral coinfection did not increase severity in all outcomes assessed.

The other 20 patients were treated with Godhuma Vati (placebo) at a dose of 500 mg once daily for 30 days (Group B). In both groups, Madhu was the Anupana advised. After completion of 30 days of treatment, the patients were assessed on the following day and another investigation took place 15 days later. Statistically significant effects (p \u003C 0.05) in the reduction of all signs and symptoms of chronic tonsillitis after KR treatment were observed. These results indicate that Kumarabharana Rasa has an ameliorative effect in reducing the signs and symptoms of chronic tonsillitis.","publish_time":"2016-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arun Raj, G.

Coronaviruses were recently found to have little intrinsic disorder compared with many other virus families. Because intrinsically disordered regions have been proposed to be important for rewiring interactions between virus and host, we investigated the conservation of intrinsic disorder and secondary structure in coronaviruses in an evolutionary context. We found that regions of intrinsic disorder are rarely conserved among different coronavirus protein families, with the primary exception of the nucleocapsid. Also, secondary structure predictions are only conserved across 50\u201380% of sites for most protein families, with the implication that 20\u201350% of sites do not have conserved secondary structure prediction. Furthermore, nonconserved structure sites are significantly less constrained in sequence divergence than either sites conserved in the secondary structure or sites conserved in loop. Avoiding regions symptomatic of conformational flexibility such as disordered sites and sites with nonconserved secondary structure to identify potential broad-specificity antiviral targets, only one sequence motif (five residues or longer) remains from the \u003E10,000 starting sites across all coronaviruses in this study. The identified sequence motif is found within the nonstructural protein (NSP) 12 and constitutes an antiviral target potentially effective against the present day and future coronaviruses. On shorter evolutionary timescales, the SARS and MERS clades have more sequence motifs fulfilling the criteria applied. Interestingly, many motifs map to NSP12 making this a prime target for coronavirus antivirals.","publish_time":"2016-11-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rahaman, Jordon; Siltberg-Liberles, Jessica","journal":"Genome Biol Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c745ca78351211b549476ef12e4cccf3fc3f5b84.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5203785.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evw246; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27797946/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs1NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["nonconserved structure sites","disordered sites","starting sites","nonconserved secondary structure","conserved secondary structure prediction","secondary structure predictions","related coronaviruses","future coronaviruses","sequence motifs","regions of intrinsic disorder","sequence divergence","virus families","disordered regions","conservation of intrinsic disorder","identified sequence motif","little intrinsic disorder","different coronavirus protein families","SARS","CoV","nonstructural protein","host range","new host","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","MERS clades","prime target","coronavirus antivirals","regions symptomatic of conformational flexibility","evolutionary context","motifs map","shorter evolutionary timescales","potential broad-specificity antiviral targets","present day","increased virulence","primary exception","humans","NSP12","rewiring interactions","years","loop","nucleocapsid","criteria","residues","implication","study"],"language":"en"},

The high level of mutations of the IB virus (IBV) leads to the emergence of new serotypes and genotypes, and limits the efficacy of routine prevention. Medicinal plants, or substances derived from them, are being tested as options in the prevention of infectious diseases such as IB in many countries. The objective of this study was to investigate extracts of 15 selected medicinal plants for anti-IBV activity. RESULTS: Extracts of S. montana, O. vulgare, M. piperita, M. officinalis, T. vulgaris, H. officinalis, S. officinalis and D. canadense showed anti-IBV activity prior to and during infection, while S. montana showed activity prior to and after infection. M. piperita, O. vulgare and T. vulgaris extracts had \u003E 60 SI. In further studies no virus plaques (plaque reduction rate 100%) or cytopathogenic effect (decrease of TCID(50) from 2.0 to 5.0 log(10)) were detected after IBV treatment with extracts of M. piperita, D. canadense and T. vulgaris at concentrations of extracts \u22650.25 cytotoxic concentration (CC(50)) (P \u003C 0.05). Both PFU number and TCID(50) increased after the use of M. piperita, D. canadense, T. vulgaris and M. officinalis extracts, the concentrations of which were 0.125 CC(50) and 0.25 CC(50) (P \u003C 0.05). Real-time PCR detected IBV RNA after treatment with all plant extracts using concentrations of 1:2 CC(50), 1:4 CC(50) and 1:8 CC(50). Delta cycle threshold (Ct) values decreased significantly comparing Ct values of 1:2 CC(50) and 1:8 CC(50) dilutions (P \u003C 0.05).

As a result, the Centers for Disease Control predict more deaths resulting from microorganisms than all cancers combined by 2050. Currently, many traditional models used to study bacterial infections fail to precisely replicate the in vivo bacterial environment. These models often fail to incorporate fluid flow, bio-mechanical cues, intercellular interactions, host-bacteria interactions, and even the simple inclusion of relevant physiological proteins in culture media. As a result of these inadequate models, there is often a poor correlation between in vitro and in vivo assays, limiting therapeutic potential. Thus, the urgency to establish in vitro and ex vivo systems to investigate the mechanisms underlying bacterial infections and to discover new-age therapeutics against bacterial infections is dire. In this review, we present an update of current in vitro and ex vivo models that are comprehensively changing the landscape of traditional microbiology assays. Further, we provide a comparative analysis of previous research on various established organ-disease models. Lastly, we provide insight on future techniques that may more accurately test new formulations to meet the growing demand of antibiotic resistant bacterial infections.","publish_time":"2018-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Di; Mi, Gujie; Wang, Mian; Webster, Thomas J.","journal":"Biomaterials","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ac0e2eea2bcd4b5015bcfe9dfb62bae24cfba67.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172914.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0142961218307440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30384974/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961218307440; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.10.030","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs1ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bacterial environment","traditional models","growing demand of antibiotic resistant bacterial infections","inadequate models","various established organ-disease models","ex","result","host-bacteria interactions","intercellular interactions","growing problem","Disease Control","new formulations","landscape of traditional microbiology assays","new-age therapeutics","bio-mechanical cues","simple inclusion of relevant physiological proteins","comparative analysis of previous research","deaths","fluid flow","culture media","Centers","mechanisms","microorganisms","past decade","systems","future techniques","update of current","poor correlation","insight","cancers","therapeutic potential","review","urgency"],"language":"en"},

Likewise, many viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of eukaryotes have evolved 2\u2032-O-methyltransferases to autonomously modify their mRNAs. However, a defined biological role for 2\u2032-O-methylation of mRNA remains elusive. Here we show that 2\u2032-O-methylation of viral mRNA was critically involved in subverting the induction of type I interferon. We demonstrate that human and mouse coronavirus mutants lacking 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase activity induced higher expression of type I interferon and were highly sensitive to type I interferon. Notably, the induction of type I interferon by viruses deficient in 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase was dependent on the cytoplasmic RNA sensor Mda5. This link between Mda5-mediated sensing of viral RNA and 2\u2032-O-methylation of mRNA suggests that RNA modifications such as 2\u2032-O-methylation provide a molecular signature for the discrimination of self and non-self mRNA.","publish_time":"2011-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Z\u00FCst, Roland; Cervantes-Barragan, Luisa; Habjan, Matthias; Maier, Reinhard; Neuman, Benjamin W; Ziebuhr, John; Szretter, Kristy J; Baker, Susan C; Barchet, Winfried; Diamond, Michael S; Siddell, Stuart G; Ludewig, Burkhard; Thiel, Volker","journal":"Nature Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5856d08e6923ed5366f12e5684243cf1ff98b9f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ebdadfca69444ceb4461969dfdbe7ce99e1d33b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3182538.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21217758/; https://www.nature.com/articles/ni.1979.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1038/ni.1979","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs1ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["O-methylation","O-methyltransferases","interferon","O-methyltransferase activity","viral mRNA","induction of type","higher expression of type","non-self mRNA","RNA modifications","Mda5-mediated sensing of viral RNA","cytoplasmic RNA sensor Mda5","discrimination of self","viruses deficient","cap structures of higher eukaryote mRNAs","ribose","molecular signature","mouse coronavirus mutants","link","defined biological role","cytoplasm of eukaryotes"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN: Prospective randomised controlled non-inferiority study. SETTING: Microbiology department of a large teaching hospital in Lancashire, UK. PARTICIPANTS: Two members of the medical microbiology team carried out the duty work on any given week day and an on-call team member on any weekend day. 29 days were assigned in which staff were to say \u201CToday will be a quiet day\u201D and 32 days were assigned in which staff were to refrain from saying the word \u201Cquiet\u201D in any context. INTERVENTIONS: Each day was randomly allocated to either saying \u201CToday will be a quiet day\u201D (intervention group) or refraining from saying the word \u201Cquiet\u201D (control group) in any context. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was mean overall workload: a composite of number of clinically related telephone calls, clinically significant results, or validated results processed by the duty medical microbiology team during a 24 hour period referred to collectively as \u201Cclinical episodes.\u201D A difference of 30 clinical episodes was considered as the margin of non-inferiority. Secondary outcomes included the individual components of the primary outcome. RESULTS: Workload was measured each day over a 61 day period (1 May to 30 June 2019). A mean 139.0 clinical episodes occurred on control days compared with 144.9 on days when the experimental intervention was uttered, a difference of 5.9 (95% confidence interval\u221212.9 to 24.7). The upper bound was less than the specified margin of 30, providing evidence for non-inferiority. No evidence of a difference in workload was found between interventions with any of the four components, whether considering unadjusted or adjusted analyses, or looking at the subgroups of week days or weekends. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings refute the long held superstition that utterance of the word \u201Cquiet\u201D impacts on clinical workload, and therefore it should not be avoided. In the era of considerable staff shortages and increased work related stress, doctors should look to other methods to increase resilience and protect their wellbeing and mental health.

As such, chemokines play an important role in mediating pathophysiological events during microbial infection. In particular, CXCL9, 10 and 11 and their cognate receptor CXCR3 have been associated with the clinical course of several infectious diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza. While CXCL9, 10 and 11 share the same receptor and have overlapping functions, each can also have unique activity in host defense. The lack of a preferred characterized animal model for SARS has brought our attention to ferrets, which have been used for years in influenza studies. The lack of immunological reagents for ferrets prompted us to clone CXCL9, 10, 11 and CXCR3 and, in the case of CXCL10, to express the gene as a recombinant protein. In this study we demonstrate that endogenous ferret CXCL10 exhibits similar mRNA expression patterns in the lungs of deceased SARS patients and ferrets experimentally infected with SARS coronavirus. This study therefore represents an important step towards development of the ferret as a model for the role of CXCL9, 10 and 11:CXCR3 axis in severe viral infections.","publish_time":"2008-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Danesh, Ali; Seneviratne, Charit; Cameron, Cheryl M.; Banner, David; Devries, Mark E.; Kelvin, Alyson A.; Xu, Luoling; Ran, Longsi; Bosinger, Steven E.; Rowe, Thomas; Czub, Marcus; Jonsson, Colleen B.; Cameron, Mark J.; Kelvin, David J.","journal":"Molecular Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20a38a054a302914d42eb2b228afb705702de803.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f37df26a05846314d7e0e64692fe37fe95be14ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5653245.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5653245?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016158900700747X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016158900700747X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs2NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ferrets","role of CXCL9","SARS coronavirus","important role","CXCR3 axis","cognate receptor CXCR3","study","Chemokines","lungs of deceased SARS patients","endogenous ferret CXCL10","important step","case of CXCL10","influenza studies","severe viral infections","lack of immunological reagents","severe acute respiratory syndrome","preferred characterized animal model","similar mRNA expression patterns","infectious diseases","activation of cells","immune system","pathophysiological events","recruitment","receptors function","development","unique activity","sites of inflammation","microbial infection","clinical course","host defense","gene","attention","recombinant protein","years","functions"],"language":"en"},

HNVs enter host cells by fusing the viral and cellular membranes via the concerted action of the attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins, the main targets of the humoral immune response.

It also includes experts in community engagement strategies and ethical issues germane to vaccination policies, including eight African scientists with direct experience in developing and implementing vaccination policies in Africa. Ebola Vaccine Team B members have worked on a range of vaccination programmes, such as polio eradication (Africa and globally), development of meningococcal A disease vaccination campaigns in Africa, and malaria and HIV/AIDS vaccine research.

These two viruses pose major challenges to clinical management because there are no specific antiviral drugs available.

We have at least identified many of the critical geophysical constraints, transport opportunities, biotic requirements for some disease systems, and some of the socioeconomic factors that govern the process of migration and establishment of parasites and pathogens.

However, epidemiological information regarding bovine noroviruses is still lacking for many important cattle producing countries from South America. In this study, three bovine norovirus genogroup III sequences were determined by conventional RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing in feces from diarrheic dairy calves from Argentina (B4836, B4848, and B4881, all collected in 2012). Phylogenetic studies based on a partial coding region for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, 503 nucleotides) of these three samples suggested that two of them (B4836 and B4881) belong to genotype 2 (GIII.2) while the third one (B4848) was more closely related to genotype 1 (GIII.1) strains. By deep sequencing, the capsid region from two of these strains could be determined. This confirmed the circulation of genotype 1 (B4848) together with the presence of another sequence (B4881) sharing its highest genetic relatedness with genotype 1, but sufficiently distant to constitute a new genotype. This latter strain was shown in silico to be a recombinant: phylogenetic divergence was detected between its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase coding sequence (genotype GIII.2) and its capsid protein coding sequence (genotype GIII.1 or a potential norovirus genotype). According to this data, this strain could be the second genotype GIII.2_GIII.1 bovine norovirus recombinant described in literature worldwide. Further analysis suggested that this strain could even be a potential norovirus GIII genotype, tentatively named GIII.4. The data provides important epidemiological and evolutionary information on bovine noroviruses circulating in South America.","publish_time":"2016-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ferragut, F\u00E1tima; Vega, Celina G.; Mauroy, Axel; Concei\u00E7\u00E3o-Neto, N\u00E1dia; Zeller, Mark; Heylen, Elisabeth; Uriarte, Enrique Louge; Bilbao, Gladys; Bok, Marina; Matthijnssens, Jelle; Thiry, Etienne; Badaracco, Alejandra; Parre\u00F1o, Viviana","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39b54c3e0c3560b23189d363831c0b04f213055f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185671.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S156713481630065X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156713481630065X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2016.02.034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26940636/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs4MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sanger"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Argentina","South America"],"keyphrases":["genotype GIII","potential norovirus GIII genotype","new genotype","circulation of genotype","potential norovirus genotype","Bovine noroviruses","bovine norovirus recombinant","bovine norovirus genogroup","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase coding sequence","B4881","B4848","capsid protein coding sequence","diarrheic dairy calves","non-diarrheic calves","partial coding region","capsid region","epidemiological information","B4836","South America","countries","data","strains","Sanger sequencing","evolutionary information","deep sequencing","important cattle","fecal samples","Phylogenetic studies","phylogenetic divergence","feces","Argentina","conventional RT-PCR","sequences","enteric pathogens","RdRp","highest genetic relatedness","nucleotides","silico","study","presence","literature","analysis"],"language":"en"},

However, the swiftly spreading virus also caused an unprecedentedly rapid response from the research community facing the unknown health challenge of potentially enormous proportions. Unfortunately, the experimental research to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the viral infection and to design a vaccine or antivirals is costly and takes months to develop.

Palivizumab (PZ) is the only RSV-specific immunoprophylaxis approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Mutations leading to amino acid substitutions in the PZ binding site of the RSV F protein have been associated with breakthrough RSV infections in patients receiving PZ. OBJECTIVE: To detect PZ resistance conferring mutations in RSV strains from children who received PZ. STUDY DESIGN: Children aged \u226424 months on October 31 who were hospitalized or had outpatient visits for respiratory illness and/or fever during October\u2013May 2001\u20132008 in 3 US counties were included. PZ receipt was obtained from parent interviews and medical records among children subsequently infected with RSV. Archived nasal/throat swab specimens were tested for RSV by real-time RT-PCR. The coding region of the PZ binding site of the RSV F protein was sequenced using both Sanger and pyrosequencing methods. RESULTS: Of 8762 enrolled children, 375 (4.3%) were tested for RSV and had a history of PZ receipt, of which 56 (14.9%) were RSV-positive and 45 of these had available archived specimens. Molecular typing identified 42 partial F gene sequences in specimens from 39 children: 19 single RSV subgroup A, 17 subgroup B and 3 mixed infections. Nucleotide substitutions were identified in 12/42 (28.6%) RSV strains. PZ resistance mutations were identified in 4 (10.2%) of the 39 children, of which one had documented PZ receipt. CONCLUSIONS: Although RSV PZ resistance mutations were infrequent, most RSV-associated illnesses in children with a history of PZ receipt were not due to strain resistance.","publish_time":"2015-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oliveira, Danielle B.L.; Iwane, Marika K.; Prill, Mila M.; Weinberg, Geoffrey A.; Williams, John V.; Griffin, Marie R.; Szilagyi, Peter G.; Edwards, Kathryn M.; Staat, Mary A.; Hall, Caroline B.; Durigon, Edison L.; Erdman, Dean D.","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a3fffb071de7d5eeb06af3def8945e7a9ff30218.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172275.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S138665321500030X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138665321500030X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25766983/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2015.01.016","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sanger"],"organizations":["U.S. Food and Drug Administration","RSV F","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RSV PZ resistance mutations","RSV strains","RSV-positive","RSV F protein","breakthrough RSV infections","history of PZ receipt","single RSV subgroup","RSV-associated illnesses","documented PZ receipt","PZ binding site","RSV-specific immunoprophylaxis","enrolled children","strain resistance","major cause of respiratory infections","respiratory illness","available archived specimens","mixed infections","throat swab specimens","Respiratory syncytial virus","partial F gene sequences","subgroup B","Archived nasal","Nucleotide substitutions","amino acid substitutions","parent interviews","Molecular typing","medical records","Food","Sanger","BACKGROUND","coding region","patients","CONCLUSIONS","real-time RT-PCR","outpatient visits","STUDY DESIGN","Drug Administration","pyrosequencing methods","fever","RESULTS","months","OBJECTIVE","US counties","Palivizumab"],"language":"en"},

Burkholderia mallei is a host-adapted clone of B. pseudomallei that does not persist outside of its equine reservoir and causes the zoonosis glanders, which is endemic in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America. Infection by these organisms typically occurs via percutaneous inoculation or inhalation of aerosols, and the most common manifestation is severe pneumonia leading to fatal bacteremia. Glanders and melioidosis are difficult to diagnose and require prolonged antibiotic therapy with low success rates. There are no vaccines available to protect against either Burkholderia species, and there is concern regarding their use as biological warfare agents given that B. mallei has previously been utilized in this manner. Hence, experiments were performed to establish a mouse model of aerosol infection to study the organisms and develop countermeasures. Using a hand-held aerosolizer, BALB/c mice were inoculated intratracheally with strains B. pseudomallei 1026b and B. mallei ATCC23344 and growth of the agents in the lungs, as well as dissemination to the spleen, were examined. Mice infected with 10(2), 10(3) and 10(4) organisms were unable to control growth of B. mallei in the lungs and bacteria rapidly disseminated to the spleen. Though similar results were observed in mice inoculated with 10(3) and 10(4) B. pseudomallei cells, animals infected with 10(2) organisms controlled bacterial replication in the lungs, dissemination to the spleen, and the extent of bacteremia. Analysis of sera from mice surviving acute infection revealed that animals produced antibodies against antigens known to be targets of the immune response in humans. Taken together, these data show that small volume aerosol inoculation of mice results in acute disease, dose-dependent chronic infection, and immune responses that correlate with those seen in human infections.","publish_time":"2013-10-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lafontaine, Eric R.; Zimmerman, Shawn M.; Shaffer, Teresa L.; Michel, Frank; Gao, Xiudan; Hogan, Robert J.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33b590b2a517896a894c71c1c0b86c593804c034.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3788738.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0076804; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24098563/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjs5MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Asia","Africa","Middle East","South America"],"keyphrases":["organisms","Burkholderia mallei","Burkholderia pseudomallei","acute infection","c mice","lungs","spleen","mallei ATCC23344","pseudomallei cells","small volume aerosol inoculation of mice results","growth of","mouse model of aerosol infection","animals","dissemination","Burkholderia species","dose-dependent chronic infection","acute disease","percutaneous inoculation","similar results","zoonosis glanders","immune responses","fatal bacteremia","extent of bacteremia","etiologic agent of melioidosis","biological warfare agents","prolonged antibiotic therapy","saprophytic bacterium","wet soils of countries","Middle East","Africa","low success rates","severe pneumonia","Asia","common manifestation","host-adapted clone of","inhalation of aerosols","hand-held aerosolizer","BALB","data","antibodies","strains","bacterial replication","South America","Analysis of sera","equator","equine reservoir","vaccines available","humans","antigens","human infections","experiments","countermeasures","manner"],"language":"en"},

As for all paramyxoviruses, proteolytic activation of the NiV-F protein is an indispensable prerequisite for viral infectivity. Interestingly, proteolytic activation of NiV-F differs principally from other paramyxoviruses with respect to protease usage (cathepsins instead of trypsin- or furin-like proteases), and the subcellular localization where cleavage takes place (endosomes instead of Golgi or plasma membrane). To allow efficient F protein activation needed for productive virus replication and cell-to-cell fusion, the NiV-F cytoplasmic tail contains a classical tyrosine-based endocytosis signal (Y525RSL) that we have shown earlier to be needed for F uptake and proteolytic activation. In this report, we furthermore revealed that an intact endocytosis signal alone is not sufficient for full bioactivity. The very C-terminus of the cytoplasmic tail is needed in addition. Deletions of more than four residues did not affect F uptake or endosomal cleavage but downregulated the surface expression, likely by delaying the intracellular trafficking through endosomal-recycling compartments. Given that the NiV-F cytoplasmic tail is needed for timely and correct intracellular trafficking, endosomal cleavage and fusion activity, the influence of tail truncations on NiV-mediated cell-to-cell fusion and on pseudotyping lentiviral vectors is discussed.","publish_time":"2015-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weis, Michael; Maisner, Andrea","journal":"European Journal of Cell Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/49c37548b2dc49396b686e242dd20a426dd907da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114669.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejcb.2015.05.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26059400/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0171933515000515; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0171933515000515","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NiV-F protein","NiV-F cytoplasmic tail","F uptake","proteolytic activation of NiV","fusion protein","cell fusion","efficient F protein activation","NiV-mediated cell","endosomal cleavage","fusion activity","influence of tail truncations","paramyxoviruses","receptor-binding protein G","correct intracellular trafficking","endosomal-recycling compartments","intact endocytosis signal","surface glycoproteins","surface expression","classical tyrosine-based endocytosis signal","productive virus replication","Abstract Nipah virus","endosomes","indispensable prerequisite","trypsin","cathepsins","protease usage","place","subcellular localization","Golgi","proteases","respect","Y525RSL","pathogenic paramyxovirus","pseudotyping lentiviral vectors","viral infectivity","plasma membrane","furin","residues","C-terminus","addition","Deletions","bioactivity","report"],"language":"en"},

While, at first, it appeared as a disease affecting feeder pigs, fattening- and adult swine, it later also became pathogenic for neonatal and suckling pigs hereby drastically increasing its economic impact. Isolation of the causative virus revealed a new porcine coronavirus, the origin of which has never been clarified. Pathogenesis studies with the prototype strain CV777 showed severe villous atrophy in neonatal pigs and the virus-animal interactions showed many similarities with transmissible gastro-enteritis virus (TGEV), another porcine coronavirus. Disease patterns in field outbreaks showed muchvariation but, while farm related factors played a role, possible genetic variations of virus strains in Europe have not been examined and are thus unknown. CV777 in experimental pigs caused diarrheal disease and mortality rates similar to those later encountered in Asia and more recently with the \u201Coriginal\u201D US strains even though genomic typing of the prototype European strain have shown that it belongs to the S-INDEL strains. In Europe, PED has become endemic during the eighties and nineties and subsequently regressed so that, after 2000, swine populations in many countries have largely become seronegative. Sporadic outbreaks have recently reappeared showing a large variety of clinical outcomes.","publish_time":"2016-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pensaert, Maurice B.; Martelli, Paolo","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b9fbe0887c389e6c5202eaf5d7e21c9d19ab6bc6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132433.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2016.05.030; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170216301800; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27317168/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170216301800","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe","Asia"],"keyphrases":["neonatal pigs","experimental pigs","suckling pigs","feeder pigs","causative virus","prototype strain CV777","virus-animal interactions","transmissible gastro-enteritis virus","possible genetic variations of virus strains","diarrheal disease","PED","Disease patterns","new porcine coronavirus","prototype European strain","S-INDEL strains","emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea","field outbreaks","adult swine","swine populations","Sporadic outbreaks","severe villous atrophy","similarities","genomic typing","role","muchvariation","TGEV","mortality rates similar","fattening","related factors","Pathogenesis studies","early seventies","large variety of clinical outcomes","countries","eighties","origin","economic impact","nineties","Isolation","Asia","retrospect"],"language":"en"},

Rapid diagnostics of viral pathogens is essential to avoid unnecessary antibiotic treatment, thereby slowing down antibiotic-resistance. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel FAST v2 against viral specific PCR as reference assays for ARI in Vietnam. Methods: Four hundred and forty two nose and throat swabs were collected in viral transport medium, and were tested with Luminex xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel FAST v2. Multiplex RT-PCR and single RT-PCR were used as references. Results: Overall, sensitivity of the Luminex against reference assays was 91.8%, 95% CI 88.1-94.7 (270/294), whilst 112/6336 (1.8%, 95% CI, 1.4-2.1) of pathogens were detected by the Luminex, but not by reference assays. Frequency of pathogens detected by Luminex and reference assays was 379 and 292, respectively. The diagnostic yield was 66.7% (295/442, 95%CI 62.1-71.1%) for the Luminex assay and 54.1% (239/442, 95% CI, 49.3-58.8%) for reference assays. The Luminex kit had higher yields for all viruses except influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and human bocavirus. High agreements between both methods [mean (range): 0.91 (0.83-1.00)] were found for 10/15 viral agents. Conclusions: The Luminex assay is a high throughput multiplex platform for rapid detection of common viral pathogens causing ARI. Although the current high cost may prevent Luminex assays from being widely used, especially in limited resource settings where ARI are felt most, its introduction in clinical diagnostics may help reduce unnecessary use of antibiotic prescription.","publish_time":"2018-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thi Ty Hang, Vu; Thi Han Ny, Nguyen; My Phuc, Tran; Thi Thanh Tam, Pham; Thao Huong, Dang; Dang Trung Nghia, Ho; Tran Anh Vu, Nguyen; Thi Hong Phuong, Pham; Van Xang, Nguyen; Dong, Nguyen; Nhu Hiep, Pham; Van Hung, Nguyen; Tinh Hien, Tran; Rabaa, Maia; Thwaites, Guy E.; Baker, Stephen; Van Tan, Le; van Doorn, H.Rogier","journal":"Wellcome Open Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/04d638b3c1d8b8fcd771e569e439b364d4ac2c1a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5811805.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.12429.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29503874/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Luminex","ARI"],"locations":["Vietnam"],"keyphrases":["Luminex assays","reference assays","Luminex kit","Luminex xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel FAST v2","viral agents","ARI","Rapid diagnostics of viral pathogens","viral specific PCR","rapid detection of common viral pathogens","viral transport medium","Frequency of pathogens","respiratory syncytial virus","Multiplex RT-PCR","Acute respiratory infections","single RT-PCR","unnecessary antibiotic treatment","High agreements","antibiotic-resistance","Methods","high throughput multiplex platform","unnecessary use of antibiotic prescription","current high cost","clinical diagnostics","diagnostic performance","diagnostic yield","influenza B virus","viruses","higher yields","children","throat swabs","leading causes of hospitalization","human bocavirus","Background","sensitivity","years old","limited resource settings","introduction","Vietnam","nose","references","Conclusions","Results","range"],"language":"en"},

ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous and widely expressed in the heart, vessels, gut, lung (particularly in type 2 pneumocytes and macrophages), kidney, testis and brain. ACE2 is mostly bound to cell membranes and only scarcely present in the circulation in a soluble form. An important salutary function of membrane-bound and soluble ACE2 is the degradation of angiotensin II to angiotensin(1-7). Consequently, ACE2 receptors limit several detrimental effects resulting from binding of angiotensin II to AT1 receptors, which include vasoconstriction, enhanced inflammation and thrombosis. The increased generation of angiotensin(1-7) also triggers counter-regulatory protective effects through binding to G-protein coupled Mas receptors. Unfortunately, the entry of SARS-CoV2 into the cells through membrane fusion markedly down-regulates ACE2 receptors, with loss of the catalytic effect of these receptors at the external site of the membrane. Increased pulmonary inflammation and coagulation have been reported as unwanted effects of enhanced and unopposed angiotensin II effects via the ACE\u2192Angiotensin II\u2192AT1 receptor axis. Clinical reports of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show that several features associated with infection and severity of the disease (i.e., older age, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) share a variable degree of ACE2 deficiency. We suggest that ACE2 down-regulation induced by viral invasion may be especially detrimental in people with baseline ACE2 deficiency associated with the above conditions. The additional ACE2 deficiency after viral invasion might amplify the dysregulation between the \u2018adverse\u2019 ACE\u2192Angiotensin II\u2192AT1 receptor axis and the \u2018protective\u2019 ACE2\u2192Angiotensin(1-7)\u2192Mas receptor axis. In the lungs, such dysregulation would favor the progression of inflammatory and thrombotic processes triggered by local angiotensin II hyperactivity unopposed by angiotensin(1-7). In this setting, recombinant ACE2, angiotensin(1-7) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers could be promising therapeutic approaches in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Verdecchia, Paolo; Cavallini, Claudio; Spanevello, Antonio; Angeli, Fabio","journal":"Eur J Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/071cbb29c961a8fb45d45738395a7c7f9dbfdfda.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167588.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32336612/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0953620520301515; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejim.2020.04.037; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0953620520301515","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE2 receptors","binding of angiotensin","unopposed angiotensin","local angiotensin","degradation of angiotensin","soluble ACE2","recombinant ACE2","baseline ACE2 deficiency","additional ACE2 deficiency","increased generation of angiotensin","AT1 receptors","SARS-CoV","Mas receptors","variable degree of ACE2 deficiency","entry of SARS","AT1 receptor axis","detrimental effects","Mas receptor axis","receptor blockers","unwanted effects of enhanced","counter-regulatory protective effects","viral invasion","membrane fusion","dysregulation","type","enhanced inflammation","infection","cardiovascular disease","hyperactivity unopposed","important salutary function of membrane","soluble form","cell membranes","pulmonary inflammation","Clinical reports of patients","G-protein","thrombotic processes","therapeutic approaches","hypertension","diabetes","CoV2","strains of coronavirus","vasoconstriction","people","NL63","older age","progression of inflammatory","kidney","heart","macrophages","gut","pneumocytes","coagulation","cells","catalytic effect","loss","external site","testis","vessels","circulation","severity","thrombosis","features","setting","enzyme","brain","conditions","lungs"],"language":"en"},

If surveillance fails to address the needs of practitioners and policy-makers, it is likely that there will be loss of confidence. Current surveillance systems are reasonably effective at detecting significant events that are localised in time and space. It is more difficult to detect diffuse and progressive events with a slow increase over time or sporadic and widespread events without obvious links to time, place or person. Detection of these events relies on good data collection, comparative background data and sophisticated analytical tools. To improve surveillance systems, we need methods with the appropriate sensitivity and specificity for the outputs desired. Targeted surveillance should enable better ascertainment of those cases which must be considered and those which can be dismissed. New methods, such as mathematical modelling and geographical information systems, support conventional surveillance in moving events into the known and predictable category. It is important to integrate surveillance across local, regional and international levels and to base surveillance on local public health structures. The purpose and value of data aggregation at each level and the amount of detail needed at each level must be carefully evaluated. The key to all these improvements is developing the workforce. Surveillance needs individuals with a broad range of skills: clinical, epidemiological, anthropological, and mathematical; in particular, people who can think laterally. These individuals must be encouraged through effective training courses, good mentorship, networking and clear career structures.","publish_time":"2005-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weinberg, J.","journal":"Clinical Microbiology and Infection","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X15300173; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X15300173","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effective surveillance","base surveillance","conventional surveillance","Targeted surveillance","Current surveillance systems","widespread events","moving events","progressive events","time","significant events","New methods","good data collection","new technology","individuals","local public health structures","comparative background data","value of data aggregation","geographical information systems","ABSTRACT New emerging","effective training courses","good mentorship","mathematical modelling","needs of practitioners","weight of public opinion","clear career structures","networking","re-emerging threats","obvious links","slow increase","international levels","broad range of skills","sophisticated analytical tools","specificity","appropriate sensitivity","place","policy-makers","better ascertainment","treatment","outputs desired","predictable category","purpose","person","improvements","cases","people","Detection","loss of confidence","key","workforce","space","future"],"language":"en"},

Western blot analysis required that membrane preparations not be incubated in the loading buffer above 50\u00B0C to avoid aggregation of the protein. Treatment of membrane fractions from HsPCFT-transfected HeLa cells with peptidyl N-glycanase F, or cells with tunicamycin, resulted in conversion to a \u223C35 kDa species. Substitution of asparagine residues of two canonical glycosylation sites to glutamine, individually, yielded a \u223C 47 kDa protein; substitution of both sites gave a smaller (\u223C35 kDa) protein. Single mutants retained full transport activity; the double mutant retained a majority of activity.

Due to a lack of proper information about Asn-linked (N-glycans) on ZIKV E, we analyzed ZIKV E of various strains derived from different cells. We found ZIKV E proteins being extensively modified with oligomannose, hybrid and complex N-glycans of a highly heterogeneous nature.

In Australia and Canada, the dominant narrative of resource extraction is that most of the benefits flow away from host regions. This paper draws on evolutionary economic geography, presenting a case study of the Limestone Coast in South Australia, which previously extracted and distributed gas locally to food and fibre manufacturing industries. New policies seeking to renew the gas industry in the region, provide subsidies for exploration. Scenarios were developed to help inform decisions about the role of gas within this region. Qualitative analysis of the scenarios emphasised that gas needs to be affordable and locally accessible. Quantitative modelling showed that using the gas locally by manufacturing industries as part of broader industrial expansion would lead to greater benefits compared with exporting all gas outside the region. We conclude that policy settings have gone some way towards realising increased benefits for the region. Regional stakeholders clearly favoured the local use scenario but saw it as unlikely in the context of current infrastructure limitations. Stakeholders sought policy support for infrastructure to enable the preferred scenario to be realised.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Measham, Thomas G.; Poruschi, Lavinia; Marcos-Martinez, Raymundo","journal":"Extr Ind Soc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/206c928a201dad1f1b9f0e8aa8a5fc3d812cdab0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194547.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exis.2020.04.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214790X20300253; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214790X20300253; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363147/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs3MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia","Canada","South Australia"],"keyphrases":["gas needs","distributed gas","gas industry","role of gas","greater benefits","increased benefits","policy support","policy settings","Scenarios","host regions","fibre manufacturing industries","dominant narrative of resource extraction","South Australia","Regional stakeholders","preferred scenario","local use scenario","context of current infrastructure limitations","case study","broader industrial expansion","Limestone Coast","major issue","food","evolutionary economic geography","Canada","research","way","paper","subsidies","decisions","Qualitative analysis","New policies","exploration","Quantitative modelling","degree"],"language":"en"},

Several therapeutic options are currently emerging but none with universal consensus or proven efficacy. Solid organ transplant recipients are perceived to be at increased risk of severe COVID-19 because of their immunosuppressed conditions due to chronic use of immunosuppressive drugs (ISDs). It is therefore likely that solid organ transplant recipients will be treated with these experimental antivirals. METHODS: This article is not intended to provide a systematic literature review on investigational treatments tested against COVID-19; rather, the authors aim to provide recommendations for therapeutic drug monitoring of ISDs in transplant recipients infected with SARS-CoV-2 based on a review of existing data in the literature. RESULTS: Management of drug\u2013drug interactions between investigational anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs and immunosuppressants is a complex task for the clinician. Adequate immunosuppression is necessary to prevent graft rejection while, if critically ill, the patient may benefit from pharmacotherapeutic interventions directed at limiting SARS-CoV-2 viral replication. Maintaining ISD concentrations within the desired therapeutic range requires a highly individualized approach that is complicated by the pandemic context and lack of hindsight. CONCLUSIONS: With this article, the authors inform the clinician about the potential interactions of experimental COVID-19 treatments with ISDs used in transplantation. Recommendations regarding therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustments in the context of COVID-19 are provided.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Elens, Laure; Langman, Loralie J.; Hesselink, Dennis A.; Bergan, Stein; Moes, Dirk Jan A.R.; Molinaro, Mariadelfina; Venkataramanan, Raman; Lemaitre, Florian","journal":"Ther Drug Monit","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3311f6ac7a2115167140dc003f08b75111190eab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7188032.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/ftd.0000000000000761; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32304488/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs3NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ISD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["context of COVID","therapeutic drug monitoring of ISDs","drug interactions","investigational anti-SARS-CoV","Management of drug","potential interactions of experimental COVID","therapeutic options","Solid organ transplant recipients","increased risk of severe COVID","investigational treatments","desired therapeutic range","recommendations","clinician","authors","article","systematic literature review","pandemic context","experimental antivirals","review of existing data","severe acute respiratory distress","chronic use of immunosuppressive drugs","dose adjustments","immunosuppressed conditions","coronavirus","novel infectious disease","graft rejection","universal consensus","individualized approach","ISD concentrations","complex task","immunosuppressants","Adequate immunosuppression","pharmacotherapeutic interventions","proven efficacy","patient","lack of hindsight","RESULTS","viral replication","transplantation","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

To define key cell types that require type I IFN signaling to orchestrate immunity against West Nile virus (WNV), we infected mice with conditional deletions of the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) gene. Deletion of the Ifnar gene in subsets of myeloid cells resulted in uncontrolled WNV replication, vasoactive cytokine production, sepsis, organ damage, and death that were remarkably similar to infection of Ifnar (\u2212/\u2212) mice completely lacking type I IFN signaling. In Mavs(\u2212/\u2212)\u00D7Ifnar(\u2212/\u2212) myeloid cells and mice lacking both Ifnar and the RIG-I-like receptor adaptor gene Mavs, cytokine production was muted despite high levels of WNV infection. Thus, in myeloid cells, viral infection triggers signaling through MAVS to induce proinflammatory cytokines that can result in sepsis and organ damage. Viral pathogenesis was caused in part by massive complement activation, as liver damage was minimized in animals lacking complement components C3 or factor B or treated with neutralizing anti-C5 antibodies. Disease in Ifnar (\u2212/\u2212) and CD11c Cre(\u002B) Ifnar (f/f) mice also was facilitated by the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03B1, as blocking antibodies diminished complement activation and prolonged survival without altering viral burden.

In the past month we recorded an outbreak of Kawasaki disease; we aimed to evaluate incidence and features of patients with Kawasaki-like disease diagnosed during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. METHODS: All patients diagnosed with a Kawasaki-like disease at our centre in the past 5 years were divided according to symptomatic presentation before (group 1) or after (group 2) the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Kawasaki- like presentations were managed as Kawasaki disease according to the American Heart Association indications. Kawasaki disease shock syndrome (KDSS) was defined by presence of circulatory dysfunction, and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) by the Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation criteria. Current or previous infection was sought by reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, and by serological qualitative test detecting SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG, respectively. FINDINGS: Group 1 comprised 19 patients (seven boys, 12 girls; aged 3\u00B70 years [SD 2\u00B75]) diagnosed between Jan 1, 2015, and Feb 17, 2020. Group 2 included ten patients (seven boys, three girls; aged 7\u00B75 years [SD 3\u00B75]) diagnosed between Feb 18 and April 20, 2020; eight of ten were positive for IgG or IgM, or both. The two groups differed in disease incidence (group 1 vs group 2, 0\u00B73 vs ten per month), mean age (3\u00B70 vs 7\u00B75 years), cardiac involvement (two of 19 vs six of ten), KDSS (zero of 19 vs five of ten), MAS (zero of 19 vs five of ten), and need for adjunctive steroid treatment (three of 19 vs eight of ten; all p\u003C0\u00B701). INTERPRETATION: In the past month we found a 30-fold increased incidence of Kawasaki-like disease. Children diagnosed after the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic began showed evidence of immune response to the virus, were older, had a higher rate of cardiac involvement, and features of MAS. The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic was associated with high incidence of a severe form of Kawasaki disease.

One of the interventions implemented by the government is a school closure. The Ministry of Education decided to postpone the school opening from March 2 to April 6 to minimize epidemic size. We aimed to quantify the school closure effect on the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: The potential effects of school opening were measured using a mathematical model considering two age groups: children (aged 19 years and younger) and adults (aged over 19). Based on susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model, isolation and behavior-changed susceptible individuals are additionally considered. The transmission parameters were estimated from the laboratory confirmed data reported by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from February 16 to March 22. The model was extended with estimated parameters and estimated the expected number of confirmed cases as the transmission rate increased after school opening. RESULTS: Assuming the transmission rate between children group would be increasing 10 fold after the schools open, approximately additional 60 cases are expected to occur from March 2 to March 9, and approximately additional 100 children cases are expected from March 9 to March 23. After March 23, the number of expected cases for children is 28.4 for 7 days and 33.6 for 14 days. CONCLUSION: The simulation results show that the government could reduce at least 200 cases, with two announcements by the Ministry of education. After March 23, although the possibility of massive transmission in the children\u0027s age group is lower, group transmission is possible to occur.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Soyoung; Kim, Yae-Jean; Peck, Kyong Ran; Jung, Eunok","journal":"J Korean Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a79e1236b8a1790dd3a8f5dac2f3eae5124ce11e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131906.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32242349/; https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e143","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["The Ministry of Education"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["children cases","group transmission","number of expected cases","children group","transmission rate","transmission parameters","expected number of confirmed cases","school closure effect","potential effects of school opening","estimated parameters","possibility of massive transmission","children\u0027s age group","mathematical model","COVID","government","Ministry of Education","days","age groups","Disease Control","coronavirus disease","simulation results","susceptible individuals","epidemic size","Korea Centers","isolation","Nonpharmaceutical intervention strategy","Prevention","years","behavior","schools open","laboratory","fold","BACKGROUND","data","METHODS","announcements","adults","CONCLUSION","interventions"],"language":"en"},

In myeloid cells, IFN-\u03B3 induces formation of a multiprotein GAIT complex that binds structural GAIT elements in the 3\u0027 untranslated regions (UTR) of multiple inflammation-related mRNAs, including ceruloplasmin and VEGF-A, and represses their translation. The human GAIT complex is a heterotetramer containing glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS), NS1-associated protein 1 (NSAP1), ribosomal protein L13a (L13a), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). A network of IFN-\u03B3-stimulated kinases regulates recruitment and assembly of GAIT complex constituents. Activation of Cdk5, mTORC1, and S6K1 kinases induces EPRS release from its parental multi-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase complex to join NSAP1 in a \u201Cpre-GAIT\u201D complex. Subsequently, the DAPK-ZIPK kinase axis phosphorylates L13a, inducing release from the 60S ribosomal subunit and binding to GAPDH. The subcomplexes join to form the functional GAIT complex. Each constituent has a distinct role in the GAIT system. EPRS binds the GAIT element in target mRNAs, NSAP1 negatively regulates mRNA binding, L13a binds eIF4G to block ribosome recruitment, and GAPDH shields L13a from proteasomal degradation. The GAIT system is susceptible to genetic and condition-specific regulation. An N-terminus EPRS truncate is a dominant-negative inhibitor ensuring a \u201Ctranslational trickle\u201D of target transcripts. Also, hypoxia and oxidatively-modified lipoproteins regulate GAIT activity. Mouse models exhibiting absent or genetically-modified GAIT complex constituents are beginning to elucidate the physiological role of the GAIT system, particularly in the resolution of chronic inflammation. Finally, GAIT-like systems in proto-chordates suggests an evolutionarily conserved role of the pathway in innate immunity.","publish_time":"2017-11-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arif, Abul; Yao, Peng; Terenzi, Fulvia; Jia, Jie; Ray, Partho Sarothi; Fox, Paul L.","journal":"Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: RNA","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88570a6aef03be24f89f3c0c49d9f654af2c1240.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5815886.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29152905/; https://doi.org/10.1002/wrna.1441","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GAIT","EPRS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GAIT system","GAIT activity","pre-GAIT","multiprotein GAIT complex","functional GAIT complex","human GAIT complex","modified GAIT complex constituents","assembly of GAIT complex constituents","structural GAIT elements","NSAP1","EPRS release","ribosomal protein L13a","GAPDH shields L13a","IFN-\u03B3","parental multi-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase complex","\u03B3-stimulated kinases","target mRNAs","\u03B3-activated inhibitor of translation","N-terminus EPRS","conserved role","distinct role","physiological role","network of IFN","multiple inflammation-related mRNAs","ribosome recruitment","glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase","S6K1 kinases","translational trickle","mRNA binding","related genes","target transcripts","oxidatively-modified lipoproteins","S ribosomal subunit","dominant-negative inhibitor","NS1-associated protein","resolution of chronic inflammation","transcript-selective translational control","heterotetramer","formation","untranslated regions","UTR","mTORC1","eIF4G","DAPK-ZIPK kinase axis","condition-specific regulation","pathway","proto-chordates","ceruloplasmin","proteasomal degradation","glyceraldehyde","innate immunity","myeloid cells","Activation of Cdk5","hypoxia","phosphate dehydrogenase","VEGF","systems","Mouse models","subcomplexes","interferon"],"language":"en"},

To determine the ability of SARS-Cov nucleoprotein (N protein) to induce antiviral immunity, in this report, we established a stable C2C12 line expressing SARS-Cov N protein, which was used as a target for specific CTL assay. We also expressed recombinant N proteins in Escherichia coli and prepared N protein-specific polyclonal antibodies. C3H/He mice were immunized with N protein-expressible pcDN-fn vector by intramuscular injections. We found that the DNA vaccination induced both N protein-specific antibody and specific CTL activity to the target. When C3H/He mice were immunized by three separate injections, high antibody titre (1:3200\u20131:6400, average titre is 1:4580) and high CTL activity (67.4\u00B18.4% (E:T=25:1), 69.6\u00B16.7% (E:T=50:1) and 71.8\u00B16.2% (E:T=100:1)) were observed.

Patients infected by HCoV-NL63 are typically young children with upper and lower respiratory tract infection, presenting with symptoms including croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. Unfortunately, there are currently no effective antiviral therapy to contain HCoV-NL63 infection. CoV genomes encode an integral viral component, main protease (M(pro)), which is essential for viral replication through proteolytic processing of RNA replicase machinery. Due to the sequence and structural conservation among all CoVs, M(pro) has been recognized as an attractive molecular target for rational anti-CoV drug design. Here we present the crystal structure of HCoV-NL63 M(pro) in complex with a Michael acceptor inhibitor N3. Structural analysis, consistent with biochemical inhibition results, reveals the molecular mechanism of enzyme inhibition at the highly conservative substrate-recognition pocket.

Although the original outbreak was controlled by classical public health measures, there is a real risk that another SARS-CoV could re-emerge from its natural reservoir, either in its original form or as a more virulent or pathogenic strain; in which case, the virus would be difficult to control in the absence of any effective antiviral drugs or vaccines. Using the well-studied SARS-CoV isolate HKU-39849, we developed a vaccinia virus-based SARS-CoV reverse genetic system that is both robust and biosafe. The SARS-CoV genome was cloned in separate vaccinia virus vectors, (vSARS-CoV-5prime and vSARS-CoV-3prime) as two cDNAs that were subsequently ligated to create a genome-length SARS-CoV cDNA template for in vitro transcription of SARS-CoV infectious RNA transcripts. Transfection of the RNA transcripts into permissive cells led to the recovery of infectious virus (recSARS-CoV). Characterization of the plaques produced by recSARS-CoV showed that they were similar in size to the parental SARS-CoV isolate HKU-39849 but smaller than the SARS-CoV isolate Frankfurt-1. Comparative analysis of replication kinetics showed that the kinetics of recSARS-CoV replication are similar to those of SARS-CoV Frankfurt-1, although the titers of virus released into the culture supernatant are approximately 10-fold less. The reverse genetic system was finally used to generate a recSARS-CoV reporter virus expressing Renilla luciferase in order to facilitate the analysis of SARS-CoV gene expression in human dendritic cells (hDCs). In parallel, a Renilla luciferase gene was also inserted into the genome of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). Using this approach, we demonstrate that, in contrast to HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV is not able to mediate efficient heterologous gene expression in hDCs.","publish_time":"2012-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"van den Worm, Sjoerd H.

MERS-CoV had been associated with a high case fatality rate especially among severe cases. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of reported MERS-CoV cases between December 2016 and January 2019, as retrieved from the World Health Organization. The aim of this study is to examine the epidemiology of reported cases and quantify the percentage of health care workers (HCWs) among reported cases. Results There were 403 reported cases with a majority being men (n = 300; 74.4%). These cases were reported from Lebanon, Malaysia, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates. HCWs represented 26% and comorbidities were reported among 71% of non-HCWs and 1.9% among HCWs (P \u003C .0001). Camel exposure and camel milk ingestion were reported in 64% each, and the majority (97.8%) of those with camel exposures had camel milk ingestion. There were 58% primary cases and 42% were secondary cases. The case fatality rate was 16% among HCWs compared with 34% among other patients (P = .001). The mean age \u00B1 SD was 47.65 \u00B1 16.28 for HCWs versus 54.23 \u00B1 17.34 for non-HCWs (P = .001). Conclusions MERS-CoV infection continues to have a high case fatality rate and a large proportion of patients were HCWs.

However, we believe that the introduction of a fixed requirement to corroborate microarray data, especially if adopted by more journals, is overly burdensome and may, in at least several applications of microarray technology, be inappropriate. We also believe that, in cases in which corroborative studies are deemed essential, a lack of clear guidance leaves researchers unclear as to what constitutes an acceptable corroborative study. Guidelines have already been outlined regarding the details of conducting microarray experiments. We propose that all stakeholders, including journal editorial boards, reviewers, and researchers, should undertake concerted and inclusive efforts to address properly and clarify the specific issue of corroborative data.

Viral RNA was subsequently extracted from each pool and tested using the CDC SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. Positive pools were consequently split into individual specimens and tested by extraction and PCR. This method was also tested on an unselected group of 60 nasopharyngeal specimens grouped into 12 pools. RESULTS: All 25 pools were positive with cycle threshold (Ct) values within 0 and 5.03 Ct of the original individual specimens. The analysis of 60 specimens determined that 2 pools were positive followed by identification of 2 individual specimens among the 60 tested. This testing was accomplished while using 22 extractions/PCR tests, a savings of 38 reactions.

To perform numerous functions within infected cells, the M protein needs to recruit cellular partners. To better understand the role of M during VSV replication, we looked for interacting partners by using the two-hybrid system. The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit i (eIF3i) was identified to be an M-binding partner, and this interaction was validated by GST pull-down and laser confocal assays. Through a mutagenesis analysis, we found that some mutants of M between amino acids 122 and 181 impaired but did not completely abolish the M\u2013eIF3i interaction. Furthermore, the knockdown of eIF3i by RNA interference decreased viral replication and transcription in the early stages but led to increase in later stages. VSV transcription was increased at 4h post-infection but was not changed at 8 and 12h post-infection after the over-expression of eIF3i. Finally, we also demonstrated that VSV could inhibit the activity of Akt1 and that the knockdown of eIF3i inhibited the expression of the ISGs regulated by phospho-Akt1. These results indicated that eIF3i may affect VSV growth by regulating the host antiviral response in HeLa cells.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pan, Wei; Song, Deguang; He, Wenqi; Lu, Huijun; Lan, Yungang; Li, Hongli; Gao, Feng; Zhao, Kui","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4942c524b2d3ef76f18d3a08b30981e0a4820939.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117458.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.10.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29173589/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113517309124; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113517309124","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs2NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GST","RNA","VSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VSV replication","knockdown of eIF3i","eIF3i interaction","VSV transcription","viral replication","virus replication","VSV growth","over-expression of eIF3i","viral genome replication","multiple functions","h post-infection","modulating multiple host","numerous functions","HeLa cells","infected cells","phospho-Akt1","early stages","activity of Akt1","later stages","cellular partners","matrix protein of vesicular stomatitis virus","host antiviral response","virion production","RNA interference","subunit i","eukaryotic translation initiation factor","GST pull-down","pathways","laser confocal assays","ISGs","mutants","amino acids","binding partner","role","results","mutagenesis analysis","hybrid system"],"language":"en"},

We analyzed the B cell compartment in human newborns and identified a population of neonatal regulatory B lymphocytes (nBreg cells) that produced interleukin 10 (IL-10) in response to RSV infection. The polyreactive B cell receptor of nBreg cells interacted with RSV protein F and induced upregulation of chemokine receptor CX3CR1. CX3CR1 interacted with RSV glycoprotein G, leading to nBreg cell infection and IL-10 production that dampened T helper 1 (Th1) cytokine production. In the respiratory tract of neonates with severe RSV-induced acute bronchiolitis, RSV-infected nBreg cell frequencies correlated with increased viral load and decreased blood memory Th1 cell frequencies. Thus, the frequency of nBreg cells is predictive of the severity of acute bronchiolitis disease and nBreg cell activity may constitute an early-life host response that favors microbial pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2017-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhivaki, Dania; Lemoine, S\u00E9bastien; Lim, Annick; Morva, Ahsen; Vidalain, Pierre-Olivier; Schandene, Liliane; Casartelli, Nicoletta; Rameix-Welti, Marie-Anne; Herv\u00E9, Pierre-Louis; D\u00E9riaud, Edith; Beitz, Benoit; Ripaux-Lefevre, Maryline; Miatello, Jordi; Lemercier, Brigitte; Lorin, Valerie; Descamps, Delphyne; Fix, Jenna; El\u00E9ou\u00EBt, Jean-Fran\u00E7ois; Riffault, Sabine; Schwartz, Olivier; Porcheray, Fabrice; Mascart, Fran\u00E7oise; Mouquet, Hugo; Zhang, Xiaoming; Tissi\u00E8res, Pierre; Lo-Man, Richard","journal":"Immunity","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b21f6a299e3b5b40ecf2e7ed99e941b3af72b763.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b2a9758643fe2551953f0aece46a4d8ada9c1541.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128247.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1074761317300328; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28228284/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761317300328; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2017.01.010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs2NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nBreg cell infection","nBreg cell activity","RSV-infected nBreg cell frequencies","RSV infection","polyreactive B cell receptor of nBreg cells","frequency of nBreg cells","B cell compartment","severe RSV","RSV protein F","RSV glycoprotein G","pulmonary infiltration of B cells","decreased blood memory Th1 cell frequencies","respiratory tract of neonates","Respiratory syncytial virus","population of neonatal regulatory B lymphocytes","induced upregulation of chemokine receptor CX3CR1","severity of acute bronchiolitis disease","major cause of lower respiratory tract infections","cytokine production","early-life host response","increased viral load","infants","human newborns","T helper","fatal cases","microbial pathogenesis","interleukin"],"language":"en"},

It is worth considering that children are the most vulnerable to respiratory pathogens, but fatal SARS-like virus had not caused severe cases among them. According to the pathological studies of COVID-19 and SARS, a sharp decrease in T lymphocytes leads to the breakdown of the immune system. The cellular immune system of children differs from that of adults may be the keystone of atypical clinical manifestations or even covert infection. The frequent childhood vaccinations and repeated pathogens infections might be resulting in trained immunity of innate immune cells, immune fitness of adaptive immune cells or cross-protection of antibodies in the children. Therefore, due to lack of specific vaccine, some vaccines for tuberculosis, influenza and pneumonia may have certain application potential for the front-line health workers in the prevention and control of COVID-19.

However, the disease presentation is nonspecific. The aim of this study was to define clearly the presentation, clinical progression, and laboratory data in a group of patients who had SARS. Design: Retrospective observational study. Setting: A tertiary care medical center with 51 negative-pressure isolation rooms in Taipei, Taiwan. Patients: Fifty-three patients with SARS seen between April 27 and June 16, 2003. Results: Fever (ie, temperature \u003E 38\u00B0C) was the most common symptom (98%) and the earliest. When admitted to the isolation unit of the hospital for observation, most patients reported nonspecific symptoms associated with their fever. Only two patients with preexisting illnesses had cough on the same day the fever began. Eventually, 39 patients (74%) developed cough, beginning at a mean (\u00B1 SD) time of 4.5 \u00B1 1.9 days after fever onset, and 35 patients (66%) had diarrhea beginning at a mean time of 6.0 \u00B1 3.3 days after fever onset. Thirty-one patients (59%) had abnormal findings on chest radiographs on hospital admission, and all but 1 patient (98%) eventually developed lung infiltrates that were consistent with pneumonia. The majority of patients (63%) first developed unifocal infiltrates at a mean time of 4.5 \u00B1 2.1 days after fever onset, while in 37% of patients the initial infiltrates were multifocal, appearing at a mean time of 5.8 \u00B1 1.3 days after fever onset. Common laboratory findings included lymphopenia (on hospital admission, 70%; during hospitalization, 95%), thrombocytopenia (on hospital admission, 28%; during hospitalization, 40%), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (on hospital admission, 58%; during hospitalization, 88%), creatine kinase (on hospital admission, 18%; during hospitalization, 32%), and aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase levels (on hospital admission, 27%; during hospitalization, 62%). Throat or nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR was positive in 40 of the 47 patients (85%) in whom the test was performed. Conclusions: None of the presenting symptoms or laboratory findings are pathognomonic for SARS. Even though cough developed in a majority of patients, it did not occur until later in the disease course, suggesting that a cough preceding or concurrent with the onset of fever is less likely to indicate SARS. While PCR for SARS-CoV appears to be the best early diagnostic test currently available, it is clear that better methods are needed to differentiate between SARS and non-SARS illness on initial presentation.","publish_time":"2004-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Ching-Lung; Lu, Yen-Ta; Peng, Meng-Jen; Chen, Pei-Jan; Lin, Rong-Luh; Wu, Chien-Liang; Kuo, Hsu-Tah","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/93b922d4f3bae90ff8ce10b4fed7a84888ddcc53.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094461.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369215311648; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369215311648","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["majority of patients","hospital admission","group of patients","fever onset","onset of fever","SARS-CoV","hospitalization","days","mean time","cough","non-SARS illness","disease presentation","Common laboratory findings","developed unifocal infiltrates","initial presentation","initial infiltrates","laboratory data","abnormal findings","real-time PCR","Study objectives","nonspecific symptoms","lung infiltrates","progressive disease","disease course","Retrospective observational study","aspartate aminotransferase","presenting symptoms","isolation unit","common symptom","alanine aminotransferase levels","negative-pressure isolation rooms","best early diagnostic test","reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","tertiary care medical center","Taipei","novel coronavirus","chest radiographs","lymphopenia","nasopharyngeal swab","elevated lactate dehydrogenase","Setting","Taiwan","clinical progression","preexisting illnesses","creatine kinase","better methods","Design","pneumonia","infection","temperature","Throat","diarrhea","thrombocytopenia","Conclusions","Results","SD","aim"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Infectious diseases are still a cause of high mortality and morbidity rates. Current microbiological diagnostic methods are based on culture and phenotypic identification of isolated microorganisms, which can be obtained in about 24-48h. Given that the microbiological identification is of major importance for patient management, new diagnostic methods are needed in order to detect and identify microorganisms in a timely and accurate manner. Over the last few years, several molecular techniques based on the amplification of microbial nucleic acids have been developed with the aim of reducing the time needed for the identification of the microorganisms involved in different infectious processes. On the other hand, mass spectrometry has emerged as a rapid and consistent alternative to conventional methods for microorganism identification. This review describes the most widely used mass spectrometry technologies \u2014matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) and electrospray ionization time-of-flight (ESI-TOF)\u2014, both for protein and nucleic acid analysis, as well as the commercial platforms available. Related publications of most interest in clinical microbiology are also reviewed.","publish_time":"2012-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jordana-Lluch, Elena; Martr\u00F3 Catal\u00E0, Elisa; Ausina Ruiz, Vicente","journal":"Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiolog\u00EDa Cl\u00EDnica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ea4ca2aae9c62360d8830eb753efbe993f704562.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103318.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213005X12000547; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213005X12000547","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs3MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ESI-TOF","rapid"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["needed for the identification of the microorganisms","and phenotypic identification of isolated microorganisms","TOF","of high mortality and morbidity","based on the amplification of microbial nucleic acids have been developed with the aim of reducing the","On the other hand","and electrospray ionization","Given that the microbiological identification","the most widely used mass spectrometry","detect and identify microorganisms in a timely and accurate manner","identificaci\u00F3n de microorganismos","as well as the commercial platforms available","of major importance for patient management","Over the last few years","needed in order","both for protein and nucleic acid","in different infectious","Related publications of most interest in clinical microbiology","conventional methods for microorganism identification","as a rapid and consistent alternative","identificaci\u00F3n fenot\u00EDpica","identificaci\u00F3n microbiol\u00F3gica","new diagnostic methods","Current microbiological diagnostic methods","ionizaci\u00F3n","MALDI","flight","ESI","tiempo necesario","revisi\u00F3n","which can be obtained in about","microorganismo de manera r\u00E1pida","microorganismos implicados","m\u00E9todos convencionales","alternativa r\u00E1pida","Abstract Infectious","m\u00E9todos de diagn\u00F3stico microbiol\u00F3gico","matrix","pron\u00F3stico","l\u00E1ser asistida","still","assisted laser desorption","also reviewed","This review","necesarias nuevas herramientas diagn\u00F3sticas capaces","amplificaci\u00F3n gen\u00E9tica","trabajos","mayor inter\u00E9s","desorci\u00F3n","cultivo seguido","matriz","t\u00E9cnicas moleculares basadas","prote\u00EDnas","enfermedades infecciosas","elevada mortalidad","microbiolog\u00EDa cl\u00EDnica","manejo","objetivo","tipos de procesos infecciosos","\u00E1cidos nucleicos microbianos","paciente","espectrometr\u00EDa de masas","tecnolog\u00EDa","plataformas comerciales disponibles","lado","Resumen","morbilidad","an\u00E1lisis","obtenci\u00F3n"],"language":"es"},

In this study, we investigated the potential of rhinovirus to survive on fingers. Rhinovirus-B14 was deposited on fingers for 30, 60, 90 and 120 min. Survival was defined as the ability of the virus to grow after 7 days, confirmed by immunofluorescence. Rhinovirus survival was not dependent on incubation time on fingers. Droplet disruption had no influence on survival. Survival was frequent with high rhinovirus concentrations, but rare with low-concentration droplets, which corresponded to the usual rhinovirus concentrations in mucus observed in children and adults, respectively. Our study confirms that rhinovirus infectiousness is related to the viral concentration in droplets and suggests that children represent the main transmission source, which occurs only rarely via adults. It confirms also that rhinovirus hand-related transmission is possible and supports hand hygiene as a key prevention measure.","publish_time":"2015-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"L\u0027Huillier, A.

In contrast, memory antiviral CD8 T cells in the spleen are PD-1(\u2212), despite viral loads being similar in both the brain and spleen during persistent infection. Repetitive antigen engagement is central to sustained PD-1 expression by T cells in chronic viral infections; however, recent evidence indicates that expression of inhibitory receptors, including PD-1 is part of the T(RM) differentiation program. Here, we asked whether PD-1 expression by CD8 bT(RM) cells during persistent MuPyV encephalitis is antigen-dependent. By transferring MuPyV-specific CD8 bT(RM) cells into brains of naive mice and mice infected with cognate epitope-sufficient and -deficient MuPyVs, we demonstrate that antigen and inflammation are dispensable for PD-1 maintenance. In vitro and direct ex vivo analyses indicate that CD103(\u2212) MuPyV-specific CD8 bT(RM) retain functional competence. We further show that the Pdcd-1 promoter of anti-MuPyV bT(RM) cells is epigenetically fixed in a demethylated state in the brain. In contrast, the PD-1 promoter of splenic antiviral memory CD8 T cells undergoes remethylation after being demethylated during acute infection.

Beijing has undergone significant socioeconomic changes in last decade, however no large-scale community epidemiological surveys of MDD have been conducted in Beijing since 2003. AIMS: To determine the prevalence of MDD and its socio-demographic correlates in a representative household sample of the general population in Beijing, China. METHOD: Data were collected from the 2010 representative household epidemiological survey of mental disorders in Beijing. The multistage cluster random sampling method was used to select qualified subjects in 18 districts and counties, and then face-to-face interviews were administered using the Chinese version of Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders-Patient Edition (SCID-I/P) during November 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010. RESULTS: 19,874 registered permanent residents were randomly identified and 16,032 (response rate=80.7%) completed face-to-face interviews. The time-point and life-time prevalence rates of MDD were estimated to be 1.10% (95% CI: 0.94\u20131.26%) and 3.56% (95% CI: 3.27\u20133.85%) respectively. Significant differences were found in sex, age, location of residence, marital status, education, employment status, personal/family monthly income, perception of family environment and relationship with others, when comparing residents with MDD to those without MDD. Those who were female, aged 45 or above, reported low family income, or reported an \u201Caverage\u201D or \u201Cpoor\u201D family environment were associated with a higher risk of MDD. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of MDD reported in this survey is relatively lower than that in other western countries. Female sex, age older than 45, low family income, and poor family environment appear to be independent risk factors for MDD.","publish_time":"2015-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Jing; Yan, Fang; Ma, Xin; Guo, Hong-Li; Tang, Yi-Lang; Rakofsky, Jeffrey J.; Wu, Xiao-Mei; Li, Xiao-Qiang; Zhu, Hong; Guo, Xiao-Bing; Yang, Yang; Li, Peng; Cao, Xin-Dong; Li, Hai-Ying; Li, Zhen-Bo; Wang, Ping; Xu, Qiu-Yue","journal":"J Affect Disord","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/32b6079c752664c2fd6e27194f5bb71b2c0379f5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127303.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016503271500138X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2015.03.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016503271500138X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25845752/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs4MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Structured Clinical Interview"],"locations":["China","Beijing"],"keyphrases":["prevalence of MDD","higher risk of MDD","Beijing","poor family environment","low family income","family monthly income","perception of family environment","life-time prevalence rates of MDD","large-scale community epidemiological surveys of MDD","general population","representative household epidemiological survey of mental disorders","face-to-face interviews","Female sex","socioeconomic factors","representative household sample","prevalent mental disorder","independent risk factors","significant socioeconomic changes","marital status","employment status","age older","Significant differences","Major depressive disorder","registered permanent residents","multistage cluster random sampling method","DSM-IV","Chinese version of Structured Clinical Interview","education","decade","TR Axis","socio-demographic correlates","location of residence","counties","Patient Edition","qualified subjects","districts","BACKGROUND","relationship","SCID","RESULTS","China","average","western countries","Data","CONCLUSIONS","response rate"],"language":"en"},

Despite the immense and ongoing global effort, no efficacious drugs to fight this plague have been identified and patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICU), for respiratory distress, are managed mostly by means of supportive care based on oxygen maintenance. Several authors have reported that the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases comorbidities were indeed frequent among patients with COVID-19, which suggests that these conditions are likely to aggravate and complicate the prognosis. What the aforementioned diseases have in common is a latent chronic inflammatory state that may be associated with the alteration of laboratory parameters that are typical of the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. In severe COVID-19 patients laboratory markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein, IL-6, D-dimer, serum ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase are elevated in many patients; assessed since the 4th-6th day of illness onset, such increases seem to be predictive of an adverse prognosis. Our hypothesis is that drugs belonging to the family of thiazolidinediones (TZD) such as pioglitazone or rosiglitazone, approved for treating the condition of insulin resistance and the accompanying inflammation, could ameliorate the prognosis of those COVID-19 patients with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disorders comorbidities. TZD are PPAR\u03B3 agonists that act on nuclear receptors, thereby triggering certain transcription factors. TZD were widely used for type-2 diabetes in the first decade of this century and although concerns have been raised for possible side effects associated with long-term treatment, their use has been recently revaluated for their anti-inflammatory properties in numerous medical conditions.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carboni, Elena; Carta, Anna Rosa; Carboni, Ezio","journal":"Med Hypotheses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b30eddbd04cd0c4c9fc37757399325e983750f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7175844.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109776; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32344313/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720306186?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720306186","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs4NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TZD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diabetes","severe COVID","TZD","patients laboratory markers of inflammation","adverse prognosis","cerebrovascular diseases comorbidities","cardiovascular disorders comorbidities","condition of insulin resistance","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","metabolic syndrome","accompanying inflammation","efficacious drugs","prevalence of hypertension","aforementioned diseases","supportive care","respiratory distress","alteration of laboratory parameters","intensive care units","numerous medical conditions","nuclear receptors","D-dimer","serum ferritin","ongoing global effort","C-reactive protein","ICU","lactate dehydrogenase","latent chronic inflammatory state","increases","long-term treatment","anti-inflammatory properties","PPAR\u03B3 agonists","SARS-CoV","certain transcription factors","family of thiazolidinediones","concerns","day of illness onset","effects","oxygen maintenance","rosiglitazone","pioglitazone","decade","plague","century","use","pandemic disease","type","authors","hypothesis","deaths"],"language":"en"},

Its physiological role is to regulate the concentrations of choline and glycine betaine in the blood and cells. Choline is important for regulation of gene expression, the biosynthesis of lipoproteins and membrane phospholipids and for the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine; glycine betaine plays important roles as a primary intracellular osmoprotectant and as methyl donor for the biosynthesis of methionine from homocysteine, a required step for the synthesis of the ubiquitous methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine. Recently, CHD has generated considerable medical attention due to its association with various human pathologies, including male infertility, homocysteinuria, breast cancer and metabolic syndrome. Despite the renewed interest, the biochemical characterization of the enzyme has lagged behind due to difficulties in the obtainment of purified, active and stable enzyme.

The functional unit of M(pro) is a homodimer and each subunit contains a His41/Cys145 catalytic dyad. Large amounts of biochemical and structural information are available on M(pro); nevertheless, the mechanism by which monomeric M(pro) is converted into a dimer during maturation still remains poorly understood. Previous studies have suggested that a C\u2010terminal residue, Arg298, interacts with Ser123 of the other monomer in the dimer, and mutation of Arg298 results in a monomeric structure with a collapsed substrate\u2010binding pocket. Interestingly, the R298A mutant of M(pro) shows a reversible substrate\u2010induced dimerization that is essential for catalysis. Here, the conformational change that occurs during substrate\u2010induced dimerization is delineated by X\u2010ray crystallography. A dimer with a mutual orientation of the monomers that differs from that of the wild\u2010type protease is present in the asymmetric unit. The presence of a complete substrate\u2010binding pocket and oxyanion hole in both protomers suggests that they are both catalytically active, while the two domain IIIs show minor reorganization.

Specifically, we demonstrated that GILT was constitutively expressed in lung epithelial cells and fibroblasts and its expression could be further induced by type II interferon. While overexpression of GILT inhibited the entry mediated by envelope glycoproteins of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Ebola virus (EBOV) and Lassa fever virus (LASV), depletion of GILT enhanced the entry mediated by these viral envelope glycoproteins. Furthermore, mutations that impaired the thiol reductase activity or disrupted the N-linked glycosylation, a posttranslational modification essential for its lysosomal localization, largely compromised GILT restriction of viral entry. We also found that the induction of GILT expression reduced the level and activity of cathepsin L, which is required for the entry of these RNA viruses in lysosomes.

Furthermore, the presence of plasma-cells producing coronavirus-specific antibodies was evaluated in situ. Macrophages and neutrophils were demonstrated by an antibody against calprotectin (leukocyte protein L1, myeloid/histiocyte antigen), neutrophils were recognized due to their chloroacetate esterase activity, and B- and T-lymphocytes were identified by antibodies against the CD3 antigen and the CD45R antigen, respectively. Expression of viral antigen was immunohistologically demonstrated by a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against coronavirus while coronavirus-specific antibodies in situ were identified by the application of feline coronavirus prior to the coronavirus antibody. Lesions were classified as diffuse alterations at serosal surfaces, granulomas with areas of necrosis, granulomas without extended necrosis, focal and perivascular lymphoplasmocytic infiltrates, and granulomatous-necrotizing vasculitis. Diffuse alterations on serosal surfaces were represented either by activated mesothelial cells with single coronavirus antigen-bearing macrophages or by layers of precipitated exudate containing single to numerous granulomas with areas of necrosis. In liver and spleen, the exudate was often underlaid by a small band of subcapsular B-cells with an occasional plasma-cell producing coronavirus-specific antibodies. In other locations, a variably broad band of B-cells and plasma-cells, often infiltrating between underlying muscle fibers, separated the exudate from the unaltered tissue. Some of these plasma-cells were positive for coronavirus-specific antibodies. In granulomas with areas of necrosis, the central necrosis was surrounded by macrophages usually expressing considerable amounts of viral antigen. Few B-cells and plasma-cells were found in the periphery. In granulomas without extended necrosis, the number of macrophages were lower. Only few macrophages expressing low amounts of viral antigen were present. B-cells and plasma-cells formed a broad rim. Few plasma-cells stained positive for coronavirus-specific antibodies. In both types of granulomas, few neutrophils were found between macrophages. Few T-cells were seen scattered throughout the lesions. Focal and perivascular lymphoplasmocytic infiltrates were mainly seen in omentum and leptomeninx. B-cells were the predominant cells; some plasma-cells were positive for coronavirus-specific antibodies. Viral antigen was not readily detected in these alterations. Granulomatous-necrotizing vasculitis was occasionally found in kidneys and leptomeninx. It was dominated by macrophages which often stained strongly positive for coronavirus antigen. Different types of alteration were often seen in the same animal and even the same tissue. There was no obvious correlation between the cat\u0027s age, gross pathological changes, and the histological types of alteration. Single plasma-cells positive for coronavirus-specific antibodies were found around blood vessels distant from inflammatory alterations, within the lung parenchyma, as infiltrating cells in the mucosa of the small intestine, and in spleen and mesenteric lymph node. Results show that alterations in FIP are heterogeneous concerning cellular composition and expression of viral antigen. The dominance of B-cells in part of the lesions together with the presence of plasma-cells positive for coronavirus-specific antibodies indicate that these cells may play a role in the maintenance of inflammatory processes in FIP.","publish_time":"1998-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kipar, A; Bellmann, S; Kremendahl, J; K\u00F6hler, K; Reinacher, M","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ab57eb1e6316741111ffbfacc8057029d20799f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119884.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242798001585; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242798001585","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T-cells","infiltrating cells","mesothelial cells","predominant cells","coronavirus-specific antibodies","Single plasma-cells positive","single coronavirus antigen","coronavirus antibody","expression of viral antigen","small band of subcapsular B-cells","histiocyte antigen","presence of plasma","CD3 antigen","CD45R antigen","application of feline coronavirus","low amounts of viral antigen","considerable amounts of viral antigen","areas of necrosis","types of granulomas","extended necrosis","FIP","occasional plasma-cell","dominance of B","number of macrophages","lesions","broad band of B","numerous granulomas","central necrosis","inflammatory alterations","diffuse alterations","neutrophils","perivascular lymphoplasmocytic infiltrates","serosal surfaces","monoclonal antibody","spleen","granulomatous-necrotizing vasculitis","histological types of alteration","situ","Different types of alteration","leptomeninx","layers of precipitated exudate","heterogeneous concerning cellular composition","small intestine","broad rim","T-lymphocytes","unaltered tissue","maintenance of inflammatory processes","spontaneous feline infectious peritonitis","leukocyte protein L1","cat\u0027s age","gross pathological changes","blood vessels distant","histochemistry","cats","calprotectin","order","lung parenchyma","light microscopy","immunohistology","role","mucosa","mAb","chloroacetate esterase activity","underlying muscle fibers","obvious correlation","mesenteric lymph node","kidneys","omentum","locations","liver","Results","animal","periphery"],"language":"en"},

The limited effectiveness of conventional medication has prompted the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as alternative or adjunctive therapy for the management of bronchiolitis. AIMS: To determine the effectiveness and safety of CAM for the treatment of bronchiolitis in infants aged less than 2 years. METHODS: A systematic electronic search was performed in Medline, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from their respective inception to June 30, 2016 for studies evaluating CAM as an intervention to treat bronchiolitis in infants (1 month to 2 years of age). The CAM could be any form of treatment defined by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) and was utilized either as a single agent or adjunctive therapy. The predefined primary outcome was length of hospital stay. Secondary outcomes were time to resolution of bronchiolitis symptoms, adverse events, and all other clinical outcomes reported by the included studies. RESULTS: The review identified 11 studies (8 randomized controlled trials and 3 cohort studies) examining four herbal preparations and four supplements used either as adjunctive or alternative therapy for bronchiolitis in 904 infants. Most studies were of moderate quality. Among six studies reporting on length of stay, a significant benefit was found for Chinese herbal medicine compared to ribavirin in one cohort study (n = 66) and vitamin D compared to placebo in one randomized controlled trial (n = 89). Studies of Chinese herbal medicine (4 studies, n = 365), vitamin D (1 study, n = 89), N-acetylcysteine (1 study, n = 100), and magnesium (2 studies, n = 176) showed some benefits with respect to clinical severity scores, oxygen saturation, and other symptoms, although data were sparse for any single intervention and the outcomes assessed and reported varied across studies. Only five studies reported on adverse events; no serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Among 11 studies examining the effect of CAM on inpatients with bronchiolitis, six reported on the review\u2019s primary outcome of length of hospital stay. In general, findings did not show a significant benefit associated with the primary outcome. Preliminary evidence indicated that Chinese herbal medicine mixtures, vitamin D, N-acetylcysteine, and magnesium might be useful in managing the symptoms of bronchiolitis. However, the evidence was not sufficient or rigorous enough to formulate recommendations for the use of any CAM. Among studies that reported adverse events, no serious harms were noted.","publish_time":"2017-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kua, Kok Pim; Lee, Shaun Wen Huey","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1174cadd31854c1128f0bbf2a61d31b2b72f61c3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5315308.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28212381/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0172289","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bronchiolitis","AMED"],"organizations":["CAM","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cohort studies","included studies","Studies of Chinese herbal medicine","symptoms of bronchiolitis","N-acetylcysteine","treatment of bronchiolitis","management of bronchiolitis","resolution of bronchiolitis symptoms","infants","alternative medicine","effect of CAM","safety of CAM","serious adverse events","Chinese herbal medicine mixtures","vitamin D","alternative therapy","adjunctive therapy","length of stay","herbal preparations","clinical outcomes","length of hospital","review\u2019s primary outcome of length","cohort study","randomized controlled trials","predefined primary outcome","significant benefit","use of complementary","Secondary outcomes","single intervention","magnesium","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials","Preliminary evidence","form of treatment","single agent","serious harms","years of age","clinical severity scores","limited effectiveness of conventional medication","Medline","AMED","ribavirin","National Center","oxygen saturation","Integrative Health","CINAHL","benefits","placebo","time","common cause of hospitalization","systematic electronic search","Embase","recommendations","data","supplements","month","respective inception","METHODS","NCCIH","findings","BACKGROUND","inpatients","moderate quality","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Attempts to use reverse vaccinology to generate an HIV-1 vaccine on the basis of the structure of viral epitopes bound to monoclonal neutralizing antibodies have failed so far because it was not possible to extrapolate from an observed antigenic structure to the immunogenic structure required in a vaccine. Vaccine immunogenicity depends on numerous extrinsic factors such as the host immunoglobulin gene repertoire, the presence of various cellular and regulatory mechanisms in the immunized host and the process of antibody affinity maturation. All these factors played a role in the appearance of the neutralizing antibody used to select the epitope to be investigated as potential vaccine immunogen, but they cannot be expected to be present in identical form in the host to be vaccinated. It is possible to rationally design and optimize an epitope to fit one particular antibody molecule or to improve the paratope binding efficacy of a monoclonal antibody intended for passive immunotherapy. What is not possible is to rationally design an HIV-1 vaccine immunogen that will elicit a protective polyclonal antibody response of predetermined efficacy. An effective vaccine immunogen can only be discovered by investigating experimentally the immunogenicity of a candidate molecule and demonstrating its ability to induce a protective immune response. It cannot be discovered by determining which epitopes of an engineered antigen molecule are recognized by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody. This means that empirical immunogenicity trials rather than structural analyses of antigens offer the best hope of discovering an HIV-1 vaccine.","publish_time":"2011-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Van Regenmortel, Marc H.

Despite the medical importance of this disease, some crucial steps in the development of encephalitis remain poorly understood. In particular, the basis of the disease severity is largely unknown. METHODS: TBE virus growth, neutralizing antibody response, key cytokine and chemokine mRNA production and changes in mRNA levels of cell surface markers of immunocompetent cells in brain were measured in mice with different susceptibilities to TBE virus infection. RESULTS: An animal model of TBE based on BALB/c-c-STS/A (CcS/Dem) recombinant congenic mouse strains showing different severities of the infection in relation to the host genetic background was developed. After subcutaneous inoculation of TBE virus, BALB/c mice showed medium susceptibility to the infection, STS mice were resistant, and CcS-11 mice were highly susceptible. The resistant STS mice showed lower and delayed viremia, lower virus production in the brain and low cytokine/chemokine mRNA production, but had a strong neutralizing antibody response. The most sensitive strain (CcS-11) failed in production of neutralizing antibodies, but exhibited strong cytokine/chemokine mRNA production in the brain. After intracerebral inoculation, all mouse strains were sensitive to the infection and had similar virus production in the brain, but STS mice survived significantly longer than CcS-11 mice. These two strains also differed in the expression of key cytokines/chemokines, particularly interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10/CXCL10) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) in the brain. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the genetic control is an important factor influencing the clinical course of TBE. High neutralizing antibody response might be crucial for preventing host fatality, but high expression of various cytokines/chemokines during TBE can mediate immunopathology and be associated with more severe course of the infection and increased fatality.","publish_time":"2013-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Palus, Martin; Vojt\u00ED\u0161kov\u00E1, Jarmila; Sal\u00E1t, Ji\u0159\u00ED; Kopeck\u00FD, Jan; Grubhoffer, Libor; Lipoldov\u00E1, Marie; Demant, Peter; R\u016F\u017Eek, Daniel","journal":"J Neuroinflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c983db27cc8ff3e50008d8d2bc803e14da7d38b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3700758.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-2094-10-77; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23805778/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TBE","CcS/Dem"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TBE virus infection","TBE virus growth","brain","c mice","lower virus production","chemokine mRNA production","similar virus production","clinical course of TBE","resistant STS mice","subcutaneous inoculation of TBE virus","CcS","production of neutralizing antibodies","animal model of TBE","c-c","strong neutralizing antibody response","High neutralizing antibody response","strong cytokine","severe course","clinical course of tick-borne encephalitis","BALB","low cytokine","chemokines","expression of key cytokines","severe debilitating encephalitis","host fatality","disease severity","host genetic background","development of encephalitis","recombinant congenic mouse strains","high expression of various cytokines","different severities","different susceptibilities","crucial steps","genetic control","increased fatality","intracerebral inoculation","sensitive strain","mRNA levels of cell surface markers of immunocompetent cells","monocyte chemotactic protein","interferon gamma-induced protein","changes","delayed viremia","medium susceptibility","mild influenza","relation","Dem","ranges","important factor","MCP","CXCL10","IP","encephalomyelitis","data","basis","RESULTS","immunopathology","METHODS","medical importance","CCL2","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The objectives of this study were to explore the intervals before TB diagnosis and isolation at a regional hospital in Taiwan, and to provide useful knowledge to hospitals for the purpose of TB infection control. Methods From 2002 to 2005, we included a total of 343 patients with culture-positive pulmonary TB in a regional hospital in Southern Taiwan for this study. Their medical records were reviewed, and the time intervals between patient-hospital contact points and isolation were recorded. Results Of 343 culture-positive pulmonary TB patients, the majority were male, over 40 years old, and unemployed. The mean interval between the first admission and isolation was 20.5 days (median, 2.0 days). The mean intervals between the first admission from outpatient clinics, emergency department and hospitalization and suspected TB were \u003C 1 day, 6.07 days and 25.53 days, respectively. The mean accumulated exposure time was 0.35 days, 0.61 days and 10.09 days in outpatient clinics, the emergency department and hospitalization, respectively; 75.5% of patients had their diagnosis confirmed at the chest department of the department of internal medicine. Conclusion Delayed diagnosis was most likely in the case of hospitalized patients and least likely in outpatient clinics. Delayed diagnosis in hospitalized patients also contributed more severely to TB exposure time than others.

Their rapid and accurate diagnosis is essential to patient management. To evaluate the prospective utility of Seeplex\u00AE DPO technology in respiratory virus diagnosis, a panel of 99 respiratory samples positive by real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR for one or more viruses was assayed by the Seegene Seeplex\u00AE RV12 system. As well as being able to detect all 10 viruses in the real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR system with the exception of enteroviruses, RV12 can also distinguish between the two subgroups of RSV and detect two subgroups of coronaviruses. Seven of the nine viruses in common with the RT\u2010PCR were detected reliably by RV12. Eleven samples RT\u2010PCR\u2010positive for Metapneumovirus and five samples positive for influenza B were not detected by RV12. Seegene developed a second\u2010generation system, RV15, which not only allowed detection of three additional viruses, but also addressed the potential problems with RV12 specificity. To address these concerns, 84 respiratory samples positive for a range of viruses by real\u2010time PCR were assayed with RV15.

Associations between management variables and calf mortality (death or condemnation) were examined using multivariable logistic regression models. Factors associated with an increased risk of calf mortality included time in the farm of origin\u2019s calving season, duration of travel from farm to the processor and processing slaughter schedule (same day or next day). Every additional week into the farm\u2019s calving season increased the odds of mortality by a factor of 1.2 (95%CI 1.06, 1.35). Similarly, each additional hour of travel time increased the odds of mortality by a factor of 1.45 (95% CI 1.18, 1.76). Risk of mortality was significantly greater for calves processed at premises with a next day slaughter schedule than those processed at premises with a same day slaughter schedule (OR 3.82, 95% CI 1.51, 9.67). However, when the data set was limited to those cases that died or were condemned in the yards (i.e. excluding calves that were dead or condemned on arrival) the effect of same day slaughter was not significant. In order to reduce bobby calf mortality and morbidity, transport duration should be kept as short as possible and a same day slaughter schedule applied. While these factors can be regulated, New Zealand\u2019s pastoral dairy system means that calves will inevitably be transported for slaughter across several months each spring. Although farm management factors did not apparently influence the risk of mortality in this study, the effect of time in farm\u2019s calving season suggests there may be farm-management related factors that change over the season. This requires further investigation.","publish_time":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boulton, Alana C.; Kells, Nikki J; Cogger, Naomi; Johnson, Craig B.; O\u2019Connor, Cheryl; Webster, Jim; Palmer, Anna; Beausoleil, Ngaio J.","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7ff69edc7eb8d1fc0e31314b8a4434a50a31134.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127677.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2019.104836; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587719301874; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31765960/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587719301874","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["New Zealand"],"keyphrases":["mortality of bobby calves","Risk of mortality","day slaughter schedule","control calves","odds of mortality","processing slaughter schedule","management of selected calves","bobby calf mortality","farm management factors","increased risk of calf mortality","point of slaughter","risk factors","farm of origin\u2019s calving season","farm-management related factors","farm\u2019s calving season","spring calving season","processing premises personnel","case-control study","transport duration","effect of time","management variables","duration of travel","transport operators","additional hour of travel time","morbidity","processor","cases","New Zealand\u2019s pastoral dairy system","additional week","dairy supply chain","condemnation","farmers","death","welfare reasons","controls","Associations","veterinarians","multivariable logistic regression models","health","questionnaires","arrival","Information","order","data set","months","total","objective","yards","investigation"],"language":"en"},

Clinical manifestation of COVID-19 can be characterized by mild upper respiratory tract infection, lower respiratory tract infection involving non-life threatening pneumonia, and life-threatening pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome. It affects all age groups, including newborns, to the elders. Particularly, pregnant women may be more susceptible to COVID-19 since pregnant women, in general, are vulnerable to respiratory infection. In pregnant women with COVID-19, there is no evidence for vertical transmission of the virus, but an increased prevalence of preterm deliveries has been noticed. The COVID-19 may alter immune responses at the maternal-fetal interface, and affect the well-being of mothers and infants.

Here we analyze the importance of the sialic acid binding activity for the infection of tracheal organ cultures (TOCs) by different IBV strains.

Besides few reports from stray and pet dogs from localised geographical regions (cities/towns/small states), a comprehensive study on prevalence of Ehrlichia canis (E. canis) among working dogs from different geo-climatic zones of India was pertinently lacking. Study of CME among these dog populations was thus carried out, encompassing clinical aspects and different diagnostic methodologies viz., microscopy, serology and molecular biology. During the two-year study period, clinical specimens from 225 cases suspected of canine ehrlichiosis were examined for clinical pathology and presence of the haemoparasites. Overall prevalence of ehrlichiosis by microscopic examination, commercial dot-ELISA kit and nested PCR assay was estimated to be 1.3%, 19.1% and 5.8%, respectively, which were found to be statistically significant by McNemar Chi squared test (p\u003C0.05). It was also observed that possibly due to widespread use of doxycycline therapy in field, CME presently does not remain a potential threat which it uses to pose earlier. However, concurrent infections of E. canis and Babesia gibsoni were found to be mostly fatal. Keeping in view of high number of apparently healthy dogs (24) out of total positive cases (46) observed during the study, it is recommended that prevalence studies on CME should also involve screening of apparently healthy dogs. Phylogenetic analysis carried on partial sequencing of 16S rRNA of E. canis strains revealed that all of the Indian strains clustered in a single clade with other E. canis species from India and rest of the world. Molecular divergence was observed among the sequences of Brazilian and American isolates which were also included in the present study.

For general communities, epidemic modeling based on social networks is being recognized as a useful tool. However, disease propagation may occur in a healthcare facility in a manner different from that in a urban community setting due to different network architecture. We simulate stochastic susceptible-infected-recovered dynamics on social networks, which are based on observations in a hospital in Tokyo, to explore effective containment strategies against nosocomial infection. The observed social networks in the hospital have hierarchical and modular structure in which dense substructure such as departments, wards, and rooms, are globally but only loosely connected, and do not reveal extremely right-skewed distributions of the number of contacts per individual. We show that healthcare workers, particularly medical doctors, are main vectors (i.e. transmitters) of diseases on these networks. Intervention methods that restrict interaction between medical doctors and their visits to different wards shrink the final epidemic size more than intervention methods that directly protect patients, such as isolating patients in single rooms. By the same token, vaccinating doctors with priority rather than patients or nurses is more effective. Finally, vaccinating individuals with large betweenness centrality (frequency of mediating connection between pairs of individuals along the shortest paths) is superior to vaccinating ones with large connectedness to others or randomly chosen individuals, which was suggested by previous model studies.","publish_time":"2008-10-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ueno, Taro; Masuda, Naoki","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb84579d04e12484426a03cb27a4799d2c649f04.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094152.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18647609/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519308003512; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.07.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519308003512","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsyNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Tokyo"],"keyphrases":["healthcare facilities","vaccinating doctors","vaccinating individuals","observed social networks","different wards","medical doctors","healthcare facility","healthcare workers","manner different","pairs of individuals","Intervention methods","isolating patients","Abstract Nosocomial infection","different network architecture","hospital-mediated outbreaks of influenza","epidemic modeling","large connectedness","single rooms","final epidemic size","large betweenness centrality","effective containment strategies","methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","frequency of mediating connection","visits","existence of pathogens characteristic","dense substructure","serious public health problem","severe acute respiratory syndrome","modular structure","Tokyo","urban community","dynamics","priority","interaction","shortest paths","main vectors","number of contacts","ones","transmitters","departments","stochastic susceptible-infected","general communities","skewed distributions","diseases","nurses","token","observations","disease propagation","previous model studies","useful tool"],"language":"en"},

The rabies virus (RABV) is able to infect almost all mammals and is therefore a useful model for the study of host shift mechanisms. Carnivore RABVs originated from two historical host shifts from bat viruses. To reveal the genetic pathways by which bat RABVs changed their host tropism from bats to carnivores, we investigated the second permanent bat-to-carnivore shift resulting in two carnivore variants, known as raccoon RABV (RRV) and south-central skunk RABV (SCSKV). We found that their glycoprotein (G) genes are the result of recombination between an American bat virus and a carnivore virus. This recombination allowed the bat RABV to acquire the head of the G-protein ectodomain of the carnivore virus. This region is involved in receptor recognition and binding, response to changes in the pH microenvironment, trimerization of G proteins, and cell-to-cell transmission during the viral infection. Therefore, this recombination event may have significantly improved the variant\u2019s adaptability to carnivores, altering its host tropism and thus leading to large-scale epidemics in striped skunk and raccoon.","publish_time":"2017-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ding, Nai-Zheng; Xu, Dong-Shuai; Sun, Yuan-Yuan; He, Hong-Bin; He, Cheng-Qiang","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c71f856263c447ba7983e1f7087259008ca8505.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5428239.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-00395-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28325933/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsyOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["carnivore virus","Bat virus host shifts","bat RABVs","American bat virus","host tropism","Carnivore RABVs","carnivore shift","bat viruses","permanent bat","carnivore variants","raccoon RABV","rabies virus","historical host shifts","result of recombination","south-central skunk RABV","study of host shift mechanisms","carnivores","recombination event","trimerization of G proteins","G-protein ectodomain","cell transmission","striped skunk","response","changes","pH microenvironment","large-scale epidemics","head","RRV","receptor recognition","useful model","binding","spread of diseases","genes","bats","significant effects","mammals","viral infection","variant\u2019s adaptability","SCSKV","genetic pathways","region","glycoprotein"],"language":"en"},

Estas exacerbaciones se deben a infecciones bacterianas y virales, y a factores estresantes medioambientales, pero otras enfermedades concomitantes como las cardiopat\u00EDas, otras enfermedades pulmonares (como la embolia pulmonar, la aspiraci\u00F3n o el neumot\u00F3rax) y otros procesos sist\u00E9micos, pueden desencadenar o complicar estas agudizaciones.

Abstract Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are considered to be episodes of instability that favor disease progression, reduce quality of life, increase the risk of death and cause substantial healthcare resource use. These exacerbations are due to bacterial and viral infections and environmental stressors. However, other concomitant diseases such as heart disease, other lung diseases (e.g. pulmonary embolism, aspiration or pneumothorax) and other systemic processes can trigger or complicate these exacerbations. The two factors with the greatest influence on the physiopathology of exacerbations are dynamic overinflation and local and systemic inflammation. In most patients, drug treatment includes short-acting bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics. Hypoxemic respiratory failure requires controlled oxygen therapy. In hypercapnic respiratory failure, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation may allow time to be gained until other treatments begin to take effect and can thus avoid endotracheal intubation. The use of non-invasive mechanical ventilation should never delay intubation, if indicated. Hospital discharge criteria are based on both clinical and gasometric stabilization and on the patient\u0027s ability to manage his or her disease at home. Hospitalization at home can be a treatment option in COPD exacerbations and is as effective as conventional hospitalization.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Calle Rubio, Myriam; Chac\u00F3n, Beatriz Morales; Rodr\u00EDguez Hermosa, Juan Luis","journal":"Archivos de Bronconeumolog\u00EDa","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d84a3c412b38677b09230c0c95054014aa50b7f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300289610700429; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300289610700429","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["and other systemic","the risk of death and","dynamic overinflation and local and systemic inflammation","systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics","of non","bacterial and viral infections and environmental stressors","These exacerbations","based on both clinical and gasometric stabilization and on the patient\u0027s ability","Hospitalization at home can be a treatment option in COPD exacerbations and","The two factors with the greatest influence on the physiopathology of exacerbations","exacerbaciones","quality of life","Abstract Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary","take effect and can thus avoid endotracheal intubation","other lung","other concomitant","can trigger or","of instability that favor","as effective as conventional hospitalization","or her","EPOC","In hypercapnic respiratory failure","be gained until other treatments begin","enfermedad pulmonar obstructiva cr\u00F3nica","such as heart","aspiration or pneumothorax","In most patients","insuficiencia respiratoria hiperc\u00E1pnica","Hypoxemic respiratory failure","insuficiencia respiratoria hipox\u00E9mica","drug treatment","pulmonary embolism","inflamaci\u00F3n local","enfermedades concomitantes","enfermedades pulmonares","embolia pulmonar","opci\u00F3n de tratamiento","procesos sist\u00E9micos","tratamiento farmacol\u00F3gico","hospitalizaci\u00F3n convencional","hospitalizaci\u00F3n domiciliaria","intubaci\u00F3n endotraqueal","invasive mechanical ventilation should never delay intubation","factores estresantes medioambientales","uso de ventilaci\u00F3n mec\u00E1nica","pressure ventilation may allow","manage","short","acting bronchodilators","progression","due","oxigenoterapia controlada","broncodilatadores de acci\u00F3n corta","Hospital discharge criteria","presi\u00F3n positiva","substantial healthcare resource","considered","if indicated","causa","pacientes","eficacia equivalente","exacerbaci\u00F3n","controlled oxygen therapy","estabilizaci\u00F3n","consumo significativo","mayor\u00EDa","antibi\u00F3ticos","hiperinsuflaci\u00F3n din\u00E1mica","neumot\u00F3rax","cardiopat\u00EDas","poder","However","recursos sanitarios","riesgo de defunci\u00F3n","episodios de inestabilidad","infecciones bacterianas","calidad de vida","capacidad","tiempo","aspiraci\u00F3n","progresi\u00F3n","criterios de alta hospitalaria","domicilio","fisiopatolog\u00EDa","tratamientos","agudizaciones"],"language":"es"},

Licorice (Glycyrrhiza) is a perennial plant that is cultivated in many countries and has been reported to exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. However, some components of licorice exert unwanted side effects and therefore identifying safer licorice components would be ideal. The anticancer activities of many of the licorice components appear to include cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, and general antioxidant effects. Commonly reported indirect protein targets important in tumorigenesis include many cell cycle-related proteins, apoptosis-associated proteins, MMP proteins, COX-2, GSK-\u03B2, Akt, NF-\u03BAB, and MAP kinases. Importantly, several licorice components were reported to directly bind to and inhibit the activities of PI3-K, MKK4, MKK7, JNK1, mTOR, and Cdk2, resulting in decreased carcinogenesis in several cell and mouse models with no obvious toxicity. This review focuses on specific components of licorice for which a direct protein target has been identified.","publish_time":"2015-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bode, Ann M.; Dong, Zigang","journal":"Curr Pharmacol Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f7ca4d9c88184c863530bf72c046033e8ef465e2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100402.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100402/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzE10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["safer licorice components","specific components of licorice","anticancer effects","apoptosis-associated proteins","cell cycle-related proteins","MMP proteins","general antioxidant effects","anticancer activities","apoptosis induction","cycle arrest","activities of PI3","indirect protein targets important","tumorigenesis","prevention","novel","COX","NF-\u03BAB","mouse models","treatment","GSK-\u03B2","MKK4","safe compounds","decreased carcinogenesis","major health issue","MKK7","JNK1","mTOR","Cdk2","Akt","obvious toxicity","MAP kinases","high priority","perennial plant","Glycyrrhiza","review","countries"],"language":"en"},

It is accepted that in an ecological system, pressure will cause evolution; this is also the case with antimicrobials, the result being the development of resistance and the therapeutic failure of drugs. To an extent, this can be ameliorated through advances by the pharmaceutical industry, but that should not stop us from critically appraising our use and modifying our behavior to slow this process down. Up to 50% of prescribing in human medicine and 80% in veterinary medicine and farming has been considered questionable. The Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antimicrobials (APUA) was approached by the WHO to review the situation. Their recommendations include decreasing the prescribing of antibacterials for nonbacterial infections. In the UK, there has been an initiative called \u2018the path of least resistance\u2019. This encourages general practitioners to avoid prescribing or reduce the duration of prescriptions for conditions such as upper respiratory tract infections and uncomplicated urinary tract infections; this approach has been successful. Another recommendation is to reduce the prescribing of broad-spectrum antibacterials. In UK hospitals, the problems identified with the inappropriate use of antibacterials are insufficient training in infectious disease, difficulty in selecting empirical antibacterial therapy, poor use of available microbiological information, the fear of litigation and the fact that the majority of antibacterials are prescribed by the least experienced doctors. With close liaison between the laboratories and clinicians, and the development of local protocols, this can be addressed. Another recommendation is to tighten the use of antibacterial prophylaxis and to improve patient compliance. Through a combination of improved education for doctors and patients, and improved communication skills, these problems can be addressed. A further recommendation is to encourage teaching methods that modify prescribing habits. It has been shown that workshops have led to a significant reduction in the prescribing of broad-spectrum antibacterials in the community. Auditing the prescribing of antibacterials has also been recommended. Surveillance systems around the world monitor trends in resistance: the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Progamme (EARSS) monitors antibacterial resistance; the WHO and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease collaborate to monitor tuberculosis; the WHO and the International AIDS Society monitor HIV. In the third world, a bigger problem than resistance is whether drugs are even effective, as they are often spoiled by climactic conditions, and poor quality generics and counterfeit drugs are common. Also, patients may not be able to complete a course for financial reasons. Facts about Antimicrobial resistance in Animals (and agriculture) and Impact on Resistance (FAAIR) was commissioned by APUA. They conclude that the nonhuman use of antibacterials can lead to the development of antibacterial resistance in human pathogens. The European commission banned the use of antibacterials as growth promoters in 1999. In the Western world, we should improve our diagnosis of sepsis, access local guidelines and consider withholding treatment pending investigations, decide if treatment can be stopped earlier and treat the patient not the result. Many developing countries need improved access to more antimicrobials, preferably in the controlled environment of appropriate medical advice.","publish_time":"2012-09-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sarkar, Paul; Gould, Ian M.","journal":"Drugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ccfde92cc14959cab65169629c83390d9b9c7794.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100809.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100809/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzY20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Progamme","International AIDS Society","APUA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prescribing of antibacterials","development of resistance","prescribing of broad-spectrum antibacterials","development of antibacterial resistance","inappropriate use of antibacterials","nonhuman use of antibacterials","majority of antibacterials","use of antibacterial prophylaxis","Prudent Use of Antimicrobials","prescribing habits","European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Progamme","improved access","poor use of available microbiological information","world monitor trends","empirical antibacterial therapy","nonbacterial infections","counterfeit drugs","development of local protocols","human medicine","Tuberculosis","patients","problems","Western world","result","APUA","uncomplicated urinary tract infections","upper respiratory tract infections","access local guidelines","improved communication skills","therapeutic failure of drugs","combination of improved education","infectious disease","Lung Disease","Surveillance systems","climactic conditions","European commission","withholding treatment","International Union","veterinary medicine","human pathogens","experienced doctors","patient compliance","UK hospitals","poor quality generics","International AIDS Society","difficulty","insufficient training","EARSS","fear of litigation","clinicians","approach","Animals","agriculture","diagnosis of sepsis","controlled environment of appropriate medical advice","significant reduction","evolution","laboratories","investigations","Impact","teaching methods","bigger problem","course","ecological system","pressure","close liaison","HIV","farming","duration of prescriptions","wider repercussions","case","FAAIR","Facts","Alliance","countries","growth promoters","community","financial reasons","advances","pharmaceutical industry","actions","workshops","initiative","behavior","recommendations","general practitioners","process","paper","extent","situation"],"language":"en"},

The similarity of SARS and avian influenza prompted us to examine the relationship between SARS experience and preparedness on a potential avian influenza outbreak. METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire was delivered to nurses in Hong Kong to assess their attitude towards avian influenza; risk perception, and their relationships with previous level of exposure to SARS patients. RESULTS: Nine hundred and ninety-nine respondents were included in data analysis. About half of them perceived there would be an avian influenza outbreak in Hong Kong. The majority accepted a personal risk of infection in the course of their work (72.7%), and prepared to take care of patients infected with avian influenza (84.0%). Respondents were classified into two groups: high exposure (44.1%) and low exposure (55.9%) as defined by having worked in SARS ward or hospitals. High exposure nurses were less likely to avoid patients, less inclined to change their job if they were required to take care of infected patients, and had therefore a more positive attitude towards an impending avian influenza epidemic. About half of the nurses had frequent involuntary recalls of incidents relating to SARS, the frequency of which was positively correlated with knowing a person suffering from long-term complications of SARS. CONCLUSION: Healthcare workers who had been actively involved in SARS work were more \u201Cpositive\u201D in responding to the impending avian influenza epidemic.

They are able to influence the surface tension of the gas\u2013liquid interface specifically by directly interacting with single lipids. This work describes the generation of reliable protein structure models to support the experimental characterization of two novel putative surfactant proteins called SP-G and SP-H. The obtained protein models were complemented by predicted posttranslational modifications and placed in a lipid model system mimicking the pulmonary surface. Molecular dynamics simulations of these protein-lipid systems showed the stability of the protein models and the formation of interactions between protein surface and lipid head groups on an atomic scale. Thereby, interaction interface and strength seem to be dependent on orientation and posttranslational modification of the protein. The here presented modeling was fundamental for experimental localization studies and the simulations showed that SP-G and SP-H are theoretically able to interact with lipid systems and thus are members of the surfactant protein family.

The objectives of this study were to determine the specific role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the process. Acute lung injury was induced by administering paraquat (PQ) intraperitoneally. NLRP3 inflammasome including NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 mRNA and protein expression in lung tissue and IL-1\u03B2 and IL-18 levels in BALF were detected at 4, 8, 24, and 72 h after PQ administration in rats. Moreover, rats were pretreated with 10, 30, and 50 mg/kg NLRP3 inflammasome blocker glybenclamide, respectively, 1 h before PQ exposure. At 72 h after PQ administration, lung histopathology changes, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 protein expression, as well as secretion of cytokines including IL-1\u03B2 and IL-18 in BALF were investigated. The NLRP3 inflammasome including NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1 expression, and cytokines IL-1\u03B2 and IL-18 levels in PQ poisoning rats were significantly higher than that in the control group. NLRP3 inflammasome blocker glybenclamide pretreatment attenuated lung edema, inhibited the NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 activation, and reduced IL-1\u03B2 and IL-18 levels in BALF. In the in vitro experiments, IL-1\u03B2 and IL-18 secreted from RAW264.7 mouse macrophages treated with paraquat were attenuated by glybenclamide.

Thiazolidine motifs behave as a bridge between organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry and compel researchers to explore new drug candidates. Thiazolidine motifs are very intriguing heterocyclic five-membered moieties present in diverse natural and bioactive compounds having sulfur at the first position and nitrogen at the third position. The presence of sulfur enhances their pharmacological properties, and, therefore, they are used as vehicles in the synthesis of valuable organic combinations. They show varied biological properties viz. anticancer, anticonvulsant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, antioxidant activity and so on. This diversity in the biological response makes it a highly prized moiety. Based on literature studies, various synthetic approaches like multicomponent reaction, click reaction, nano-catalysis and green chemistry have been employed to improve their selectivity, purity, product yield and pharmacokinetic activity. In this review article, we have summarized systematic approaches for the synthesis of thiazolidine and its derivatives, along with their pharmacological activity, including advantages of green synthesis, atom economy, cleaner reaction profile and catalyst recovery which will help scientists to probe and stimulate the study of these scaffolds.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sahiba, Nusrat; Sethiya, Ayushi; Soni, Jay; Agarwal, Dinesh K.; Agarwal, Shikha","journal":"Top Curr Chem (Cham)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/983e5143faa29cd7c1cba856739053d06cbd1a80.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101601.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101601/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzEwNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["synthesis of thiazolidine","organic synthesis","pharmacological activity","Thiazolidine motifs","advantages of green synthesis","multicomponent reaction","green chemistry","synthesis of valuable organic combinations","pharmacokinetic activity","antioxidant activity","pharmacological properties","position","cleaner reaction profile","varied biological properties","systematic approaches","medicinal chemistry","presence of sulfur","biological response","various synthetic approaches","atom economy","membered moieties present","anticonvulsant","anti-inflammatory","bioactive compounds","researchers","bridge","catalyst recovery","purity","product yield","nano-catalysis","literature studies","interdisciplinary research","derivatives","new drug candidates","past decades","scientists","selectivity","vehicles","nitrogen","prized moiety","review article","study","diversity"],"language":"en"},

While the dose-dependent side effects of AZA are common and well known, hypersensitivity reactions such as pulmonary toxicity are rare. Here, we describe a case involving a 38-year-old man with GPA-associated pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis who developed subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) during AZA maintenance therapy. Five months after the initiation of AZA administration (100 mg/day), the patient was admitted with a 7-day history of cough, dyspnea, and fever. High-resolution computed tomography of the chest showed ill-defined centrilobular nodules and diffuse ground-glass opacities in both lung fields. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was negative for infectious etiologies. A transbronchial lung biopsy specimen revealed poorly formed non-necrotizing granulomas. A chest radiograph obtained at 2 weeks after discontinuation of AZA showed normal findings. The findings from this case suggest that AZA-induced HP should be considered as a differential diagnosis when a patient with GPA exhibits fresh pulmonary lesions accompanied by respiratory symptoms during AZA therapy.","publish_time":"2016-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, In Hee; Kang, Gun Woo; Kim, Kyung Chan","journal":"Rheumatol Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1ca73efec036ee222ab7d13ee2a8b41b0df59312.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101638.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101638/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzEyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GPA","AZA","HP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AZA therapy","discontinuation of AZA","effects of AZA","AZA maintenance therapy","AZA-induced HP","initiation of AZA administration","GPA remission","patient","induction therapy","case","GPA-associated pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis","hypersensitivity reactions","respiratory symptoms","inflammatory granulomas","formed non-necrotizing granulomas","pulmonary toxicity","respiratory tract","chest radiograph","lung fields","normal findings","subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis","fresh pulmonary lesions","day history of cough","transbronchial lung biopsy specimen","ill-defined centrilobular nodules","diffuse ground-glass opacities","year-old man","weeks","small-vessel vasculitis","autoimmune disease","bronchoalveolar lavage","dyspnea","High-resolution computed tomography","cyclophosphamide","dose-dependent","differential diagnosis","infectious etiologies","polyangiitis","months","purine analog","Bronchoscopy","fever","kidneys","Granulomatosis","Azathioprine"],"language":"en"},

The spectrum of GBS includes acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), acute motor sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN), and some other variants like Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS). METHODS: Patient with AMAN variant of GBS after severe bilateral pneumonia and ARDS due to the novel pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus is presented. RESULTS: 28-year-old white female was admitted to our Intensive Care Unit during the influenza pandemic because of severe ARDS due to bilateral pneumonia. The course of the disease was complicated with the new onset tetraplegia due to the AMAN variant of GBS. Treatment with plasma exchange was conducted and the patient had satisfactory recovery. CONCLUSION: We report a case of AMAN variant of GBS associated with proven H1N1 influenza A infection. This virus has not been reported previously as the agent of antecedent infection that induced this disorder. Risk factors for other causes of ICU neuromuscular weakness are usually present in the ICU patients and should not be the reason for reluctance in active quest for GBS. Once the diagnosis of GBS is established or suspected the treatment with plasma exchange or intravenous immune globulin is indicated.","publish_time":"2010-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kutle\u0161a, Marko; Santini, Marija; Krajinovi\u0107, Vladimir; Raffanelli, Dinko; Bar\u0161i\u0107, Bruno","journal":"Neurocrit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/892bbf8eea194fc945666b0df3975646d117a33c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101666.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101666/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzEzOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GBS","AMAN","ARDS","Intensive Care","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spectrum of GBS","diagnosis of GBS","case of AMAN variant of GBS","influenza pandemic","acute motor axonal neuropathy","acute motor sensory axonal neuropathy","severe ARDS","novel pandemic H1N1 influenza","severe bilateral pneumonia","proven H1N1 influenza","plasma exchange","Treatment","virus","agent of antecedent infection","acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy","ICU patients","Barre syndrome","antecedent events","Miller-Fisher syndrome","causes of ICU neuromuscular weakness","AIDP","AMSAN","Intensive Care Unit","infectious agents","intravenous immune globulin","new onset tetraplegia","reason","year-old white female","variants","reluctance","active quest","known entity","Guillain","Risk factors","disease","RESULTS","MFS","BACKGROUND","METHODS","satisfactory recovery","disorder","course","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

These changes could contribute to worsening asthma control and predispose asthmatics to critical asthma syndromes. For many years, the contribution of vasculature to severe asthma was limited to discussion of small and medium vessel vasculitis commonly referred to as Churg \u2212 Strauss syndrome. This comprehensive review will explore the known mechanisms that are associated with remodeling of the vasculature in a variety of critical asthma presentations. Inflammation of pulmonary and bronchial small blood vessels may contribute significantly but silently to asthma pathobiology. Inflammation in the vasculature of the lung parenchyma can decrease lung capacity while inflammation in airway vasculature can decrease airflow. This review will provide a modern perspective on Churg\u2013Strauss syndromes with a focus on phenotyping, mechanism, and ultimately modern therapeutic approaches. Vascular remodeling and airway remodeling are not mutually exclusive concepts in understanding the progression of asthma and frequency of acute exacerbations. Furthermore, the contribution of vascular leak, particularly in the parenchymal vasculature, has become an increasingly recognized component of certain presentations of poorly controlled, severe persistent asthmatic and during exacerbations. We highlight how these mechanisms can contribute to some the severe presentations of influenza infection in patients with a history of asthma. The ultimate aim of this review is to summarize the current literature concerning vasculitis and the contribution of airway and parenchymal vascular remodeling to presentation of persistent asthma and its consequences during acute exacerbations and critical asthma syndromes.","publish_time":"2014-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Avdalovic, Mark","journal":"Clin Rev Allergy Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bbd3c1183b6e51ef6206d0014beaa32e12192eb0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101667.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101667/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzE0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe asthma","progression of asthma","asthma control","history of asthma","asthma pathobiology","critical asthma syndromes","presentation of persistent asthma","airway vasculature","contribution of vasculature","variety of critical asthma presentations","parenchymal vasculature","airway remodeling","contribution of airway","parenchymal vascular remodeling","lung parenchyma","Strauss syndromes","severe persistent asthmatic","contribution of vascular leak","consequences","lung capacity","severe presentations of influenza infection","Churg","frequency of acute exacerbations","Inflammation of pulmonary","comprehensive review","discussion of small","modern perspective","recognized component of certain presentations","known mechanisms","medium vessel vasculitis","modern therapeutic approaches","bronchial small blood vessels","patients","phenotyping","focus","asthmatics","exclusive concepts","current literature","airways","important factors","airflow","ultimate aim","changes","years"],"language":"en"},

In order to investigate the reason for the higher rate of fatal outcome of this infection, this study compared the molecular epidemiology and virology of avian influenza A (H7N9) viruses from mild (N = 14), severe (N = 50) and fatal (N = 35) cases, as well as from non-human hosts (N = 73). The epidemiological results showed that the average age of the people in the mild, severe and fatal groups was 27.6, 52 and 62 years old, respectively (p \u003C 0.001). Males accounted for 42.9 % (6/14), 58.0 % (29/50), and 74.3 % (26/35) of cases in the mild, severe and fatal group respectively (p = 0.094). Median days from onset to start of antiviral treatment were 2, 5 and 7 days in the mild, severe and fatal group, respectively (p = 0.002). The median time from onset to discharge/death was 12, 40 and 19 days in the mild, severe and fatal group, respectively (p \u003C 0.001). Analysis of whole genome sequences showed that PB2 (E627K), NA (R294K) and PA (V100A) mutations were markedly associated with an increased fatality rate, while HA (N276D) and PB2 (N559T) mutations were clearly related to mild cases. There were no differences in the genotypes, adaptation to mammalian hosts, and genetic identity between the three types of infection. In conclusion, advanced age and delayed confirmation of diagnosis and antiviral intervention were risk factors for death. Furthermore, PB2 (E627K), NA (R294K) and PA (V100A) mutations might contribute to a fatal outcome in human H7N9 infection.

Bacterial infections remain the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. This review is focused on the prevalence of infections in those with cirrhosis, including multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, pathogenesis of infection-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), current treatment recommendations, and prophylactic strategies in patients with cirrhosis. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent epidemiological studies have noted an emerging prevalence of MDR bacterial infections and associated with poor prognosis, and a high rate of treatment failure and mortality. Therefore, new recommendations on empirical antibiotic use based on epidemiological data have been developed in order to improve outcomes. SUMMARY: Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and urinary tract infection (UTI) are the most frequent infections followed by pneumonia, cellulitis, and bacteremia, while pneumonia carries the highest risk of mortality. The incidence of MDR bacterial infections has been increasing, especially in healthcare-associated settings.

The present review examines the cytokine response to short term exercise stress, with an emphasis on the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms and modulation of both innate and specific immune parameters through cytokine regulation. The effects of long term exercise on cytokine responses and the possible impact on various facets of the immune system are also discussed, with reference to both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of exercise training. Finally, the validity of using exercise as a model for trauma and sepsis is scrutinised in the light of physiological changes, symptomatology and outcome, and limitations of the model are addressed. Further studies, examining the effect of exercise, trauma and infection on novel cytokines and cytokine systems are needed to elucidate the significance of cytokine regulation by physical activity and, more importantly, to clarify the health implications of short and long term physical activity with respect to overall immune function and resistance to infection.","publish_time":"2012-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moldoveanu, Andrei I.; Shephard, Roy J.; Shek, Pang N.","journal":"Sports Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bdfdd49c3f55f41ab8695b5133c6f38508de8831.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101891.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101891/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzIyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cytokine systems","cytokine responses","infection","trauma","significance of cytokine regulation","long term physical activity","systemic cytokine production","effect of exercise","short term exercise stress","effects of long term exercise","immune system","longitudinal studies of exercise training","overall immune function","specific immune parameters","novel cytokines","inflammatory cytokines","model","organ systems","various facets","anti-inflammatory mechanisms","various stimuli","anti-inflammatory mediators","health implications of short","respect","different levels","organs","modulation","possible impact","nonimmune cells","striking similarity","symptomatology","outcome","resistance","emphasis","light of physiological changes","reference","balance","present review","limitations","body","mediate communication","sepsis","soluble glycoproteins","validity"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Overall, 170 asthmatic children and 170 healthy controls were included in this case\u2013control study. The human IL-8 serum levels were measured using ELISA. The IL-8 mRNA expression levels were assessed by a real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction\u2013restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR\u2013RFLP) methods. RESULTS: The IL-8 expression at both protein and mRNA levels was found to be significantly elevated in asthmatic children compared to healthy subjects (P \u003C 0.0001, P = 0.004; respectively). Higher levels of IL-8 mRNA are detected in subjects with moderate to severe asthma. The presence of IL8-251 A/T (rs4073) and \u002B 781C/T (rs2227306) polymorphisms was significantly associated with an increased risk of asthma (P = 0.002, P = 0.036, respectively). In addition, we noted a significant association between these polymorphisms and an elevated risk of atopic asthma (P \u003C 0.05). For rs2227306 SNP, the highest median level of IgE was detected for the presence of TT genotype (865 \u00B1 99.74 IU/mL). Although, the rs4073 polymorphism conferred a higher risk to develop asthma at an advanced stage of severity (P = 0.008). The rs4073 T and rs2227306 C alleles are considered as risk factors for asthma development. The rs4073 T allele is represented also as a risk factor for asthma severity in Tunisian children.

One hundred and four patients (15\u201396 years) with laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 infection seen at the Emergency Department from July to December 2009 who underwent chest radiographs were studied. Radiographs were evaluated for consolidation, ground-glass opacities, interstitial patterns, distribution, and extent of findings. Eighty-seven (83.7%) of the patients were managed in the ward, and 17 (16.3%) patients eventually required admission to the ICU. All patients admitted to the ICU showed abnormalities on the initial radiograph. The presence of consolidation, multifocal, diffuse, and bilateral involvement on the initial radiograph was associated with a statistically higher risk of requiring ICU admission (p \u003C 0.001). There were no significant differences regarding age, sex, and presence of underlying comorbidities. Evolution to ARDS was found in eight cases that necessitated ICU care. All of them had on the initial radiograph patchy multifocal consolidations (p \u003C 0.001) with bilateral lesions in six cases.

Isolated working rat hearts were subjected to global ischemia and reperfusion. Infusion of 140 \u03BCM A12 or AI before global ischemia improved cardiac function recovery; increased the activity of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px); decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) content in reperfused heart; and reduced the formation of hydroxyl radical adduct of the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide in the myocardial effluent during early reperfusion compared with these indices in control. Anesthetized open-chest rats were subjected to the left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and coronary reperfusion. Peptide A12 or its analog AI was injected intravenously at the onset of reperfusion at a dose of 0.35 \u03BCmol/kg. Treatment with A12 or AI significantly limited infarct size and reduced the activity of lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase MB isoenzyme in blood plasma at the end of reperfusion compared with control. These effects were accompanied by complete recovery of Cu,Zn SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px activities; and decrease in MDA content in the area at risk by the end of reperfusion.

Fecal incontinence negatively influences the ability of affected intensive patients to care for themselves. Fecal incontinence and diarrhea often occur together, which in return restricts the patient\u2019s mobility. Improperly treated fecal incontinence can result in infections (e.g., skin disorders, existing catheter sores), secondary healing can be delayed (e.g., bedsores, sores on the back or groin/genital area) and can also result in contamination of other areas (e.g., intestinal infection). In the past, many improvised techniques and materials have been used to drain feces for patients who are either immobile or critically ill with temporary or persistent fecal incontinence. Continuous and safe fecal drainage is often a problem. There is no basic standard nursing concept that can be recommended or verified. At present there are a number of continuous fecal drainage systems that have been launched on the market. Different indications and fields of application have been recommended when dealing with continuous fecal drainage. This article shows weaknesses and strengths of continuous fecal drainage, explains how each functions, and illustrates possible indications and contra-indications with each of these.

METHODS: Forty-eight male Wistar rats were randomized into four groups, namely, group C, the control group, which was not ventilated, and groups C1, C2 and C3, the treatment groups, which were ventilated for 2 h with tidal volumes of 8, 30 and 42 ml/kg, respectively. The right middle lobe was assayed for malondialdehyde (MDA), the right posterior lobe was assayed using Western blotting for Nrf2, GCLm and SrX1 and the left lobe was assayed for Nrf2, GCLm and SrX1 mRNA. RESULTS: The MDA levels were increased in the three treatment groups, with MDA levels highest in group C3 and lowest in group C1 (C3 \u003E C2 \u003E C1) (all P \u003C 0.05). The mRNA expression of Nrf2, GCLm and SrX1 was highest in group C3 and lowest in group 1 (C3 \u003E C2 \u003E C1) (all P \u003C 0.05).

METHODS: A total of 131 consecutive adult ex situ split liver transplants (01.12.1987\u201331.12.2010) were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality rates and 1- and 3-year patient survival rates were 13, 76.3, and 66.4 %, respectively. One- and three-year graft survival rates were 63.4 and 54.2 %, respectively. The observed 10-year survival rate was 40.6 %. Continuous improvement of survival from era 1 to 3 was observed (each era: 8 years), indicating a learning curve over 24 years of experience. Patient and graft survival were not influenced by different combinations of transplanted segments or types of biliary reconstruction (p \u003E 0.05; Cox regression). Patients transplanted for primary sclerosing cholangitis had better survival (p = 0.021; log-rank), whereas all other indications including acute liver failure (13.6 %), acute and chronic graft failure (9.1 %) had no significant influence on survival (p \u003E 0.05; log-rank).

Hepatic artery thrombosis (13.2 %) had a significant influence on graft survival but not on patient survival (p = 0.002, \u003E0.05, respectively; log-rank). CONCLUSIONS: Split liver transplantation can be used safely and appears to be an underutilized resource that may benefit from liberal allocation of the second graft.","publish_time":"2014-01-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schrem, Harald; Kleine, Moritz; Lankisch, Tim Oliver; Kaltenborn, Alexander; Kousoulas, Lampros; Zachau, Lea; Lehner, Frank; Klempnauer, J\u00FCrgen","journal":"World J Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f7d0251d396eace3084952c878eb0a1337d9a1df.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102172.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102172/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzMzNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["better survival","three-year graft survival rates","year patient survival rates","Split liver transplantation","year survival rate","Continuous improvement of survival","log-rank","acute liver failure","chronic graft failure","Utilization of split liver grafts","ex situ split liver transplant series","significant influence","consecutive adult ex situ split liver transplants","ex situ splits","day mortality rates","liberal allocation","years of experience","Biliary complications","types of biliary reconstruction","change of allocation rules","different combinations of transplanted segments","German centres","primary sclerosing cholangitis","total","incentives","learning curve","indications","long-term experiences","Patients","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","underutilized resource","Cox regression","Hepatic artery thrombosis","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The agent causing CCHF is a Nairovirus. The virus is typically transmitted to humans through tick bites. CCHF is a life-threatening disease observed endemically over a wide geographical regions in the world, and there is limited information about pulmonary findings in CCHF patients. PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate the pulmonary findings belonging to a large CCHF patient cohort and to determine if there is any relationship between laboratory findings and disease severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 165 patients who were diagnosed with CCHF and examined through chest X-ray (CXR) due to respiratory symptoms at their first examination and/or during their hospitalization were included in this study. In addition to demographical and laboratory findings of the patients, chest X-rays were also examined. RESULTS: Of the 165 patients examined, 96 were male (58.2%) and 69 were female (41.8%). The mean age was 51.64 \u00B1 17.95 years (4\u201381 years). Single and/or multiple pathological findings were detected in 93 patients (56.4%) as a result of chest X-ray during their first examination. On chest X-ray, consolidation in 74 patients (44.8%), pleural effusion in 64 patients (39.8%), ground glass opacity in 49 patients (29.7%), and atelectasis in 30 patients (18.2%) were detected. CONCLUSION: According to the results of our study, it can be suggested that radiological examination in lungs should be performed primarily with CXR and pulmonary involvement (pleural effusion and consolidation) affects survival in CCHF negatively.","publish_time":"2019-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Akta\u015F, Fatma; Akta\u015F, Turan","journal":"Radiol Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97b8cd56329e51c32b08c19836bfa388b8dabf78.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102267.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102267/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzM3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CCHF","CXR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CCHF patients","pulmonary findings","laboratory findings","result of chest X-ray","large CCHF patient cohort","chest X-rays","multiple pathological findings","CXR","pulmonary involvement","consolidation","disease severity","pleural effusion","life-threatening disease","radiological examination","years","RESULTS","study","zoonotic viral disease","Congo hemorrhagic fever","limited information","world","Crimean","wide geographical regions","BACKGROUND","high mortality","hemorrhage","relationship","survival","respiratory symptoms","ground glass opacity","humans","lungs","METHODS","total","addition","tick bites","MATERIALS","mean age","agent","Nairovirus","hospitalization","CONCLUSION","atelectasis","female","PURPOSE"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: In a prospective, cross-sectional, multicentre study, data on 540 patients with confirmed 2009 H1N1 infection from seven Austrian hospitals were collected using a standardised online case-history form. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 19.3 years (range 26 days\u201390.8 years); point-of-care testing yielded false-negative results in 60.2% of the 176 cases tested. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, fatigue and headache. Overall, 343 patients (63.5%) were hospitalised, 49 (9.1%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) and 14 (4.1%) died. Case fatality rates were highest (9.1%) in those aged 65 years or older. Factors significantly associated with a higher risk for ICU admission included age, neurological disease, adipositas, and both interstitial pathology and lobular pathology on chest X-ray. No association with pregnancy, malignancy or immunosuppressive therapy was detected. Antiviral treatment significantly reduced the duration of fever by 0.66 days and lowered the risk of ICU admission, but had no significant benefit on survival. CONCLUSIONS: During the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, elderly or obese patients and those with neurological disease had an increased risk for severe H1N1 infection in Austria. Pregnancy was not associated with a higher risk for severe disease in the later phase of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Antiviral treatment provided a minimal effect on the symptoms of influenza but reduced the risk of admission to an ICU.","publish_time":"2011-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Poeppl, W.; Hell, M.; Herkner, H.; Stoiser, B.; Fritsche, G.; Schurz-Bamieh, N.; Poeppl, G.; Gattringer, R.; Jones, N.; Maass, M.; Egle, A.; Burgmann, H.","journal":"Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a27461bbce3d1cfe83d0302fbd4208102381c6f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102306.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102306/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzM5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["Austria"],"keyphrases":["risk of admission","risk of ICU admission","higher risk","risk factors","H1N1 pandemic","severe H1N1 infection","H1N1 influenza pandemic","severe disease","increased risk","neurological disease","pandemic influenza","obese patients","years","symptoms of influenza","virus infection","days","Antiviral treatment","pregnancy","interstitial pathology","lobular pathology","median age","care testing","duration of fever","common symptoms","false-negative results","intensive care unit","Case fatality rates","standardised online case-history form","effectiveness of oseltamivir","clinical features","later phase","cough","multicentre study","data","Austrian hospitals","minimal effect","adipositas","chest X-ray","malignancy","fatigue","point","range","immunosuppressive therapy","significant benefit","association","headache","survival","METHODS","PURPOSE","CONCLUSIONS","cases"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The orchidectomized (ORX) mice were orally administered with vehicle or captopril at low dose (10 mg/kg) and high dose (50 mg/kg) for six weeks. The distal femoral end, the proximal tibial head and the lumbar vertebra (LV) were stained by hematoxylin and eosin, Safranin O/Fast Green and masson-trichrome. Micro-computed tomography was performed to measure bone mineral density (BMD). RESULTS: Treatment with captopril increased trabecular bone area at distal metaphysis of femur, proximal metaphysis of tibia and LV-4, moreover, high dose of captopril significantly elevated trabecular BMD of LV-2 and LV-5. The mRNA expressions of renin receptor, angiotensinogen, carbonic anhydrase II, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were significantly decreased in tibia of ORX mice following treatment with captopril. The administration with captopril enhanced the ratio of OPG/RANKL mRNA expression, the mRNA expression of transforming growth factor-beta and the protein expression of bradykinin receptor-1. CONCLUSIONS: The inhibition on ACE by captopril exerts beneficial effects on trabecular bone of ORX mice. The therapeutic efficacy may be attributed to the regulation of captopril on local RAS and cytokines in bone.","publish_time":"2018-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Xiang-Fan; Li, Xiao-Li; Liu, Jin-Xin; Xu, Jing; Zhao, Yan-Yan; Yang, Min; Zhang, Yan","journal":"Pharmacol Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1633e707c76d44b4d51c85021a0dddb3cbfdd2f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102314/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzM5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Safranin O/Fast Green","ORX","OPG/RANKL","RAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["regulation of captopril","modulation of captopril","high dose of captopril","trabecular bone of ORX mice","bone metabolism","bone mass","trabecular bone area","osteo-preservative effects of captopril","trabecular BMD of LV","tibia of ORX mice","RANKL mRNA expression","measure bone mineral density","proximal metaphysis of tibia","mRNA expressions of renin receptor","ACE","Treatment","low dose","study","mRNA expression of transforming growth factor-beta","protein expression of bradykinin receptor","distal metaphysis of femur","beneficial effects","skeletal renin-angiotensin system","local RAS","micro-architecture","proximal tibial head","distal femoral end","Micro-computed tomography","tumor necrosis factor-alpha","angiotensinogen","Fast Green","Safranin O","carbonic anhydrase","regulators","ratio of OPG","eosin","matrix metalloproteinase","lumbar vertebra","histomorphology","inhibitor","masson-trichrome","hematoxylin","inhibition","bilateral orchidectomy","enzyme","cytokines","vehicle","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","administration","therapeutic efficacy","BACKGROUND","weeks"],"language":"en"},

They can be divided into agents with relatively broad, non-targeted specificity and targeted drugs developed on the basis of a more refined understanding of individual cancers and directed at specific molecular targets on different cancer cells. Individual drugs in both groups have been classified on the basis of their mechanism of action in killing cancer cells. The targeted drugs include proteasome inhibitors, toxic chimeric proteins and signal transduction inhibitors such as tyrosine kinase (non-receptor and receptor), serine/threonine kinase, histone deacetylase and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors. Increasingly used targeted vascular (VEGF) and platelet-derived endothelial growth factor blockade can provoke a range of pathological consequences. Many of the non-targeted drugs are cytotoxic, suppressing haematopoiesis as well as provoking cutaneous eruptions and vascular, lung and liver injury. Cytotoxic side effects of the targeted drugs occur less often and usually with less severity, but they show their own unusual adverse effects including, for example, a lengthened QT interval, a characteristic papulopustular rash, nail disorders and a hand\u2013foot skin reaction variant. The term hypersensitivity is widely used across a number of disciplines but not always with the same definition in mind, and the terminology needs to be standardised. This is particularly apparent in cancer chemotherapy where anti-neoplastic drug-induced thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anaemia, vascular disorders, liver injury and lung disease as well as many dermatological manifestations sometimes have an immune basis. The most insidious of all adverse consequences of targeted therapies, however, are tumour adaptation, increased malignancy and the invasive metastatic switch seen with anti-angiogenic drugs that inhibit the VEGF-A pathway. Adverse reactions to 44 non-targeted and 33 targeted, frequently used, chemotherapeutic drugs are presented together with discussions of diagnosis, premedications, desensitizations and importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying the various drug-induced reactions. There is need for wide-ranging acceptance of what constitutes a hypersensitivity reaction and for allergists to be more involved in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of chemotherapeutic drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions.","publish_time":"2013-09-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baldo, Brian A.; Pham, Nghia H.","journal":"Cancer Metastasis Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/01a203b05c7c97bd6716617b5f9ffb8cd7b9e18d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102343.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102343/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzQxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-targeted drugs","chemotherapeutic drugs","Individual drugs","non-targeted specificity","anti-angiogenic drugs","adverse consequences of targeted therapies","non-receptor","Adverse reactions","vascular disorders","various drug-induced reactions","prevention of chemotherapeutic drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions","different cancer cells","proteasome inhibitors","cancer chemotherapy","liver injury","VEGF","immune basis","different cancers","unusual adverse effects","term hypersensitivity","anti-neoplastic drug-induced thrombocytopenia","refined understanding of individual cancers","signal transduction inhibitors","tyrosine kinase","nail disorders","threonine kinase","mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors","lung disease","discussions of diagnosis","range of pathological consequences","foot skin reaction variant","toxic chimeric proteins","histone deacetylase","characteristic papulopustular rash","hand","serine","neutropenia","anaemia","platelet-derived endothelial growth factor blockade","specific molecular targets","invasive metastatic switch","increased malignancy","example","lengthened QT interval","desensitizations","tumour adaptation","mechanisms","treatment","haematopoiesis","dermatological manifestations","cutaneous eruptions","importance","premedications","mechanism of action","allergists","agents","groups","wide-ranging acceptance","definition","mind","terminology","number of disciplines","pathway","severity"],"language":"en"},

If not cleared, apoptotic neutrophils are postulated to release histotoxic granular contents. Since numerous cellular proteins are degraded during apoptosis, we sought to determine whether functional serine proteinases are indeed released by apoptosing neutrophils in vitro. In a coculture system, cytokine-activated neutrophils induced detachment in the human epithelial cell line, A549. This process was CD18- and serine proteinase-dependent. Early apoptotic neutrophils induced significant detachment, but live, senescent, resting neutrophils and terminal, secondary necrotic neutrophils had a different effect. This detachment process was CD18-independent but serine proteinase-dependent. Similarly, detachment occurred with primary human small airway epithelial cells. Notably, epithelial cell detachment correlated with the transition of early apoptotic neutrophils to secondary necrosis and with the accumulation of elastase in the supernatant. The membrane integrity of lung epithelial cells was damaged in advance of significant cell detachment. These observations suggest that not only live activated neutrophils but also apoptosing neutrophils can reveal functional elastase activities. Furthermore, the rapidity of the transition emphasizes the importance of the prompt clearance of apoptotic neutrophils before they progress to secondary necrosis at the site of lung inflammation.","publish_time":"2003-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Chien-Ying; Liu, Yun-Hen; Lin, Shu-Min; Yu, Chih-Ten; Wang, Chun-Hua; Lin, Horng-Chyuan; Lin, Chien-Huang; Kuo, Han-Pin","journal":"J Biomed Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/efce114427b6890a6af5e70d5f8a8611dcdc6a75.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102366/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzQyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["apoptosing neutrophils","secondary necrotic neutrophils","live activated neutrophils","transition of early apoptotic neutrophils","prompt clearance of apoptotic neutrophils","cytokine-activated neutrophils","epithelial cell detachment","significant detachment","detachment process","advance of significant cell detachment","secondary necrosis","human epithelial cell line","serine proteinase-dependent","membrane integrity of lung epithelial cells","site of lung inflammation","functional serine proteinases","primary human small airway epithelial cells","resolution phase of lung inflammation","functional elastase activities","CD18-independent","accumulation of elastase","important role","alveolar macrophages","importance","terminal","coculture system","different effect","A549","apoptosis","numerous cellular proteins","histotoxic granular contents","supernatant","rapidity","observations"],"language":"en"},

It has evolved a multi-faceted, physical and immune defense system to ensure that in the majority of instances, potentially injurious invaders are repelled. Inflammation, predominantly mediated by effector cells of the granulocyte lineage including neutrophils and eosinophils, is a form of immune defense. Where inflammation proves unable to remove an inciting stimulus, chronic inflammatory disease may supervene because of the potential for tissue damage conferred by the presence of large numbers of frustrated, activated granulocytes. Successful recovery from inflammatory disease and resolution of inflammation rely on the clearance of these cells. Ideally, they should undergo apoptosis prior to phagocytosis by macrophage, dendritic, or epithelial cells. The outcome of inflammation can have serious sequelae for the integrity of the respiratory mucosa leading to disease. Therapeutic strategies to drive resolution of inflammation may be directed at the induction of granulocyte apoptosis and the enhancement of granulocyte clearance.

The development of an automated and rapid disease detection system would therefore be of considerable benefit to both production and animal welfare. This study represents an intelligence device for diagnosing avian diseases by using Data-mining methods and Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (D-S). 14-day-old chickens were divided into four groups. Each group was deliberately infected with a disease: Newcastle Disease (ND), Bronchitis Virus (BV), Avian Influenenza (AI), and the last group was considered as control samples. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) were used to process the chicken\u2019s sound signals in frequency and time-frequency domains, respectively. In order to achieve information, 25 statistical features from frequency domains, and 75 statistical features from time-frequency domains were extracted. During dimensionality reduction stage, the best features of the sound signals were selected, using improved distance evaluation (IDE) method. The chicken\u2019s sound signals were analyzed in two consecutive days after virus infection. Support vector machine (SVM) was used as the classifier in this study. The first classification was done with SVM and based on sound features in frequency and time-frequency domains with accuracy of 41.35 and 83.33%, respectively. The accuracy of the method based on D-S infusion of sound data reached 91.15%. The developed model based on achievement result could diagnose Newcastle Disease, Bronchitis Virus and Avian Influenza from sound signals.","publish_time":"2016-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Banakar, Ahmad; Sadeghi, Mohammad; Shushtari, Abdolhamid","journal":"Computers and Electronics in Agriculture","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc84045e71998d21b9fec20b2b58db343ecacb5d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125684.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168169916306020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287574/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168169916306020; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2016.08.006","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Discrete Wavelet Transform","SVM","Newcastle Disease, Bronchitis Virus and Avian Influenza"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sound features","time-frequency domains","chicken\u2019s sound signals","Newcastle Disease","statistical features","D-S infusion of sound data","Bronchitis Virus","avian diseases","best features","Avian Influenza","Avian Influenenza","virus infection","SVM","accuracy","study","rapid disease detection system","number of diseases","Data-mining methods","Discrete Wavelet Transform","commercial poultry production","Fast Fourier Transform","Dempster-Shafer evidence theory","FFT","BV","achievement result","particular importance","considerable benefit","improved distance evaluation","consecutive days","heavy economic losses","dimensionality reduction stage","intelligence device","information","animal welfare","developed model","Support vector machine","Abstract","DWT","development","flock","control samples","order","classifier","chickens","groups","classification"],"language":"en"},

One efficient tactic is to divert host immune responses toward an immunodominant decoy epitope and to induce non-neutralizing antibodies toward this epitope. Therefore, it is expected that the amount of decoy epitope in a subunit vaccine can affect the level of neutralizing antibody in an immunized animal. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by generating an antibody specific to the decoy epitope on the capsid protein of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). Using this antibody, we found that two commercial vaccines contained statistically different amounts of the decoy epitope. The vaccine with lower levels of decoy epitope induced a significantly higher level of neutralizing antibody after immunization. This antibody can be used as an analytical tool to monitor the quality of a vaccine from batch to batch.","publish_time":"2018-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jin, Junyeong; Park, Changhoon; Cho, Sun-Hee; Chung, Junho","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f63cd990f80bf23a1c1ac68e58f8e6bcaa460cd8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092900.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X18301621; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29374509/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X18301621; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.01.141","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immunodominant decoy epitope","lower levels of decoy epitope","antibody specific","higher level of neutralizing antibody","host immune responses","subunit vaccine","batch","non-neutralizing antibodies","wide range of tactics","capsid protein of porcine circovirus type","different amounts","quality","immunization","Abstract Viral pathogens","commercial vaccines","efficient tactic","immunized animal","PCV2","hypothesis","analytical tool","study"],"language":"en"},

In addition to community onset, nosocomial acquisition and transmission may also occur. Detection of asymptomatic shedders (e.g., patients in the incubation period or immunosuppressed long term shedders) facilitates control of nosocomial transmission. Methods: To strengthen the existing infection control concept, a PCR-based screening for RSV and influenza virus was implemented for all patients lacking respiratory symptoms (asymptomatic patients) who were hospitalized on an adult and a pediatric hemato-oncological ward. Laboratory results of this screening were analyzed retrospectively. Results: 665 respiratory specimens were obtained for screening from 251 patients (26% were 18 years and younger) from December 2016 to April 2017. In 23 patients without respiratory symptoms, either influenza virus or RSV infection was found, resulting in a detection rate of about 9%. In 6 patients, the infection was presumably detected during the incubation period, because an increase of viral load was observed in subsequent specimens. Positive screening results facilitated timely implementation of adequate infection control precautions. Nosocomial clusters of RSV or influenza were not detected during the screening period on the two wards. Conclusion: The seasonal screening program expanded our existing infection control concept in terms of patients lacking respiratory symptoms who shed influenza virus or RSV. It enabled us to identify 23 RSV or influenza infections in patients lacking respiratory symptoms in a 4-month period and thus to rapidly take isolation precautions.","publish_time":"2018-09-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baier, Claas; Linderkamp, Christin; Beilken, Andreas; Thol, Felicitas; Heuser, Michael; Ebadi, Ella; Ganzenmueller, Tina; Heim, Albert; Bange, Franz-Christoph","journal":"GMS Hyg Infect Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e9904ae72aa384d02a168cbee9347f4af5afda06.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6234716.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30460173/; https://doi.org/10.3205/dgkh000314","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RSV infection","asymptomatic patients","respiratory symptoms","terms of patients","immunocompromised patients","screening period","influenza virus infections","influenza infections","Respiratory syncytial virus","respiratory specimens","Nosocomial clusters of RSV","Positive screening results","existing infection control concept","control of nosocomial transmission","incubation period","PCR-based screening","seasonal screening program","month period","timely implementation of adequate infection control precautions","nosocomial acquisition","Detection of asymptomatic shedders","Laboratory results","subsequent specimens","isolation precautions","detection rate","immunosuppressed long term shedders","significant healthcare risk","community onset","increase of viral load","addition","pediatric hemato-oncological ward","Introduction","adult","Conclusion","years","Methods","wards"],"language":"en"},

Summary Compensation for no-fault medical accidents to professionals or establishments is provided for by article L.1142-1 of the public health code, created by the law of March 4, 2002 relating to the rights of patients and the quality of the health system. It indicates the conditions of accountability, clinical criteria and severity. Among the clinical criteria \u0022a medical accident (...) gives the right to compensation for damages (...) in the name of national solidarity, when (...) they have had abnormal consequences for the patient in view of his condition as well as the foreseeable evolution of it (\u2026)\u201D. The jurisdictional orders have had to characterize this \u0022abnormality of the consequences\u0022. According to the jurisprudence of the Conseil d\u2019Etat of December 12, 2014 the condition of abnormality is always \u0022satisfied when the medical act entailed consequences significantly more serious than those to which the patient was exposed in a sufficiently probable way in the absence of treatment \u0022. And if this is not the case,\u0022 they cannot be regarded as abnormal unless, under the conditions in which the act was performed, the occurrence of damage presented a low probability; that thus, they cannot be regarded as abnormal with regard to the state of the patient when the gravity of this state led to practicing an act involving high risks whose realization is at the origin of the damage \u0022. The Conseil d\u2019Etat specified in 2019 that a probability of occurrence of 3% was a low probability.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Collet, Lionel","journal":"Bull Acad Natl Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f56f5f87e45e6677155b536af0180702dfd24fcd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001407920301850; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001407920301850?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["\u00E9tat","state"],"keyphrases":["the Conseil","the consequences","the occurrence","the damage","the health","the case","the law","gives the","the quality","the patient when the gravity","in the name","the patient in view","The jurisdictional orders","According to the jurisprudence","relating to the rights","It indicates the conditions","under the conditions in which the act was performed","Among the clinical criteria","the public health code","sufficiently probable way in the absence","they cannot be regarded as abnormal with regard to the","his condition as well as the foreseeable evolution","satisfied when the medical act entailed consequences significantly more serious than those to which the patient was exposed in","to compensation","\u00E9tat du patient","patient des cons\u00E9quences anormales","led to practicing an act involving high risks whose realization is at the origin","had to characterize this","\u00E9tat de sant\u00E9","Etat specified in","jurisprudence du Conseil","had abnormal consequences","if this is","low probability","fault medical accidents to professionals or establishments is provided","they cannot be regarded as abnormal unless","acte m\u00E9dical","probabilit\u00E9 de survenance","anormalit\u00E9 des cons\u00E9quences","probabilit\u00E9 faible","abnormality is always","accident m\u00E9dical","article","Summary Compensation for no","crit\u00E8res cliniques","survenance du dommage","gravit\u00E9","code de la sant\u00E9 publique cr\u00E9\u00E9","that thus","damage presented","absence de traitement","origine du dommage","indemnisation des accidents m\u00E9dicaux","patients","accountability","created","damages","March","national solidarity","faute des professionnels","treatment","December","r\u00E9alisation","\u00E9tablissements","loi","mani\u00E8re","droits des malades","qualit\u00E9 du syst\u00E8me","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","risques \u00E9lev\u00E9s","severity","imputabilit\u00E9","r\u00E9paration des pr\u00E9judices","\u00E9volution pr\u00E9visible","titre de la solidarit\u00E9 nationale","ordres juridictionnels"],"language":"fr"},

The cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) is a well-recognized model for the study of human respiratory viral infections. In this work we show that, without requiring any genetic modification of either the host or the virus, intranasal infection of cotton rats with HRV16 resulted in measurable lower respiratory tract pathology, mucus production, and expression of interferon-activated genes. Intramuscular immunization with live HRV16 generated robust protective immunity that correlated with high serum levels of neutralizing antibodies. In addition, cotton rats treated prophylactically with hyperimmune anti-HRV16 serum were protected against HRV16 intranasal challenge. Finally, protection by immunization was efficiently transferred from mothers to newborn animals resulting in a substantial reduction of infectious virus loads in the lung following intranasal challenge. Overall, our results demonstrate that the cotton rat provides valuable additional model development options for testing vaccines and prophylactic therapies against rhinovirus infection.","publish_time":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blanco, Jorge C.

However, it is not uncommon to observe negligence in adopting such behaviour, and this especially among young segments of the population. Using the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) as conceptual framework, this study explores the role of socio-cognitive factors that affect the decision of wearing a pollution mask in the context of young educated people. This is done by selecting a sample of college students in urban China, a country that has seen air quality as one of the major challenges in the last decades. While young urban college students might be expected to be receptive to standard attempts to be influenced through reason-based cognitive stimuli, it is often found that this is not the case. The empirical analysis was articulated it in two steps. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was first used to examine the relationships among the conceptual constructs derived from the TPB conceptual model, and second Step-Wise Ordinary Least Squares Regressions (SWOLS) were employed to observe the partial effect played by each item on the decision to wear a mask. RESULTS: Results show that, while reason-based stimuli play a role, attitude, social norm, and self-efficacy were the most important predictors of the behavioural intention (p \u003C 0.01). The role of past behaviour was also acknowledged as strongly associated with the dependent variable (p \u003C 0.01). Overall, the likelihood of wearing a pollution mask increases with the importance of others socio-cognitive and psychological factors, which could help understand behavioural biases, and explain the relative role of several mechanisms behind the decision to wear a mask. CONCLUSIONS: While tackling pollution requires multiple and synergic approaches, encouraging self-prevention using pollution mask is a simple and effective action, implementable at negligible costs. Resistance among younger, well-educated cohorts to wear masks can be overcome by stressing the social desirability of action and the sense of empowerment derived from its usage. This study has the potential to inform policies aimed at changing suboptimal behavioural attitudes by identifying triggers for change, and it could serve in improving the tailoring of health promotion messages aimed at nudging healthy behaviour.

This study describes the willingness to be vaccinated for H1N1 among healthcare workers (HCWs) in primary healthcare clinics with and without chronic medical conditions, their reasons for refusing vaccination and whether they sought additional information to make an informed decision for the vaccination. Materials and methods An anonymous survey was conducted in November 2009 among all medical, nursing, allied health and operations HCWs in nine primary care clinics in Singapore. Participants were asked if they had any chronic medical conditions associated with influenza-related complications (example: asthma, stroke, heart disease, cancer, diabetes mellitus, renal disease), their perception towards vaccination for H1N1 and against seasonal influenza within the preceding 2 years. Results The initial response rate was 80%, of which 711 (54.7%) of the completed surveys were analysed. Among the 711 respondents, 16.6% reported having at least 1 chronic disease. Asthma (10.8%), hypertension (10.4%) and dyslipidaemia (9.8%) were the main chronic conditions. Only 39.4% of respondents were willing to be vaccinated against H1N1. Males were 2.07 (95% CI 1.19\u20133.62) times more likely than females to receive the H1N1 vaccination; the 45\u201354 and 55\u002B years old were 2.12 (95% CI 1.06\u20134.24) and 2.44 (95% CI 1.13\u20135.27) times more willing than those below 25 years old; and those who considered accepting the seasonal influenza vaccine were 7.0 times more likely than those who did not (95%CI 4.48\u201310.92). The 2 principal barriers were \u201Cfear of side effects\u201D and \u201Cunsure of vaccine\u0027s effectiveness\u201D. Although 78% attended some H1N1-related talks, only 7% of all HCWs felt that they had sufficient information. Most wanted more information about the vaccine\u0027s safety profile and contraindications. Conclusion Fewer than 40% of HCWs expressed willingness to receive the H1N1 vaccination, lower than past rates of influenza vaccine. HCWs in primary care clinics who had a chronic condition did not perceive themselves to be at higher risk of developing H1N1-related complications and were not more willing than the rest of the HCWs to accept H1N1 vaccination. Vaccine\u0027s side effects and effectiveness were the main concerns. Uptake of H1N1 vaccine may improve with targeted health information covering the vaccine\u0027s safety profile.","publish_time":"2012-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Toh, Matthias Paul Han Sim; Kannan, Predeebha; Chen, Yongchang; Chng, Florence Liong Cheu; Tang, Wern Ee","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ac60c43cffb0af459331a7cab49bd236576741b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127734.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X11019608; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22178521/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.12.037; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X11019608","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Singapore"],"keyphrases":["H1N1 vaccination","novel H1N1 vaccine","Uptake of H1N1 vaccine","H1N1-related talks","chronic disease","chronic medical conditions","operations HCWs","seasonal influenza vaccine","main chronic conditions","influenza-related complications","higher risk of developing H1N1-related complications","times","primary care clinics","primary healthcare clinics","vaccine\u0027s safety profile","past rates of influenza vaccine","additional information","sufficient information","years old","targeted health information","unsure of vaccine\u0027s effectiveness","heart disease","renal disease","effects","asthma","willingness","respondents","allied health","healthcare workers","main concerns","initial response rate","cancer","diabetes mellitus","stroke","example","nursing","informed decision","Abstract Introduction","perception","reasons","females","Materials","methods","anonymous survey","fear","contraindications","Singapore","rest","principal barriers","hypertension","Conclusion Fewer","completed surveys","dyslipidaemia","pandemic","study","Participants"],"language":"en"},

There are more than 150 antigenically heterogeneous HRV serotypes, with \u223C90 HRVs belonging to major group species A and B. Development of small animal models that are susceptible to infection with major group HRVs would be beneficial for vaccine research. Previously, we showed that the cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) is semi-permissive to HRV16 (major group, species HRV-A virus) infection, replicating in the upper and lower respiratory tracts with measurable pathology, mucus production, and expression of inflammatory mediators. Herein, we report that intranasal infection of cotton rats with HRV14 (major group, species HRV-B virus) results in isolation of infectious virus from the nose and lung. Similar to HRV16, intramuscular immunization with live HRV14 induces homologous protection that correlated with high levels of serum neutralizing antibodies. Vaccination and challenge experiments with HRV14 and HRV16 to evaluate the development of cross-protective immunity demonstrate that intramuscular immunization with live HRV16 significantly protects animals against HRV14 challenge. Determination of the immunological mechanisms involved in heterologous protection and further characterization of infection with other major HRV serotypes in the cotton rat could enhance the robustness of the model to define heterotypic relationships between this diverse group of viruses and thereby increase its potential for development of a multi-serotype HRV vaccine.","publish_time":"2017-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patel, Mira C.; Pletneva, Lioubov M.; Boukhvalova, Marina S.; Vogel, Stefanie N.; Kajon, Adriana E.; Blanco, Jorge C.

How these diverse receptor recognition patterns affect viral entry is unknown. Mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) is the only known coronavirus that uses the N-terminal domain (NTD) of its spike to recognize a protein receptor, CEACAM1a. Here we determined the cryo-EM structure of MHV spike complexed with mouse CEACAM1a. The trimeric spike contains three receptor-binding S1 heads sitting on top of a trimeric membrane-fusion S2 stalk. Three receptor molecules bind to the sides of the spike trimer, where three NTDs are located. Receptor binding induces structural changes in the spike, weakening the interactions between S1 and S2. Using protease sensitivity and negative-stain EM analyses, we further showed that after protease treatment of the spike, receptor binding facilitated the dissociation of S1 from S2, allowing S2 to transition from pre-fusion to post-fusion conformation. Together these results reveal a new role of receptor binding in MHV entry: in addition to its well-characterized role in viral attachment to host cells, receptor binding also induces the conformational change of the spike and hence the fusion of viral and host membranes. Our study provides new mechanistic insight into coronavirus entry and highlights the diverse entry mechanisms used by different viruses.","publish_time":"2020-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shang, Jian; Wan, Yushun; Liu, Chang; Yount, Boyd; Gully, Kendra; Yang, Yang; Auerbach, Ashley; Peng, Guiqing; Baric, Ralph; Li, Fang","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cda6739d1d7ea0d99f680fe096b04c521036cfcf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7082060.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32150576/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008392","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["trimeric spike","protein receptor","spike trimer","receptor molecules","new role of receptor binding","receptor-binding S1 heads","MHV entry","viral entry","coronavirus entry","fusion of viral","diverse receptor recognition patterns","cryo-EM structure of MHV spike","envelope-anchored spike protein","pre-fusion","trimeric membrane-fusion S2 stalk","diverse entry mechanisms","viral attachment","known coronavirus","post-fusion conformation","dissociation of S1","Mouse hepatitis coronavirus","mouse CEACAM1a","different domains","different viruses","protease sensitivity","protease treatment","host membranes","well-characterized role","new mechanistic insight","negative-stain EM analyses","addition","cells","variety of receptors","N-terminal domain","study","sides","structural changes","conformational change","results","interactions","Coronaviruses","NTDs"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we described the development of a lateral flow dipstrip (LFD) of isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) method for rapid detection of IBRV. METHODS: Distinct regions were selected as a candidate target for designing the LFD-RPA primers and probes. The analytical sensitivity of the RPA assay was determined using ten-fold serially diluted IBRV DNA. The specificity of the assay was assessed with other viral pathogens of cattle with similar clinic and other herpesviruses. The clinical performance was evaluated by testing 106 acute-phase high fever clinical specimens. RESULTS: RPA primers and probe were designed to target the specific conserved UL52 region fragment of IBRV. The detection could be completed at a constant temperature of 38 \u00B0C for 25 min, and the amplification products were easily visualized on a simple LFD. The detection limit of this assay was 5 copies per reaction of IBRV DNA and there was no cross-reactivity with other viruses causing bovine gastrointestinal and respiratory infections or other herpesviruses. The assay performance on acute-phase high fever clinical samples collected from cattle with no vaccine against IBRV, which were suspected to be infected with IBRV, was validated by detecting 24 fecal, 36 blood, 38 nasal swab and 8 tissue specimens, and compared with SYBR Green I based real-time PCR. The coincidence between IBRV LFD-RPA and real-time PCR was 100%. CONCLUSION: IBRV LFD-RPA was fast and much easier to serve as an alternative to the common measures used for IBRV diagnosis, as there is reduction in the use of instruments for identification of the infected animals. In addition, this assay may be the potential candidate to be used as point-of-care diagnostics in the field.","publish_time":"2017-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hou, Peili; Wang, Hongmei; Zhao, Guimin; He, Chengqiang; He, Hongbin","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/72761826ce01da1fe5599c79547746b44fe5ec49.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5729238.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29237466/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-017-1284-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsxMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBRV","RPA","SYBR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBRV LFD-RPA","IBRV diagnosis","RPA assay","rapid detection of IBRV","reaction of IBRV DNA","diluted IBRV DNA","LFD-RPA primers","rapid diagnosis of IBRV infection","assay performance","simple LFD","specific conserved UL52 region fragment of IBRV","clinical performance","acute-phase high fever clinical specimens","acute-phase high fever clinical samples","real-time PCR","herpesviruses","candidate target","detection limit","viral pathogens of cattle","tissue specimens","optimal method","amplification products","potential candidate","infected animals","isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification","Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus","respiratory infections","lateral flow dipstrip","similar clinic","copies","significant economic losses","nasal swab","SYBR Green","development","dairy industry","use of instruments","identification","point","BACKGROUND","cross-reactivity","common measures","reduction","fold","Distinct regions","major pathogen","care diagnostics","blood","alternative","RESULTS","vaccine","analytical sensitivity","probes","coincidence","CONCLUSION","constant temperature","field","METHODS","study","specificity","addition"],"language":"en"},

Coronaviruses (group 1: 14 [18.9%] illnesses; group 2: 26 [21.5%] illnesses) and enteroviruses/rhinoviruses (group 1: 14 [18.9%] illnesses; group 2: 37 [30.6%] illnesses) were most common. Virus co-infections occurred in 10 illnesses. Illnesses with 9 to 11 symptoms were more common in group 1 (17 [23.0%]) than in group 2 (15 [12.4%]) (P \u003C .05). Compared with group 2, more group 1 subjects reported dyspnea, more severe disease of longer duration, and treatment for acute illness with prednisone and antibiotics. Coronavirus-associated illnesses (percent of illnesses, group 1 vs group 2) were characterized by myalgias (21% vs 68%, P \u003C .01), chills (50% vs 52%), dyspnea (71% vs 24%, P \u003C .01), headache (64% vs 72%), malaise (64% vs 84%), cough (86% vs 68%), sputum production (86% vs 60%), sore throat (64% vs 80%), and nasal congestion (93% vs 96%). Conclusions Respiratory illnesses were commonly associated with coronaviruses and enteroviruses/rhinoviruses affecting chronically ill, older patients more than healthy, young adults.","publish_time":"2015-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gorse, Geoffrey J.; Donovan, Mary M.; Patel, Gira B.; Balasubramanian, Sumitra; Lusk, Rodney H.","journal":"The American Journal of Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d8a49de93133baa4c5180ffe3ce2450f41db977.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7093847.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002934315005185; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002934315005185; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26087047/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2015.05.034","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsyMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vs group","percent of illnesses","acute respiratory illnesses","Coronavirus-associated illnesses","Conclusions Respiratory illnesses","Results Virus-associated illnesses","subjects","Respiratory secretions","older adults","healthy adults","panel of respiratory viruses","older patients","years","rhinoviruses","coronavirus strains","young adults","dyspnea","enteroviruses","Coronaviruses","Virus co-infections","Abstract Background Study of human coronavirus","acute illness","prospective study","calendar quarters","treatment","heart diseases","severe disease of longer duration","nucleic acids","chronic lung","prednisone","clinical effects","onset","antibody titer","antibiotics","sputum production","sore throat","symptoms","nasal congestion","increase","Methods","weeks","chills","headache","malaise","cough","myalgias"],"language":"en"},

The spread of multi-drug resistant organisms presents increasing challenges to treatment. Surviving BSI is dependent on rapid and accurate identification of causal organisms, and timely application of appropriate antibiotics. Current culture-based methods used to detect and identify agents of BSI are often too slow to impact early therapy and may fail to detect relevant organisms in many positive cases. Existing methods for direct molecular detection of microbial DNA in blood are limited in either sensitivity (likely the result of small sample volumes) or in breadth of coverage, often because the PCR primers and probes used target only a few specific pathogens. There is a clear unmet need for a sensitive molecular assay capable of identifying the diverse bacteria and yeast associated with BSI directly from uncultured whole blood samples. We have developed a method of extracting DNA from larger volumes of whole blood (5 ml per sample), amplifying multiple widely conserved bacterial and fungal genes using a mismatch- and background-tolerant PCR chemistry, and identifying hundreds of diverse organisms from the amplified fragments on the basis of species-specific genetic signatures using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS). We describe the analytical characteristics of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay and compare its pre-clinical performance to current standard-of-care methods in a collection of prospectively collected blood specimens from patients with symptoms of sepsis. The assay generated matching results in 80% of culture-positive cases (86% when common contaminants were excluded from the analysis), and twice the total number of positive detections. The described method is capable of providing organism identifications directly from uncultured blood in less than 8 hours.

Here, we present a method to identify single antibody-expressing cells using antigen-conjugated fluorescent beads. To establish this, we selected Folate Receptor alpha (FR\u03B1) as a model antigen and a mouse B cell line, expressing both the soluble and the membrane-bound forms of a human/mouse chimeric antibody (MOv18 IgG1) specific for FR\u03B1, as test antibody-expressing cells. Beads were conjugated to FR\u03B1 using streptavidin/avidin-biotin bridges and used to select single cells expressing the membrane-bound form of anti-FR\u03B1. Bead-bound cells were single cell-sorted and processed for single cell RNA retrotranscription and PCR to isolate antibody heavy and light chain variable regions. Variable regions were then cloned and expressed as human IgG1/k antibodies. Like the original clone, engineered antibodies from single cells recognized native FR\u03B1. To evaluate whether antigen-coated beads could identify specific antibody-expressing cells in mixed immune cell populations, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were spiked with test antibody-expressing cells. Antigen-specific cells could comprise up to 75% of cells selected with antigen-conjugated beads when the frequency of the antigen-positive cells was 1:100 or higher. In PBMC pools, beads conjugated to recombinant antigens FR\u03B1 and HER2 bound antigen-specific anti-FR\u03B1 MOv18 and anti-HER2 Trastuzumab antibody-expressing cells, respectively. From melanoma patient-derived B cells selected with melanoma cell line-derived protein-coated fluorescent beads, we generated a monoclonal antibody that recognized melanoma antigen-coated beads.

Human papillomavirus has been established as the causative agent for cervical neoplasia and cervical cancer. However, the tumor biology involved in the prognoses of different cell types in early cancers and tumor responses to radiation in advanced cancers remain largely unknown. The introduction of microarray technologies in the 1990s has provided genome-wide strategies for searching tens of thousands of genes simultaneously. In this review, we first summarize the two types of microarrays: oligonucleotides microarray and cDNA microarray. Then, we review the studies of functional genomics in cervical cancer. Gene expression studies that involved cervical cancer cell lines, cervical cells of cancer versus normal ectocervix, cancer tissues of different histology, radioresistant versus radiosensitive patients, and the combinatorial gene expression associated with chromosomal amplifications are discussed. In particular, CEACAM5, TACSTD1, S100P, and MSLN have shown to be upregulated in adenocarcinoma, and increased expression levels of CEACAM5 and TACSTD1 were significantly correlated with poorer patient outcomes. On the other hand, 35 genes, including apoptotic genes (e.g. BIK, TEGT, SSI-3), hypoxia-inducible genes (e.g. HIF1A, CA12), and tumor cell invasion and metastasis genes (e.g. CTSL, CTSB, PLAU, CD44), have been noted to echo the hypothesis that increased tumor hypoxia leads to radiation resistance in cervical cancer during radiation.","publish_time":"2007-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chao, Angel; Wang, Tzu-Hao; Lai, Chyong-Huey","journal":"Taiwanese Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9912aeecf51b0e95f7d0bc4ba806aef374b089a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1028455908600054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18182341/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1028-4559(08)60005-4; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1028455908600054","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsyNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MSLN"],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["cervical cells of cancer","SUMMARY Cervical cancer","cervical cancer cell lines","cervical neoplasia","cause of cancer death","cancer tissues of different histology","tumor hypoxia","metastasis genes","apoptotic genes","tumor cell invasion","hypoxia-inducible genes","tumor responses","tumor biology","Gene expression studies","prognoses of different cell types","early cancers","radiation resistance","combinatorial gene expression","TACSTD1","advanced cancers","leading female cancers","oligonucleotides microarray","cDNA microarray","increased expression levels of CEACAM5","review","introduction of microarray technologies","types of microarrays","female population","studies of functional genomics","normal ectocervix","radiosensitive patients","CTSL","radioresistant","CA12","CTSB","HIF1A","causative agent","genome-wide strategies","tens of thousands","S100P","BIK","TEGT","Taiwan","chromosomal amplifications","PLAU","CD44","adenocarcinoma","poorer patient outcomes","MSLN","hand","hypothesis","Human papillomavirus"],"language":"en"},

Regionalization of critical care is a possible solution; regionalization has been implemented for trauma and neonatal intensive care, and it is under active discussion for medical and cardiac critical care. However, regionalization is only one possible approach to reorganizing critical care services. This commentary introduces the technique of network analysis as a framework for the following: (1) understanding how critically ill patients move between hospitals, (2) defining the roles hospitals play in regional care delivery, and (3) suggesting systematic improvements that may benefit population health. We examined transfers of critically ill Medicare patients in Connecticut in 2005 as a model system. We found that patients are systematically transferred to more capable hospitals. However, we find the standard distinction of hospitals into either \u201Csecondary hospitals\u201D or \u201Ctertiary hospitals\u201D poorly explains observed transfer patterns; instead, hospitals show a continuum of roles. We further examine the implications of the network pattern in a simulation of quarantine of a hospital to incoming transfers, as occurred during the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic. Network perspectives offer new ways to study systems to care for critically ill patients and provide additional tools for addressing pragmatic problems in triage and bed management, regionalization, quality improvement, and disaster preparedness.","publish_time":"2009-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Iwashyna, Theodore J.; Christie, Jason D.; Kahn, Jeremy M.; Asch, David A.","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a40da6b79aa95e3d5a3b4c490795d765f36f6a1.json; document_parses/pdf_json/02280f4671f272485b91fcba2c5c8955bde6c027.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2692049.xml.json","url":"https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/61909/1/09.I.Christie.Asch.Kahn.09.Chest.pdf; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369209602105; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369209602105; https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.08-1052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19265091/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Medicare"],"locations":["Connecticut"],"keyphrases":["Regionalization of critical care","roles hospitals","tertiary hospitals","secondary hospitals","capable hospitals","cardiac critical care","critical care services","quality of critical care lead","ill patients","standard distinction of hospitals","regional care delivery","neonatal intensive care","ill Medicare patients","network pattern","Network perspectives","technique of network analysis","quality improvement","possible approach","possible solution","incoming transfers","continuum of roles","bed management","pragmatic problems","triage","additional tools","simulation of quarantine","Connecticut","systems","active discussion","observed transfer patterns","severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic","framework","new ways","trauma","disaster preparedness","avoidable deaths","systematic improvements","population health","commentary","Wide variation","model system","following","implications"],"language":"en"},

The pathogenesis of SARS is highly complex, with multiple factors leading to severe injury in the lungs and dissemination of the virus to several other organs. The SARS coronavirus targets the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, resulting in diffuse alveolar damage. Several organs/cell types may be infected in the course of the illness, including mucosal cells of the intestines, tubular epithelial cells of the kidneys, neurons of the brain, and several types of immune cells, and certain organs may suffer from indirect injury. Extensive studies have provided a basic understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease. In this review we describe the most significant pathological features of SARS, explore the etiological factors causing these pathological changes, and discuss the major pathogenetic mechanisms. The latter include dysregulation of cytokines/chemokines, deficiencies in the innate immune response, direct infection of immune cells, direct viral cytopathic effects, down-regulation of lung protective angiotensin converting enzyme 2, autoimmunity, and genetic factors. It seems that both abnormal immune responses and injury to immune cells may be key factors in the pathogenesis of this new disease.","publish_time":"2007-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gu, Jiang; Korteweg, Christine","journal":"The American Journal of Pathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf31e02fc93ca64721215ca7d9eee12f7825d324.json; document_parses/pdf_json/df0141b52b442501005da3c23dd142f20217f142.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1829448.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002944010613296; http://ajp.amjpathol.org/article/S0002944010613296/pdf; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002944010613296","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["types of immune cells","direct infection of immune cells","mucosal cells","pathogenesis of SARS","tubular epithelial cells","severe injury","SARS coronavirus","etiological factors","multiple factors","key factors","genetic factors","innate immune response","abnormal immune responses","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","lower respiratory tract","significant pathological features of SARS","indirect injury","certain organs","new disease","emerging infectious viral disease","severe clinical manifestations","direct viral cytopathic effects","pathological changes","cell types","enzyme","deficiencies","regulation of lung protective angiotensin","autoimmunity","chemokines","kidneys","intestines","basic understanding","lungs","dissemination","brain","neurons","diffuse alveolar damage","Extensive studies","dysregulation of cytokines","major pathogenetic mechanisms","course","illness","review"],"language":"en"},

ABSTRACT: The global HIV epidemic continues to grow, with 1.8 million new infections occurring per year. In the absence of a cure and an AIDS vaccine, there is a pressing need to prevent new infections in order to curb the disease. Topical microbicides that block viral entry into human cells can potentially prevent HIV infection. The antiviral lectin griffithsin has been identified as a highly potent inhibitor of HIV entry into human cells. Here we have explored the possibility to use transplastomic plants as an inexpensive production platform for griffithsin. We show that griffithsin accumulates in stably transformed tobacco chloroplasts to up to 5% of the total soluble protein of the plant. Griffithsin can be easily purified from leaf material and shows similarly high virus neutralization activity as griffithsin protein recombinantly expressed in bacteria. We also show that dried tobacco provides a storable source material for griffithsin purification, thus enabling quick scale-up of production on demand.

The aim of the current study is to bibliometrically analyze the quantity and quality of publications indexed in Scopus from different countries to reveal the characteristics of global research output regarding WNV. METHODS: This study is a bibliometric analysis based on the Scopus database. This study focused on identifying WNV publication trends with regard to publication year, publication type, prolific countries, language of publication, as well as, prolific journals, citations, and collaboration patterns. RESULTS: A total of 4729 publications were considered in this study, which were published between 1943 and 2016. The annual quantity of literature published before 2000 followed a low rate of research growth; while the quantity of publications after 2000 were published in a stage of rapid development. The country with the greatest number of publications in WNV research field was the USA with 2304 (48.7%) publications, followed by France with 224 (4.7%) publications, and Canada with 222 (4.7%) publications. Contributions from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) were considerably small, that is, (n = 519 publications; 11%). All publications related to WNV achieved h-index of 140 and were cited 124,222 times. The median [interquartile range] number of citations per article thus amounts to 9 [2-28]. The USA had the highest h-index of 131. Emerging Infectious Diseases is the most productive journal with 227 articles, followed by Journal of Virology with 162 publications. The result designated that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was ranked the first in terms of publication output, followed by National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases. CONCLUSIONS: There is an obvious trend of WNV research after 2000, and countries with high income have more contributions in WNV research field. The research output is low among LMIC. The USA produced the largest number of publications. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention obtained the leading position of the institutions in terms of publication output. In general, this study not only presents a full view of global WNV research, but also can contribute for future further research in this field.","publish_time":"2017-08-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Jabi, Samah W.","journal":"Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0fd34148f90e726e4ae52896f0c37146a57cbfc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5543434.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-017-0284-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28774315/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WNV","USA","LMIC"],"locations":["France","Canada"],"keyphrases":["quantity of publications","WNV research field","quality of publications","WNV publication trends","greatest number of publications","largest number of publications","view of global WNV research","obvious trend of WNV research","terms of publication output","characteristics of global research output","publication year","publication type","language of publication","low rate of research growth","prolific countries","USA","current study","Emerging Infectious Diseases","middle-income countries","different countries","number of citations","Disease Control","Prevention","Contributions","Zoonotic Infectious Diseases","Centers","LMIC","highest h-index","annual quantity of literature","prolific journals","productive journal","Scopus database","Journal of Virology","regard","National Center","leading position","institutions","interquartile range","bibliometric analysis","West Nile virus","high income","articles","BACKGROUND","collaboration patterns","major public-health problem","median","country","stage of rapid development","mosquito","CONCLUSIONS","aim","METHODS","RESULTS","total","humans","France","Canada","times"],"language":"en"},

Over a period of 30 months, 29 viral respiratory diseases were proven serologically by testing 275 sporadically collected sera from 75 patients with cystic fibrosis. The influenza A virus was the most frequent responsible viral pathogen (11 \u00D7 ), followed by adenovirus (8 \u00D7 ), influenza B virus (5 \u00D7 ), parainfluenza virus type 3 (3 \u00D7 ), parainfluenza virus type 1 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (each of 1 \u00D7 ). There was no serological evidence for infections with parainfluenza virus type 2, Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Coxiella burnetii. Deterioration of the clinical condition was found in 78% of the viral infections leading in 70% to hospital admission. Patients with cystic fibrosis and viral respiratory illnesses showed significantly more admissions to the hospital (3\u00B72 \u00B1 2\u00B77) with a longer stay (90\u00B76 \u00B1 99\u00B76 days). Nearly all viral episodes (93%) were accompanied or followed by a significant change of the microbial flora in the sputum especially by colonisation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae. Seventy-two per cent of the viral infections occurred at home and 28% seemed to be hospital acquired. Our study emphasises the importance of improving antibacterial therapy at home to reduce the number of hospital admissions. Efforts for prophylaxis by vaccination or the use of chemotherapeutic agents should be made for the patients with cystic fibrosis.","publish_time":"1988-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Przyklenk, B.; Bauernfeind, A.; Bertele, R.

Celastrol is a quinone methide triterpene and the most abundant bioactive constituent isolated from the root extracts of T. wilfordii. Previous studies have shown that celastrol exhibits antiviral activity against HIV and SARS-CoV. To date, no investigations of the anti-DENV activity of celastrol have been reported. This work aimed to investigate the anti-DENV effect and possible mechanism of celastrol in vitro and in vivo. Methods A four-serotype DENV infection system was performed to determine the anti-DENV effect of celastrol by detecting DENV RNA replication and protein synthesis. The precise anti-DENV replication mechanism of celastrol was clarified using specific RNA silencing and specific inhibitor. In addition, the therapeutic efficacy of celastrol was evaluated by monitoring survival rates and clinical scores in a DENV-infected Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) suckling mouse model. Results Celastrol inhibited DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4 RNA replication with EC50 values of 0.19 \u00B1 0.09, 0.12 \u00B1 0.11, 0.16 \u00B1 0.14, and 0.17 \u00B1 0.08 \u03BCM, respectively. This antiviral effect of celastrol was associated with celastrol-induced interferon-\u03B1 (IFN-\u03B1) expression and was attenuated by a specific inhibitor of the JAK\u2013STAT signaling pathway downstream of IFN-\u03B1 or specific shRNA. Furthermore, celastrol protected ICR suckling mice against life-threatening DENV infection. Conclusion Celastrol represents a potential anti-DENV agent that induces IFN-\u03B1 expression and stimulates a downstream antiviral response, making the therapy a promising drug or dietary supplement for the treatment of DENV-infected patients.","publish_time":"2017-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Jung-Sheng; Tseng, Chin-Kai; Lin, Chun-Kuang; Hsu, Yao-Chin; Wu, Yu-Hsuan; Hsieh, Ching-Liang; Lee, Jin-Ching","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2a34a9c30330efd835a7597627885b1ca0bae91.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113783.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27847245/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354216304351; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354216304351; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2016.11.010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs0MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["T. wilfordii"],"organizations":["ICR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-DENV effect of celastrol","anti-DENV activity of celastrol","Conclusion Celastrol","Results Celastrol inhibited DENV","treatment of DENV","antiviral effect of celastrol","DENV RNA replication","precise anti-DENV replication mechanism of celastrol","possible mechanism of celastrol","life-threatening DENV infection","therapeutic efficacy of celastrol","potential anti-DENV agent","celastrol-induced interferon-\u03B1","serotype DENV infection system","DENV-infected Institute of Cancer Research","IFN-\u03B1 expression","specific inhibitor","specific RNA silencing","antiviral activity","specific shRNA","downstream antiviral response","ICR suckling mice","infected patients","study Tripterygium wilfordii","suckling mouse model","lei gong teng","therapy","clinical scores","dietary supplement","Thunder of God Vine","monitoring survival rates","root extracts","promising drug","quinone methide triterpene","STAT","HIV","medicinal plant","Celastraceae family","member","JAK","pathway","protein synthesis","investigations","SARS-CoV","Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance","addition","EC50 values","Methods","Previous studies","range of illnesses","date","work","\u03BCM"],"language":"en"},

Phleboviruses are major arthropod\u2010borne viruses (arboviruses) causing disease in humans and other animals globally. Sloths host arboviruses, but virus detections are scarce. A phlebovirus termed Anhanga virus (ANHV) was isolated from a Brazilian Linnaeus\u0027s two\u2010toed sloth (Choloepus didactylus) in 1962. Here, we investigated the presence of phleboviruses in sera sampled in 2014 from 74 Hoffmann\u0027s two\u2010toed (Choloepus hoffmanni, n = 65) and three\u2010toed (Bradypus variegatus, n = 9) sloths in Costa Rica by broadly reactive RT\u2010PCR. A clinically healthy adult Hoffmann\u0027s two\u2010toed sloth was infected with a phlebovirus. Viral load in this animal was high at 8.5 \u00D7 10(7) RNA copies/ml. The full coding sequence of the virus was determined by deep sequencing. Phylogenetic analyses and sequence distance comparisons revealed that the new sloth virus, likely representing a new phlebovirus species, provisionally named Penshurt virus (PEHV), was most closely related to ANHV, with amino acid identities of 93.1%, 84.6%, 94.7% and 89.0% in the translated L, M, N and NSs genes, respectively. Significantly more non\u2010synonymous mutations relative to ANHV occurred in the M gene encoding the viral glycoproteins and in the NSs gene encoding a putative interferon antagonist compared to L and N genes. This was compatible with viral adaptation to different sloth species and with micro\u2010evolutionary processes associated with immune evasion during the genealogy of sloth\u2010associated phleboviruses. However, gene\u2010wide mean dN/dS ratios were low at 0.02\u20130.15 and no sites showed significant evidence for positive selection, pointing to comparable selection pressures within sloth\u2010associated viruses and genetically related phleboviruses infecting hosts other than sloths. The detection of a new phlebovirus closely\u2010related to ANHV, in sloths from Costa Rica fifty years after and more than 3,000 km away from the isolation of ANHV confirmed the host associations of ANHV\u2010related phleboviruses with the two extant species of two\u2010toed sloths.","publish_time":"2019-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Oliveira Filho, Edmilson F.; Moreira\u2010Soto, Andr\u00E9s; Fischer, Carlo; Rasche, Andrea; Sander, Anna\u2010Lena; Avey\u2010Arroyo, Judy; Arroyo\u2010Murillo, Francisco; Corrales\u2010Aguilar, Eugenia; Drexler, Jan Felix","journal":"Transbound Emerg Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0f6969c88dbdd38df41a43456b9d600ac6f60f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168552.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31420970/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13333","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs0ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hoffmann"],"organizations":["ANHV"],"locations":["Costa Rica"],"keyphrases":["toed sloths","new sloth virus","associated phleboviruses","genealogy of sloth","isolation of ANHV","different sloth species","Sloths host arboviruses","new phlebovirus species","host associations of ANHV","virus detections","Penshurt virus","Anhanga virus","presence of phleboviruses","N genes","related phleboviruses infecting hosts","associated viruses","extant species","Costa Rica","viral adaptation","viral glycoproteins","Viral load","NSs genes","positive selection","coding sequence","Choloepus hoffmanni","Choloepus didactylus","comparable selection pressures","sequence distance comparisons","healthy adult Hoffmann\u0027s","micro\u2010evolutionary processes","immune evasion","wide mean dN","dS ratios","putative interferon antagonist","reactive RT","sites","significant evidence","Phylogenetic analyses","disease","non\u2010synonymous mutations relative","major arthropod","Brazilian Linnaeus\u0027s","humans","PCR","amino acid identities","sera","years","RNA copies","Bradypus variegatus","animals","deep sequencing","PEHV","divergent mammals"],"language":"en"},

A total of 145 sera from 120 patients were tested. They were obtained from patients who were serologically positive for M. pneumoniae infection as well as from patients who were infected with micro-organisms that may cause interstitial pneumonia. The following assays were utilized: SeroMP IgM and IgG, SeroMP recombinant IgM, IgA and IgG, Liaison M. pneumoniae IgM and IgG and M. pneumoniae IgM, IgA and IgG ELISA Medac. The SeroMP Recombinant and Liaison assays both showed low IgM specificity, and crossreactivity was mainly observed in groups of patients with acute cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus infections. For IgA, the Medac assay was less specific than the SeroMP Recombinant assay. Discrepancies between the four tests were observed in IgG analyses, and due to the lack of a gold standard, 22 results were removed prior to determining the sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, the overall performance of IgG assays may be overstated; nevertheless, the SeroMP assay demonstrated a lack of sensitivity. The seroprevalence of IgG appears to be very low, raising concerns regarding whether the serological techniques can detect IgG levels over time. Serology remains a biological tool of choice for diagnosing M. pneumoniae infection, but improvement and standardization of the assays are needed, particularly for the determination of IgG.","publish_time":"2013-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Busson, Laurent; Van den Wijngaert, Sigi; Dahma, Hafid; Decolvenaer, Marc; Di Cesare, Lina; Martin, Agnes; Vasseur, Liesbet; Vandenberg, Olivier","journal":"Diagnostic Microbiology and Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fbc2586454df58414b6940edfc78688e5dac5775.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127255.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2013.02.027; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0732889313001235; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732889313001235; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23537789/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs1MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SeroMP Recombinant"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pneumoniae IgM","SeroMP IgM","IgG levels","IgG analyses","seroprevalence of IgG","determination of IgG","SeroMP recombinant IgM","overall performance of IgG assays","SeroMP assay","IgG ELISA Medac","SeroMP Recombinant assay","Liaison assays","serological assays","low IgM specificity","IgA","following assays","diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection","Medac assay","groups of patients","lack of sensitivity","serological techniques","acute cytomegalovirus","Epstein-Barr virus infections","biological tool of choice","improvement","crossreactivity","standardization","Serology","results","gold standard","micro-organisms","study","concerns","tests","time","interstitial pneumonia","Abstract","total","sera","Discrepancies"],"language":"en"},

It is found that economic property of YRD urban agglomerations is the main cause for the ESER system of YRD urban agglomerations being superior. In the current YRD urban agglomerations\u2019 ESER system, energy intensity cannot be adjusted to an ideal level by commercialization management and government control; however, it is under effective control of carbon tax incentives.

The fractionated plasma proteins were subjected to 2D-DIGE with highly sensitive fluorescent dyes. The quantitative protein expression profiles obtained by 2D-DIGE were compared between two plasma protein mixtures: one from five non-cancer bearing healthy donors and the other from five patients with pancreatic cancer. Among 1200 protein spots, we found that 33 protein spots were differently expressed between the two mixtures; 27 of these were up-regulated and six were down-regulated in cancer. Mass spectrometry and database searching allowed the identification of the proteins corresponding to the gel spots. Up-regulation of leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein (LRG), which has not previously been implicated in pancreatic cancer, was observed. Western blotting with an anti-LRG antibody validated the up-regulation of LRG in an independent series of plasma samples from healthy controls, patients with chronic pancreatitis, and patients with pancreatic cancer. Our results demonstrate the application of a combination of multi-dimensional liquid chromatography with 2D-DIGE for plasma proteomics and suggest the clinical utility of LRG plasma level measurement.","publish_time":"2007-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kakisaka, Tatsuhiko; Kondo, Tadashi; Okano, Tetsuya; Fujii, Kiyonaga; Honda, Kazufumi; Endo, Mitsufumi; Tsuchida, Akihiko; Aoki, Tatsuya; Itoi, Takao; Moriyasu, Fuminori; Yamada, Tesshi; Kato, Harubumi; Nishimura, Toshihide; Todo, Satoru; Hirohashi, Setsuo","journal":"J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/807f24b771a8b42b94e53fed83df97a437cdb874.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105233.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1570023207000736; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570023207000736","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs1MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LRG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pancreatic cancer","plasma protein mixtures","patients","plasma proteomics","fractionated plasma proteins","High-abundance plasma proteins","aberrant expression of plasma proteins","non-cancer","protein spots","D-DIGE","regulation of LRG","independent series of plasma samples","clinical utility of LRG plasma level measurement","anti-LRG antibody","quantitative protein expression profiles","gel spots","healthy controls","healthy donors","rich alpha","regulation of leucine","low-abundance ones","anion-exchange chromatography","combination of multi-dimensional liquid chromatography","albumin","chronic pancreatitis","transferrin","immuno-affinity column","fractions","haptoglobin","use","application","Western blotting","sensitive fluorescent dyes","database","IgA","IgG","identification","glycoprotein","Mass spectrometry","results"],"language":"en"},

They are cleaved off upon the passenger protein reaching its destination. The explosive growth in sequencing technologies has led to the deposition of vast numbers of protein sequences necessitating rapid functional annotation techniques, with subcellular localization being a key feature. Of the myriad software prediction tools developed to automate the task of assigning the SP cleavage site of these new sequences, we review here, the performance and reliability of commonly used SP prediction tools. RESULTS: The available signal peptide data has been manually curated and organized into three datasets representing eukaryotes, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. These datasets are used to evaluate thirteen prediction tools that are publicly available. SignalP (both the HMM and ANN versions) maintains consistency and achieves the best overall accuracy in all three benchmarking experiments, ranging from 0.872 to 0.914 although other prediction tools are narrowing the performance gap. CONCLUSION: The majority of the tools evaluated in this study encounter no difficulty in discriminating between secretory and non-secretory proteins. The challenge clearly remains with pinpointing the correct SP cleavage site. The composite scoring schemes employed by SignalP may help to explain its accuracy. Prediction task is divided into a number of separate steps, thus allowing each score to tackle a particular aspect of the prediction.","publish_time":"2009-12-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choo, Khar Heng; Tan, Tin Wee; Ranganathan, Shoba","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3799479a8ad2b8db9f21c68f88dfae6410d0fed0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2788353.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19958512/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-10-s15-s2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["used SP prediction tools","Prediction task","myriad software prediction tools","correct SP cleavage site","targeting of secretory proteins","non-secretory proteins","SignalP","datasets","correct subcellular compartments","subcellular localization","new sequences","passenger protein","available signal peptide data","performance gap","deposition of vast numbers of protein sequences","best overall accuracy","Amino-terminal signal peptides","rapid functional annotation techniques","SPs","discriminating","consistency","short regions","reliability","score","sequencing technologies","eukaryotes","BACKGROUND","difficulty","RESULTS","Gram-negative bacteria","benchmarking experiments","number of separate steps","explosive growth","composite scoring schemes","key feature","study","particular aspect","ANN versions","destination","CONCLUSION","majority","challenge"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of all confirmed MERS-CoV infections from March 2014 to May 2014 at two tertiary care hospitals in Al-Madinah region (Saudi Arabia). We gathered data about demographic, clinical presentation, and factors associated with severity and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 29 cases were identified; 20 males (69%) and nine females (31%), age 45 \u00B1 12 years. The death rate was higher for men (52%) than for women (23%). Initial presentation was fever in 22 (75%) cases, cough in 20 (69%) cases, and shortness of breath in 20 (69%) cases. Associated comorbidities were diabetes mellitus in nine (31%) patients and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in eight (27%) patients. Duration of symptoms before hospitalization ranged from 2.9 days to 5 days. Elevated liver enzymes were present in 14 (50%) patients and impaired renal profile present in eight (27%) patients. We also describe in this study radiological patterns and factors associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: MERS-CoV infection transmission continues to occur as clusters in healthcare facilities. The frequency of cases and deaths is higher among men than women and among patients with comorbidities.","publish_time":"2016-06-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sherbini, Nahid; Iskandrani, Ayman; Kharaba, Ayman; Khalid, Ghalilah; Abduljawad, Mohammed; AL-Jahdali, Hamdan","journal":"J Epidemiol Glob Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c2eb211a5031820b92fe4b307796f4a762014d1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104069.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210600615300927; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jegh.2016.05.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27302882/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210600615300927","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS","Associated"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["outcome of MERS infected patients","frequency of cases","MERS-CoV infection transmission","clinical presentation","Associated comorbidities","confirmed MERS-CoV infections","clinical characteristics","factors","high mortality rate","retrospective study","women","days","study radiological patterns","wide spectrum of clinical features","emerging virus respiratory infection","death rate","Initial presentation","impaired renal profile present","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Al-Madinah region","BACKGROUND","deaths","tertiary care hospitals","Saudi Arabia","clusters","CKD","chronic kidney disease","demographic","CONCLUSION","hospitalization","Elevated liver enzymes","diabetes mellitus","data","severity","Duration of symptoms","age","healthcare facilities","fever","METHODS","RESULTS","total","shortness of breath","females","years","cough"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we generated by fusion PCR a vector to express high levels of chimeric secretory IgD (csIgD) specifically in the liver. We then generated seven founder lines of transgenic mice by co-microinjection, and verified them using genomic PCR and Southern blotting. We detected the expression of csIgD by reverse transcription PCR, quantitative PCR, western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. We demonstrated that csIgD could be specifically and stably expressed in the liver. We used flow cytometry to show that overexpression of csIgD in the bone marrow and spleen cells had no effect on B cell development. Morphologic and anatomical observation of the transgenic mice revealed skin damage, hepatosplenomegaly, and nephromegaly in some transgenic mice; in these mice, pathological sections showed high levels of cell necrosis and protein-like sediments in the liver, spleen, and kidney. We demonstrated that the genomic insertion sites of the transgenes did not disrupt the MVK gene on mouse chromosome 5. This transgenic mouse will be useful to explore the pathogenesis of HIDS.","publish_time":"2012-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Ping; Wei, ZhiGuo; Yan, BoWen; Huang, Tan; Gou, KeMian; Dai, YunPing; Zheng, Min; Wang, MeiLi; Cheng, XueQian; Wang, XiFeng; Xu, Chen; Sun, Yi","journal":"Sci China Life Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3cca3d66fd6ef068573a246a76360a9e574cad1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22527518/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11427-012-4301-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genomic PCR","transgenic mouse","liver","quantitative PCR","fusion PCR","founder lines of transgenic mice","overexpression of csIgD","reverse transcription PCR","pathogenesis of HIDS","high levels of cell necrosis","clinical features of HIDS","high levels of chimeric secretory IgD","western blotting","spleen cells","Southern blotting","MVK gene","mouse chromosome","B cell development","genomic insertion sites","elevated serum immunoglobulin D","cases of hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome","effect","protein","pathological sections","bone marrow","relationship","transgenes","sediments","vector","co-microinjection","hepatosplenomegaly","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays","anatomical observation","skin damage","account","recurrent fever","mechanism","Mutation of mevalonate kinase","flow cytometry","study","kidney"],"language":"en"},

Here we report the isolation and genetic and pathogenic characterization of a novel MRV type 3 (MRV3), named MRV-ZJ2013, from the diarrheic feces of piglets in Zhejiang province, China. Genomic and phylogenetic analysis shows that MRV-ZJ2013 may have originated from reassortments among mink, bat, and pig MRVs, suggesting the hypothesis that interspecies transmission has occurred in pig herds. Neonatal piglets infected with MRV-ZJ2013 displayed mild clinical signs such as poor appetite and soft feces, but vomiting and diarrhea were not observed. Fecal virus shedding was detected only in three out of six piglets, each for one- or two-day post-infection. In contrast, piglets inoculated with a virulent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) strain as the control group had severe signs characterized by acute vomiting and watery diarrhea. These findings suggest that the virulence of MRV-ZJ2013, if any, was likely not significant compared to that of PEDV. A seroepidemiological survey of MRV by means of an indirect enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA) based on a recombinant MRV3 capsid protein sigma1 as antigen revealed a high seroprevalence (77%) in 1037 samples from diarrheic pigs of different ages from 24 herds in seven provinces of east China between 2015 and 2016, indicating that MRV3 is endemic in pig herds in China, and may contribute collectively to enteric disease along with other porcine pathogens.","publish_time":"2017-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qin, Pan; Li, Huan; Wang, Jing-Wei; Wang, Bin; Xie, Rong-Hui; Xu, Hui; Zhao, Ling-Yan; Li, Long; Pan, Yongfei; Song, Yanhua; Huang, Yao-Wei","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc0959eb5a34d038380f72b0f21ecd8361b17cc1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117289.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28888627/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.07.021; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113517303917; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113517303917","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs3MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["MRV-ZJ2013","virulence of MRV","pig herds","novel MRV type","diarrheic feces of piglets","seroepidemiological survey of MRV","pig MRVs","Neonatal piglets","PEDV","watery diarrhea","virulent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","provinces of east China","severe signs","diarrheic pigs of different ages","soft feces","porcine pathogens","acute vomiting","recombinant MRV3 capsid protein sigma1","mild clinical signs","Abstract Mammalian orthoreoviruses","Fecal virus shedding","wide variety of mammalian species","antigen","bats","strain","poor appetite","pathogenic characterization","control group","ELISA","minks","Zhejiang province","immune-sorbent assay","indirect enzyme","interspecies transmission","samples","hypothesis","phylogenetic analysis","high seroprevalence","isolation","enteric disease","humans","reassortments","two-day post-infection","respiratory illness","contrast","findings"],"language":"en"},

Although these have diminished the risk of disease transmission, there are additional steps that could be taken to prevent another blood-borne viral epidemic. A new Office of Blood Product Safety (OBPS) might be established within the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to communicate information on the safety and availability of blood and blood products to the public and health care professionals. Furthermore, the costs of collection, processing, and distribution of blood for transfusion should be borne by the public, not individual patients. Another recommendation is to establish an Office for the Control of Pharmaceutical Prices (COPP) within the Department of Health and Human Services to set caps on the prices of blood products, essential drugs, and medical devices.

Viral genome sequences can also inform on likely phenotypes including drug susceptibility or neutralization serotypes. In this study, different variables of the laboratory methods often used to generate viral metagenomics libraries on the efficiency of viral detection and virus genome coverage were compared. A biological reagent consisting of 25 different human RNA and DNA viral pathogens was used to estimate the effect of filtration and nuclease digestion, DNA/RNA extraction methods, pre-amplification and the use of different library preparation kits on the detection of viral nucleic acids. Filtration and nuclease treatment led to slight decreases in the percentage of viral sequence reads and number of viruses detected. For nucleic acid extractions silica spin columns improved viral sequence recovery relative to magnetic beads and Trizol extraction. Pre-amplification using random RT-PCR while generating more viral sequence reads resulted in detection of fewer viruses, more overlapping sequences, and lower genome coverage. The ScriptSeq library preparation method retrieved more viruses and a greater fraction of their genomes than the TruSeq and Nextera methods. Viral metagenomics sequencing was able to simultaneously detect up to 22 different viruses in the biological reagent analyzed including all those detected by qPCR. Further optimization will be required for the detection of viruses in biologically more complex samples such as tissues, blood, or feces.","publish_time":"2015-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Linlin; Deng, Xutao; Mee, Edward T.; Collot-Teixeira, Sophie; Anderson, Rob; Schepelmann, Silke; Minor, Philip D.; Delwart, Eric","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3007130618efe9e8e818751f03f9c8ab57446b72.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5ef04a13e99d347f738debb9d8683ff70abe52bb.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8691f1056401814c593a3626fe9891ef95a411a7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4344864.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25497414/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093414004613; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4344864?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2014.12.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093414004613","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs3OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Nextera"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["efficiency of viral detection","Viral genome sequences","detection of viral nucleic acids","detection of viruses","percentage of viral sequence","Viral metagenomics sequencing","different viruses","DNA viral pathogens","viral metagenomics libraries","viral sequence recovery relative","detection of fewer viruses","simultaneous detection","number of viruses","different variables","different human RNA","RNA extraction methods","pre-amplification","use of different library preparation kits","laboratory methods","Nextera methods","virus genome coverage","lower genome coverage","biological reagent","nuclease digestion","overlapping sequences","Trizol extraction","ScriptSeq library preparation method","nuclease treatment","complex samples","clinical samples","effect of filtration","nucleic acid extractions silica spin columns","Unbiased metagenomic sequencing","magnetic beads","significant potential","likely phenotypes","slight decreases","diagnostic tool","drug susceptibility","genomes","random RT-PCR","neutralization serotypes","tissues","blood","TruSeq","greater fraction","study","feces","optimization","qPCR"],"language":"en"},

Effective prognostication would be beneficial in managing this disease. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the occurrence of leukocytopenias at admission and at 24 and 48 hours after admission, and changes in absolute leukocyte counts over time, could be used to predict outcome. Animals: Sixty\u2010two puppies with confirmed CPV. Methods: A prospective study was performed. CBC was performed daily until discharge or death (in which case a postmortem examination was performed). Results: Of the nonsurvivors (10/62; 16%), 9 died because of complications of the disease and 1 was euthanized because of a poor prognosis. There was a statistical significant difference in the occurrence of leukocytopenias between groups at 24 and 48 hours postadmission. The survivors showed a significant increase over time in certain leukocyte types (specifically lymphocytes) compared with values at admission. The positive predictive value for survivors was high. Nonsurvivors had marked thymic and lymphoid atrophy and marked bone marrow hypocellularity. Conclusion: An accurate prognosis could be obtained at 24 hours after admission by evaluating the change in total leukocyte, band neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, and eosinophil counts.","publish_time":"2008-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goddard, A.; Leisewitz, A.L.; Christopher, M.M.; Duncan, N.M.; Becker, P.J.","journal":"J Vet Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/15e59ab2f9541e4474afa2bdebe831454cd86ab9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166684.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18371025/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1939-1676.2008.0073.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs4ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CPV","CBC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["total leukocyte","absolute leukocyte","time","occurrence of leukocytopenias","complications","hours postadmission","nonsurvivors","disease","certain leukocyte types","significant increase","confirmed CPV","eosinophil counts","accurate prognosis","poor prognosis","statistical significant difference","marked bone marrow hypocellularity","lymphoid atrophy","band neutrophil","monocyte","lymphocytes","changes","positive predictive value","canine parvoviral","groups","dogs","Animals","puppies","enteritis","discharge","death","Methods","prospective study","Effective prognostication","Background","treatment","Conclusion","values","postmortem examination","CBC","Results","Hypothesis","outcome"],"language":"en"},

Comparative metagenomic analysis of human and non-human primate (NHP) microbiomes offers a promising approach to study this symbiosis. Very few microbial species have been characterized in NHP microbiomes due to their poor representation in the available cataloged microbial diversity, thus limiting the potential of such comparative approaches. RESULTS: We reconstruct over 1000 previously uncharacterized microbial species from 6 available NHP metagenomic cohorts, resulting in an increase of the mappable fraction of metagenomic reads by 600%. These novel species highlight that almost 90% of the microbial diversity associated with NHPs has been overlooked. Comparative analysis of this new catalog of taxa with the collection of over 150,000 genomes from human metagenomes points at a limited species-level overlap, with only 20% of microbial candidate species in NHPs also found in the human microbiome. This overlap occurs mainly between NHPs and non-Westernized human populations and NHPs living in captivity, suggesting that host lifestyle plays a role comparable to host speciation in shaping the primate intestinal microbiome. Several NHP-specific species are phylogenetically related to human-associated microbes, such as Elusimicrobia and Treponema, and could be the consequence of host-dependent evolutionary trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: The newly reconstructed species greatly expand the microbial diversity associated with NHPs, thus enabling better interrogation of the primate microbiome and empowering in-depth human and non-human comparative and co-diversification studies.","publish_time":"2019-12-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Manara, Serena; Asnicar, Francesco; Beghini, Francesco; Bazzani, Davide; Cumbo, Fabio; Zolfo, Moreno; Nigro, Eleonora; Karcher, Nicolai; Manghi, Paolo; Metzger, Marisa Isabell; Pasolli, Edoardo; Segata, Nicola","journal":"Genome Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e633cc8cbce07eacd478bb25aa824872ad55c59d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6935492.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31883524/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1923-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human microbiome","non-human comparative","non-human primate","NHPs","uncharacterized microbial species","microbial candidate species","Comparative metagenomic analysis of human","human-associated microbes","NHP-specific species","microbial communities","reconstructed species","novel species","empowering in-depth human","human metagenomes points","non-Westernized human populations","primate microbiome","available cataloged microbial diversity","NHP microbiomes","Comparative analysis","limited species-level overlap","primate intestinal microbiome","available NHP metagenomic cohorts","comparative approaches","host speciation","consequence of host","host lifestyle","mappable fraction of metagenomic","better interrogation","better understanding","poor representation","co-diversification studies","collection","increase","role comparable","captivity","new catalog of taxa","dependent evolutionary trajectories","promising approach","potential","Treponema","Elusimicrobia","Humans","advantageous relationship","symbiosis","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Thus, many compounds that may cause the death of viruses are also very likely to injure the host cell that harbours them. Natural products are increasingly appreciated as leads for drug discovery and development. Screening studies have been carried out in order to find antiviral agents from natural sources, and the occurrence of antiviral activity in extracts of plants, marine organisms and fungi is frequent. The evidence indicates that there may be numerous potentially useful antiviral phytochemicals in nature, waiting to be evaluated and exploited. In addition, other plants, not previously utilized medicinally, may also reveal antivirals.

The effect of asymptomatic viral infection on the dynamics of bacterial density and colonization of the nasopharynx has not been reported. The current study was performed to assess the presence and density of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis in the nasopharynx of 4\u20137-year-old children during URTI and when well. METHODS: Nasal samples were obtained during 4 surveillance periods when children were asymptomatic and whenever they had symptoms of URTI. Respiratory viruses and bacterial pathogens were identified and quantified using polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The proportion of children colonized with all 3 bacteria was higher during visits for acute URTI than during asymptomatic surveillance visits. Mean bacterial densities were significantly higher at all visits for all 3 pathogens when a virus was detected. The differences between the means were 1.0, 0.4, and 0.7 log(10) colony-forming unit equivalents per milliliter for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis, respectively, compared with visits in which virus was not detected. The percentage of children colonized and density were also higher at asymptomatic visits in which virus was detected than at visits in which virus was not detected. CONCLUSION: The density and frequency of colonization with S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis in nasal wash samples increase during periods of both symptomatic and asymptomatic viral infection. Increases in bacterial colonization observed during asymptomatic viral infection were nearly the same magnitude as when children were symptomatic.","publish_time":"2017-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"DeMuri, Gregory P; Gern, James E; Eickhoff, Jens C; Lynch, Susan V; Wald, Ellen R","journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b073cda95dea79db6973f9c1f84d4860f3bddf0e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6019034.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cix941; https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-pdf/66/7/1045/25418773/cix941.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29121208/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs0MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Moraxella","S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["URTI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asymptomatic children","asymptomatic visits","asymptomatic surveillance visits","year-old children","proportion of children","percentage of children","effect of asymptomatic viral infection","bacterial colonization","dynamics of bacterial density","bacterial pathogens","nasopharynx","density of Streptococcus pneumoniae","bacterial densities","Haemophilus influenzae","surveillance periods","Nasal samples","frequency of colonization","acute URTI","Moraxella catarrhalis","symptoms of URTI","nasal wash samples","Respiratory viruses","upper respiratory tract infections","milliliter","URTIs","colony","unit equivalents","presence","magnitude","polymerase chain reaction","means","log","CONCLUSION","METHODS","RESULTS","current study","differences","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Networks are useful for representing a wide range of complex interactions ranging from those between molecular biomarkers, neurons, and microbial communities, to those found in human or animal populations. Recent technological advances have resulted in an increasing amount of healthcare data in multiple modalities, increasing the preponderance of network inference problems. Multi-domain data can now be used to improve the robustness and reliability of recovered networks from unimodal data. For infectious diseases in particular, there is a body of knowledge that has been focused on combining multiple pieces of linked information. Combining or analyzing disparate modalities in concert has demonstrated greater insight into disease transmission than could be obtained from any single modality in isolation. This has been particularly helpful in understanding incidence and transmission at early stages of infections that have pandemic potential. Novel pieces of linked information in the form of spatial, temporal, and other covariates including high-throughput sequence data, clinical visits, social network information, pharmaceutical prescriptions, and clinical symptoms (reported as free-text data) also encourage further investigation of these methods. The purpose of this review is to provide an in-depth analysis of multimodal infectious disease transmission network inference methods with a specific focus on Bayesian inference. We focus on analytical Bayesian inference-based methods as this enables recovering multiple parameters simultaneously, for example, not just the disease transmission network, but also parameters of epidemic dynamics. Our review studies their assumptions, key inference parameters and limitations, and ultimately provides insights about improving future network inference methods in multiple applications.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ray, Bisakha; Ghedin, Elodie; Chunara, Rumi","journal":"Journal of Biomedical Informatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05c54cf28f0dddde77a35f831f28110dae65fc4d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106161.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2016.09.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046416301162; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27612975/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1532046416301162","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs0Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["future network inference methods","multiple parameters","preponderance of network inference problems","key inference parameters","multiple modalities","Abstract Networks inference problems","in-depth analysis of multimodal infectious disease transmission network inference methods","social network information","analytical Bayesian inference-based methods","multiple applications","multiple pieces of linked information","unimodal data","healthcare data","multiple biomedical subfields","free-text data","Multi-domain data","high-throughput sequence data","Novel pieces of linked information","reliability of recovered networks","parameters of epidemic dynamics","clinical visits","clinical symptoms","specific focus","disparate modalities","review studies","infectious diseases","pharmaceutical prescriptions","early stages of infections","covariates","assumptions","greater insight","metagenomics","molecular biomarkers","understanding incidence","concert","form of spatial","limitations","insights","wide range of complex interactions","microbial communities","neurons","temporal","example","pandemic potential","human","neuroscience","robustness","investigation","Recent technological advances","single modality","isolation","animal populations","epidemiology","body of knowledge","purpose"],"language":"en"},

In early \u2013 but not in later \u2013 stages, dying oligodendrocytes express activated caspase 3, suggesting a switch from classical apoptotic pathways to caspase 3-independent mechanisms during the course of the cuprizone diet. The expression level of FAS in the corpus callosum, a cell death receptor crucial for oligodendroglial cell death in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), correlates with the expression of activated caspase 3 in oligodendrocytes. However, mice lacking FAS in oligodendrocytes are not protected against cuprizone-induced oligodendroglial cell death, showing that FAS is dispensable for oligodendroglial cell death in the cuprizone model.","publish_time":"2010-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hesse, Amke; Wagner, Michael; Held, Jasmin; Br\u00FCck, Wolfgang; Salinas-Riester, Gabriela; Hao, Zhenyue; Waisman, Ari; Kuhlmann, Tanja","journal":"Neurobiology of Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/80c830ed24c9a0c0fc6d251f745abf69dacb30f3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127175.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbd.2009.10.016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969996109003027; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0969996109003027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19853662/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs0OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cuprizone-induced oligodendroglial cell death","Abstract Oligodendroglial cell death","cell death receptor crucial","cuprizone diet","oligodendrocytes","toxic demyelination cuprizone model","expression of activated caspase","expression level of FAS","demyelinating diseases","neurological diseases","independent mechanisms","underlying mechanisms","corpus callosum","experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","downregulation of myelin genes","frequent phenomenon","initiation","days","EAE","correlates","switch","classical apoptotic pathways","weeks","multiple sclerosis","course","stages","mice"],"language":"en"},

The cases had many similarities, including a history of diarrhea and sudden death, abomasitis, and hemorrhagic enteritis. In both cases, anaerobic cultures of abomasum yielded heavy growth of C. perfringens genotype E. Four percent of \u003E 1000 strains of C. perfringens from cases of enteritis in domestic animals were type E, and all (n=45) were from neonatal calves with hemorrhagic enteritis. Furthermore, type E isolates represented nearly 50% of all isolates submitted from similar clinical cases in calves.

Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus belongs to the family Coronaviridae; genus Coronavirus; and species Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV). Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus causes two distinct syndromes; one is known as vomiting and wasting disease, and the other involves encephalomyelitis. The hosts of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus are pigs. Vomiting and wasting disease and encephalomyelitis were initially reported as two separate diseases in Canada in the late 1950s. Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus was isolated in 1962, and the common etiology of the two syndromes was shown in 1969. The diagnostic techniques for porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus are virus neutralisation (VN) and agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID).","publish_time":"1983-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"ODEND\u0027HAL, STEWART","journal":"The Geographical Distribution of Animal Viral Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/317a6d4a8c37dcf0368b0a7b088db68fc2891a95.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150334.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B978012524180950087X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012524180950087X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["hosts of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus","species Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus","virus neutralisation","diagnostic techniques","diagnostic reagents","vomiting","distinct syndromes","VN","genus Coronavirus","key developments","family Coronaviridae","overview","classification","agar gel immunodiffusion","description","HEV","chapter","pigs","separate diseases","Canada","Publisher Summary","AGID","common etiology"],"language":"en"},

Preliminary IRT imaging demonstrated that foot temperatures increased in FMDV-infected animals. The maximum foot temperatures of healthy (n =53), directly inoculated (DI) (n =12), contact (CT) (n =6), and vaccine trial (VT) (n =21) cattle were measured over the course of FMD infection. A cut-off value was established at 34.4\u00B0C (sensitivity=61.1%, specificity=87.7%) with the aim of detecting FMDV-infected animals both before and after clinical signs were observed. Seven of 12 (58%) DI and 3/6 (50%) CT animals showed maximum foot temperatures exceeding the 34.4\u00B0C cut-off before the development of foot vesicles. In contrast, only 5/21 (24%) VT animals displayed pre-clinical foot temperatures above this cut-off possibly indicating partial vaccine protection of this group. These results show IRT as a promising screening technology to quickly identify potentially infected animals for confirmatory diagnostic testing during FMD outbreaks. Further evaluation of this technology is needed to determine the value of IRT in detecting animals with mild clinical signs or sub-clinical infections.","publish_time":"2009-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rainwater-Lovett, Kaitlin; Pacheco, Juan M.; Packer, Craig; Rodriguez, Luis L.","journal":"The Veterinary Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6cc72a73b9f477fdff266f2d74f612132698143e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110760.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2008.01.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18308596/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023308000129; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023308000129","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FMD","DI","CT","IRT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FMDV-infected animals","pre-clinical foot temperatures","VT animals","CT animals","development of clinical signs","maximum foot temperatures of healthy","development of foot vesicles","mild clinical signs","infected cattle","value of IRT","C cut-off","cut-off value","sub-clinical infections","Preliminary IRT imaging","FMD outbreaks","vaccine trial","partial vaccine protection","promising screening technology","course of FMD infection","confirmatory diagnostic testing","mouth disease virus","study","infrared thermography","Abstract","group","results","contact","aim","sensitivity","means","specificity","evaluation","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Arteriviruses and coronaviruses, distantly related members of the nidovirus order, employ a unique mechanism of discontinuous minus-strand RNA synthesis to generate subgenome-length templates for the synthesis of a nested set of sg mRNAs. Non-structural protein 1 (nsp1) of the arterivirus equine arteritis virus (EAV), a multifunctional regulator of viral RNA synthesis and virion biogenesis, was previously implicated in controlling the balance between genome replication and sg mRNA synthesis. Here, we employed reverse and forward genetics to gain insight into the multiple regulatory roles of nsp1. Our analysis revealed that the relative abundance of viral mRNAs is tightly controlled by an intricate network of interactions involving all nsp1 subdomains. Distinct nsp1 mutations affected the quantitative balance among viral mRNA species, and our data implicate nsp1 in controlling the accumulation of full-length and subgenome-length minus-strand templates for viral mRNA synthesis. The moderate differential changes in viral mRNA abundance of nsp1 mutants resulted in similarly altered viral protein levels, but progeny virus yields were greatly reduced. Pseudorevertant analysis provided compelling genetic evidence that balanced EAV mRNA accumulation is critical for efficient virus production. This first report on protein-mediated, mRNA-specific control of nidovirus RNA synthesis reveals the existence of an integral control mechanism to fine-tune replication, sg mRNA synthesis, and virus production, and establishes a major role for nsp1 in coordinating the arterivirus replicative cycle.","publish_time":"2010-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nedialkova, Danny D.; Gorbalenya, Alexander E.; Snijder, Eric J.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3568da162b8d9f5356c9264193b6292efa3d9556.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2824749.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000772; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20174607/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral mRNA synthesis","sg mRNA synthesis","viral mRNA species","viral mRNA abundance of nsp1 mutants","genomic mRNA","synthesis of subgenomic","mRNA-specific control of nidovirus RNA synthesis","multifunctional regulator of viral RNA synthesis","nsp1 subdomains","viral protein levels","balanced EAV mRNA accumulation","unique mechanism of discontinuous minus-strand RNA synthesis","relative abundance of viral mRNAs","Distinct nsp1 mutations","strand RNA viruses","strand templates","genome replication","multiple regulatory roles of nsp1","efficient virus production","nested set of sg mRNAs","subgenome-length templates","arterivirus equine arteritis virus","progeny virus yields","Non-structural protein","integral control mechanism","accumulation of full-length","quantitative balance","polycistronic genome","nidovirus order","Pseudorevertant analysis","arterivirus replicative cycle","compelling genetic evidence","insight","existence","moderate differential changes","related members","translation","data","virion biogenesis","intricate network of interactions","major role","forward genetics","gene expression","reverse","Arteriviruses","coronaviruses","report"],"language":"en"},

We have recently shown that PCV2 induces nuclear factor kappa B activation and its activation is required for active replication, but the other cellular factors involved in PCV2 replication are not well defined. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) which served as an important component of cellular signal transduction pathways has been shown to regulate many viral infections. In this report, we show that PCV2 activates ERK1/2 in PCV2-infected PK15 cells dependent on viral replication. The PCV2-induced ERK1/2 leads to phosphorylation of the ternary complex factor Elk-1, which kinetically paralleled ERK1/2 activation. Inhibition of ERK activation with U0126, a specific MEK1/2 inhibitor, significantly reduced viral progeny release. Investigations into the mechanism of ERK1/2 regulation revealed that inhibition of ERK activation leads to decreased viral transcription and lower virus protein expression.

We examined the expression of these novel components of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and the production and vasoactive effects of angiotensin-(1\u20137) in the bile duct ligated (BDL) rat. Methods BDL or sham-operated rats were sacrificed at 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks. Tissue and blood were collected for gene expression, enzyme activity and peptide measurements. In situ perfused livers were used to assess angiotensin peptide production and their effects on portal resistance. Results Hepatic ACE2 gene and activity (P \u003C0.0005), plasma angiotensin-(1\u20137) (P \u003C0.0005) and Mas receptor expression (P \u003C0.01) were increased following BDL compared to shams.

The 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) highlighted the potentially lethal consequences of CoV-induced disease in humans. In 2012, a novel CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus; MERS-CoV) emerged, causing 49 human cases thus far, of which 23 had a fatal outcome. In this study, we characterized MERS-CoV replication and cytotoxicity in human and monkey cell lines. Electron microscopy of infected Vero cells revealed extensive membrane rearrangements, including the formation of double-membrane vesicles and convoluted membranes, which have been implicated previously in the RNA synthesis of SARS-CoV and other CoVs. Following infection, we observed rapidly increasing viral RNA synthesis and release of high titres of infectious progeny, followed by a pronounced cytopathology. These characteristics were used to develop an assay for antiviral compound screening in 96-well format, which was used to identify cyclosporin A as an inhibitor of MERS-CoV replication in cell culture. Furthermore, MERS-CoV was found to be 50\u2013100 times more sensitive to alpha interferon (IFN-\u03B1) treatment than SARS-CoV, an observation that may have important implications for the treatment of MERS-CoV-infected patients. MERS-CoV infection did not prevent the IFN-induced nuclear translocation of phosphorylated STAT1, in contrast to infection with SARS-CoV where this block inhibits the expression of antiviral genes. These findings highlight relevant differences between these distantly related zoonotic CoVs in terms of their interaction with and evasion of the cellular innate immune response.","publish_time":"2013-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Wilde, Adriaan H.; Raj, V.

Structural and biochemical studies have revealed that all confirmed 3CLpro cleavage sites have a conserved Gln residue at the P1 position, which is thought to be absolutely required for efficient cleavage. Recent studies on murine hepatitis virus (MHV) showed that processing of the 1a polyprotein at the position between nsp10\u2013nsp11 is essential for viral replication. In this report, we investigated the requirement of processing at the equivalent position for replication of avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), using an infectious cloning system. The results showed that mutation of the P1 Gln to Pro or deletion of the Gln residue in the nsp10\u2013nsp11/12 site completely abolished the 3CLpro-mediated processing, but allowed production of infectious recombinant viruses with variable degrees of growth defect, suggesting that cleavage at the nsp10\u2013nsp11/12 site of IBV is dispensable for viral replication in cultured cells. This study would pave a way for potential vaccine development by generation of attenuated IBV from field isolates through manipulation of the nsp10\u2013nsp11/12 cleavage site. Similar approaches would be also applicable to other human and animal coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2008-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fang, Shou Guo; Shen, Hongyuan; Wang, Jibin; Tay, Felicia P.L.; Liu, Ding Xiang","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8146ed36d59c3b04822ecf1862bdf6cb9bcbcaf2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103401.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682208004340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18678384/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2008.06.038; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682208004340","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nsp10","nsp11","viral replication","site of IBV","CLpro-mediated processing","CLpro cleavage sites","P1 Gln","P1 position","extensive processing","requirement of processing","efficient cleavage","replication of avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus","conserved Gln residue","equivalent position","generation of attenuated IBV","viral life cycle","infectious cloning system","production of infectious recombinant viruses","Abstract Coronavirus","Recent studies","biochemical studies","murine hepatitis virus","potential vaccine development","variable degrees of growth defect","important roles","field isolates","manipulation","non-structural proteins","way","proteinase","MHV","deletion","nsp5","polyproteins","mutation","cultured cells","animal coronaviruses","nsp16","Similar approaches","study","results","report"],"language":"en"},

Domestic and mainly wild animals such as bats, small rodents and birds are highly diversified animals in relation to their habitats and ecological niches and are widely distributed geographically in environments of forest fragmentation in some areas of the Amazon, being considered important sources for viruses that affect humans and other animals. Due to the anthropical activities, these animals changed their natural habitat and adapted to urbanized environments, thus representing risks to human and animal health. Although the knowledge of the global diversity of enteric viruses is scarce, there are reports demonstrating the detection of rotavirus in domestic animals and animals of productive systems, such as bovines and pigs. The present study investigated the prevalence of Rotavirus A in 648 fecal samples of different animal species from the northeastern mesoregion of the state of Par\u00E1, Brazil, which is characterized as an urbanized area with forest fragments. The fecal specimens were collected from October 2014 to April 2016 and subjected to a Qualitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR), using the NSP3 gene as a target. It was observed that 27.5% (178/648) of the samples presented positive results for RVA, with 178 samples distributed in birds (23.6%), canines (21.35%), chiropterans (17.98%), bovines (14.6%), horses (8.43%), small rodents (6.74%), pigs (3.93%) and felines (3.37%), demonstrating the circulation of RVA in domestic animals and suggesting that such proximity could cause transmissions between different species and the occurrence of rearrangements in the genome of RVA as already described in the literature, associated to the traces of environmental degradation in the studied areas.","publish_time":"2018-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Barros, Bruno de C\u00E1ssio Veloso; Chagas, Elaine Nunes; Bezerra, Luna Wanessa; Ribeiro, Laila Graziela; Duarte J\u00FAnior, Jose Wandilson Barboza; Pereira, Diego; da Penha Junior, Edvaldo Tavares; Silva, Julia Rezende; Bezerra, Delana Andreza Melo; Bandeira, Renato Silva; Pinheiro, Helder Henrique Costa; Guerra, Sylvia de F\u00E1tima dos Santos; Guimar\u00E3es, Ricardo Jos\u00E9 de Paula Souza e; Mascarenhas, Joana D\u0027Arc Pereira","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3c309c596c20f48f493b77e714ce957d877bdcb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6298726.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0209005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30562373/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["domestic animals","diversified animals","young animals","wild animals","animals of productive systems","fecal samples of different animal species","different species","humans","birds","small rodents","genome of RVA","circulation of RVA","bovines","pigs","environments of forest fragmentation","prevalence of Rotavirus","animal health","detection of rotavirus","studied areas","forest fragments","fecal specimens","urbanized area","global diversity of enteric viruses","RT-qPCR","northeastern mesoregion","relation","Qualitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction","main causes of mortality","habitats","occurrence of rearrangements","bats","proximity","state of Par\u00E1","traces of environmental degradation","Amazon","risks","important sources","transmissions","natural habitat","positive results","NSP3 gene","ecological niches","knowledge","present study","Acute gastroenteritis","anthropical activities","target","Brazil","chiropterans","canines","literature","horses","felines"],"language":"en"},

Liver impairment has been frequently reported as a common manifestation, although its clinical significance is still unclear, particularly in patients with underlying chronic liver disease (CLD). AIMS To summarize the changes in liver function tests during SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of COVID-19 in patients with underlying CLD. METHODS A literature review using online database Pubmed was done using the search terms \u0022SARS-CoV-2\u0022, \u0022COVID-19\u0022, \u0022liver\u0022, \u0022cirrhosis\u0022 and \u0022liver transplantation\u0022. RESULTS COVID-19 is frequently associated with different degrees of abnormal liver function tests, most notably transaminases, which are usually transitory and of mild degree. Available evidence suggests that liver injury may result from direct pathogenic effect by the virus, systemic inflammation or toxicity from commonly used drugs in this subset of patients. SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is associated with minimal or no increase in liver enzymes, thus the presence of abnormal liver function tests should trigger evaluation for underlying liver diseases. Although it seems that patients with CLD are not at greater risk for acquiring the infection, those with cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, autoimmune liver diseases or liver transplant may have a greater risk for severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Abnormal liver function tests during the course of COVID-19 are common, though clinically significant liver injury is rare.

Lineage A betacoronaviruses incorporate a 95-bp stem-loop structure, the packaging signal (PS), into the nsp15 locus of ORF1b that is both necessary and sufficient for the packaging of RNAs. However, unlike other viral PSs, where mutations generally resulted in viral replication defects, mutation of the coronavirus (CoV) PS results in large increases in subgenomic RNA packaging with minimal effects on gRNA packaging in vitro and on viral titers. Here, we show that selective packaging is also required for viral evasion of the innate immune response and optimal pathogenicity. We engineered two distinct PS mutants in two different strains of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) that packaged increased levels of subgenomic RNAs, negative-sense genomic RNA, and even cellular RNAs. All PS mutant viruses replicated normally in vitro but caused dramatically reduced lethality and weight loss in vivo. PS mutant virus infection of bone marrow-derived macrophages resulted in increased interferon (IFN) production, indicating that the innate immune system limited the replication and/or pathogenesis of PS mutant viruses in vivo. PS mutant viruses remained attenuated in MAVS(\u2212/\u2212) and Toll-like receptor 7-knockout (TLR7(\u2212/\u2212)) mice, two well-known RNA sensors for CoVs, but virulence was restored in interferon alpha/beta receptor-knockout (IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212)) mice or in MAVS(\u2212/\u2212) mice treated with IFNAR-blocking antibodies. Together, these data indicate that coronaviruses promote virulence by utilizing selective packaging to avoid innate immune detection.","publish_time":"2018-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Athmer, Jeremiah; Fehr, Anthony R.; Grunewald, Matthew E.; Qu, Wen; Wheeler, D.

Recently cGAS and STING have been identified as intracellular sensors that activate the interferon pathway in response to virus infection and thus mediate host defense against a range of DNA and RNA viruses. Here we review how viruses are sensed by the cGAS-STING signaling pathway as well as how viruses modulate this pathway. Mechanisms utilized by viral proteins to inhibit cGAS and/or STING are also discussed. On the flip side, host cells have also evolved strategies to thwart viral immune escape. The balance between host immune control and viral immune evasion is pivotal to viral pathogenesis and we discuss this virus-host stand-off in the context of the cGAS-STING innate immune pathway.","publish_time":"2016-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Zhe; Damania, Blossom","journal":"Cell Host \u0026 Microbe","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a7ace6dcceb13de9cb1f1ec2504fd3ecdbc8eb8.json; document_parses/pdf_json/add6e4fce535dff73dabb4548cfb9fdf80c8a272.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4755325.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312816300099; http://www.cell.com/article/S1931312816300099/pdf; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2016.01.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312816300099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26867174/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune pathway","cGAS-STING","host immune control","viral immune evasion","viral immune escape","host cells","viral infection","viral pathogenesis","viral proteins","interferon pathway","virus-host stand-off","concerted innate immune response","mediate host defense","virus infection","RNA viruses","type","pro-inflammatory cytokines","range of DNA","context","strategies","elimination","intracellular sensors","balance","Mechanisms","flip"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: In total, 348 CT scans in 112 patients were classified according to the time after the onset of the initial symptoms, namely stage-1 (0\u20134 days); stage-2 (5\u20139 days); stage-3 (10\u201314 days); stage-4 (15\u201321 days); stage-5 (22\u201328 days); and stage-6 (\uFF1E28 days). Each lung lobe was evaluated for extent affected by ground-glass opacities (GGO), crazy-paving pattern and consolidation, in five categories of percentual severity. Summation of scores from all five lung lobes provided the total CT score (maximal CT score, 25). RESULTS: The predominant patterns of lung abnormalities were GGOs, crazy-paving pattern, consolidation and linear opacities. The frequency of crazy-paving pattern, consolidation and linear opacities peaked at stage-3 (62.7 %), stage-4 (75.0 %) and stage-5 (83.1 %), respectively, and decreased thereafter. Total CT scores increased from stage-1 to stage-2 (2.8 \u00B1 3.1, vs. 6.5 \u00B1 4.6, respectively, P \u003C 0.01), and thereafter remained high. The lower lobes were more inclined to be involved with higher CT scores except for stage-1. At stage-6 98.1 % of CT scans still showed abnormalities (CT score 7.5 \u00B1 4.1). CONCLUSION: Thin-section CT could provide semi-quantitative analysis of pulmonary damage severity. This disease changed rapidly at the early stage, then tended to be stable and lasted for a long time.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ding, Xun; Xu, Jia; Zhou, Jun; Long, Qingyun","journal":"Eur J Radiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/06d09c26eec1823530c12904407cf21c16b34ac5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165099.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.109009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0720048X20301984; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32325282/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0720048X20301984","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["early stage","CT scans","days","section CT","Total CT scores","maximal CT score","higher CT scores","crazy-paving pattern","consolidation","lung lobes","linear opacities","predominant patterns of lung abnormalities","frequency of crazy","patients","Summation of scores","ground-glass opacities","initial symptoms","duration of symptoms","lower lobes","long time","categories of percentual severity","semi-quantitative analysis of pulmonary damage severity","GGOs","extent","COVID","correlate findings","onset","RESULTS","disease","PURPOSE","CONCLUSION","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Nevertheless, the RNA can also form secondary structures by intramolecular base-pairing. RESULTS: We show that the nucleotide distribution within codons is biased in all taxa of life on a global scale. Thereby, RNA secondary structures that require base-pairing between the position 1 of a codon with the position 1 of an opposing codon (here named RNA secondary structure class c(1)) are under-represented. We conclude that this bias may result from the co-evolution of codon sequence and mRNA secondary structure, suggesting that RNA secondary structures are generally important in protein-coding regions of mRNAs. The above result also implies that codon position 2 has a smaller influence on the amino acid choice than codon position 1.

The present studies were designed to characterize 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) mediated epoxide hydrolase elevation and to investigate the relationship between epoxide hydrolase increases, AAF metabolism, and hepatocarcinogenicity. Oral or i.p. administration of AAF to F-344 rats produced log-linear doseresponse curves for epoxide hydrolase elevation, measured with either benzo[a]pyrene-4, 5-oxide or styrene oxide substrate. Following a single dose of AAF (35 mg/kg), epoxide hydrolase activity was maximally increased (560% of control) within 48 h, and the activity declined slowly, with a halflife of 17.5 days. Co-treatment with actinomycin D effectively blocked the AAF dependent increase in epoxide hydrolase, suggesblng that de novo protein synthesis is associated with the increase in enzyme activity. Dose-response curves for epoxide hydrolase induction by AAF, N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene (N-OH-AAF), and aminofluorene were compared, and the potencies for increasing epoxide hydrolase activity reflected the relative hepatocarcinogenic potentials of these agents. In mice, which are resistant to the hepatocarcinogenic action of AAF and deficient in AAF-N-hydroxylase activity, AAF caused no significant increase in hepatic microsomal epoxide hydrolase activity. Similarly, in Cotton rats and guinea pigs, which are lacking in ability to form the sulfate conjugate of N-OH-AAF, neither i.p. nor dietary administration of AAF elicited increases in epoxide hydrolase activity at doses which were maximally effective in F-344 rats. These results support the hypothesis that the ability of compounds to increase epoxide hydrolase activity is related to their carcinogenic potency. Furthermore, the results suggest that increases in epoxide hydrolase activity are associated with metabolism of AAF to the putative proximate carcinogen N-OH-AAF, and the subsequent conversion of this compound to the N-O-sulfate conjugate.","publish_time":"1984-01-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Graichen, M.

Nevertheless, this goal requires new strategies such as the active detection and treatment of infected individuals. As the detection threshold for the currently used diagnostic methods is 100 parasites/\u03BCL, most low-density, asymptomatic infections able to maintain transmission cannot be detected. Identifying them by molecular methods such as PCR is a possible option but the field deployment of these tests is problematic. Isothermal amplification of nucleic acids (at a constant temperature) offers the opportunity of addressing some of the challenges related to the field deployment of molecular diagnostic methods. One of the novel isothermal amplification methods for which a substantial amount of work has been done is the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay. The present review describes LAMP and several other isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods, such as thermophilic helicase-dependent amplification, strand displacement amplification, recombinase polymerase amplification and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, and explores their potential use as high-throughput, field-based molecular tests for malaria diagnosis.","publish_time":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oriero, Eniyou C.; Jacobs, Jan; Van Geertruyden, Jean-Pierre; Nwakanma, Davis; D\u0027Alessandro, Umberto","journal":"J Antimicrob Chemother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf29a9990de83afd59f7063f1547ff4da789db35.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109677.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109677/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozk1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel isothermal amplification methods","isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods","Isothermal amplification of nucleic acids","molecular methods","strand displacement amplification","recombinase polymerase amplification","nucleic acid sequence-based amplification","field deployment of molecular diagnostic methods","thermophilic helicase-dependent amplification","molecular tests","malaria transmission","LAMP","malaria elimination","malaria diagnosis","active detection","detection threshold","\u03BCL","high-throughput","potential use","asymptomatic infections able","control interventions","possible option","new strategies","treatment of infected individuals","constant temperature","parasites","PCR","loop","opportunity","scale","thanks","challenges","assay","present review","goal","work","countries"],"language":"en"},

Epidemiologically it is characterized by sporadic community cases, which are amplified by hospital-based outbreaks. Healthcare facilities in 27 countries from most continents have experienced imported cases, with the most significant outbreak involving 186 cases in Korea. The mortality internationally is 36% and guidance for clinical management has yet to be developed. Most facilities and healthcare providers outside of the Middle East receiving patients have no or little experience in the clinical management of MERS. When a case does occur there is likely little time for a critical appraisal of the literature and putative pharmacological options. We identified published literature on the management of both MERS-CoV and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) through searches of PubMed and WHO and the US CDC websites up to 30 April 2016. A total of 101 publications were retrieved for critical appraisal. Most published literature on therapeutics for MERS are in vitro experiments, animal studies and case reports. Current treatment options for MERS can be categorized as: immunotherapy with virus-specific antibodies in convalescent plasma; polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies produced in vitro or in genetically modified animals; and antiviral agents. The use of any therapeutics in MERS-CoV remains investigational. The therapeutic agents with potential benefits and warranting further investigation include convalescent plasma, interferon-\u03B2/ribavirin combination therapy and lopinavir. Corticosteroids, ribavirin monotherapy and mycophenolic acid likely have toxicities that exceed potential benefits.","publish_time":"2016-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mo, Yin; Fisher, Dale","journal":"J Antimicrob Chemother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/01f1bf8c372d1cdac5d14431c65194c9929ef953.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109760.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109760/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozk3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare","MERS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV","clinical management of MERS","SARS-CoV","published literature","convalescent plasma","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","critical appraisal","therapeutics","imported cases","potential benefits","Healthcare facilities","likely little time","sporadic community cases","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","ribavirin monotherapy","monoclonal antibodies","little experience","case reports","healthcare providers","antiviral agents","therapeutic agents","virus-specific antibodies","ribavirin combination therapy","putative pharmacological options","Current treatment options","interferon-\u03B2","experiments","mycophenolic acid","toxicities","animal studies","investigation","significant outbreak","Corticosteroids","lopinavir","countries","continents","patients","immunotherapy","modified animals","searches of PubMed","focus of international attention","identification","Korea","publications","guidance","US CDC websites","hospital-based outbreaks","use","total","mortality"],"language":"en"},

The most common symptoms are fever and cough, which can progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and/or end-organ failure. Risk factors associated with ARDS and death are older age, comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia), neutrophilia, and organ and coagulation dysfunction. Disseminated intravascular coagulation and coagulopathy can contribute to death. Anticoagulant treatment is associated with decreased mortality in severe COVID-19 pneumonia. In this report we describe two patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who developed venous thromboembolism. LEARNING POINTS: Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism can occur in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis does not decrease the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in COVID-19 pneumonia. In the presence of clinical signs and/or suspicion of VTE, compression ultrasound and echocardiography should be always performed, irrespective of disease stage.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Poggiali, Erika; Bastoni, Davide; Ioannilli, Eva; Vercelli, Andrea; Magnacavallo, Andrea","journal":"Eur J Case Rep Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9177b7874f4e57d080a25896e52a6c7410b1ccdc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7213837.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32399449/; https://doi.org/10.12890/2020_001646","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WHO Emergency Committee","ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pneumonia","severe COVID","ARDS","death","risk of venous thromboembolism","patients","suspicion of VTE","Emergency Committee","Risk factors","coagulation dysfunction","intravascular coagulation","Coronavirus disease","disease stage","global health emergency","end-organ failure","Deep vein thrombosis","pulmonary embolism","decreased mortality","comorbidities","neutrophilia","acute respiratory distress syndrome","weight heparin prophylaxis","LEARNING POINTS","older age","Low-molecular","diabetes","hypertension","hyperlipidaemia","compression ultrasound","cough","common symptoms","fever","Anticoagulant treatment","presence of clinical signs","echocardiography","coagulopathy","worldwide infection","report"],"language":"en"},

IFIT1 inhibits translation by binding directly to the 5\u2032 end of foreign RNAs, particularly those with non-self cap structures, precluding the recruitment of the cap-binding eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F and ribosome recruitment. The presence of IFIT1 imposes a requirement on viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm to maintain mechanisms to avoid its restrictive effects. Interaction of different IFIT family members is well described, but little is known of the molecular basis of IFIT association or its impact on function. Here, we reconstituted different complexes of IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 in vitro, which enabled us to reveal critical aspects of IFIT complex assembly. IFIT1 and IFIT3 interact via a YxxxL motif present in the C-terminus of each protein. IFIT2 and IFIT3 homodimers dissociate to form a more stable heterodimer that also associates with IFIT1. We show for the first time that IFIT3 stabilizes IFIT1 protein expression, promotes IFIT1 binding to a cap0 Zika virus reporter mRNA and enhances IFIT1 translation inhibition. This work reveals molecular aspects of IFIT interaction and provides an important missing link between IFIT assembly and function.","publish_time":"2018-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fleith, Renata C; Mears, Harriet V; Leong, Xin Yun; Sanford, Thomas J; Emmott, Edward; Graham, Stephen C; Mansur, Daniel S; Sweeney, Trevor R","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d073fc71e9b58f7d85ab4ae64aaeadf10d56ae4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6007307.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29554348/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsxMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFIT1 binding","presence of IFIT1","IFIT1 translation inhibition","IFIT1 protein expression","different complexes of IFIT1","IFIT assembly","molecular aspects of IFIT interaction","IFIT3 homodimers","molecular basis of IFIT association","Interaction of different IFIT family members","critical aspects of IFIT complex assembly","function","IFIT2","eukaryotic translation initiation factor","ribosome recruitment","non-self cap structures","cap0 Zika virus reporter mRNA","important missing link","tetratricopeptide repeats","YxxxL motif present","cell-intrinsic immune response","Interferon-induced proteins","viral infection","C-terminus","IFITs","impact","work","time","end of foreign RNAs","mechanisms","viruses","requirement","stable heterodimer","restrictive effects","cytoplasm"],"language":"en"},

Materials and methods High-resolution CT (HRCT) findings of 106 patients with presumed/laboratory-confirmed novel S-OIV (H1N1) infection were reviewed. The 106 patients were divided into two groups according to the serious condition of the diseases. The pattern (consolidation, ground-glass, nodules, and reticulation), distribution, and extent of abnormality on the HRCT were evaluated in both groups. The dates of the onset of symptoms of the patients were recorded. Results The predominant CT findings in the patients at presentation were unilateral or bilateral multifocal asymmetric ground-glass opacities alone (n =29, 27.4%), with unilateral or bilateral consolidation (n =50, 47.2%). The consolidation had peribronchovascular and subpleural predominance. The areas of consolidation were found mainly in the posterior, middle and lower regions of the lungs. Reticular opacities were found in 6 cases of the initial MDCT scan. The extent of disease was greater in group 1 patients requiring advanced mechanical ventilation, with diffuse involvement in 19 patients (63.3%) of group 1 patients, and only 15/76 (19.7%) of group 2 patients (p \u003C0.01, \u03C7 2 test). 20 cases (19%) of the 106 patients had small bilateral or unilateral pleural effusions. None had evidence of hilar or mediastinal lymph node enlargement on CT performed at admission or later. Conclusions The most common radiographic and CT findings in patients with S-OIV infection are unilateral or bilateral ground-glass opacities with or without associated focal or multifocal areas of consolidation. On HRCT, the ground-glass opacities had a predominant peribronchovascular and subpleural distribution. CT plays an important role in the early recognition of severe S-OIV (H1N1).","publish_time":"2011-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Ping; Su, Dong-Ju; Zhang, Ji-Feng; Xia, Xu-Dong; Sui, Hong; Zhao, Dong-Hui","journal":"European Journal of Radiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ce38291f8caacc8c0e9520bc24233724e8afdb5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185744.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20566254/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0720048X10002445; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2010.05.029; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0720048X10002445","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsxMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRCT","CT","MDCT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pneumonia patients","bilateral consolidation","bilateral ground-glass opacities","predominant CT findings","HRCT","S-OIV infection","novel S-OIV","initial high-resolution CT","bilateral multifocal asymmetric ground-glass opacities","methods High-resolution CT","H1N1","multifocal areas of consolidation","Reticular opacities","early recognition of severe S-OIV","laboratory","unilateral pleural effusions","predominant peribronchovascular","subpleural distribution","cases","groups","extent of disease","extent of abnormality","subpleural predominance","initial MDCT scan","novel swine-origin influenza","presentation","mediastinal lymph node enlargement","advanced mechanical ventilation","virus","study","diffuse involvement","nodules","evidence of hilar","important role","lower regions","posterior","reticulation","Materials","Abstract Objective","purpose","lungs","serious condition","Conclusions","admission","onset of symptoms","pattern","diseases","dates","test"],"language":"en"},

During highly infectious outbreaks, acute resuscitation scenarios may also increase the risk of insufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) use by health care workers (HCWs). Simulation was used as an educational tool to measure adherence with PPE use and pediatric resuscitation guidelines during simulated cardiopulmonary arrests of 2009 influenza A patients. METHODS: A retrospective, observational study was performed of 84 HCWs participating in 11 in situ simulations in June 2009. Assessment included (1) PPE adherence, (2) confidence in PPE use, (3) elapsed time to specific resuscitation maneuvers, and (4) deviation from AHA guidelines. RESULTS: Observed adherence with PPE use was 61% for eye shields, 81% for filtering facepiece respirators or powered air-purifying respirators, and 87% for gown/gloves. Use of a \u201Cgatekeeper\u201D to control access and facilitate donning of PPE was associated with 100% adherence with gown and respirator precautions and improved respirator adherence. All simulations showed deviation from pediatric basic life support protocols. The median time to bag-valve-mask ventilation improved from 4.3 to 2.7 minutes with a gatekeeper present. Rapid isolation carts appeared to improve access to necessary PPE. Confidence in PPE use improved from 64% to 85% after the mock code and structured debriefing. CONCLUSIONS: Large gaps exist in the use of PPE and self-protective behaviors, as well as adherence to resuscitation guidelines, during simulated resuscitation events. Intervention opportunities include use of rapid isolation measures, use of gatekeepers, reinforcement of first responder roles, and further simulation training with PPE.","publish_time":"2016-11-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Watson, Christopher M.; Duval-Arnould, Jordan M.; McCrory, Michael C.; Froz, Stephan; Connors, Cheryl; Perl, Trish M.; Hunt, Elizabeth A.","journal":"Jt Comm J Qual Patient Saf","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c23885ee86a26256aff2a6f527e05d3f285bee2f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185510.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1553725011370663; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1553725011370663","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsxMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["American Heart Association","AHA","PPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PPE use","use of PPE","PPE adherence","necessary PPE","donning of PPE","pediatric resuscitation guidelines","improved respirator adherence","use of rapid isolation measures","simulated resuscitation events","acute resuscitation scenarios","specific resuscitation maneuvers","simulated pediatric cardiac arrests","simulated cardiopulmonary arrests","pediatric basic life support protocols","frequent deviation","HCWs","access","gown","confidence","Rapid isolation carts","respirator precautions","advanced life support algorithms","elapsed time","mock codes","median time","simulation training","situ simulations","gatekeeper present","filtering facepiece respirators","gatekeepers","Previous experience","risk of insufficient personal protective equipment","American Heart Association","health care workers","responder roles","powered air","Intervention opportunities","educational tool","reinforcement","observational study","infectious outbreaks","influenza","BACKGROUND","eye shields","self-protective behaviors","Large gaps","valve-mask ventilation","METHODS","retrospective","minutes","structured debriefing","patients","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","Assessment","gloves"],"language":"en"},

In addition to its broad antiviral activity, GRFT is stable at high temperature and at a broad pH range, displays little toxicity and immunogenicity, and is amenable to large-scale manufacturing. Native GRFT is a domain-swapped homodimer that binds to viral envelope glycoproteins and has displayed mid-picomolar activity in cell-based anti-HIV assays. Previously, we have engineered and analyzed several monomeric forms of this lectin (mGRFT) with anti-HIV EC(50) values ranging up to 323 nM. Based on our previous analysis of mGRFT, we hypothesized that the orientation and spacing of the carbohydrate binding domains GRFT were key to its antiviral activity. RESULTS: Here we present data on engineered tandem repeats of mGRFT (mGRFT tandemers) with antiviral activity at concentrations as low as one picomolar in whole-cell anti-HIV assays. mGRFT tandemers were analyzed thermodynamically, both individually and in complex with HIV-1 gp120. We also demonstrate by dynamic light scattering and cryo-electron microscopy that mGRFT tandemers do not aggregate HIV virions. This establishes that, although the intra-virion crosslinking of HIV envelope glycoproteins is likely integral to their activity, the antiviral activity of these lectins is not due to virus aggregation caused by inter-virion crosslinking. CONCLUSIONS: The engineered tandemer constructs of mGRFT may provide novel and powerful agents for prevention of infection by HIV and other enveloped viruses.

Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has raised ethical and medico-legal problems, which include the equitable allocation of health resources, especially in relation to the prioritization of patients and the rationing of resources. Priority setting is always present in healthcare systems and depends on the theory of justice applicable in each society. Resource rationing has been necessary in the COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore consensus documents have been published for decision-making based on four fundamental ethical values: maximization of benefits, treating people equally, contributing to creating social value and giving priority to the worst off, from which specific recommendations derive: maximize benefits; prioritize health workers; do not prioritize attendance on a first-come, first-served basis; be sensitive to scientific evidence; recognize participation in research and apply the same principles to COVID-19 patients as to non-COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martin-Fumad\u00F3, Carles; G\u00F3mez-Dur\u00E1n, Esperanza L.; Morlans-Molina, M\u00E0rius","journal":"Revista Espa\u00F1ola de Medicina Legal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7dc8b19a434ba5445af355016e7d7ebd2edbc9ad.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0377473220300249; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.reml.2020.05.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377473220300249?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsxNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Resource"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Abstract The COVID","pacientes COVID","been necessary in the COVID","the prioritization of patients and the rationing of","the worst off","recognize participation in research and apply the same","raised ethical and","which include the equitable allocation of health","maximization of benefits","always present in healthcare systems and depends on the theory of justice applicable in each society","recursos sanitarios","racionamiento de recursos","especially in relation","creating social value and giving priority","pandemic","patients as","first","beneficios","pandemia","not prioritize attendance on","and therefore consensus documents have been published for decision","prioritize health workers","making based on four fundamental ethical","maximize benefits","Priority setting","Resource rationing","problemas \u00E9ticos","sistemas sanitarios","priorizaci\u00F3n de pacientes","valores \u00E9ticos fundamentales","creaci\u00F3n de valor social","from which specific recommendations","contributing","legal problems","treating people equally","scientific evidence","toma de decisiones sustentadas","be sensitive","maximizaci\u00F3n","mismos principios","relaci\u00F3n","teor\u00EDa de justicia aplicable","orden de llegada","evidencia cient\u00EDfica","asistencia","participaci\u00F3n","sociedad","investigaci\u00F3n","documentos de consenso","m\u00E9dico","situaci\u00F3n","asignaci\u00F3n equitativa","establecimiento de prioridades","salud","trabajadores","recomendaciones espec\u00EDficas","personas"],"language":"es"},

Crowding conditions lead to high rates of respiratory infections among the pilgrims, representing a significant cause of morbidity and a major cause of hospitalization. Pre- and post-Hajj nasal specimens were prospectively obtained from a paired cohort (692 pilgrims) and from nonpaired cohorts (514 arriving and 470 departing pilgrims) from 13 countries. The countries of residence included Africa (44.2%), Asia (40.2%), the United States (8.4%) and Europe (7.2%). Nasal specimens were tested for 34 respiratory pathogens using RT-PCR. A total of 80 512 PCRs were performed. The prevalence of viruses and bacteria increased, from 7.4% and 15.4% before the Hajj to 45.4% and 31.0% after the Hajj, respectively, due to the acquisition of rhinovirus, coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, OC43), influenza A H1N1, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus. We did not identify Middle East respiratory coronavirus carriage. At arrival, the prevalence of several viruses was clearly dependent on the pilgrim\u0027s country of origin. After Hajj participation, these viruses were isolated among pilgrims from all countries, with few exceptions. No significant differences were observed between paired and nonpaired cohort results. Our results strongly suggest that, given the particularly crowded conditions during the rituals, an international mass gathering such as the Hajj may contribute to the globalization of respiratory pathogens after the cross-contamination of pilgrims harbouring pathogens that easily spread among participants. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination, face mask use and hand hygiene should be considered in the context of the Hajj.","publish_time":"2015-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Memish, Z.A.; Assiri, A.; Turkestani, A.; Yezli, S.; al Masri, M.; Charrel, R.; Drali, T.; Gaudart, J.; Edouard, S.; Parola, P.; Gautret, P.","journal":"Clin Microbiol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae83a5650c473fc6bc62902750d21607d9af07ac.json; document_parses/pdf_json/6016e40843ce7087ad8ef7bae5b8dbeb50fb30d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129181.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X15002967; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25700892/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X15002967; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2015.02.008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsxNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Saudi Arabia","Africa","Asia","United States","Europe","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["Hajj participation","departing pilgrims","post-Hajj nasal specimens","globalization of respiratory pathogens","prevalence of viruses","nonpaired cohort results","countries of residence","high rates of respiratory infections","significant cause of morbidity","Middle East respiratory coronavirus carriage","significant differences","nonpaired cohorts","crowded conditions","major cause of hospitalization","face mask use","Streptococcus pneumoniae","Haemophilus influenzae","H1N1","pneumococcal vaccination","cross-contamination","hand hygiene","Staphylococcus aureus","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","coronaviruses","rituals","HKU1","OC43","international mass","pilgrim\u0027s country of origin","Africa","Umrah","RT-PCR","acquisition of rhinovirus","context","bacteria","arrival","United States","total","PCRs","Europe","Asia","exceptions","participants","year"],"language":"en"},

The model is Markovian of the SIR type in which the total population is constant and individuals meet a random number of other individuals at each time step. Individuals remain infectious for R time units, after which they become removed or immune. Individual transition probabilities from susceptible to diseased states are given in terms of the binomial distribution. An expression is given for the probability that any individuals beyond those initially infected become diseased. In the model with a finite recovery time R, simulations reveal large variability in both the total number of infected individuals and in the total duration of the epidemic, even when the variability in number of contacts per day is small. In the case of no recovery, R =\u221E, a formal diffusion approximation is obtained for the number infected. The mean for the diffusion process can be approximated by a logistic which is more accurate for larger contact rates or faster developing epidemics. For finite R we then proceed mainly by simulation and investigate in the mean the effects of varying the parameters p (the probability of transmission), R, and the number of contacts per day per individual. A scale invariant property is noted for the size of an outbreak in relation to the total population size. Most notable are the existence of maxima in the duration of an epidemic as a function of R and the extremely large differences in the sizes of outbreaks which can occur for small changes in R. These findings have practical applications in controlling the size and duration of epidemics and hence reducing their human and economic costs.","publish_time":"2007-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tuckwell, Henry C.; Williams, Ruth J.","journal":"Mathematical Biosciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f4b1d7b5fe0f6d5a488fb02da8ca8fd3ea8e6493.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094774.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002555640600188X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002555640600188X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsxOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["total number of infected individuals","number infected","R time units","finite recovery time R","function of R","total duration","number of contacts","total population size","random number","time step","duration of epidemics","simple discrete time stochastic epidemic model","large variability","day","mean","large differences","diseased states","small changes","probability of transmission","diffusion process","Individual transition probabilities","formal diffusion approximation","simulations","SIR type","relation","larger contact rates","terms","parameters p","findings","sizes of outbreaks","properties","practical applications","existence of maxima","human","scale invariant property","economic costs","binomial distribution","notable","effects","case","expression"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study is to analyze outdoor particle penetration and transport, and their impact on indoor air, in a multi-zone and multi-story building using a CONTAMW simulation. For the airflow and particle transport analysis, the building leakage, penetration coefficients, and deposition rates were determined by on-site experiments. The results of airflow simulations for cold winters show that outdoor air infiltrates through the lower part of building and exfiltrates from the upper part. The results of the particle simulation also indicated that the airflow characteristics, combined with deposition rates, cause the lower floors of a multi-story building to be exposed to higher fine particle concentrations compared with the upper floors of the building. The study demonstrated that the CONTAMW simulation can be useful in analyzing the impact of outdoor particles on indoor environments through the identification of key particle transport parameters and validated airflow simulations.","publish_time":"2016-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Byung Hee; Yee, Su Whan; Kang, Dong Hwa; Yeo, Myoung Souk; Kim, Kwang Woo","journal":"Build Simul","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4aafd8b1fffaee0a6150275b448fc7655a142a2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32218899/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12273-016-0340-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsyMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["particle simulation","indoor particle concentrations","outdoor particle penetration","indoor air","particle transport analysis","indoor environments of multi-zone","multi-story buildings","building leakage","results of airflow simulations","outdoor air infiltrates","impact of outdoor particles","validated airflow simulations","complicated airflow characteristics","higher fine particle concentrations","CONTAMW simulation","identification of key particle transport parameters","deposition rates","lower floors","upper floors","study","poor ambient air quality","penetration coefficients","cold winters","buildings\u2019","single-family houses","areas","on-site experiments","exfiltrates","particulate matter","objective"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this document is to provide recommendations for a systematic approach for the care of patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a recognition of two major challenges in providing recommendations for AMI care in the COVID-19 era. Cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 are complex with patients presenting with AMI, myocarditis simulating a ST-elevation MI presentation, stress cardiomyopathy, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary spasm, or nonspecific myocardial injury and the prevalence of COVID-19 disease in the US population remains unknown with risk of asymptomatic spread. This document addresses the care of these patients focusing on 1) the varied clinical presentations; 2) appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) for health care workers; 3) role of the Emergency Department, Emergency Medical System and the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory; and 4) Regional STEMI systems of care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, primary PCI remains the standard of care for STEMI patients at PCI capable hospitals when it can be provided in a timely fashion, with an expert team outfitted with PPE in a dedicated CCL room.

However, there is a dearth of comparative studies in children that address differences in the clinical epidemiological features between HAdV-55 and other HAdV serotypes that can also induce severe infection (such as HAdV-7). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of pediatric patients hospitalized at Beijing Children\u2019s Hospital with ALRTI from April 2008 to December 2013 who had adenovirus detected from nasopharyngeal or throat samples by PCR. We further compared pediatric patients infected with HAdV-55 to those infected with HAdV-7 using a case-control methodology by matching each subject with HAdV-55 infection to 4 patients with HAdV-7 infection within 2 months of each HAdV-55 infection. Demographic, clinical, and etiological data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Over the five-year period, HAdV was detected in 194 children. Of these, 8 were HAdV-55 positive. Epidemiological results showed that HAdV-55 infection was observed only in 4% of adenovirus infected children whereas HAdV-7 infection proportioned 53%. Most cases of HAdV-55 infection were identified during March and April, whereas HAdV-7 infection occurred throughout the year. Wheezing was significantly less frequent in the HAdV-55 group. No patients infected with HAdV-55 presented with vomiting or had any underlying disease. Coinfections with other respiratory tract pathogens were frequent among children infected with either HAdV-55 or HAdV-7. CONCLUSIONS: HAdV-55 circulated in Beijing during spring and appeared to cause pediatric respiratory infections that were as severe as HAdV-7 infections. Broader surveillance studies are needed.","publish_time":"2018-12-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Lili; Liu, Jun; Liu, Chunyan; Duan, Yali; Zhu, Yun; Xu, Baoping; Xie, Zhengde","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/894676819b105b56f30438858631fce2958592e0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6286589.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-018-3520-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30526511/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjszMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["HAdV serotypes","cases of HAdV","severe infection","adenovirus infected children","pediatric respiratory infections","severe cases of adenovirus","retrospective review of pediatric patients","acute lower respiratory tract infections","emerging human adenovirus","respiratory tract pathogens","Epidemiological results","clinical epidemiological features","Beijing Children\u2019s Hospital","dearth of comparative studies","Broader surveillance studies","ALRTIs","differences","throat samples","adults","subject","months","case-control methodology","PCR","Demographic","etiological data","Coinfections","vomiting","spring","five-year period","underlying disease","METHODS","BACKGROUND","group","Wheezing","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Some of their functions include contractility, locomotion, collagen and elastin fiber production, and the regulation and degradation of the extracellular matrix. Also, fibroblasts act as sentinels to produce inflammatory mediators in response to several microorganisms. There is evidence that fibroblasts can synthesize toll-like receptors (TLRs), antimicrobial peptides, proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, which are important molecules involved in innate immune response against microorganisms. Fibroblasts can express TLRs (TLR-1 to TLR-10) to sense microbial components or microorganisms. They can synthesize antimicrobial peptides, such as LL-37, defensins hBD-1, and hBD-2, molecules that perform antimicrobial activity. Also, they can produce proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF\u03B1, INF\u03B3, IL-6, IL-12p70, and IL-10; other chemokines, such as CCL1, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL8, CXCL10, and CX3CL1; and the growth factors granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to induce and recruit inflammatory cells. According to their immunological attributes, we can conclude that fibroblasts are sentinel cells that recognize pathogens, induce the recruitment of inflammatory cells via cytokines and growth factors, and release antimicrobial peptides, complying with the characteristics of real sentinels.","publish_time":"2017-08-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bautista-Hern\u00E1ndez, Luis Antonio; G\u00F3mez-Olivares, Jos\u00E9 Luis; Buentello-Volante, Beatriz; Bautista-de Lucio, Victor Manuel","journal":"Eur J Microbiol Immunol (Bp)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/092880cc76f470dd9cca8233d83c884c0c5edf94.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5632742.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29034104/; https://doi.org/10.1556/1886.2017.00009","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjszNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antimicrobial peptides","fibroblasts act","microorganisms","growth factors granulocyte","proinflammatory cytokines","antimicrobial activity","recruitment of inflammatory cells","granulocyte colony","inflammatory mediators","chemokines","TLRs","IL-12p70","macrophage colony","important molecules","GM-CSF","G-CSF","defensins hBD","connective tissues","innate immune response","characteristics of real sentinels","regulation","locomotion","collagen","elastin fiber production","CCL5","CXCL8","CCL2","CX3CL1","receptors","degradation","contractility","CXCL10","CCL1","toll","TNF\u03B1","INF\u03B3","pathogens","extracellular matrix","functions","microbial components","evidence","immunological attributes"],"language":"en"},

As such, nucleoli carry out ribosome biogenesis and sequester or associate with key molecules that regulate cell cycle progression, tumorigenesis, apoptosis and the stress response. Nucleoli are dynamic compartments that are characterized by a constant flux of macromolecules. Given the complex and dynamic composition of the nucleolar proteome, it is challenging to link modifications in nucleolar composition to downstream effects. RESULTS: In this contribution, we present quantitative immunofluorescence methods that rely on computer-based image analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques by monitoring the dynamic association of proteins and RNA with nucleoli under different physiological conditions. Thus, the protocols described by us were employed to study stress-dependent changes in the nucleolar concentration of endogenous and GFP-tagged proteins. Furthermore, our methods were applied to measure de novo RNA synthesis that is associated with nucleoli. We show that the techniques described here can be easily combined with automated high throughput screening (HTS) platforms, making it possible to obtain large data sets and analyze many of the biological processes that are located in nucleoli. CONCLUSIONS: Our protocols set the stage to analyze in a quantitative fashion the kinetics of shuttling nucleolar proteins, both at the single cell level as well as for a large number of cells. Moreover, the procedures described here are compatible with high throughput image acquisition and analysis using HTS automated platforms, thereby providing the basis to quantify nucleolar components and activities for numerous samples and experimental conditions. Together with the growing amount of information obtained for the nucleolar proteome, improvements in quantitative microscopy as they are described here can be expected to produce new insights into the complex biological functions that are orchestrated by the nucleolus.","publish_time":"2011-06-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kodiha, Mohamed; Ba\u0144ski, Piotr; Stochaj, Ursula","journal":"BMC Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa2c978f246035c7e524e301c1ed8f9a5178dfde.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3126779.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21639891/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2121-12-25","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjszNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Nucleoli"],"organizations":["HTS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Nucleoli","nucleolar composition","nucleolar proteome","nucleolar components","kinetics of shuttling nucleolar proteins","different proteins","nucleolar concentration of endogenous","dynamic association of proteins","dynamic composition","dynamic compartments","HTS automated platforms","quantitative fashion","quantitative microscopy","quantitative immunofluorescence methods","biological processes","techniques","protocols","high throughput image acquisition","automated high throughput screening","complex biological functions","different physiological conditions","computer-based image analysis","experimental conditions","conspicuous compartments","stress response","cellular processes","cell cycle progression","single cell level","novo RNA synthesis","stress-dependent changes","large data sets","large number of cells","activities","tumorigenesis","apoptosis","numerous samples","key molecules","proper execution","associate","basis","crucial role","nucleus","new insights","contribution","stage","modifications","downstream effects","GFP","improvements","ribosome biogenesis","information","constant flux of macromolecules","CONCLUSIONS","procedures","RESULTS","nucleolus","effectiveness","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Chronic inflammatory cells then produce soluble factors that induce both tissue destruction and inflammation. A major issue is how and why apparently normal immune responses in the acute stage progress to chronic inflammation in subsequent months to years. Although it is often assumed that the initial etiologic agent, persisting in the joint or at an extra-articular site, is responsible for continued synovitis, this need not be the case. It is possible that once the inciting agent is cleared from the joint through a normal immune response, the presence of activated cells rich in surface class II histocompatibility (Ia) antigens could, under the influence of multiple genetic or environmental factors, become the target of autoimmune attack. Alternatively, the process might result from the interactions of synovial lining cells and their products with T cells assuming a secondary role. Further research into the relative contributions of soluble products, T helper and suppressor subsets, synoviocytes, and antigen determine which model is correct.","publish_time":"1988-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zvaifler, Nathan J.","journal":"The American Journal of Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf5d344243153d58be692ceb26f52c08e2bd2d2f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0002934388903567; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0002934388903567","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjszNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T cells","joint","chronic inflammation","articular inflammation","Chronic inflammatory cells","soluble factors","inciting antigen","inciting agent","presence of activated cells rich","relative contributions of soluble products","interactions of synovial lining cells","normal immune responses","T helper","environmental factors","extra-articular site","initial etiologic agent","acute stage progress","surface class","suppressor subsets","produced antibodies complex","histocompatibility","synoviocytes","subsequent months","pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis","influence of multiple genetic","antigens","years","tissue destruction","complement system","polymorphonuclear leukocytes","continued synovitis","secondary role","Abstract","target of autoimmune attack","model","research","major issue","process","case"],"language":"en"},

Here we test this idea and demonstrate with translation studies both in vitro and in vivo that the I protein is synthesized according to the leaky scanning model for initiation of translation on the subgenomic N mRNA molecule.","publish_time":"1997-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Senanayake, Savithra D.; Brian, David A.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c92f482865fa4e3d8a41bf09b77855537651630c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170296014232; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170296014232","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs0NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["I protein","N start codon","kDa protein","I ORF","kDa nucleocapsid protein","subgenomic N mRNA molecule","open reading frame","initiation of translation","translation studies","leaky scanning model","nt","ribosomes","bovine coronavirus","codons","bicistronic","idea","Sequences"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed at determining the potential impact of IFNL4 variation for the clearance of respiratory tract pathogens in Rwandan children (\u22645 years old, n = 480) seeking medical care for acute respiratory infections. Nasopharyngeal swabs were retrieved from all children at the first hospital referral and from 161 children at follow-up visits 2 weeks later. The swabs were analyzed for pathogens by real-time PCR and for host cell IFNL4 genotype at rs12979860 and rs368234815. Approximately 1/3 of the children were homozygous for the rs12979860 T allele and the rs368234815 \u0394G allele, which are overrepresented in subjects of African descent.

After a preliminary Phase I, open-label study (n = 25) to assess safety 1\u201314 days post-vaccination, a comparative observer-blind, randomised, controlled clinical trial (n = 600) was performed to assess safety and immunogenicity versus a non-adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine (Subunit; Agrippal(\u00AE), Novartis Vaccines). Subjects were randomised (2:1) to receive Sub/MF59\u2122 or Subunit. RESULTS: Both vaccines were well tolerated, with no vaccine-related serious adverse events reported during the Phase I trial. During the observer-blind study, local and systemic reactions were generally similar for both vaccines 1\u201322 days post-vaccination; however, injection-site induration was more frequent among the Subunit group (P \u003C 0.05), and mild pain at the injection site and fever were more frequent among Sub/MF59\u2122 recipients (P \u2264 0.005). Both vaccines induced a significant (P \u003C 0.001) increase in geometric mean titres (GMTs) for the three strains tested, versus baseline; GMTs against A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B were significantly higher in the Sub/MF59\u2122 group (P = 0.034, P \u003C 0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively). GMT ratios against A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B were also significantly higher in the Sub/MF59\u2122 group (P = 0.038, P \u003C 0.001 and P = 0.006, respectively). Similarly, the percentage of subjects achieving seroprotection or seroconversion on Day 22 was greater for Sub/MF59\u2122 recipients, reaching significance for A/H3N2 (P \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSION: MF59\u2122-adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine is well tolerated by elderly Chinese subjects and induces a higher level of immunogenicity than a non-adjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine in this population that is at high risk of influenza-related complications.

Despite the efforts at controlling this disease, it is unclear why dengue remains an issue in affluent countries. A better understanding of dengue epidemiology and its burden, and those of chikungunya virus and Zika virus which share vectors with dengue, is required to prevent the emergence of these diseases in high-income countries in the future. The purpose of this review was to assess the relative burden of dengue in four high-income countries and to appraise the similarities and differences in dengue transmission. We searched PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and Google Scholar using specific keywords for articles published up to 05 May 2016. We found that outbreaks rarely occur where only Aedes albopictus is present. The main similarities between countries uncovered by our review are the proximity to dengue-endemic countries, the presence of a competent mosquito vector, a largely nonimmune population, and a lack of citizens\u2019 engagement in control of mosquito breeding. We identified important epidemiological and environmental issues including the increase of local transmission despite control efforts, population growth, difficulty locating larval sites, and increased human mobility from neighboring endemic countries. Budget cuts in health and lack of practical vaccines contribute to an increased risk. To be successful, dengue-control programs for high-income countries must consider the epidemiology of dengue in other countries and use this information to minimize virus importation, improve the control of the cryptic larval habitat, and engage the community in reducing vector breeding. Finally, the presence of a communicable disease center is critical for managing and reducing future disease risks.","publish_time":"2016-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Viennet, Elvina; Ritchie, Scott A.; Williams, Craig R.; Faddy, Helen M.; Harley, David","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0022796bb2112abd2e6423ba2d57751db06049fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5028037.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0004943; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27643596/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs1MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ISI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high-income countries","dengue-endemic countries","dengue transmission","affluent countries","epidemiology of dengue","dengue-control programs","neighboring endemic countries","lower middle-income countries","relative burden of dengue","better understanding of dengue epidemiology","control efforts","control of mosquito breeding","Zika virus","presence","chikungunya virus","virus importation","review","vector breeding","future disease risks","competent mosquito vector","communicable disease center","population growth","larval sites","nonimmune population","increased risk","main similarities","increased human mobility","increase of local transmission","lack of practical vaccines","lack of citizens\u2019 engagement","cryptic larval habitat","difficulty","Google Scholar","environmental issues","ISI Web of Science","health","specific keywords","negative impact","articles","community","diseases","vectors","proximity","Budget cuts","Aedes albopictus","PubMed","information","emergence","differences","outbreaks","purpose"],"language":"en"},

We show that following OC43\u2019s introduction into humans, HE-mediated receptor binding was selected against and ultimately lost through progressive accumulation of mutations in the HE lectin domain. Consequently, virion-associated receptor-destroying activity toward multivalent glycoconjugates was reduced and altered such that some clustered receptor populations are no longer cleaved. Loss of HE lectin function was also observed for another respiratory human coronavirus, HKU1. This thus appears to be an adaptation to the sialoglycome of the human respiratory tract and for replication in human airways. The findings suggest that the dynamics of virion-glycan interactions contribute to host tropism.

The existence in vertebrates of three members of the tachykinin family of peptides may account for pharmacological observations suggesting the presence of more than one type of substance P receptor in the nervous system.","publish_time":"1984-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harmar, Anthony J.","journal":"Trends in Neurosciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec073af3ac6d9ecc514e5c35ee48c9632684b1fa.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016622368480154X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016622368480154X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs1Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neuropeptide substance P","type of substance P receptor","related peptide","members","amino acid sequences","tachykinin family of peptides","polypeptide precursors","nervous system","pharmacological observations","\u03B2-preprotachykinin","vertebrates","presence","novel","neuromedin","existence","spinal cord"],"language":"en"},

These sequences were compared with recently published sequences of the HE genes of the Quebec and Mebus strains. A large open reading frame of 1272 nt encoding a protein of 424 amino acid residues was predicted. The putative esterase active site was conserved in the virulent and avirulent BCV strains, indicating that this domain is probably not a determinant for BCV virulence. Four amino acid substitutions occurred between the HE proteins of BCV-L9 and BCV-LY138 (Leu to Pro at 5, Leu to Val at 103, Ser to Pro at 367, and Thr to Asn at 379). Monoclonal antibodies specific for the HE glycoprotein inhibited the hemagglutination and acetylesterase activities of BCV-L9, but showed no inhibitory effect on the acetylesterase activity of BCV-LY138. These results suggest that at least one epitope is located proximal to one of the three strain-specific amino acids. Four S-specific monoclonal antibodies inhibited hemagglutination but not acetylesterase activity of BCVL9, implying that the S glycoprotein can promote hemagglutination of chicken erythrocytes in addition to the HE glycoprotein.","publish_time":"1991-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Xuming; Kousoulas, Konstantin G.; Storz, Johannes","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a78233e970f133d1ba29d0106a8d2abe395e3d93.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229190557R; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229190557R","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs1NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BCV-LY138","proteins of BCV","BCV virulence","acetylesterase activities of BCV","avirulent BCV strains","virulent strain LY138","S glycoprotein","strain-specific amino acids","Monoclonal antibodies specific","S-specific monoclonal antibodies","avirulent strain L9 of bovine coronavirus","acetylesterase activity of BCVL9","genes","Leu","amino acid residues","amino acid substitutions","published sequences","hemagglutination of chicken erythrocytes","entire nucleotide sequences","Mebus strains","putative esterase active site","hemagglutinin","large open reading frame","inhibitory effect","Val","addition","Quebec","Ser","determinant","domain","epitope","results","Asn"],"language":"en"},

The virus containing an expressed HE protein (A59-DE-HE) was generated by infecting cells with MHV-A59, which does not express HE, and transfecting thein vitro-transcribed DI RNA containing the HE gene. A similar virus (A59-DE-CAT) expressing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) was used as a control. These viruses were inoculated intracerebrally into mice, and the role of the HE protein in viral pathogenesis was evaluated. Results showed that all mice infected with parental A59 or A59-DE-CAT succumbed to infection by 9 days postinfection (p.i.), demonstrating that inclusion of the DI did not by itself alter pathogenesis. In contrast, 60% of mice infected with A59-DE-HE survived infection. HE- or CAT-specific subgenomic mRNAs were detected in the brains at days 1 and 2 p.i. but not later, indicating that the genes in the DI vector were expressed only in the early stage of viral infection. No significant difference in virus titer or viral antigen expression in brains was observed between A59-DE-HE- and A59-DE-CAT-infected mice, suggesting that virus replication in brain was not affected by the expression of HE. However, at day 3 p.i. there was a slight increase in the extent of inflammatory cell infiltration in the brains of the A59-DE-HE-infected mice. Surprisingly, virus titers in the livers of A59-DE-HE-infected mice were 3 log10lower than that of the A59-DE-CAT-infected mice at day 6 p.i. Also, substantially less necrosis and viral antigen were detected in the livers of the A59-DE-HE-infected mice. This may account for the reduced mortality of these mice. The possible contribution of the host immune system to this difference in pathogenesis was analyzed by comparing the expression of four cytokines. Results showed that both tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 and interleukin-6 mRNAs increased in the brains of the A59-DE-HE-infected mice at day 2 p.i., whereas interferon-\u03B3 and interleukin-1\u03B1 mRNAs were similar between A59-DE-HE- and A59-DE-CAT-infected mice. These data suggest that the transient expression of HE protein enhances an early innate immune response, possibly contributing to the eventual clearance of virus from the liver. This study indicates the feasibility of the DI expression system for studying roles of viral proteins during MHV infection.","publish_time":"1998-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Xuming; Hinton, David R.; Park, Sungmin; Parra, Beatriz; Liao, Ching-Len; Lai, Michael M.C.; Stohlman, Stephen A.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2b3f7bd146b0afe15fc0c40bbd1b3eec4329d2e5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682297989935; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682297989935","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs2ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["A59-DE-CAT-infected mice","MHV-A59","livers of A59","parental A59","similar virus","DI expression system","brains","viral antigen expression","virus replication","virus titers","viral pathogenesis","MHV infection","DI vector","CAT-specific subgenomic mRNAs","early stage of viral infection","eventual clearance of virus","transient expression","RNA of mouse hepatitis virus","\u03B1 mRNAs","MHV hemagglutinin","roles of viral proteins","interleukin","Results","transfecting thein vitro-transcribed DI RNA","host immune system","early innate immune response","tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","significant difference","days postinfection","extent of inflammatory cell infiltration","slight increase","possible contribution","esterase","feasibility","chloramphenicol acetyltransferase","interferon-\u03B3","defective-interfering","infecting cells","log10lower","data","study","reduced mortality","inclusion","cytokines","control","viruses","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Among these, there is a long history of infectious diseases that have spread from non-human primates (NHP) to humans. For millennia, indigenous groups that depend on wildlife for their survival were exposed to the risk of NHP pathogens\u0027 transmission through animal hunting and wild meat consumption. Usually, exposure is of no consequence or is limited to mild infections. In rare situations, it can be more severe or even become a real public health concern. Since the emergence of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), nobody can ignore that an emerging infectious diseases (EID) might spread from NHP into the human population. In large parts of Central Africa and Asia, wildlife remains the primary source of meat and income for millions of people living in rural areas. However, in the past few decades the risk of exposure to an NHP pathogen has taken on a new dimension. Unprecedented breaking down of natural barriers between NHP and humans has increased exposure to health risks for a much larger population, including people living in urban areas. There are several reasons for this: (i) due to road development and massive destruction of ecosystems for agricultural needs, wildlife and humans come into contact more frequently; (ii) due to ecological awareness, many long distance travelers are in search of wildlife discovery, with a particular fascination for African great apes; (iii) due to the attraction for ancient temples and mystical practices, others travelers visit Asian places colonized by NHP. In each case, there is a risk of pathogen transmission through a bite or another route of infection. Beside the individual risk of contracting a pathogen, there is also the possibility of starting a new pandemic. This article reviews the known cases of NHP pathogens\u0027 transmission to humans whether they are hunters, travelers, ecotourists, veterinarians, or scientists working on NHP. Although pathogen transmission is supposed to be a rare outcome, Rabies virus, Herpes B virus, Monkeypox virus, Ebola virus, or Yellow fever virus infections are of greater concern and require quick countermeasures from public health professionals.","publish_time":"2019-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Devaux, Christian A.; Mediannikov, Oleg; Medkour, Hacene; Raoult, Didier","journal":"Front Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05620ea699e7dcf77f750bbb52911ea18b005d8f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6849485.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2019.00305; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31828053/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs3MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Central Africa","Asia"],"keyphrases":["risk of NHP pathogens\u0027 transmission","humans","risk of pathogen transmission","risk of exposure","known cases of NHP pathogens\u0027 transmission","Ebola virus","Monkeypox virus","Rabies virus","individual risk","human population","Herpes B virus","Yellow fever virus infections","long distance travelers","search of wildlife discovery","real public health concern","health risks","public health professionals","human pandemics","long history of infectious diseases","emerging infectious diseases","non-human primates","greater concern","millions of people","rare outcome","larger population","mild infections","rural areas","urban areas","rare situations","new pandemic","new dimension","primary source of meat","wild meat consumption","animal hunting","mystical practices","massive destruction of ecosystems","particular fascination","quick countermeasures","agricultural needs","income","veterinarians","natural barriers","hunters","bite","ancient temples","large parts of Central Africa","Asian places","immune deficiency syndrome","African great apes","attraction","road development","ecotourists","ecological awareness","EID","emergence","AIDS","date","indigenous groups","consequence","scientists","article","possibility","past","decades","route of infection","millennia","survival","contact","zoonoses","reasons"],"language":"en"},

Patients with virus-confirmed common cold (n = 254, verum 126, placebo 128) were included and the following parameters were appraised: duration of disease, number of patients with relapses, number of respiratory viruses and viral titers at inclusion (visit 1) compared to days 3\u20135 (visit 2). RESULTS: Carrageenan treated patients showed a significant reduction in duration of disease of almost 2 days (p \u003C 0.05) as well as significantly fewer relapses during 21 days of observation period (p \u003C 0.05). The virus clearance between visit 1 and visit 2 was significantly more pronounced in the carrageenan group (p \u003C 0.05). In both studies, virus-confirmed common cold was caused by three main virus subtypes: human rhinovirus (46%), human coronavirus (25%) and influenza A (14%) virus. Carrageenan nasal spray showed significant antiviral efficacy in all three virus subgroups, the highest effectiveness was observed in human corona virus-infected patients. The reduced duration of disease was 3 days (p \u003C 0.01) and the number of relapses was three times less (p \u003C 0.01) in carrageenan treated corona-virus-infected patients compared to control patients. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of carrageenan nasal spray in children as well as in adults suffering from virus-confirmed common cold reduced duration of disease, increased viral clearance and reduced relapses of symptoms. Carrageenan nasal spray appeared as an effective treatment of common cold in children and adults.

Assessing the capacity of surveillance systems to detect these threats is crucial for evaluating a country\u2019s ability to meet these requirements. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We propose a framework to evaluate the sensitivity and representativeness of hospital-based surveillance and apply it to severe neurological infectious diseases and fatal respiratory infectious diseases in Bangladesh. We identified cases in selected communities within surveillance hospital catchment areas using key informant and house-to-house surveys and ascertained where cases had sought care. We estimated the probability of surveillance detecting different sized outbreaks by distance from the surveillance hospital and compared characteristics of cases identified in the community and cases attending surveillance hospitals. We estimated that surveillance detected 26% (95% CI 18%\u201333%) of severe neurological disease cases and 18% (95% CI 16%\u201321%) of fatal respiratory disease cases residing at 10 km distance from a surveillance hospital. Detection probabilities decreased markedly with distance. The probability of detecting small outbreaks (three cases) dropped below 50% at distances greater than 26 km for severe neurological disease and at distances greater than 7 km for fatal respiratory disease. Characteristics of cases attending surveillance hospitals were largely representative of all cases; however, neurological disease cases aged \u003C5 y or from the lowest socioeconomic group and fatal respiratory disease cases aged \u226560 y were underrepresented. Our estimates of outbreak detection rely on suspected cases that attend a surveillance hospital receiving laboratory confirmation of disease and being reported to the surveillance system. The extent to which this occurs will depend on disease characteristics (e.g., severity and symptom specificity) and surveillance resources. CONCLUSION: We present a new approach to evaluating the sensitivity and representativeness of hospital-based surveillance, making it possible to predict its ability to detect emerging threats.","publish_time":"2017-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nikolay, Birgit; Salje, Henrik; Sturm-Ramirez, Katharine; Azziz-Baumgartner, Eduardo; Homaira, Nusrat; Ahmed, Makhdum; Iuliano, A.

Methods This was a qualitative study based on face-to-face semistructured interviews with healthcare professionals involved in ASPs and activities across three Ministry of Health (MoH) hospitals in Saudi Arabia (n = 18). Interviews were also conducted with two representatives of a General Directorate of Health Affairs in a Saudi region and two representatives of the Saudi MoH (n = 4) between January\u2013February 2017. Results Despite the existence of a national strategy to implement ASPs in Saudi MoH hospitals, their adoption and implementation remains low. Hospitals have their own antimicrobial stewardship policies, but adherence to these is poor. ASP team members highlight that lack of enforcement of policies and guidelines from the MoH and hospital administration is a significant barrier to ASP adoption and implementation. Other barriers include disintegration of teams, poor communication, lack of recruitment/shortage of ASP team members, lack of education and training, and lack of health information technology (IT). Physicians\u2019 fears and concerns in relation to liability are also a barrier to their adoption of ASPs. Conclusion This is the first qualitative study exploring barriers to ASP adoption and implementation in Saudi hospitals from the perspective of ASP team members. Formal endorsement of ASPs from the MoH as well as hospital enforcement of policies and provision of human and health IT resources would improve the adoption and implementation of ASPs in Saudi hospitals.","publish_time":"2019-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alghamdi, Saleh; Atef-Shebl, Nada; Aslanpour, Zoe; Berrou, Ilhem","journal":"Journal of Global Antimicrobial Resistance","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19cc8623f4bbacbd1747b395b755c7491a3f82c8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104169.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213716519300384; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jgar.2019.01.031; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213716519300384; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797087/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs3MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["General Directorate of Health Affairs","ASP"],"locations":["Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["Saudi hospitals","ASP adoption","Saudi MoH hospitals","adoption of ASPs","implementation of ASPs","Saudi region","Saudi Arabia","shortage of ASP team members","perspective of ASP team members","lack of enforcement","lack of recruitment","lack of education","qualitative study","lack of health information technology","Ministry of Health","antimicrobial stewardship policies","hospital enforcement of policies","Formal endorsement of ASPs","team members\u2019 perspectives","representatives","barriers","General Directorate of Health Affairs","antimicrobial stewardship programme","significant barrier","hospital administration","poor communication","face-to-face semistructured interviews","healthcare professionals","training","guidelines","factors","provision of human","relation","activities","national strategy","resources","disintegration of teams","Abstract Objectives","concerns","liability","adherence","programmes","Physicians\u2019 fears","existence","Results","Methods","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Despite the molecular mechanisms of PF are gradually clear with numerous researchers\u2019 efforts, few effective drugs have been developed to reverse human PF or even halt the chronic progression to respiratory failure. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the main component of the medical practice used for more than 5000 years especially in China, often exerts wider action spectrum than previously attempted options in treating human diseases. Recent data have shown the anti-fibrotic benefits of the active ingredients from TCM in this field, which may represent an attractive source of the drug discovery against PF. Aim of the review This review summarizes the pre-clinical and clinical evidence on the benefits of TCM and their active ingredients, and provides a comprehensive information and reliable basis for the exploration of new treatment strategies of botanical drugs in the therapy of PF. Methods The literature information was obtained from the scientific databases on ethnobotany and ethno medicines (up to Aug 2016), mainly from the Pubmed, Web of Science and CNKI databases, and was to identify the experimental studies on the anti-fibrotic role of the active agents from TCM and the involved mechanisms. The search keywords for such work included: \u201Clung fibrosis\u201D or \u201Cpulmonary fibrosis\u201D, and \u201Ctraditional Chinese medicine\u201D, \u201Cextract\u201D or \u201Cherb\u201D. Results A number of studies have shown that the active agents of single herbs and TCM formulas, particularly the flavonoids, glycosides and alkaloids, exhibit potential benefits against PF, the mechanisms of which appear to involve the regulation of inflammation, oxidant stress, and pro-fibrotic signaling pathways, etc. Besides, the processing methods for discovering TCM in treating PF were prospectively discussed. Conclusion These research work have shown the therapeutic benefits of TCM in the treatment of PF. However, more continued researches should be undertaken to clarify the unconfirmed chemical composition and regulatory mechanisms, conduct standard clinical trials, and evaluate the possible side effects. The insights provided in present review will be needed for further exploration of botanical drugs in the development of PF therapy.","publish_time":"2017-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Liu-Cheng; Kan, Lian-Di","journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e19c6a17804bb681538d81bbe845034f0c4f843.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127743.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874116308029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28038955/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874116308029; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2016.12.042","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs3ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PF","TCM"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["therapeutic benefits of TCM","TCM formulas","human PF","molecular mechanisms of PF","anti-fibrotic benefits","active ingredients","development of PF therapy","potential benefits","regulatory mechanisms","lung fibrosis","involved mechanisms","exploration of botanical drugs","anti-fibrotic role","clinical evidence","active agents of single herbs","effective drugs","treatment of","therapy of","present review","Traditional Chinese medicine","exploration of new treatment strategies of botanical drugs","standard clinical trials","Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance Pulmonary fibrosis","comprehensive information","scientific databases","literature information","chronic progression","CNKI databases","research work","experimental studies","processing methods","human diseases","number of studies","lethal lung disorder","attempted options","numerous researchers\u2019 efforts","oxidant stress","reliable basis","wider action spectrum","glycosides","alkaloids","drug discovery","main component","unconfirmed chemical composition","China","Web of Science","ethnobotany","ethno medicines","pathways","flavonoids","extract","Aim","field","medical practice","attractive source","regulation of inflammation","Recent data","Pubmed","respiratory failure","years","search keywords","Conclusion","insights","continued researches","effects"],"language":"en"},

This study focuses on outdoor falls within an urban community in Hong Kong. Urban environmental hazards are often place-specific and dependent upon the built features, landscape characteristics, and habitual activities. Therefore, falls must be examined with respect to local situations. RESULTS: This paper uses spatial analysis methods to map fall occurrences and examine possible environmental attributes of falls in an urban community of Hong Kong. The Nearest neighbour hierarchical (Nnh) and Standard Deviational Ellipse (SDE) techniques can offer additional insights about the circumstances and environmental factors that contribute to falls. The results affirm the multi-factorial nature of falls at specific locations and for selected groups of the population. CONCLUSION: The techniques to detect hot spots of falls yield meaningful results that enable the identification of high risk locations. The combined use of descriptive and spatial analyses can be beneficial to policy makers because different preventive measures can be devised based on the types of environmental risk factors identified. The analyses are also important preludes to establishing research hypotheses for more focused studies.","publish_time":"2009-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lai, Poh C; Low, Chien T; Wong, Martin; Wong, Wing C; Chan, Ming H","journal":"Int J Health Geogr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cdbdc0b6176729a11ba5e08c708408592d189657.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2666650.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19291326/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1476-072x-8-14","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Falls"],"organizations":["Standard Deviational Ellipse"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["outdoor falls","possible environmental attributes of falls","hot spots of falls","environmental factors","Urban environmental hazards","multi-factorial nature of falls","urban community of Hong Kong","types of environmental risk factors","spatial analyses","specific locations","techniques","meaningful results","identification of high risk locations","spatial analysis methods","fall occurrences","policy makers","Nnh","Standard Deviational Ellipse","SDE","landscape characteristics","built features","additional insights","research hypotheses","issue of great public health concern","different preventive measures","selected groups","combined use of descriptive","Nearest neighbour hierarchical","important preludes","paper","circumstances","habitual activities","focused studies","respect","local situations","population","CONCLUSION","study","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

As for Hong Kong, one of the most densely populated cities, the scarcity of land has always been assumed as a major impediment for its long-term development. Therefore, the Hong Kong government actively explores approaches to enhance usable land resources. One viable approach is rock cavern development. This paper presents a feasibility assessment of relocating a sewage treatment works to a cavern, with emphasis on the evaluation of environmental sustainability. Wind tunnel tests were carried out with efforts to estimate the prospective odor impact, as well as the wind availability at pedestrian level. It is noted that the sewage odor concentration depends greatly on the dispersion distance and the surrounding topography. The results indicate that when the sewage treatment works is relocated to the cavern, the predicted odor concentration will not cause damage to human health as long as the ventilation shaft is properly placed. In addition, the air ventilation assessments were conducted for both before/after the planned building development. It shows that the new building development at the current plant site will not significantly influence the wind availability at pedestrian level in the surrounding areas. This paper highlights the importance of sustainable development in connection with the environment, and shows that rock cavern development can be an attractive alternative for strategic urban planning in Hong Kong.","publish_time":"2015-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shu, Z.

Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a multivariate analysis method to determine the structural relationship between measured variables. This observational study aimed to use SEM to determine the effects of social support on sleep quality and function of medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 in January and February 2020 in Wuhan, China. MATERIAL/METHODS: A one-month cross-sectional observational study included 180 medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 infection. Levels of anxiety, self-efficacy, stress, sleep quality, and social support were measured using the and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction (SASR) questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Social Support Rate Scale (SSRS), respectively. Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis and SEM identified the interactions between these factors. RESULTS: Levels of social support for medical staff were significantly associated with self-efficacy and sleep quality and negatively associated with the degree of anxiety and stress. Levels of anxiety were significantly associated with the levels of stress, which negatively impacted self-efficacy and sleep quality. Anxiety, stress, and self-efficacy were mediating variables associated with social support and sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS: SEM showed that medical staff in China who were treating patients with COVID-19 infection during January and February 2020 had levels of anxiety, stress, and self-efficacy that were dependent on sleep quality and social support.","publish_time":"2020-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Han; Zhang, Yan; Kong, Desheng; Li, Shiyue; Yang, Ningxi","journal":"Med Sci Monit","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b29b65801480de25dd4b503bfd7939a1884b97e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7075079.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.923549; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32132521/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pearson"],"organizations":["SEM","Self-Rating Anxiety Scale","Stanford Acute Stress Reaction","Social Support Rate Scale"],"locations":["China","Wuhan City"],"keyphrases":["Levels of social support","levels of stress","Levels of anxiety","effects of social support","General Self-Efficacy Scale","Self-Rating Anxiety Scale","SEM","Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index","Social Support Rate Scale","COVID","degree of anxiety","function of medical staff","patients","China","Stanford Acute Stress Reaction","novel coronavirus","Coronavirus disease","measured variables","infection","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","structural relationship","month cross-sectional observational study","Wuhan City","multivariate analysis method","Structural equation modeling","Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis","questionnaire","SASR","GSES","PSQI","SARS-CoV","interactions","SSRS","METHODS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","nCoV","factors","MATERIAL"],"language":"en"},

METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty\u2010three lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from foal\u0027s faeces were assessed based on the main desirable functional in vitro criteria. Based on these results, Pediococcus pentosaceus strain 40 was chosen to evaluate its putative probiotic features in a mouse model of Salmonella infection. Daily intragastric doses of Ped. pentosaceus 40 for 10 days before and 10 days after Salmonella challenge (10(6) CFU of Salm. Typhimurium per mouse) led to a significant aggravation in mouse health by increasing weight loss, worsening clinical symptoms and anticipating the time and the number of deaths by Salmonella.

Among the drugs were e.g., three cardiotonic agents (ouabain, digitoxin, digoxin) with a TI greater than 100, an anti-malaria drug (atovaquone; TI \u003E34), an inhalable corticosteroid (ciclesonide; TI \u003E6), etc. Together, our results identify potential therapeutic options for treating MERS-CoV infections and could provide a basis for agents against a wider range of coronavirus-related illnesses, including the currently emerging Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ko, Meehyun; Chang, So Young; Byun, Soo Young; Choi, Inhee; d\u2019Alexandry d\u2019Orengiani, Anne-Laure Pham Hung; Shum, David; Min, Ji-Young; Windisch, Marc P.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dbefc8ad2a3de5d1696b7e604de8bce1da2ea8cd.json; document_parses/pdf_json/43cb651837d3ec906fd63ec8ca9e15a608cf9968.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.25.965582","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["United States Food and Drug Administration","FDA"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["TI greater","MERS-CoV infections","CoV interventions","FDA-approved drugs","hits","South Korean MERS-CoV clinical isolate","limited therapeutic options","potential therapeutic options","therapeutic index","wider range of coronavirus","emerging Coronavirus Disease","Drug Administration","cardiotonic agents","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","anti-malaria drug","late stages","compounds","United States Food","related illnesses","dose-response curve analysis","largest epidemic","nosocomial transmission","digitoxin","basis","digoxin","Republic of Korea","addition studies","bioactive molecules","viral life cycle","therapeutics act","ouabain","COVID","various strategies","atovaquone","inhalable corticosteroid","Arabian Peninsula","unmet medical needs","activity","primary assay","ciclesonide","results","date","Time","outbreak"],"language":"en"},

Investigations into the origin of MERS-CoV have focused on two potential reservoirs: bats and camels. Here, we investigated the role of bats as a potential reservoir for MERS-CoV. In vitro, the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein interacted with Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor and MERS-CoV replicated efficiently in Jamaican fruit bat cells, suggesting there is no restriction at the receptor or cellular level for MERS-CoV. To shed light on the intrinsic host-virus relationship, we inoculated 10 Jamaican fruit bats with MERS-CoV. Although all bats showed evidence of infection, none of the bats showed clinical signs of disease. Virus shedding was detected in the respiratory and intestinal tract for up to 9 days. MERS-CoV replicated transiently in the respiratory and, to a lesser extent, the intestinal tracts and internal organs; with limited histopathological changes observed only in the lungs. Analysis of the innate gene expression in the lungs showed a moderate, transient induction of expression. Our results indicate that MERS-CoV maintains the ability to replicate in bats without clinical signs of disease, supporting the general hypothesis of bats as ancestral reservoirs for MERS-CoV.","publish_time":"2016-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Munster, Vincent J.; Adney, Danielle R.; van Doremalen, Neeltje; Brown, Vienna R.; Miazgowicz, Kerri L.; Milne-Price, Shauna; Bushmaker, Trenton; Rosenke, Rebecca; Scott, Dana; Hawkinson, Ann; de Wit, Emmie; Schountz, Tony; Bowen, Richard A.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/577c6a13f9ef70e9756890fc66e98f537c01ac0a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4761889.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26899616/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21878","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein","origin of MERS","Jamaican fruit bats","role of bats","general hypothesis of bats","potential reservoirs","Jamaican fruit bat cells","receptor","lungs","clinical signs of disease","zoonotic potential of Betacoronaviruses","ancestral reservoirs","intestinal tracts","Virus shedding","emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","innate gene expression","transient induction of expression","intrinsic host-virus relationship","internal organs","dipeptidyl peptidase","Artibeus jamaicensis","DPP4","limited histopathological changes","cellular level","lesser extent","restriction","ability","light","Analysis","camels","evidence of infection","days","Investigations","results"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: In this nationwide prospective study on Swedish lung transplant patients, we evaluated the microbiological panorama of bacteria, fungi, and virus found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) obtained the first year after lung transplantation (LTx). Differences in microbiological findings depending of concomitant signs of infection and background factors were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 470 bronchoscopies from 126 patients were evaluated. Sixty\u2010two percent (n = 293) of BALF samples had positive microbiological finding(s). Forty\u2010six percent (n = 217) had bacterial growth, 29% (n = 137) fungal growth, and 9% (n = 43) were positive in viral PCR. In 38% of BALF samples (n = 181), a single microbe was found, whereas a combination of bacteria, fungi or virus was found in 24% (n = 112) of bronchoscopies. The most common microbiological findings were Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and coagulase negative Staphylococcus (in 42 (33%), 36 (29%), and 25 (20%) patients, respectively). Microbiological findings were similar in BALF from patients with and without signs of lung infection and the frequency of multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria was low. No significant association was found between background factors and time to first lung infection. CONCLUSION: This study gives important epidemiologic insights and reinforces that microbiological findings have to be evaluated in the light of clinical symptoms and endobronchial appearance in the assessment of lung infections in lung transplant patients.","publish_time":"2018-08-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stj\u00E4rne Aspelund, Anna; Hammarstr\u00F6m, Helena; Inghammar, Malin; Larsson, Hillevi; Hansson, Lennart; Riise, Gerdt C.; Friman, Vanda; Christensson, Bertil; P\u00E5hlman, Lisa I.","journal":"Transpl Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0816e748c473f9ddf03d7952738025c7bf22ef33.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169803.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30107073/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.12973","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BALF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung transplantation","Swedish lung transplant patients","signs of lung infection","assessment of lung infections","common microbiological findings","microbiological panorama of bacteria","positive microbiological finding","BALF samples","background factors","concomitant signs of infection","virus","fungi","combination of bacteria","bronchoscopies","percent","bacterial growth","fungal growth","nationwide prospective study","high risk of airway infections","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Candida albicans","endobronchial appearance","inhaled microorganisms","microbial colonization","frequency of multidrug resistant","ciliary transport","important epidemiologic insights","denervation","environment","coagulase negative Staphylococcus","MDR","constant exposure","light of clinical symptoms","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","year","time","decreased cough","CONCLUSION","METHODS","significant association","LTx","total","Differences","RESULTS","viral PCR","single microbe"],"language":"en"},

We propose a more encompassing Microbial Theory of Health that will have implications for the way that we address our relationship with microbes, including hygiene policy and community-based infection control practices. Methods: This paper considers theories over the last 30 years that have impacted hygiene policy and consumer practice, from the Germ Theory of Disease and the Hygiene Hypothesis, to the Microbial Theory of Health, including the concept of Bidirectional Hygiene. Here we present a high-level review of the literature on pathogen transmission and the cycle of infection in the home and everyday settings. Results: Targeted hygiene is an evidence-based hygiene policy that is employed to prevent transmission of pathogens and the transmission of infectious diseases through targeting only sites, surfaces, and practices that are considered high risk for pathogen transmission. Targeted hygiene also discourages the indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum microbicides for lower-risk activities and surfaces. Conclusions: The Microbial Theory of Health, including age-appropriate and health-appropriate hygiene practices for home and everyday life, should usher in a new era in which pathogen reduction can be accomplished without indiscriminate elimination of potentially beneficial microbes from the human and environmental microbiomes.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scott, Elizabeth A.; Bruning, Elizabeth; Nims, Raymond W.; Rubino, Joseph R.; Ijaz, Mohammad Khalid","journal":"American journal of infection control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ff9fe2710ce768199fb36d4c1b352fbc4c38f03b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32442651/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655320303102; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.05.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655320303102?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Bidirectional Hygiene"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Targeted hygiene","Hygiene Hypothesis","health-appropriate hygiene practices","evidence-based hygiene policy","pathogen transmission","concept of Bidirectional Hygiene","encompassing Microbial Theory of Health","germ theory of disease","transmission of pathogens","home","pathogen reduction","transmission of infectious diseases","surfaces","community-based infection control practices","age-appropriate","cycle of infection","beneficial microbes","indiscriminate elimination","high risk","everyday life","everyday settings","lower-risk activities","indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum microbicides","sites","targeting","literature","general acceptance","consumer practice","growing understanding","healthy microbiome","traditional thinking","importance","human","relationship","environmental microbiomes","new era","high-level review","theories","ABSTRACT Background","Results","implications","years","Conclusions","Methods","paper","way"],"language":"en"},

Viral rhinitis alone does not seem to be able to elicit clinical acute sinusitis. Bacteria determine the clinical picture and outcome of sinusitis.

Much more conflicting reports are published about normal sinus flora, the role of anaerobes and the microbiology of chronic sinusitis. The relationship between infectious and allergic diseases ise more difficult to explain. It is shown that, in particular viruses can induce the release of inflammatory mediators and modify the inflammatory process. Their role in epithelial damage, excitation of nerve fibers, sensitization of inflammatory cells, and therefore, in general hyperreactivity has also been reported. Finally, with regard to sinusitis, different hypothesis have been proposed to explain the possible links with bronchial hyperreactivity.","publish_time":"1998-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Van Cauwenberge, P.; Watelet, J.

Here, we used a large dataset from 357 lions comprehending 1.13 megabases of sequence data and genotypes from 22 microsatellite loci to characterize its recent evolutionary history. Patterns of molecular genetic variation in multiple maternal (mtDNA), paternal (Y-chromosome), and biparental nuclear (nDNA) genetic markers were compared with patterns of sequence and subtype variation of the lion feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV(Ple)), a lentivirus analogous to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In spite of the ability of lions to disperse long distances, patterns of lion genetic diversity suggest substantial population subdivision (mtDNA \u03A6(ST) = 0.92; nDNA F (ST) = 0.18), and reduced gene flow, which, along with large differences in sero-prevalence of six distinct FIV(Ple) subtypes among lion populations, refute the hypothesis that African lions consist of a single panmictic population. Our results suggest that extant lion populations derive from several Pleistocene refugia in East and Southern Africa (\u223C324,000\u2013169,000 years ago), which expanded during the Late Pleistocene (\u223C100,000 years ago) into Central and North Africa and into Asia. During the Pleistocene/Holocene transition (\u223C14,000\u20137,000 years), another expansion occurred from southern refugia northwards towards East Africa, causing population interbreeding. In particular, lion and FIV(Ple) variation affirms that the large, well-studied lion population occupying the greater Serengeti Ecosystem is derived from three distinct populations that admixed recently.","publish_time":"2008-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Antunes, Agostinho; Troyer, Jennifer L.; Roelke, Melody E.; Pecon-Slattery, Jill; Packer, Craig; Winterbach, Christiaan; Winterbach, Hanlie; Hemson, Graham; Frank, Laurence; Stander, Philip; Siefert, Ludwig; Driciru, Margaret; Funston, Paul J.; Alexander, Kathy A.; Prager, Katherine C.; Mills, Gus; Wildt, David; Bush, Mitch; O\u0027Brien, Stephen J.; Johnson, Warren E.","journal":"PLoS Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f2af8027b6801850481d09ad0d4c5eb8e31c7d7f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2572142.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18989457/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Pleistocene/Holocene","Serengeti Ecosystem"],"locations":["Africa","Southern Africa","North Africa","Asia","East Africa","East"],"keyphrases":["extant lion populations","patterns of lion genetic diversity","well-studied lion population","lion feline immunodeficiency virus","lion Panthera leo","years","Patterns of molecular genetic variation","patterns of sequence","distinct FIV","Southern Africa","East Africa","Pleistocene refugia","distinct populations","genetic markers","substantial population subdivision","subtype variation","African lions","single panmictic population","ability of lions","North Africa","large differences","large dataset","Late Pleistocene","human immunodeficiency virus","southern refugia northwards","mtDNA \u03A6","nDNA F","megabases of sequence data","long distances","microsatellite loci","greater Serengeti Ecosystem","biparental nuclear","lentivirus analogous","sero-prevalence","genotypes","subtypes","world\u0027s","Y-chromosome","HIV","expansion","hypothesis","recent evolutionary history","charismatic carnivores","Africa\u0027s key predators","Asia","results","Holocene transition","reduced gene flow","spite"],"language":"en"},

In this review, we examine the role of respiratory virus infection in the exacerbation of ARS and CRS. We explore the epidemiology of viral exacerbation of ARS and CRS and highlight key viruses that may cause exacerbation. We also review the current understanding of viral infections in the upper airway to further explain the putative underlying mechanisms of inflammatory events in ARS and CRS exacerbation. Advances in accurate diagnosis of the etiologic respiratory viruses of ARS and CRS symptoms which can lead to better disease management are also surveyed. In addition to the current treatments which provide symptomatic relief, we also explore the potential of harnessing existing antiviral strategies to prevent ARS and CRS exacerbation, especially with improved viral diagnostic tools to guide accurate prescription of antivirals against causative respiratory viruses.","publish_time":"2017-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Kai Sen; Yan, Yan; Ong, Hsiao Hui; Chow, Vincent T.

Primers and probes, designed to target highly conserved regions of the matrix protein of influenza A and the nucleoprotein of influenza B, were optimized using the high\u2010throughput LightCycler 480 II system. Analytical sensitivity and specificity were characterized using RNA transcripts diluted serially, archived non\u2010influenza respiratory viruses, and proficiency test samples. Eighty\u2010nine clinical samples were tested in parallel against existing influenza A and B monoplex assays. Once validated, the duplex assay was applied prospectively on 2,458 clinical specimens that were later subtyped. In April 2011, the emergence of an influenza B variant necessitated the inclusion of an additional modified probe for influenza B and revalidation of the revised protocol. The lower detection limits of the assay were 50 copies/PCR. There was no cross\u2010reactivity against any non\u2010influenza respiratory virus and all proficiency testing materials were identified correctly. The parallel testing revealed a 98.9% overall agreement. Routine application of the assay revealed high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of influenza A/H1N1/2009, A/H3N2 and influenza B.

Methods This study was conducted from March to July, 2005, using semi-structured in-depth interviews to collect data. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. A qualitative content analysis was employed to analyze the transcribed data. Interviewees included media reporters, media supervisors, health and medical institution executives or spokespersons, and social observers. Results Altogether, 35 interviewees were recruited for in-depth interviews, and the duration of the interview ranged from 1 hour to 2 hours. Results revealed that the most important characteristics of health/medical institutions spokespersons are professional competence and good interaction with the media. In contrast, the most important behaviors they should avoid are concealing the truth and misreporting the truth. Three major flaws of spokespersons\u0027 performance were identified: they included poor understanding of media needs and landscape; blaming the media to cover up a mistake they made in an announcement; and lack of sufficient participation in decision-making or of authorization from the head of organization.

METHODS: Prospective, observational, multicenter study from 23 June 2009 through 11 February 2010, reported in the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) H1N1 registry. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with completed outcome data were analyzed. Invasive mechanical ventilation was used in 155 (70.5%). Sixty-seven (30.5%) of the patients died in ICU and 75 (34.1%) whilst in hospital. One hundred twenty-six (57.3%) patients received corticosteroid therapy on admission to ICU. Patients who received corticosteroids were significantly older and were more likely to have coexisting asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic steroid use. These patients receiving corticosteroids had increased likelihood of developing hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) [26.2% versus 13.8%, p \u003C 0.05; odds ratio (OR) 2.2, confidence interval (CI) 1.1\u20134.5]. Patients who received corticosteroids had significantly higher ICU mortality than patients who did not (46.0% versus 18.1%, p \u003C 0.01; OR 3.8, CI 2.1\u20137.2). Cox regression analysis adjusted for severity and potential confounding factors identified that early use of corticosteroids was not significantly associated with mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1.3, 95% CI 0.7\u20132.4, p = 0.4] but was still associated with an increased rate of HAP (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.0\u20134.8, p \u003C 0.05).

To date, little information is available on the Arfs in the economically important giant freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii and their relationship to viral infection. Here we identified two Arf genes from M. rosenbergii (MrArf1 and MrArf2) for the first time. Phylogenetic analysis showed that MrArf1, together with MjArf1 from shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus belonged to Class I Arfs. By contrast, MrArf2 didn\u0027t not match any of the Arfs classes of I/II/III, although it could be clustered with an Arf protein from M. japonicas called MjArfn, which may represent an analog of the Arf. MrArf1 was ubiquitously expressed in all the examined tissues, with the highest transcription level in the hepatopancreas, whereas MrArf2 was only highly expressed in the hepatopancreas and exhibited very low levels in the heart, stomach, gills and intestine. The expression level of MrArf1 in the gills was down-regulated post 24 h WSSV challenge, and reached the maximal level at 48 h. MrArf1 in the hepatopancreas went up from 24 to 48 h WSSV challenge. MrArf2 transcript in the gill also went down at 24 h and then was upregulated at 48 h WSSV challenge. MrArf2 increased significantly in the hepatopancreas 24 h after infection and then went down at 48 h WSSV challenge. RNAi results showed that knockdown of MrArf1 or MrArf2 could inhibit the expression of the envelope protein gene vp28 of the WSSV.

Since new methods of pathogens eradication must be invented and implemented, nanotechnology seems to have become the response to that acute need. A remarkable achievement in this field of science was the creation of self-disinfecting surfaces that base on advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). Thus, the phenomenon of photocatalysis was practically applied. Among the AOPs that have been most studied in respect of their ability to eradicate viruses, prions, bacteria, yeasts, and molds, there are the processes of TiO(2)/UV and ZnO/UV. Titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) and zinc oxide (ZnO) act as photocatalysts, after they have been powdered to nanoparticles. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is an agent that determines their excitation. Methods using photocatalytic properties of nanosized TiO(2) and ZnO prove to be highly efficient in inactivation of infectious agents. Therefore, they are being applied on a growing scale. AOP-based disinfection is regarded as a very promising tool that might help overcome problems in food hygiene and public health protection. The susceptibility of infectious agents to photocatalylic processes can be generally arranged in the following order: viruses \u003E prions \u003E Gram-negative bacteria \u003E Gram-positive bacteria \u003E yeasts \u003E molds.","publish_time":"2015-08-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bogdan, Janusz; Zarzy\u0144ska, Joanna; P\u0142awi\u0144ska-Czarnak, Joanna","journal":"Nanoscale Res Lett","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8d6ac4365bc4ab3f85ea3a5c287cddfaef482707.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4523504.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s11671-015-1023-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26239879/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsyOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZnO/UV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["processes of TiO","ZnO","UV","Gram-negative bacteria","prions","Gram-positive bacteria","viruses","yeasts","photocatalylic processes","molds","AOPs","Nanotechnology","new methods of pathogens eradication","advanced oxidation processes","susceptibility of infectious agents","inactivation of infectious agents","effective eradication of pathogens","food hygiene","photocatalytic properties of nanosized TiO","food processing plants","creation of self-disinfecting surfaces","problems","field of science","veterinary clinics","public health protection","ability","hospitals","zinc oxide","traditional drugs","following order","remarkable achievement","disinfectants","response","respect","radiation","photocatalysts","promising tool","AOP-based disinfection","acute need","Titanium dioxide","phenomenon of photocatalysis","growing scale","excitation","nanoparticles"],"language":"en"},

High\u2010density 60\u201370\u2010mer oligonucleotide microarrays have been explored for broad detection of many viruses. However, relatively low specificity and the complex analytical processes are the major limitations when pan\u2010viral oligonucleotide microarrays are used to detect viral pathogens. In this study, genus\u2010specific oligonucleotides were used as probes and modified sample preparations were carried out to improve the specificity and accuracy of the pan\u2010viral oligonucleotide microarray. Genus\u2010specific 63\u2010mer oligonucleotide probes were used for screening human pathogenic RNA viruses. A total of 628 oligonucleotide probes covering 32 RNA viral genera from 14 viral families were used. The number of oligonucleotide probes was decreased to simplify the analytical process of hybridization and to minimize cross\u2010hybridization. Host genomes were removed by DNase I/RNase T1 digestion before viral nucleic acid extraction, and non\u2010ribosomal hexanucleotides were used for reverse transcription to minimize interference of host genomes. Cultured viruses were used for microarray validation. The microarray was validated by cultured isolates that belonged to five viral genera. By using DNase I/RNase T1 digestion before viral nucleic acid extraction and non\u2010ribosomal hexanucleotides for reverse transcription, the specificity of the microarray was improved. Furthermore, the analytical process of hybridization results was simplified. The specificity of pan\u2010viral microarray could be improved by using genus\u2010specific oligonucleotides as probes and by using non\u2010ribosomal hexanucleotides for reverse transcription. Combined with subsequent degenerate reverse transcriptase\u2010polymerase chain reaction and sequencing processes, this improved genus\u2010specific oligonucleotides microarray provides a relatively flexible strategy for diagnosis of RNA virus diseases.

Occurring as trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, collagenase, thrombin, subtilisin etc., it mediates a diverse array of functions, including pathological roles as inflammatory, coagulatory to haemorrhagic. This review emphasizes that despite the superficial differences in mechanisms, most health issues, be they infectious, allergic, metabolic, or neural have a common conduit. This enzyme, in its various glycosylated forms leads to signal misinterpretations, wreaking havoc. However, organisms are endowed with serine protease inhibitors which might restrain this ubiquitous yet deleterious enzyme.

Among them, a high mannose (HM)-binding anti-HIV lectin, ESA-2 from the red alga Eucheuma serra, showed the highest inhibition against infection with an EC(50) of 12.4 nM. Moreover, ESA-2 exhibited a wide range of antiviral spectrum against various influenza strains with EC(50)s of pico molar to low nanomolar levels. Besides ESA-2, HM-binding plant lectin ConA, fucose-binding lectins such as fungal AOL from Aspergillus oryzae and AAL from Aleuria aurantia were active against H1N1-2009, but the potency of inhibition was of less magnitude compared with ESA-2. Direct interaction between ESA-2 and a viral envelope glycoprotein, hemagglutinin (HA), was demonstrated by ELISA assay. This interaction was effectively suppressed by glycoproteins bearing HM-glycans, indicating that ESA-2 binds to the HA of influenza virus through HM-glycans. Upon treatment with ESA-2, no viral antigens were detected in the host cells, indicating that ESA-2 inhibited the initial steps of virus entry into the cells. ESA-2 would thus be useful as a novel microbicide to prevent penetration of viruses such as HIV and influenza viruses to the host cells.","publish_time":"2015-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sato, Yuichiro; Morimoto, Kinjiro; Kubo, Takanori; Sakaguchi, Takemasa; Nishizono, Akira; Hirayama, Makoto; Hori, Kanji","journal":"Mar Drugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e83f87fdf5b15fb7962c1b6235b520817924a9b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4483639.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/md13063454; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26035023/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjszMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDCK","EC","AOL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ESA","influenza viruses","HA of influenza virus","HM-glycans","host cells","MDCK cells","HM-binding plant lectin ConA","various influenza strains","recent pandemic influenza","fucose-binding lectins","anti-HIV lectin","Lectin sensitivity","H1N1","penetration of viruses","highest inhibition","initial steps of virus entry","viral antigens","potency of inhibition","ELISA assay","Direct interaction","neutral red dye uptake assay","various carbohydrate specificity","viral envelope glycoprotein","red alga Eucheuma serra","AAL","Aspergillus oryzae","fungal AOL","Aleuria aurantia","wide range of antiviral spectrum","s of pico molar","low nanomolar levels","novel microbicide","hemagglutinin","binds","infection","magnitude","glycoproteins","high mannose","nM","treatment"],"language":"en"},

Individually housed calves were systematically assigned at birth to 1 of 2 feeding programs: free-access feeding (ad libitum) of acidified milk replacer (ACD, n=249) or traditional restricted feeding (3L fed twice daily) of milk replacer (RES, n=249). Calves were fed milk replacer containing 24% crude protein and 18% fat. Acidified milk replacer was prepared to a target pH between 4.0 and 4.5 using formic acid. Calves were weaned off milk replacer at approximately 6wk of age. Weaning occurred over 5d, and during this weaning period, ACD calves had access to milk replacer for 12h/d and RES calves were offered only one feeding of milk replacer (3 L) daily. Calves were monitored daily for signs of disease. Fecal consistency scores were assigned each week from birth until weaning. A subset of calves was systematically selected for fecal sampling at 3 time points between 7 and 27d of age. Fecal samples were analyzed for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli F5, Cryptosporidium parvum, rotavirus, and coronavirus. Hip width, hip height, body length, heart girth, and body weight were measured at birth and weaning. Postweaning body weight measurements were collected from the heifers at approximately 8mo of age. Postweaning body weight and carcass grading information was collected from the veal calves at slaughter once a live weight between 300 and 350kg had been achieved. The odds of ACD calves being treated for a preweaning disease event tended to be lower than that of the RES calves (1.2 vs. 5.2%, respectively). Preweaning mortality, postweaning disease treatment, and postweaning mortality did not differ between feeding treatments. The ACD feeding treatment supported greater preweaning average daily gain (0.59 vs. 0.43kg/d) and structural growth than RES feeding. Postweaning average daily gain and carcass characteristics were similar for ACD and RES calves. These results indicate that free-access acidified milk replacer feeding tended to support improved health, and greater body weight gain and structural growth during the preweaning period; these effects did not persist in the postweaning period. The growth advantage observed before weaning in the ACD calves likely disappeared due to the weaning methods used.","publish_time":"2017-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Todd, C. G.; Leslie, K.

The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019 and is currently still ongoing. This novel coronavirus is highly contagious and has resulted in a continuously increasing number of infections and deaths that have already surpassed the SARS-CoV outbreak that occurred in China between 2002 and 2003. It is now officially a pandemic, announced by WHO on the 11th of March. Currently, the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) can be identified by virus isolation or viral nucleic acid detection; however, false negatives associated with the nucleic acid detection provide a clinical challenge and thus make the imaging examination crucial. Imaging exams have been a main clinical diagnostic criteria for the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China. Imaging features of multiple patchy areas of ground glass opacity and consolidation predominately in the periphery of the lungs are characteristic manifestations on chest CT and extremely helpful in the early detection and diagnosis of this disease, which aids prompt diagnosis and the eventual control of this emerging global health emergency. Key Points \u2022 In December 2019, China, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel, highly contagious coronavirus raised grave concerns and posed a huge threat to global public health. \u2022 Among the infected patients, characteristic findings on CT imaging include multiple, patchy, ground-glass opacity, crazy-paving pattern, and consolidation shadows, mainly distributed in the peripheral and subpleural areas of both lungs, which are very helpful for the frontline clinicians. \u2022 Imaging examination has become the indispensable means not only in the early detection and diagnosis but also in monitoring the clinical course, evaluating the disease severity, and may be presented as an important warning signal preceding the negative RT-PCR test results.

Results The first patient developed respiratory symptoms and fever 14 days after admission to hospital for an unrelated reason. He died 11 days later with multi-organ failure. Two of his brothers presented later to another hospital with respiratory symptoms and fever. MERS-CoV infection in the latter 2 patients was confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing. All 3 patients had fever, cough, shortness of breath, bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia and rises in serum creatinine kinase and alanine transaminase. No hospital or other social contacts are known to have acquired the infection. It appears that the index patient in this cluster acquired MERS-CoV infection whilst in hospital from an unrecognized mild or asymptomatic case.

Smallpox was eradicated using a mass vaccination strategy. The major successes in controlling infectious diseases in the 1950s and 1960s was followed by two coincident global trends that would have an impact on the dramatic reemergence of infectious diseases in the waning years of the twentieth century. The first was the redirection of the resources that were once used to control infectious diseases to other public health priorities, such as the \u201CWar on Cancer\u201D in the early 1970s. The perception that infectious diseases were no longer a problem led to decreased resources, widespread deterioration of public health infrastructure to deal with infectious diseases, and complacency among government and public health officials as well as the public. This trend included medical education with a deemphasis on preventive medicine and a strong focus on curative medicine in medical schools. The second trend was the sharply increasing and unprecedented rate of human population growth following World War II that has continued for 60 years. Increasing human numbers have been a principal factor leading to uncontrolled urbanization, changes in agriculture, land use and animal husbandry practices, and accelerated globalization, all of which have been major and interrelated drivers of the reemergence of epidemic infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilcox, Bruce A.; Gubler, Duane J.; Pizer, H.

Here, we report genetic analysis of a ts strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), tsNC11, focusing on the role of mutations in the macrodomain (MAC) and the papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) domain of nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3), a component of the viral replication complex. Using MHV reverse genetics, we generated a series of mutant viruses to define the contributions of macrodomain- and PLP2-specific mutations to the ts phenotype. Viral replication kinetics and efficiency-of-plating analysis performed at permissive and nonpermissive temperatures revealed that changes in the macrodomain alone were both necessary and sufficient for the ts phenotype. Interestingly, mutations in the PLP2 domain were not responsible for the temperature sensitivity but did reduce the frequency of reversion of macrodomain mutants. Coimmunoprecipitation studies are consistent with an interaction between the macrodomain and PLP2. Expression studies of the macrodomain-PLP2 portion of nsp3 indicate that the ts mutations enhance proteasome-mediated degradation of the protein. Furthermore, we found that during virus infection, the replicase proteins containing the MAC and PLP2 mutations were more rapidly degraded at the nonpermissive temperature than were the wild-type proteins. Importantly, we show that the macrodomain and PLP2 mutant viruses trigger production of type I interferon in vitro and are attenuated in mice, further highlighting the importance of the macrodomain-PLP2 interplay in viral pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) are emerging human and veterinary pathogens with pandemic potential. Despite the established and predicted threat these viruses pose to human health, there are currently no approved countermeasures to control infections with these viruses in humans. Viral macrodomains, enzymes that remove posttranslational ADP-ribosylation of proteins, and viral multifunctional papain-like proteases, enzymes that cleave polyproteins and remove polyubiquitin chains via deubiquitinating activity, are two important virulence factors. Here, we reveal an unanticipated interplay between the macrodomain and the PLP2 domain that is important for replication and antagonizing the host innate immune response. Targeting the interaction of these enzymes may provide new therapeutic opportunities to treat CoV disease.","publish_time":"2019-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deng, Xufang; Mettelman, Robert C.; O\u2019Brien, Amornrat; Thompson, John A.; O\u2019Brien, Timothy E.; Baker, Susan C.","journal":"Journal of Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2af60a6edf5657d366fc1f0ee1f3fda18b9418a3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6613754.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02140-18; https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/93/12/e02140-18.full.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30918076/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjszNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MAC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PLP2 mutations","macrodomain-PLP2 interplay","PLP2 domain","PLP2 mutant viruses","macrodomain-PLP2 portion of nsp3","ts mutations","contributions of macrodomain","PLP2-specific mutations","macrodomain mutants","viral pathogenesis","Viral replication kinetics","viral replication complex","ts phenotype","Viral macrodomains","enzymes","series of mutant viruses","viral multifunctional papain","Analysis of temperature","role of mutations","genetic analysis","ts strain of mouse hepatitis virus","replicase proteins","wild-type proteins","plating analysis","domain of nonstructural protein","temperature sensitivity","interaction","emerging human","human health","genetic loci","production of type","virus infection","nonpermissive temperatures","IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses","Coimmunoprecipitation studies","Expression studies","unanticipated interplay","important virulence factors","MHV reverse genetics","deubiquitinating activity","classic method","veterinary pathogens","posttranslational ADP-ribosylation","new therapeutic opportunities","polyproteins","CoVs","researchers","proteases","proteasome-mediated degradation","efficiency","polyubiquitin chains","pandemic potential","predicted threat","CoV disease","tsNC11","infections","host","interferon","frequency of reversion","changes","component","approved countermeasures","immune response","mice","humans"],"language":"en"},

In this study, a variant PEDV strain YN1 was isolated, serially propagated on the Vero cells and was characterized for 200 passages. To better elucidate the molecular basis of Vero cell adaptation of variant PEDV strains, we sequenced, compared, and analyzed the full-genome sequences of parental YN1 and passages 15, 30, 60, 90, 144, and 200. The results showed that the variations increased with the viral passage. The nucleotides sequences of non-structural protein (NSP)2, NSP4-7, NSP10, NSP12 and NSP13 genes did not change during the Vero cell adaptation process. After comparison of the variation characteristic of classical, variant virulent/attenuated strains, it was found that attenuation of PEDV virus was associated with 9\u221226 amino acid (aa) changes in open reading frames (ORF) 1a/b and S protein, early termination in ORF3, 1\u20133 aa changes in E, M and N protein and some nucleotide sequences\u2019 synonymous mutations. The aa deletion at about 144 aa of S protein could be the attenuation marker for the PEDV. The pig study showed that the early termination in ORF3 was more important for virus cell adaptation than virus attenuation.","publish_time":"2015-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Fangzhou; Zhu, Yinxing; Wu, Meizhou; Ku, Xugang; Ye, Shiyi; Li, Zhonghua; Guo, Xiaozhen; He, Qigai","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bfe634ff1fa0e8f0a43c1bd5fa6e0b5bd17705ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4632399.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26512689/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v7102891","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjszODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["attenuation of PEDV virus","virus attenuation","virus cell adaptation","aa of S protein","variant PEDV strain YN1","aa changes","variant porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","molecular basis of Vero cell adaptation of variant PEDV strains","N protein","Vero cell adaptation process","aa deletion","ORF3","early termination","nucleotides sequences of non-structural protein","Vero cells","attenuation marker","passages","outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea","attenuated strains","genome sequences of parental YN1","pig study","variation characteristic of classical","open reading frames","nucleotide sequences\u2019 synonymous mutations","etiological agent responsible","NSP10","NSP12","NSP4","NSP13 genes","amino acid","variations","comparison","viral passage","results"],"language":"en"},

Data loggers were deployed on eight of 54 A. jubatus (two males and six females) captured near Subic Bay on the Philippine island of Luzon between 22 November and 2 December 2010. Bodyweight ranged from 730 g to 1002 g, translating to a weight burden of 3\u20134% of bodyweight. Six of the eight loggers yielded useful data over 2\u201310 days, showing variability in the nature and range of individual bat movements. The majority of foraging locations were in closed forest and most were remote from evident human activity. Forty-six discrete foraging locations and five previously unrecorded roost locations were identified. Our findings indicate that foraging is not a random event, with the majority of bats exhibiting repetitious foraging movements night-to-night, that apparently intact forest provides the primary foraging resource, and that known roost locations substantially underestimate the true number (and location) of roosts.

The infection has become recognized as the most important and prevalent arboviral disease in humans, endemic in almost 100 countries worldwide. Nearly 3 billion people live in areas with transmission risk. Autochthonous transmission of the virus in previously disease-free areas, increased incidence in endemic areas, and epidemic resurgence in controlled regions could increase the risk of contracting more severe forms of the disease, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)/dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Symptomatic dengue virus infection can present with a wide range of clinical manifestations, from mild fever to life-threatening DSS. Thoracic complications may manifest as pleural effusion, pneumonitis, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and hemorrhage/hemoptysis.

However, it is gradually being phased out from clinical use against malaria due to emergence of CQ-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains. Besides low cost and tolerability, ongoing research has revealed interesting biochemical properties of CQ that have inspired its repurposing/repositioning in the management of various infectious/noninfectious diseases. Consequently, several novel compounds and compositions based on its scaffold have been studied and patented. Areas covered: In this review, patents describing CQ and its derivatives/compositions over the last 5 years are analyzed. The review highlights the rationale, chemical structures, biological evaluation and potential therapeutic application of CQ, its derivatives and compositions. Expert opinion: Repurposing efforts have dominantly focused on racemic CQ with no studies exploring the effect of the (R) and (S) enantiomers, which might potentially have additional benefits in other diseases. Additionally, evaluating other similarly acting antimalarials in clinical use and structural analogs could help maximize the intrinsic value of the 4-aminoquinolines. With regard to cancer therapy, successful repurposing of CQ-containing compounds will require linking the mode of action of these antimalarials with the signaling pathways that drive cancer cell proliferation to facilitate the development of a 4-amino-7-chloroquinoline that can be used as a synergistic partner in anticancer combination chemotherapy.","publish_time":"2015-05-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Njaria, Paul M; Okombo, John; Njuguna, Nicholas M; Chibale, Kelly","journal":"Expert Opin Ther Pat","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64ddf3f7f6113e50ec8222dbf6cacd5f71b6b6e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103710.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7103710/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzUyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CQ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emergence of CQ","racemic CQ","successful repurposing of CQ","compositions","potential therapeutic application of CQ","interesting biochemical properties of CQ","Repurposing efforts","antimalarials","clinical use","derivatives","review","cancer therapy","noninfectious diseases","novel compounds","cancer cell proliferation","biological evaluation","ongoing research","chemical structures","structural analogs","management of various infectious","tolerability","rationale","resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains","anticancer combination chemotherapy","synergistic partner","low cost","development","repositioning","pathways","regard","intrinsic value","enantiomers","antimalarial effects","World War","Expert opinion","studies","scaffold","patents","additional benefits","mode of action","aminoquinolines","Introduction","Chloroquine","chloroquinoline","Areas","years"],"language":"en"},

We show that an arrangement of three E-M heterotetramers (EM(3)) works as a bending unit and an ordered cluster of five such units generates a closed vesicle, reminiscent of the virus budding process. In silico mutagenesis of two charged residues of the anchor helices of the envelope proteins of DENV shows that Arg-471 and Arg-60 are fundamental to produce bending stress on the membrane.

The main role of the capsid is to protect the viral genome against external aggressions, facilitating its safe and efficient encapsulation and delivery. As a consequence, viral capsids have developed astonishing mechanical properties that are crucial for viral function. These remarkable properties have started to be unveiled in single-virus nanoindentation experiments, and are opening the door to the use of viral-derived artificial nanocages for promising bio- and nano-technological applications. However, the interpretation of nanoindentation experiments is often difficult, requiring the support of theoretical and simulation analysis. Here we present a \u2018Virtual AFM\u2019 (VAFM), a Brownian Dynamics simulation of a coarse-grained model of virus aimed to mimic the standard setup of atomic force microscopy (AFM) nanoindentation experiments. Despite the heavy level of coarse-graining, these simulations provide valuable information which is not accessible in experiments. Rather than focusing on a specific virus, the VAFM will be used to analyze how the mechanical response and breaking of viruses depend on different parameters controlling the effective interactions between capsid\u2019s structural units. In particular, we will discuss the influence of adsorption, the tip radius, and the rigidity and shape of the shell on its mechanical response.","publish_time":"2018-07-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aznar, Mar\u00EDa; Roca-Bonet, Sergi; Reguera, David","journal":"J Phys Condens Matter","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee44e697ab096bc73292289284015b8de94ea698.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104910.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104910/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzU4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VAFM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["single-virus nanoindentation experiments","interpretation of nanoindentation experiments","use of viral","viral capsids","viral genome","viral function","specific virus","mechanical response","coarse-grained model of virus","astonishing mechanical properties","VAFM","simulation analysis","protein shell","Virtual AFM","remarkable properties","Brownian Dynamics simulation","promising bio","derived artificial nanocages","standard setup of atomic force microscopy","graining","effective interactions","tip radius","different parameters","valuable information","external aggressions","capsid\u2019s structural units","simulations","nano-technological applications","support of theoretical","rigidity","viruses","shape","influence of adsorption","efficient encapsulation","heavy level of coarse","delivery","consequence","door","genetic material","important components","main role"],"language":"en"},

Targets for the prophylactic or therapeutic interventions include interaction of the spike (S) glycoprotein (S1 domain) with the host cell receptor, fusion of the S2 domain with the host cell membrane, processing of the replicase polyproteins by the virus-encoded proteases (3C-like cysteine protease [3CLpro] and papain-like cysteine protease) and other virus-encoded enzymes such as the NTPase/helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Human monoclonal antibody blocking S1 may play an important role in the immunoprophylaxis of SARS. Fusion inhibitors reminiscent of enfuvirtide in the case of HIV may also be developed for SARS-CoV. Various peptidomimetic and nonpeptidic inhibitors of 3CLpro have been described, the best ones inhibiting SARS-CoV replication with a selectivity index greater than 1000. Human interferons, in particular \u03B1- and \u03B2-interferon, as well as short interfering RNAs could further be pursued for the control of SARS. Various other compounds, often with an ill-defined mode of action but selectivity indexes up to 100, have been reported to exhibit in vitro activity against SARS-CoV: valinomycin, glycopeptide antibiotics, plant lectins, hesperetin, glycyrrhizin, aurintricarboxylic acid, chloroquine, niclosamide, nelfinavir and calpain inhibitors.","publish_time":"2014-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Clercq, Erik","journal":"Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3bffb39e16b2f75f62a687c206ff6c51536386da.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105749.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7105749/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzU5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV replication","immunoprophylaxis of SARS","control of SARS","S1 domain","CLpro","cysteine protease","calpain inhibitors","nonpeptidic inhibitors","Fusion inhibitors reminiscent of enfuvirtide","host cell membrane","host cell receptor","virus-encoded proteases","virus-encoded enzymes","S2 domain","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","selectivity indexes","Human interferons","Various peptidomimetic","selectivity index greater","Human monoclonal antibody","hesperetin","valinomycin","plant lectins","glycopeptide antibiotics","chloroquine","aurintricarboxylic acid","glycyrrhizin","spike","niclosamide","helicase","replicase polyproteins","therapeutic interventions","interaction","particular \u03B1","nelfinavir","NTPase","processing","ill-defined mode of action","important role","best ones","severe acute respiratory syndrome","\u03B2-interferon","prophylactic","glycoprotein","papain","coronavirus","case of HIV","Targets","compounds","infections","activity","short interfering RNAs","number of antivirals"],"language":"en"},

The CIDR\u03B11 domain of PfEMP1 is responsible for binding host endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), and increasing evidence support that this interaction triggers severe malaria, accounting for the majority of malaria-related deaths. In high transmission regions, children develop immunity to severe malaria after the first few infections. This immunity is believed to be mediated by antibodies targeting and inhibiting PfEMP1, causing infected erythrocytes to circulate and be cleared in the spleen. The development of immunity to malaria coincides with acquisition of broad antibody reactivity across the CIDR\u03B11 protein family. Altogether, this identifies CIDR\u03B11 as an important vaccine target. However, the antigenic diversity of the CIDR\u03B11 domain family is a challenge for vaccine development. METHODS: Immune responses in mice vaccinated with Virus-Like Particles (VLP) presenting CIDR\u03B11 antigens were investigated. Antibody reactivity was tested to a panel of recombinant CIDR\u03B11 domains, and the antibodies ability to inhibit EPCR binding by the recombinant CIDR\u03B11 domains was tested in Luminex-based multiplex assays. RESULTS: VLP-presented CIDR\u03B11.4 antigens induced a rapid and strong IgG response capable of inhibiting EPCR-binding of multiple CIDR\u03B11 domains mainly within the group A CIDR\u03B11.4\u20137 subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: The study observations mirror those from previous CIDR\u03B11 vaccine studies using other vaccine constructs and platforms. This suggests that broad CIDR\u03B11 antibody reactivity may be achieved through vaccination with a limited number of CIDR\u03B11 variants. In addition, this study suggest that this may be achieved through vaccination with a human compatible VLP vaccine platform.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harmsen, Charlotte; Turner, Louise; Thrane, Susan; Sander, Adam F.; Theander, Thor G.; Lavstsen, Thomas","journal":"Malar J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e787f350feb2b86d0273a5c7c1e2dfc7adfbb70b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106694.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7106694/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzYxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["P. falciparum Erythrocyte Membrane Protein","EPCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CIDR\u03B11 antigens","CIDR\u03B11 protein family","CIDR\u03B11 domain of PfEMP1","multiple CIDR\u03B11 domains","CIDR\u03B11 domain family","broad CIDR\u03B11 antibody reactivity","previous CIDR\u03B11 vaccine studies","panel of recombinant CIDR\u03B11 domains","limited number of CIDR\u03B11 variants","severe malaria","vaccine development","EPCR binding","majority of malaria","vaccine constructs","inhibiting PfEMP1","development of immunity","important vaccine target","acquisition of broad antibody reactivity","human compatible VLP vaccine platform","Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites express","vaccination","infected erythrocytes","binding host endothelial protein C receptor","falciparum Erythrocyte Membrane Protein","strong IgG response capable of inhibiting EPCR-binding","antibodies ability","study observations mirror","erythrocytic cycle","children","mice","Virus","accounting","Luminex","Particles","challenge","high transmission regions","Immune responses","interaction","antigenic diversity","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","related deaths","platforms","evidence","vascular lining","multiplex assays","BACKGROUND","infections","RESULTS","addition","subgroups","spleen"],"language":"en"},

However, the precise evolutionary and ecological mechanisms characterizing a successful cross-species transmission event remain to be elucidated. Here, in addition to expanding and clarifying our previous description of the adaptation of a diverse, naturally occurring SIVsm inoculum to a new rhesus macaque host, we present an analytical framework for understanding the selective forces driving viral adaptation to a new host. A preliminary analysis of large-scale changes in virus population structure revealed that viruses replicating in the macaques were subject to increasing levels of selection through day 70 postinfection (p.i.), whereas contemporaneous viruses in the mangabeys remained similar to the source inoculum. Three different site-by-site methods were employed to identify the amino acid sites responsible for this macaque-specific selection. Of 124 amino acid sites analyzed, 3 codons in V2, a 2\u2013amino acid shift in an N-linked glycosylation site, and variation at 2 sites in the highly charged region were consistently evolving under either directional or diversifying selection at days 40 and 70 p.i.

Human bocavirus (HBoV) was recently discovered in children with respiratory tract disease and gastroenteritis. The causative role of HBoV in human gastroenteritis remains uncertain, and, to our knowledge, no previous case-control study has studied the relationship between HBoV and gastroenteritis. Methods. We conducted a case-control study that examined stool samples from 397 children with diarrhea and from 115 asymptomatic control subjects. HBoV was detected using polymerase chain reaction. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the HBoV loads in case and control groups. Common enteric viruses were examined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, polymerase chain reaction, and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results. At least 1 viral agent was discovered in 60.2% of cases. HBoV was detected in 14 samples, and 9 were coinfected with either rotavirus (7 of 14 samples) or human calicivirus (2 of 14). Many (8 [57.1%] of 14) of the HBoV infections occurred during September-December 2006. Most (12 [85.7%]) of the HBoV-infected children were 7\u201318 months of age. The percentage of children with HBoV infection did not differ significantly between case patients and control subjects (3.5% vs. 3.5%), and the statistical analysis did not support a correlation between HBoV infection and more-severe clinical symptoms. The viral load differences between the 2 groups were not statistically significant (P = .09, by log-normal Student\u0027s t test). In addition, the VP1/VP2 partial gene of HBoV from case patients and control subjects showed minimal sequence variation. Conclusions. A single genetic lineage of HBoV was revealed in persons in China. Despite its high prevalence in stool samples, our study does not support a causative role of HBoV in gastroenteritis.","publish_time":"2008-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Wei-xia; Jin, Yu; Duan, Zhao-jun; Xu, Zi-qian; Qi, Hong-mei; Zhang, Qing; Yu, Jie-mei; Zhu, Lin; Jin, Miao; Liu, Na; Cui, Shu-xian; Li, Hui-ying; Fang, Zhao-yin","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3186f38a1e7c1edd1b6a1d17fef30a79b9124801.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107984.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107984/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozc4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["HBoV infections","HBoV-infected children","causative role of HBoV","control groups","VP2 partial gene of HBoV","single genetic lineage of HBoV","previous case-control study","case patients","human gastroenteritis","asymptomatic control subjects","Real-time polymerase chain reaction","stool samples","reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction","percentage of children","human calicivirus","Human bocavirus","viral agent","viral load differences","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays","diarrhea","VP1","minimal sequence variation","log-normal Student\u0027s t test","respiratory tract disease","correlation","knowledge","relationship","severe clinical symptoms","Common enteric viruses","high prevalence","addition","persons","statistical analysis","months of age","China","rotavirus","Background","Methods","Results","cases","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

With the drastic increase in the cost of aerosolized RBV, we aimed to compare outcomes of hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients treated with oral or aerosolized RBV for RSV infections. METHODS: We reviewed the records of 124 HCT recipients with RSV infections treated with oral or aerosolized RBV from September 2014 through April 2017. An immunodeficiency scoring index (ISI) was used to classify patients as low, moderate, or high risk for progression to lower respiratory infection (LRI) or death. RESULTS: Seventy patients (56%) received aerosolized RBV and 54 (44%) oral RBV. Both groups had a 27% rate of progression to LRI (P = 1.00). Mortality rates did not significantly differ between groups (30-day: aerosolized 10%, oral 9%, P = 1.00; 90-day: aerosolized 23%, oral 11%, P = .10). Classification and regression tree analysis identified ISI \u22657 as an independent predictor of 30-day mortality. For patients with ISI \u22657, 30-day mortality was significantly increased overall, yet remained similar between the aerosolized and oral therapy groups (33% for both). After propensity score adjustment, Cox proportional hazards models showed similar mortality rates between oral and aerosolized therapy groups (30-day: hazard ratio [HR], 1.12 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .345\u20133.65, P = .845). CONCLUSIONS: HCT recipients with RSV infections had similar outcomes when treated with aerosolized or oral RBV. Oral ribavirin may be an effective alternative to aerosolized RBV, with potential significant cost savings.","publish_time":"2019-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Foolad, Farnaz; Aitken, Samuel L; Shigle, Terri Lynn; Prayag, Amrita; Ghantoji, Shashank; Ariza-Heredia, Ella; Chemaly, Roy F","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a413760cebf82b6c766216a590fd5455ee49db61.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108094.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108094/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozc5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","RBV","ISI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["oral RBV","cost of aerosolized RBV","aerosolized therapy groups","oral therapy groups","day mortality","use of oral ribavirin","RSV infections","HCT recipients","similar mortality rates","ISI","patients","similar outcomes","LRI","rate of progression","lower respiratory infection","respiratory syncytial virus","outcomes of hematopoietic cell transplant","potential significant cost savings","Cox proportional hazards models","high risk","propensity score adjustment","effective alternative","regression tree analysis","Classification","records","independent predictor","CONCLUSIONS","hazard ratio","drastic increase","death","HR","BACKGROUND","confidence interval","immunodeficiency","index","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Although demyelination is a common symptom in FRDA patients, no multicellular model has yet been developed to study the involvement of glial cells in FRDA. Using the recently established RNAi lines for targeted suppression of frataxin in Drosophila, we were able to study the effects of general versus glial-specific frataxin downregulation. In particular, we wanted to study the interplay between lowered frataxin content, lipid accumulation and peroxidation and the consequences of these effects on the sensitivity to oxidative stress and fly fitness. Interestingly, ubiquitous frataxin reduction leads to an increase in fatty acids catalyzing an enhancement of lipid peroxidation levels, elevating the intracellular toxic potential. Specific loss of frataxin in glial cells triggers a similar phenotype which can be visualized by accumulating lipid droplets in glial cells. This phenotype is associated with a reduced lifespan, an increased sensitivity to oxidative insult, neurodegenerative effects and a serious impairment of locomotor activity. These symptoms fit very well with our observation of an increase in intracellular toxicity by lipid peroxides. Interestingly, co-expression of a Drosophila apolipoprotein D ortholog (glial lazarillo) has a strong protective effect in our frataxin models, mainly by controlling the level of lipid peroxidation. Our results clearly support a strong involvement of glial cells and lipid peroxidation in the generation of FRDA-like symptoms.","publish_time":"2010-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Navarro, Juan A.; Ohmann, Elisabeth; Sanchez, Diego; Botella, Jos\u00E9 A.; Liebisch, Gerhard; Molt\u00F3, Mar\u00EDa D.; Ganfornina, Mar\u00EDa D.; Schmitz, Gerd; Schneuwly, Stephan","journal":"Hum Mol Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/966d4620700365cee6c1e5731ff4e8e47a56af9d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108586.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108586/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozg3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["glial-specific frataxin downregulation","frataxin models","level of lipid peroxidation","glial lazarillo","lipid accumulation","lipid peroxides","strong involvement of glial cells","Specific loss of frataxin","enhancement of lipid peroxidation levels","targeted suppression of frataxin","lowered frataxin content","ubiquitous frataxin reduction","mitochondrial protein frataxin","accumulating lipid droplets","FRDA patients","generation of FRDA","neurodegenerative effects","effects of general","symptoms","increased sensitivity","oxidative insult","oxidative stress","intracellular toxicity","common symptom","similar phenotype","Friedreich\u0027s ataxia","common form of autosomal recessive ataxia","strong protective effect","intracellular toxic potential","Drosophila apolipoprotein D ortholog","deficit","fatty acids","consequences","established RNAi lines","co-expression","serious impairment of locomotor activity","reduced lifespan","fly fitness","observation","interplay","multicellular model","demyelination","results"],"language":"en"},

MIG antiserum increased the spread of virus and the proportion of spinal cord white matter with demyelination. Overall, viral antigen levels correlated strongly with the extent of pathology. At the RNA level, high virus expression was associated with low IL-2 and high IL-10 levels, and RANTES antiserum decreased the IL-2/IL-10 ratio.

However, the effects of Pelargonium sidoides and a special extract prepared from its roots (EPs 7630) on human immune cells are not fully understood. Here we demonstrate that EPs 7630 induced a rapid and dose-dependent production of TNF-\u03B1, IL-6, and IL-10 by human blood immune cells. This EPs 7630-induced cytokine profile was more pro-inflammatory in comparison with the profile induced by viral or bacterial infection-mimicking agents. The search for EPs 7630 target cells revealed that T-cells did not respond to EPs 7630 stimulation by production of TNF-\u03B1, IL-6, or IL-10. Furthermore, pretreatment of T-cells with EPs 7630 did not modulate their TNF-\u03B1, IL-6, and IL-10 secretion during subsequent activation. In contrast to lymphocytes, monocytes showed clear intracellular TNF-\u03B1 staining after EPs 7630 treatment. Accordingly, EPs 7630 predominantly provoked activation of MAP kinases and inhibition of p38 strongly reduced the monocyte TNF-\u03B1 production. The pretreatment of blood immune cells with EPs 7630 lowered their secretion of TNF-\u03B1 and IL-10 and caused an IL-6 dominant response during second stimulation with viral or bacterial infection-mimicking agents. In summary, we demonstrate that EPs 7630 activates human monocytes, induces MAP kinase-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokines in these cells, and specifically modulates their production capacity of mediators known to lead to an increase of acute phase protein production in the liver, neutrophil generation in the bone marrow, and the generation of adaptive Th17 and Th22 cells.","publish_time":"2015-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Witte, Katrin; Koch, Egon; Volk, Hans-Dieter; Wolk, Kerstin; Sabat, Robert","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24f4f393fb59daab089844e7af64e913d2951034.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4583277.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0138075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26406906/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pelargonium"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EPs","T-cells","human immune cells","monocyte TNF-\u03B1 production","target cells","Th22 cells","secretion of TNF","human blood immune cells","pretreatment of blood immune cells","dose-dependent production of TNF","clear intracellular TNF-\u03B1 staining","human monocytes","production capacity of mediators","stimulation","bacterial infection","induced cytokine profile","pretreatment of T","agents","increase of acute phase protein production","MAP kinase-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokines","effects of Pelargonium sidoides","neutrophil generation","provoked activation of MAP kinases","subsequent activation","generation of adaptive Th17","treatment of respiratory tract infections","liver","inhibition of p38","medical herb","bone marrow","special extract","lymphocytes","comparison","roots","dominant response","respective extracts","contrast","search","summary"],"language":"en"},

Although scientists worldwide have accumulated virus collections since the early twentieth century, the quality of the collections and the viruses collected may vary according to the personal interests and agenda of the scientists. Moreover, when laboratories are re-organised or closed, collections are no longer maintained and gradually cease to exist. The tragedy of 9/11 and other disruptive activities have also meant that some previously available biological reagents are no longer openly exchanged between countries. In 2008, funding under the FP7\u2013EU infrastructure programme enabled the initiation of the EVA. Within three years, it has developed from a consortium of nine European laboratories to encompass associated partners in Africa, Russia, China, Turkey, Germany and Italy. There is every reason to believe that EVA will continue to expand and ultimately exist as a globally networked, quality-controlled non-profit archive for the benefit of science.

However, the epidemiological and clinical characteristics remain unknown. Methods We collected demographic, epidemiological, and clinical data from 46 confirmed COVID-19 patients aged 10 to 35 years from the Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital. Several key epidemiological parameters, asymptomatic cases, transmission to family members, and clinical characteristics at admission and during treatment were summarized. Results Of 46 confirmed patients, 14 patients (30.4%) were aged between 10 and 24 years, and 24 (52.2%) patients were male. The estimated mean incubation period was 6.6 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.4\u20139.6). The median serial interval was 1.9 days (95% CI 0.4\u20136.2). Three of the asymptomatic cases showed transmission to their family members. Only one patient was identified as a severe case at admission. The common symptoms at admission were dry cough (34, 81.0%) and fever (29, 69.1%). Nearly 60% of the patients showed ground-glass opacity on chest computed tomography. Three patients developed acute kidney injury during treatment. Most of the patients (78.3%) recovered and were discharged by the end of the follow-up. Conclusions This single-center study with a relatively small sample size showed that adolescent and young adult patients with COVID-19 had a long incubation period and a short serial interval. The transmission occurred from asymptomatic cases to family members. Fewer patients developed complications during treatment.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liao, Jiaqiang; Fan, Shibing; Chen, Jing; Wu, Jianglin; Xu, Shunqing; Guo, Yuming; Li, Chunhui; Zhang, Xianxiang; Wu, Chuansha; Mou, Huaming; Song, Chenxi; Li, Feng; Wu, Guicheng; Zhang, Jingjing; Guo, Lian; Liu, Huawen; Lv, Jinglong; Xu, Lixin; Lang, Chunhui","journal":"The Innovation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b19549de3e1e9bc6eddb055de2584a3b7060cdd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666675820300011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666675820300011; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xinn.2020.04.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["confirmed patients","Fewer patients","young adult patients","asymptomatic cases","transmission","family members","admission","treatment","clinical characteristics","confirmed COVID","days","clinical data","key epidemiological parameters","short serial interval","median serial interval","confidence interval","years","long incubation period","young adults","key role","overseas study","estimated mean incubation period","single-center study","small sample size","ground-glass opacity","worldwide spread of Coronavirus Disease","chest computed tomography","dry cough","Chongqing","business","work","Summary Background Adolescents","common symptoms","demographic","acute kidney injury","Gorges Central Hospital","Conclusions","severe case","complications","travel","Methods","Results","end","follow-up","fever","male"],"language":"en"},

This delay was seen in the production of both intracellular and extracellular virus. However, the final titers were similar to those produced by MHV-infected cells maintained in normal medium. The manifestation of virus-induced cell fusion was similarly found to be delayed, but not otherwise decreased in severity, when ammonium chloride was present in the culture medium. Ammonium chloride caused similar delays in production of virus-specific, positive-sense RNAs and of viral polypeptides. The relative proportions and apparent molecular weights of viral RNAs and polypeptides were similar to those found in MHV-infected cells cultured in normal medium. In vitro translation of endogenously produced viral RNAs in cell extracts, prepared from MHV-infected cells, was not inhibited by ammonium chloride. Thus, ammonium chloride has no specific, inhibitory effect on viral protein synthesis. Ammonium chloride did not reduce the number of virus-infected cells in culture, as monitored by infectious center assay. Analysis of early events in MHV infection showed that ammonium chloride did not affect adsorption or internalization of MHV by L-2 cells. However, the subsequent eclipse phase, as monitored by decline in infectivity of internalized virus inoculum proceeded less efficiently in the presence of ammonium chloride. On the basis of the known inhibitory effects of ammonium chloride on lysosomal/endosomal functions, the results suggest an endosomal mechanism of MHV uncoating. Thus the primary effect of ammonium chloride on MHV infection of L-2 cells is to attenuate virus uncoating, thereby chronologically displacing all subsequent virus-encoded functions.","publish_time":"1985-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mizzen, Lee; Hilton, Anne; Cheley, Steve; Anderson, Robert","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a80e6b9c117cd9f37c9d508be5ba6caea36f7abe.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682285903459; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682285903459","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["MHV"],"keyphrases":["Abstract Ammonium chloride","presence of ammonium chloride","MHV-infected cells","primary effect of ammonium chloride","virus uncoating","MHV infection","number of virus","manifestation of virus","extracellular virus","known inhibitory effects of ammonium chloride","internalization of MHV","production of virus progeny","mouse hepatitis virus","subsequent virus-encoded functions","endosomal mechanism of MHV uncoating","viral polypeptides","infectivity of internalized virus inoculum","culture medium","apparent molecular weights of viral RNAs","viral protein synthesis","endosomal functions","similar delays","positive-sense RNAs","cell extracts","induced cell fusion","subsequent eclipse phase","results","high multiplicity","relative proportions","Analysis of early events","adsorption","basis","hr","concentration","severity","infectious center assay","final titers","translation"],"language":"en"},

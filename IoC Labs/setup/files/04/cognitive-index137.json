Concentrated and dialyzed (cutoff 12,000) B. sulfurescens culture filtrate also contains a highmolecular-weight compound cytotoxic for the Mamestra brassicae cell line. A fractionation in two chromatographic steps separated a cytotoxic fraction (IC(50)= 1.15 \u00B1 0.05 \u03BCg/ ml), which was poorly toxic to larvae (LC(50) = 150 \u00B1 10 \u03BCg/ ml) and an insecticidal fraction (LC(50) = 2.1 \u00B1 0.1 \u03BCg/ml) devoid of detectable cytotoxicity. The two kinds of activity, i.e., cytotoxicity in vitroand toxicity in vivo are thus independent. The cytotoxic activity, initially detected on a M. brassicae cell line, also affected two other insect cell lines (G. mellonella and Spodoptera frugiperda). The cytotoxic fraction provoked not only the inhibition of cell proliferation, but also cell death. Adhesive mammalian cell lines were not sensitive. Nonadhesive mammalian cell lines of murine myeloma and hybridomas were poorly sensitive.","publish_time":"2005-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mollier, P.; Lagnel, J.; Quiot, J.M.; Aloun, A.; Riba, G.","journal":"J Invertebr Pathol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131091/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjs3NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell death","insect cell lines","cytotoxic fraction","Mamestra brassicae cell line","inhibition of cell proliferation","cytotoxic activity","\u03BCg","Nonadhesive mammalian cell lines of murine myeloma","insecticidal fraction","LC","highmolecular-weight compound cytotoxic","Galleria mellonella larvae","culture medium","components toxic","culture filtrate","kinds of activity","devoid of detectable cytotoxicity","hybridomas","chromatographic steps","vitroand toxicity","Spodoptera frugiperda","hyphomycete fungus Beauveria","cutoff","fractionation"],"language":"en"},

Technological advances have improved orthopaedic implants and surgical techniques for bone reconstruction. However, improvements in surgical techniques to reconstruct bone have been limited by the paucity of autologous materials available and donor site morbidity. Recent advances in the development of biomaterials have provided attractive alternatives to bone grafting expanding the surgical options for restoring the form and function of injured bone. Specifically, novel bioactive (second generation) biomaterials have been developed that are characterised by controlled action and reaction to the host tissue environment, whilst exhibiting controlled chemical breakdown and resorption with an ultimate replacement by regenerating tissue. Future generations of biomaterials (third generation) are designed to be not only osteoconductive but also osteoinductive, i.e. to stimulate regeneration of host tissues by combining tissue engineering and in situ tissue regeneration methods with a focus on novel applications. These techniques will lead to novel possibilities for tissue regeneration and repair. At present, tissue engineered constructs that may find future use as bone grafts for complex skeletal defects, whether from post-traumatic, degenerative, neoplastic or congenital/developmental \u201Corigin\u201D require osseous reconstruction to ensure structural and functional integrity. Engineering functional bone using combinations of cells, scaffolds and bioactive factors is a promising strategy and a particular feature for future development in the area of hybrid materials which are able to exhibit suitable biomimetic and mechanical properties. This review will discuss the state of the art in this field and what we can expect from future generations of bone regeneration concepts.","publish_time":"2013-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Henkel, Jan; Woodruff, Maria A.; Epari, Devakara R.; Steck, Roland; Glatt, Vaida; Dickinson, Ian C.; Choong, Peter F.

Microbiology findings are typically similar to other nosocomial infections, with differences dependent on microbiology selection due to antibiotic pressure or the resident flora. However, this is poorly understood in the critical care setting. We therefore aimed to assess the incidence, epidemiology and microbiology of SSI and its association with outcomes in patients with severe peritonitis in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: We prospectively studied 305 consecutive patients admitted to our surgical ICU from 2010 to 2014 with a diagnosis of secondary or tertiary peritonitis. We collected the following data: SSI diagnosis, demographics, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II score, type of surgery, microbiology, antibiotic treatment and outcomes. Microbiological sampling was done by means of swabs. RESULTS: We identified 269 episodes of SSI in 162 patients (53.1 %) aged 64.4 \u00B1 14.3 years, of which 200 episodes occurred in men (64.6 %). The mean APACHE II and SAPS II scores were 19.7 \u00B1 7.8 and 36.5 \u00B1 16.1 respectively. The mean ICU and hospital stays were 19.8 \u00B1 24.8 and 21.7 \u00B1 30 days respectively. Pseudomonas spp. (n = 52, 19.3 %), Escherichia coli (n = 55, 20.4 %) and Candida spp. (n = 46, 17.1 %) were the most frequently isolated microorganisms, but gram-positive cocci (n = 80, 29.7 %) were also frequent. Microorganisms isolated from SSIs were associated with a higher incidence of antibiotic resistance (64.9 %) in ICU patients, but not with higher in-hospital mortality. However, patients who suffered from SSI had longer ICU admissions (odds ratio = 1.024, 95 % confidence interval 1.010\u20131.039, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of SSI in secondary or tertiary peritonitis requiring ICU admission is very high. Physicians may consider antibiotic-resistant pathogens, gram-positive cocci and fungi when choosing empiric antibiotic treatment for SSI, although more studies are needed to confirm our results due to the inherent limitations of the microbiological sampling with swabs performed in our research. The presence of SSI may be associated with prolonged ICU stays, but without any influence on overall mortality.","publish_time":"2015-07-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ballus, Josep; Lopez-Delgado, Juan C.; Sabater-Riera, Joan; Perez-Fernandez, Xose L.; Betbese, A.

This causes enormous fluctuations in population size, which in turn may influence the bats\u2019 impact on local ecosystems. We studied the movement ecology of this central-place forager with state-of-the-art GPS/acceleration loggers and concurrently monitored the seasonal fluctuation of the colony in Accra, Ghana. Habitat use on the landscape scale was assessed with remote sensing data as well as ground-truthing of foraging areas. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During the wet season population low (~ 4000 individuals), bats foraged locally (3.5\u201336.7 km) in urban areas with low tree cover. Major food sources during this period were fruits of introduced trees. Foraging distances almost tripled (24.1\u201387.9 km) during the dry season population peak (~ 150,000 individuals), but this was not compensated for by reduced resting periods. Dry season foraging areas were random with regard to urban footprint and tree cover, and food consisted almost exclusively of nectar and pollen of native trees. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Our study suggests that straw-coloured fruit bats disperse seeds in the range of hundreds of meters up to dozens of kilometres, and pollinate trees for up to 88 km. Straw-coloured fruit bats forage over much larger distances compared to most other Old World fruit bats, thus providing vital ecosystem services across extensive landscapes. We recommend increased efforts aimed at maintaining E. helvum populations throughout Africa since their keystone role in various ecosystems is likely to increase due to the escalating loss of other seed dispersers as well as continued urbanization and habitat fragmentation.","publish_time":"2015-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fahr, Jakob; Abedi-Lartey, Michael; Esch, Thomas; Machwitz, Miriam; Suu-Ire, Richard; Wikelski, Martin; Dechmann, Dina K.

To address these uncertainties, we evaluated the persistence of Ebola virus spiked in sterilized domestic sewage. The viral titer decreased approximately 99% within the first test day from an initial viral titer of 10(6) TCID(50) mL(\u20131); however, it could not be determined if this initial rapid decrease was due to aggregation or inactivation of the viral particles. The subsequent viral titer decrease was less rapid, and infectious Ebola virus particles persisted for all 8 days of the test. The inactivation constant (k) was determined to be \u22121.08 (2.1 days for a 90% viral titer decrease). Due to experimental conditions, we believe these results to be an upper bound for Ebola virus persistence in wastewater. Wastewater composition is inherently heterogeneous; subsequently, we caution that interpretation of these results should be made within a holistic assessment, including the effects of wastewater composition, dilution, and potential exposure routes within wastewater infrastructure. While it remains unknown if Ebola virus may be transmitted via wastewater, these data demonstrate a potential exposure route to infectious Ebola virus via wastewater and emphasize the value of a precautionary approach to wastewater handling in an epidemic response.","publish_time":"2015-08-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bibby, Kyle; Fischer, Robert J.; Casson, Leonard W.; Stachler, Elyse; Haas, Charles N.; Munster, Vincent J.","journal":"Environ Sci Technol Lett","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e14d19c13dce19aecf70e68efeee7d95ac5047b6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4613737.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4613737/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzY3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Ebola"],"keyphrases":["persistence of Ebola virus","Ebola virus persistence","Ebola virus outbreak","infectious Ebola virus particles","wastewater handling","wastewater infrastructure","effects of wastewater composition","initial viral titer","viral particles","subsequent viral titer decrease","appropriate handling of Ebola virus-contaminated liquid waste","initial rapid decrease","results","days","potential exposure routes","test day","inactivation constant","significant questions","dilution","aggregation","value","precautionary approach","sterilized domestic sewage","data","wake","epidemic response","holistic assessment","text","experimental conditions","Image","interpretation","uncertainties","TCID"],"language":"en"},

We used a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to map the antigenic structure of live JEV virus, untreated control virus (UCV), formalin-inactivated commercial vaccine (FICV), and formalin-inactivated virus (FIV). The binding activity of T16 MAb against Nakayama-derived FICV and several strains of FIV was significantly lower compared to live virus and UCV. T16 MAb, a weakly neutralizing JEV serocomplex antibody, was found to inhibit JEV infection at the post-attachment step. The T16 epitope was mapped to amino acids 329, 331, and 389 within domain III (EDIII) of the envelope (E) glycoprotein. When we explored the effect of formalin inactivation on the immunogenicity of JEV, we found that Nakayama-derived FICV, FIV, and UCV all exhibited similar immunogenicity in a mouse model, inducing anti-JEV and anti-EDII 101/106/107 epitope-specific antibodies. However, the EDIII 329/331/389 epitope-specific IgG antibody and neutralizing antibody titers were significantly lower for FICV-immunized and FIV-immunized mouse serum than for UCV-immunized. Formalin inactivation seems to alter the antigenic structure of the E protein, which may reduce the potency of commercially available JEV vaccines. Virus inactivation by H(2)O(2), but not by UV or by short-duration and higher temperature formalin treatment, is able to maintain the antigenic structure of the JEV E protein.

However, in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP), TDP-43 is abnormally phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and cleaved, and is mislocalized to the cytoplasm where it forms distinctive aggregates. We previously developed a mouse model expressing human TDP-43 with a mutation in its nuclear localization signal (\u0394NLS-hTDP-43) so that the protein preferentially localizes to the cytoplasm. These mice did not exhibit a significant number of cytoplasmic aggregates, but did display dramatic changes in gene expression as measured by microarray, suggesting that cytoplasmic TDP-43 may be associated with a toxic gain-of-function. Here, we analyze new RNA-sequencing data from the \u0394NLS-hTDP-43 mouse model, together with published RNA-sequencing data obtained previously from TDP-43 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) knockdown mice to investigate further the dysregulation of gene expression in the \u0394NLS model. This analysis reveals that the transcriptomic effects of the overexpression of the \u0394NLS-hTDP-43 transgene are likely due to a gain of cytoplasmic function. Moreover, cytoplasmic TDP-43 expression alters transcripts that regulate chromatin assembly, the nucleolus, lysosomal function, and histone 3\u2019 untranslated region (UTR) processing. These transcriptomic alterations correlate with observed histologic abnormalities in heterochromatin structure and nuclear size in transgenic mouse and human brains.","publish_time":"2015-10-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amlie-Wolf, Alexandre; Ryvkin, Paul; Tong, Rui; Dragomir, Isabelle; Suh, EunRan; Xu, Yan; Van Deerlin, Vivianna M.; Gregory, Brian D.; Kwong, Linda K.; Trojanowski, John Q.; Lee, Virginia M.-Y.; Wang, Li-San; Lee, Edward B.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8bb5f822c7bae1c50b1d5b7a9da329a1f9d8aee2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4624943.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4624943/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzY4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cytoplasmic TDP","human TDP","FTLD-TDP","\u0394NLS-hTDP","\u0394NLS model","nuclear RNA-binding protein","RNA trafficking","RNA stability","mouse model","gain of cytoplasmic function","published RNA-sequencing data","new RNA-sequencing data","nuclear size","transgenic mouse","dysregulation of gene expression","lysosomal function","significant number of cytoplasmic aggregates","TAR DNA-binding protein","nuclear localization signal","human brains","knockdown mice","transcriptomic alterations","transcriptomic effects","distinctive aggregates","toxic gain","heterochromatin structure","observed histologic abnormalities","ALS","histone","regulation of alternative splicing","frontotemporal lobar degeneration","chromatin assembly","nucleolus","range of functions","antisense oligonucleotide","ASO","inclusions","mutation","transcripts","untranslated region","dramatic changes","UTR","amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","overexpression","transgene","microarray","processing","analysis"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to identify the presence of antibodies against influenza A virus in dogs and their owners, as well as the presence of RNA of influenza A virus in nasal exudates of dogs and, thereby, assess the possible transmission of the virus between humans and dogs. METHODS: Serum samples from household dogs and their owners were analyzed to detect the presence of antibodies against three subtypes of human influenza virus (H1N1pdm09, H1N1, and H3N2), as well as subtype H3N8 of equine influenza. We analyzed dog nasal exudates to detect influenza viral RNA. The relationship between the seropositivity of dogs and various factors (age, sex, constantly at home, and seropositivity of owners) was statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Seroprevalence for human influenza in dogs was 0\u00B79% (1 of 113), and it was 4% (5 of 113) for equine influenza. In humans, seroprevalence was 22% for subtype H1N1pdm09, 20% for subtype H1N1, and 11% for subtype H3N2. No significant association (P \u003E 0\u00B705) was found between seropositivity and any of the assessed factors. Furthermore, no viral RNA was detected in the nasal exudate samples. CONCLUSIONS: Results revealed seroprevalence of the influenza virus in household dogs in Mexico City.

RESULTS: Our study results showed that US hospitals could absorb between 26,200 and 56,300 additional ventilators at the peak of a national influenza pandemic outbreak with robust pre-pandemic planning.

When provided with a gD-receptor such as nectin-1, these cells support HSV-1 entry by an endocytosis pathway. Treating some viruses bound to cells with the fusogen polyethylene glycol (PEG) mediates viral fusion with the cell surface but is insufficient to rescue viral entry. It is unclear whether PEG-mediated fusion of HSV with the plasma membrane of B78 or CHO cells results in successful entry and infection. FINDINGS: Treating HSV-1 bound to B78 or CHO cells with PEG allowed viral entry as measured by virus-induced beta-galactosidase activity. Based on the mechanism of PEG action, we propose that entry likely proceeds by direct fusion of HSV particles with the plasma membrane. Under the conditions tested, PEG-mediated infection of CHO cells progressed to the level of HSV late gene expression, while B78 cells supported HSV DNA replication. We tested whether proteolysis or acidification of cell-bound virions could trigger HSV fusion with the plasma membrane. Under the conditions tested, mildly acidic pH of 5\u20136 or the protease trypsin were not capable of triggering HSV-1 fusion as compared to PEG-treated cell-bound virions. CONCLUSIONS: B78 cells and CHO cells, which typically endocytose HSV prior to viral penetration, are capable of supporting HSV-1 entry via direct penetration. HSV capsids delivered directly to the cytosol at the periphery of these cells complete the entry process. B78 and CHO cells may be utilized to screen for factors that trigger entry as a consequence of fusion of virions with the cell surface, and PEG treatment can provide a necessary control.","publish_time":"2015-11-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walker, Erik B.; Pritchard, Suzanne M.; Cunha, Cristina W.; Aguilar, Hector C.; Nicola, Anthony V.","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae8c759fe82750edd66adb5e87e2ee44cb73c419.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4647588.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4647588/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzczMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSV","CHO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HSV fusion","PEG-mediated fusion of HSV","study of HSV","HSV capsids","Mouse B78 cells","PEG-mediated infection of CHO cells","level of viral entry","viral fusion","successful entry","entry process","direct fusion of HSV particles","capable of supporting HSV","capable of triggering HSV","HSV DNA replication","PEG treatment","plasma membrane of B78","entry likely proceeds","PEG-treated cell-bound virions","consequence of fusion","viral penetration","level of HSV late gene expression","cell surface","mechanism of PEG action","acidification of cell","direct penetration","conditions","Chinese hamster ovary","fusogen polyethylene glycol","virus-induced beta-galactosidase activity","BACKGROUND","cytosol","CONCLUSIONS","protease trypsin","necessary control","nectin","proteolysis","periphery","endocytosis pathway","gD-receptor","acidic pH","factors","viruses","FINDINGS"],"language":"en"},

To accurately understand and explain epidemic behaviour information on contact networks is required, but only limited empirical data is available. Online respondent-driven detection can provide relevant epidemiological data on numbers of contact persons and dynamics of contacts between pairs of individuals. We aimed to analyse contact networks with respect to sociodemographic and geographical characteristics, vaccine-induced immunity and self-reported symptoms. METHODS: In 2014, volunteers from two large participatory surveillance panels in the Netherlands and Belgium were invited for a survey. Participants were asked to record numbers of contacts at different locations and self-reported influenza-like-illness symptoms, and to invite 4 individuals they had met face to face in the preceding 2 weeks. We calculated correlations between linked individuals to investigate mixing patterns. RESULTS: In total 1560 individuals completed the survey who reported in total 30591 contact persons; 488 recruiter-recruit pairs were analysed. Recruitment was assortative by age, education, household size, influenza vaccination status and sentiments, indicating that participants tended to recruit contact persons similar to themselves. We also found assortative recruitment by symptoms, reaffirming our objective of sampling contact persons whom a participant may infect or by whom a participant may get infected in case of an outbreak. Recruitment was random by sex and numbers of contact persons. Relationships between pairs were influenced by the spatial distribution of peer recruitment. CONCLUSIONS: Although complex mechanisms influence online peer recruitment, the observed statistical relationships reflected the observed contact network patterns in the general population relevant for the transmission of respiratory pathogens. This provides useful and innovative input for predictive epidemic models relying on network information.

In particular, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident chaperones play key roles in synthesizing and processing viral proteins. Influx of a large amount of foreign proteins exhausts the folding capacity in ER and triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR). A fully-executed UPR comprises signaling pathways that induce ER folding chaperones, increase protein degradation, block new protein synthesis and may eventually activate apoptosis, presenting both opportunities and threats to the virus. Here, we define a role of the MHV-68M1 gene in differential modulation of UPR pathways to enhance ER chaperone production. Ectopic expression of M1 markedly induces ER chaperone genes and expansion of ER. The M1 protein accumulates in ER during infection and this localization is indispensable for its function, suggesting M1 acts from the ER. We found that M1 protein selectively induces the chaperon-producing pathways (IRE1, ATF6) while, interestingly, sparing the translation-blocking arm (PERK). We identified, for the first time, a viral factor capable of selectively intervening the initiation of ER stress signaling to induce chaperon production. This finding provides a unique opportunity of using viral protein as a tool to define the activation mechanisms of individual UPR pathways.","publish_time":"2015-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, Jiaying; Gong, Danyang; Fu, Xudong; Wu, Ting-ting; Wang, Jane; Chang, Jennifer; Zhou, Jingting; Lu, Gang; Wang, Yibin; Sun, Ren","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f47adf53fef07c0ca76beb4b100bbdfa54b2b0b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4663489.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4663489/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozc0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UPR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expansion of ER","M1 protein","ER chaperone production","ER folding chaperones","ER chaperone genes","initiation of ER stress","protein degradation","new protein synthesis","unfolded protein response","differential modulation of UPR pathways","viral proteins","M1 acts","activation mechanisms of individual UPR pathways","infection","Ectopic expression of M1","chaperon production","host chaperone network","viral factor capable","resident chaperones","folding capacity","foreign proteins","key roles","MHV-68M1 gene","synthesizing","endoplasmic reticulum","function","apoptosis","localization","tool","opportunities","threats","time","Viruses","IRE1","unique opportunity","translation","arm","PERK","Influx","ATF6"],"language":"en"},

LRTI also occurs during mechanical ventilation, increasing the morbidity and mortality of intubated patients. We sought to understand the dynamics of respiratory tract microbiota following intubation and the relationship between microbial community structure and infection. RESULTS: We enrolled a cohort of 15 subjects with respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation from the medical intensive care unit at an academic medical center. Oropharyngeal (OP) and deep endotracheal (ET) secretions were sampled within 24 h of intubation and every 48\u201372 h thereafter. Bacterial community profiling was carried out by purifying DNA, PCR amplification of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences, deep sequencing, and bioinformatic community analysis. We compared enrolled subjects to a cohort of healthy subjects who had lower respiratory tract sampling by bronchoscopy. In contrast to the diverse upper respiratory tract and lower respiratory tract microbiota found in healthy controls, critically ill subjects had lower initial diversity at both sites. Diversity further diminished over time on the ventilator. In several subjects, the bacterial community was dominated by a single taxon over multiple time points. The clinical diagnosis of LRTI ascertained by chart review correlated with low community diversity and dominance of a single taxon. Dominant taxa matched clinical bacterial cultures where cultures were obtained and positive. In several cases, dominant taxa included bacteria not detected by culture, including Ureaplasma parvum and Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal analysis of respiratory tract microbiota in critically ill patients provides insight into the pathogenesis and diagnosis of LRTI. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of endotracheal aspirate samples holds promise for expanded pathogen identification.

The animals, six weeks old and clinically healthy, were inoculated with the virulent strain Margarita (secondary virus). For exclusive detection of the Margarita strain, a specific qRT-PCR assay was designed, which proved not to have cross-reactivity with the Cat01 strain. The wild boars persistently infected with CSFV were protected from superinfection by the virulent CSFV Margarita strain, as evidenced by the absence of clinical signs and the absence of Margarita RNA detection in serum, swabs and tissue samples. Additionally, in PBMCs, a well-known target for CSFV viral replication, only the primary infecting virus RNA (Cat01 strain) could be detected, even after the isolation in ST cells, demonstrating SIE at the tissue level in vivo. Furthermore, the data analysis of the Margarita qRT-PCR, by means of calculated \u0394Ct values, supported that PBMCs from persistently infected animals were substantially protected from superinfection after in vitro inoculation with the Margarita virus strain, while this virus was able to infect naive PBMCs efficiently. In parallel, IFN-\u03B1 values were undetectable in the sera from animals in Group B after inoculation with the CSFV Margarita strain. Furthermore, these animals were unable to elicit adaptive humoral (no E2-specific or neutralising antibodies) or cellular immune responses (in terms of IFN-\u03B3-producing cells) after inoculation with the second virus. Finally, a sequence analysis could not detect CSFV Margarita RNA in the samples tested from Group B. Our results suggested that the SIE phenomenon might be involved in the evolution and phylogeny of the virus, as well as in CSFV control by vaccination. To the best of our knowledge, this study was one of the first showing efficient suppression of superinfection in animals, especially in the absence of IFN-\u03B1, which might be associated with the lack of innate immune mechanisms.","publish_time":"2016-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mu\u00F1oz-Gonz\u00E1lez, Sara; P\u00E9rez-Sim\u00F3, Marta; Colom-Cadena, Andreu; Cabez\u00F3n, Oscar; Boh\u00F3rquez, Jos\u00E9 Alejandro; Rosell, Rosa; P\u00E9rez, Lester Josu\u00E9; Marco, Ignasi; Lav\u00EDn, Santiago; Domingo, Mariano; Ganges, Llilianne","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5bedf3a8d33e6b501c2203982eaaa5567011d86.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4768946.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4768946/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozg0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Group B","CSFV","CSFV Margarita","SIE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Margarita virus strain","virulent CSFV Margarita strain","CSFV Margarita RNA","virulent strain Margarita","Cat01 strain of CSFV","infected animals","primary virus","CSFV control","absence of Margarita RNA detection","Margarita qRT-PCR","secondary virus","primary infecting virus RNA","CSFV viral replication","absence of IFN","inoculation","Group B","IFN-\u03B1 values","terms of IFN","tissue samples","naive PBMCs","wild boars","specific qRT-PCR assay","absence of clinical signs","efficient suppression of superinfection","E2-specific","exclusive detection","data analysis","sequence analysis","SIE phenomenon","ST cells","tissue level","cellular immune responses","calculated \u0394Ct values","lack of innate immune mechanisms","serum","neutralising antibodies","swabs","sera","well-known target","results","isolation","weeks old","evolution","cross-reactivity","best","knowledge","study","groups","phylogeny","vaccination"],"language":"en"},

A phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome indicated that the CBJ113 strain shares a common origin with HAdV-C2, HAdV-C6, HAdV-C1, HAdV-C5, and HAdV-C57 and formed a novel subclade on the same branch as other HAdV-C subtypes.

The main drawbacks in their development and use have been reliance on an unpredictable method of attenuation and the potential for evolutionary reversion to high virulence. Methods of genetic engineering now provide many safer alternatives to live vaccines, so if live vaccines are to compete with these alternatives in the future, they must either have superior immunogenicity or they must be able to overcome these former disadvantages. Several live vaccine designs that were historically inaccessible are now feasible because of advances in genome synthesis. Some of those methods are addressed here, with an emphasis on whether they enable predictable levels of attenuation and whether they are stable against evolutionary reversion. These new designs overcome many of the former drawbacks and position live vaccines to be competitive with alternatives. Not only do new methods appear to retard evolutionary reversion enough to prevent vaccine-derived epidemics, but it may even be possible to permanently attenuate live vaccines that are transmissible but cannot evolve to higher virulence under prolonged adaptation.","publish_time":"2015-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bull, J.

In this study, a 2.4-angstrom structure of the SS2 enolase is solved, revealing an octameric arrangement in the crystal. We further demonstrated that the enzyme exists exclusively as an octamer in solution via a sedimentation assay. These results indicate that the octamer is the biological unit of SS2 enolase at least in vitro and most likely in vivo as well.

The primary goal of this study is to explore new ways of improving the accuracy of disease prevalence estimations by combining traditional disease data with search engine data. A novel method, Biased Sentinel Hospital-based Area Disease Estimation (B-SHADE), is introduced to reduce search engine data bias from a geographical perspective. To monitor search trends on Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) in Guangdong Province, China, we tested our approach by selecting 11 keywords from the Baidu index platform, a Chinese big data analyst similar to GFT. The correlation between the number of real cases and the composite index was 0.8. After decomposing the composite index at the city level, we found that only 10 cities presented a correlation of close to 0.8 or higher. These cities were found to be more stable with respect to search volume, and they were selected as sample cities in order to estimate the search volume of the entire province. After the estimation, the correlation improved from 0.8 to 0.864. After fitting the revised search volume with historical cases, the mean absolute error was 11.19% lower than it was when the original search volume and historical cases were combined.

Cybercare means \u201Chealth care in cyberspace\u201D \u2014 for example, doctors consulting with patients via videoconferencing across a distributed network; or patients receiving care locally \u2014 in neighborhoods, \u201Cminute clinics,\u201D and homes \u2014 using information technologies such as telemedicine, smartphones, and wearable sensors to link to tertiary medical specialists. This model contrasts with traditional health care, in which patients travel (often a great distance) to receive care from providers in a central hospital. The Cybercare model shifts health care provision from hospital to home; from specialist to generalist; and from treatment to prevention. Cybercare employs advanced technology to deliver services efficiently across the distributed network \u2014 for example, using telemedicine, wearable sensors and cell phones to link patients to specialists and upload their medical data in near-real time; using information technology (IT) to rapidly detect, track, and contain the spread of a global pandemic; or using cell phones to manage medical care in a disaster situation. Cybercare uses seven \u201Cpillars\u201D of technology to provide medical care: genomics; telemedicine; robotics; simulation, including virtual and augmented reality; artificial intelligence (AI), including intelligent agents; the electronic medical record (EMR); and smartphones. All these technologies are evolving and blending. The technologies are integrated functionally because they underlie the Cybercare network, and/or form part of the care for patients using that distributed network.

Patient with HIV-related illness are more likely to present with severe TB due to immunosuppression. Very few studies have explored HIV/TB co-infection in critically ill patients. The goal of this study was to analyze factors associated with long-term mortality in critically ill patient with HIV-related disease coinfected with TB. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in an infectious disease reference center in Brazil that included all patient with HIV-related illness admitted to the ICU with laboratory-confirmed tuberculosis from March 2007 until June 2012. Clinical and laboratory variables were analyzed based on six-month survival. RESULTS: Forty-four patients with HIV-related illness with a confirmed diagnosis of tuberculosis were analyzed. The six-month mortality was 52 % (23 patients). The main causes of admission were respiratory failure (41 %), severe sepsis/septic shock (32 %) and coma/torpor (14 %). The median time between HIV diagnosis and ICU admission was 5 (1\u201360) months, and 41 % of patients received their HIV infection diagnosis \u2264 30 days before admission. The median CD4 count was 72 (IQR: 23\u2013136) cells/mm(3). The clinical presentation was pulmonary tuberculosis in 22 patients (50 %) and disseminated TB in 20 patients (45.5 %). No aspect of TB diagnosis or treatment was different between survivors and nonsurvivors. Neurological dysfunction was more prevalent among nonsurvivors (43 % vs. 14 %, p = 0.04). The nadir CD4 cell count lower than 50 cells/mm(3) was independently associated with Six-month mortality (hazard ratio 4.58 [1.64\u201312.74], p \u003C 0.01), while HIV diagnosis less than three months after positive serology was protective (hazard ratio 0.27, CI 95 % [0.10\u20130.72], p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: The Six-month mortality of HIV critically ill patients with TB coinfection is high and strongly associated with the nadir CD4 cell count less than 50 cels/mm(3).","publish_time":"2016-06-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pecego, Ana Carla; Amancio, Rodrigo T.; Ribeiro, Camila; Mesquita, Emersom C.; Medeiros, Denise M.; Cerbino, Jos\u00E9; Grinsztejn, Beatriz; Bozza, Fernando A.; Japiassu, Andre M.","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9813a0812732c9ee69266b70b6dfcdb2d225e57b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4902956.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4902956/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozk3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV/TB","ICU"],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["HIV diagnosis","Six-month mortality of HIV","HIV-related illness","HIV infection diagnosis","HIV-related disease","ill patients","aspect of TB diagnosis","severe TB","confirmed diagnosis of tuberculosis","TB coinfection","TB co-infection","median CD4 count","ICU admission","long-term mortality","pulmonary tuberculosis","six-month survival","nadir CD4 cell","main causes of admission","hazard ratio","nonsurvivors","months","cells","infectious disease reference center","infectious diseases","retrospective study","median time","severe sepsis","laboratory variables","clinical presentation","leading causes of death","treatment","Brazil","positive serology","respiratory failure","human immunodeficiency virus","epidemics","IQR","days","septic shock","Neurological dysfunction","factors","studies","CONCLUSION","coma","METHODS","cels","immunosuppression","RESULTS","torpor","goal","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

The results are validated in a parameterized network via Monte Carlo simulations and measures to mitigate the loss of efficiency of the MRP are discussed.

Epidermal growth factor (EGF), typically found in bodily fluids, such as amniotic fluid, salvia and mother\u2019s breast milk, is an intestinotrophic growth factor and may reduce the onset of NEC in premature infants. We have produced human EGF in soybean seeds to levels biologically relevant and demonstrated its comparable activity to commercially available EGF. Transgenic soybean seeds expressing a seed-specific codon optimized gene encoding of the human EGF protein with an added ER signal tag at the N\u2019 terminal were produced. Seven independent lines were grown to homozygous and found to accumulate a range of 6.7 \u002B/- 3.1 to 129.0 \u002B/- 36.7 \u03BCg EGF/g of dry soybean seed. Proteomic and immunoblot analysis indicates that the inserted EGF is the same as the human EGF protein. Phosphorylation and immunohistochemical assays on the EGF receptor in HeLa cells indicate the EGF protein produced in soybean seed is bioactive and comparable to commercially available human EGF.

The disease is characterized by severe pyrexia, oculo-nasal discharge, pneumonia, necrosis and ulceration of the mucous membrane and inflammation of the gastro-intestinal tract leading to severe diarrhea. A SYBR Green I based real time RT-PCR targeting the N gene of PPRV has not been established for PPRV detection. Thus, the objective of present study was to develop highly sensitive N gene target SYBR Green I real time RT-PCR for specific detection and quantification of PPRV in clinical samples. A set of primers was designed to detect the nucleocapsid (N) gene of PPRV. RESULTS: The assay exhibited high specificity as all the viruses which have clinical and structural similarities to PPRV including Canine distemper virus (CDV), Measles virus (MV), Bluetongue virus (BTV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) failed to show an amplification signal. The lower detection limit of the assay was 5.11 copies/\u03BCl (Ct value of 33.67 \u00B1 0.5) and 0.001 TCID(50)/ml (Ct value of 34.7 \u00B1 0.5) based on plasmid copy number and tissue culture infectivity titre. The assay was 3-log more sensitive than the conventional RT-PCR. The coefficient of variation (CV) values for intra- and inter-assay variability were low, ranging from 0.32% - 2.31%, and 0.71% - 5.32%, respectively. To evaluate the performance of the newly developed assay, a total of 36 clinical samples suspected of PPR were screened for the presence of PPRV in parallel with conventional RT-PCR. The real time RT-PCR assay detected PPRV in 30 (83.3%) of clinical samples compared to 16 (44.4%) by conventional RT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: The two-step SYBR Green I based real time RT-PCR assay reported here is highly sensitive, specific, reproducible and rapid for detection and quantification of PPRV nucleic acids.","publish_time":"2014-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abera, Tsegalem; Thangavelu, Ardhanary; Joy Chandran, Navamani Daniel; Raja, Angamuthu","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/304d61d063b602c2971b9df3ce167445c9880645.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3896792.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3896792/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzE50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SYBR Green","PPRV","Newcastle","PPR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PPRV detection","real time RT-PCR assay","conventional RT-PCR","N gene of PPRV","presence of PPRV","developed assay","clinical samples","specific detection","inter-assay variability","quantification of PPRV nucleic acids","sensitive N gene target SYBR Green","Newcastle disease virus","Bluetongue virus","Measles virus","two-step SYBR Green","Canine distemper virus","lower detection limit","Ct value","important disease of small ruminants","severe pyrexia","petits ruminants","severe diarrhea","values","CDV","structural similarities","inflammation","ulceration","necrosis","oculo-nasal discharge","MV","BTV","gastro-intestinal tract","number","CV","mucous membrane","pneumonia","viruses","copies","tissue culture infectivity titre","plasmid","Peste","high specificity","sheep","NDV","\u03BCl","nucleocapsid","total","log","coefficient of variation","BACKGROUND","goats","objective of present study","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","performance","amplification signal","set of primers","TCID"],"language":"en"},

The sequence analysis was performed in a blinded fashion and confirmed with pathogen-specific PCR. This analysis successfully identified measles virus sequences in two brain samples and herpes simplex virus type-1 sequences in three brain samples. No pathogen was identified in the other two brain specimens. These results were concordant with pathogen-specific PCR and partially concordant with prior neuropathological examinations, demonstrating that deep sequencing can accurately identify viral infections in frozen brain tissue.","publish_time":"2014-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, Benjamin K.; Wilson, Theodore; Fischer, Kael F.; Kriesel, John D.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db80870c75793687f024d74e11d6a6d49333b1b6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3974838.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3974838/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozk20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NGS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["frozen brain samples","Deep sequencing","brain specimens","frozen brain tissue","RNA sequences","types of samples","generation sequencing","pathogen-specific PCR","measles virus sequences","sequence analysis","herpes simplex virus type","accurate characterization of microbial DNA","deceased subjects","viral infections","prior neuropathological examinations","recent encephalitis","blinded fashion","wide variety of infectious diseases","diagnosis","results","study","NGS"],"language":"en"},

Kallistatin, an endogenous tissue kallikrein inhibitor, has been reported to be protective in various human diseases. The aim of this study was to assess the correlations of kallistatin with other biomarkers and to determine whether kallistatin levels have a prognostic value in severe CAP. METHODS: Plasma samples and clinical data were prospectively collected from 54 patients with severe CAP requiring ICU admission. Seventeen healthy control subjects were included for comparison. Plasma kallistatin, kallikrein, and other biomarkers of inflammation (tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 (TNF-\u03B1), interleukin (IL)-1\u03B2, IL-6, IL-8, C-reactive protein (CRP)), and anti-coagulation (protein C, anti-thrombin III) were measured on days 1 and 4 of ICU admission. Comparison between survivors (n = 41) and nonsurvivors (n = 13) was performed. RESULTS: Plasma kallistatin was significantly consumed in severe CAP patients compared with healthy individuals. Lower day 1 kallistatin levels showed a strong trend toward increased mortality (P = 0.018) and higher day 1 CURB-65 scores (P = 0.004). Plasma kallistatin levels on day 1 of ICU admission were significantly decreased in patients who developed septic shock (P = 0.017) and who had acute respiratory distress syndrome (P = 0.044). In addition, kallistatin levels were positively correlated with anti-thrombin III and protein C and inversely correlated with IL-1\u03B2, IL-6, and CRP levels. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, higher day 1 CURB-65 scores were independent predictors of mortality (odds ratio = 29.9; P = 0.009). Also, higher day 1 kallistatin levels were independently associated with a decreased risk of death (odds ratio, 0.1) with a nearly significant statistical difference (P = 0.056). Furthermore, we found that a cutoff level of 6.5 \u03BCg/ml of day 1 kallistatin determined by receiver operating characteristic curves could be used to distinguish between patients who survived in 60 days and those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that kallistatin may serve as a novel marker for severe CAP prognosis and may be involved in the pathogenesis of CAP through antiinflammatory and anticoagulation effects.

In 2009, in order to assess outcomes and evaluate risk factors for progression of illness, two cohort studies were initiated: FLU 002 in outpatients and FLU 003 in hospitalized patients. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Between October 2009 and December 2012, adults with influenza-like illness (ILI) were enrolled; outpatients were followed for 14 days and inpatients for 60 days. Disease progression was defined as hospitalization and/or death for outpatients, and hospitalization for \u003E28 days, transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) if enrolled from general ward, and/or death for inpatients. Infection was confirmed by RT-PCR. 590 FLU 002 and 392 FLU 003 patients with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 were enrolled from 81 sites in 17 countries at 2 days (IQR 1\u20133) and 6 days (IQR 4\u201310) following ILI onset, respectively. Disease progression was experienced by 29 (1 death) outpatients (5.1%; 95% CI: 3.4\u20137.2%) and 80 inpatients [death (32), hospitalization \u003E28 days (43) or ICU transfer (20)] (21.6%; 95% CI: 17.5\u201326.2%). Disease progression (death) for hospitalized patients was 53.1% (26.6%) and 12.8% (3.8%), respectively, for those enrolled in the ICU and general ward. In pooled analyses for both studies, predictors of disease progression were age, longer duration of symptoms at enrollment and immunosuppression. Patients hospitalized during the pandemic period had a poorer prognosis than in subsequent seasons. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, particularly when requiring hospital admission, are at high risk for disease progression, especially if they are older, immunodeficient, or admitted late in infection. These data reinforce the need for international trials of novel treatment strategies for influenza infection and serve as a reminder of the need to monitor the severity of seasonal and pandemic influenza epidemics globally.

Fat1 gene is the coding sequence from Caenorhabditis elegans which might play an important role on lipometabolism. To reveal the function of fat1 gene in bovine fetal fibroblast cells and gain the best cell nuclear donor for transgenic bovines, the codon of fat1 sequence was optimized based on the codon usage frequency preference of bovine muscle protein, and directionally cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pEF-GFP. After identifying by restrictive enzyme digests with AatII/XbaI and sequencing, the fusion plasmid pEF-GFP-fat1 was identified successfully. The pEF-GFP-fat1 vector was transfected into bovine fetal fibroblast cells mediated by Lipofectamine2000(TM). The positive bovine fetal fibroblast cells were selected by G418 and detected by RT-PCR. The results showed that a 1,234 bp transcription was amplified by reverse transcription PCR and the positive transgenic fat1 cell line was successfully established. Then the expression level of fat1 gene in positive cells was detected using quantitative PCR, and the catalysis efficiency was detected by gas chromatography. The results demonstrated that the catalysis efficiency of fat1 was significantly high, which can improve the total PUFAs rich in EPA, DHA and DPA. Construction and expression of pEF-GFP-fat1 vector should be helpful for further understanding the mechanism of regulation of fat1 in vitro. It could also be the first step in the production of fat1 transgenic cattle.","publish_time":"2012-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Boyang; Yang, Runjun; Li, Junya; Zhang, Lupei; Liu, Jing; Lu, Chunyan; Lian, Chuanjiang; Li, Zezhong; Zhang, Yonghong; Zhang, Liying; Zhao, Zhihui","journal":"Asian-Australas J Anim Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3469557b37bfea7f3aebded4172020ad1d6e484.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4093122.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4093122/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzIxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EPA","DHA","DPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GFP-fat1 vector","codon of fat1 sequence","function of fat1 gene","catalysis efficiency of fat1","expression level of fat1 gene","positive transgenic fat1 cell line","production of fat1 transgenic cattle","positive cells","expression of pEF","positive bovine fetal fibroblast cells","carbon n","eukaryotic expression vector pEF-GFP","fusion plasmid pEF-GFP","transgenic bovines","reverse transcription PCR","total PUFAs rich","quantitative PCR","RT-PCR","results","codon usage frequency preference of bovine muscle protein","bp transcription","coding sequence","polyunsaturated fatty acids","fatty acid desaturase","best cell nuclear donor","XbaI","sequencing","AatII","Caenorhabditis elegans","EPA","DHA","beneficial effect","G418","Lipofectamine2000","restrictive enzyme digests","human health","substrates","important role","DPA","gas chromatography","TM","step","Construction","mechanism of regulation","lipometabolism","range"],"language":"en"},

After being injected into a tumor, they infect cancer cells, multiply inside them, and when a cancer cell is killed they move on to spread and infect other cancer cells. Chondroitinase ABC (Chase-ABC) is a bacterial enzyme that can remove a major glioma ECM component, chondroitin sulfate glycosoamino glycans from proteoglycans without any deleterious effects in vivo. It has been shown that Chase-ABC treatment is able to promote the spread of the viruses, increasing the efficacy of the viral treatment. In this paper we develop a mathematical model to investigate the effect of the Chase-ABC on the treatment of glioma by oncolytic viruses (OV). We show that the model\u0027s predictions agree with experimental results for a spherical glioma. We then use the model to test various treatment options in the heterogeneous microenvironment of the brain. The model predicts that separate injections of OV, one into the center of the tumor and another outside the tumor will result in better outcome than if the total injection is outside the tumor. In particular, the injection of the ECM-degrading enzyme (Chase-ABC) on the periphery of the main tumor core need to be administered in an optimal strategy in order to infect and eradicate the infiltrating glioma cells outside the tumor core in addition to proliferative cells in the bulk of tumor core. The model also predicts that the size of tumor satellites and distance between the primary tumor and multifocal/satellite lesions may be an important factor for the efficacy of the viral therapy with Chase treatment.","publish_time":"2014-07-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Yangjin; Lee, Hyun Geun; Dmitrieva, Nina; Kim, Junseok; Kaur, Balveen; Friedman, Avner","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c43e9e66c5b384ac03f0067bc8d16a9efdd5fb9.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8dcc9848e421e45ac829203e4e6fe58e6ac130e5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4105445.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4105445/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzIyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ABC","Chase"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["primary tumor","Chase treatment","Chase-ABC treatment","treatment of glioma","cancer cells","bulk of tumor core","main tumor core","size of tumor satellites","viral treatment","infiltrating glioma cells","proliferative cells","Chondroitinase ABC","Oncolytic viruses","spherical glioma","engineered viruses","mathematical model","various treatment options","major glioma ECM component","efficacy","spread","bacterial enzyme","total injection","viral therapy","separate injections of OV","chondroitin sulfate glycosoamino glycans","proteoglycans","satellite lesions","minimal damage","distance","addition","experimental results","heterogeneous microenvironment","periphery","important factor","normal healthy tissue","better outcome","deleterious effects","order","model\u0027s predictions","optimal strategy","brain","paper","center"],"language":"en"},

Patients were randomized to either PCT-guided (PCT group) or standard (control group) antimicrobial therapy. In the control group, patients received antibiotics according to the attending physician\u2019s discretion; in the PCT group, patients received antibiotics according to an algorithm based on serum PCT levels. The primary end point was antibiotic exposure; secondary end points were clinical recovery, length of hospital stay, clinical and laboratory parameters, spirometry, number of asthma exacerbations, emergency room visits, hospitalizations and need for corticosteroid use due to asthma. RESULTS: PCT guidance reduced antibiotic prescription (48.9% versus 87.8%, respectively; P \u003C 0.001) and antibiotic exposure (relative risk, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.44 to 0.70; P \u003C 0.001) compared to standard therapy.

Airway surface liquid (ASL), which is regulated by epithelial cell ion transport, is essential for normal lung function. No information is available regarding the effect of NGF on ion transport of airway epithelium. To investigate whether NGF can affect ion transport, human primary air\u2010interface cultured epithelial cells were placed in Ussing chambers to obtain transepithelial voltage (\u22127.1 \u00B1 3.4 mV), short\u2010circuit current (I(sc), 5.9 \u00B1 1.0 \u03BCA), and transepithelial resistance (750 \u2126\u00B7cm(2)), and to measure responses to ion transport inhibitors.

Active prophylaxis by vaccination against influenza virus is currently the main countermeasure supplemented with antivirals. However, disadvantages of this strategy include the impact of antigenic drift, necessitating constant updating of vaccine strain composition, and emerging antiviral drug resistance. The development of other options for influenza prophylaxis, particularly with broad acting agents able to provide protection in the period between the onset of a pandemic and the development of a strain specific vaccine, is of great interest. Exploitation of broad-spectrum mediators could provide barricade protection in the early critical phase of influenza virus outbreaks. Passive immunity has the potential to provide immediate antiviral effects, inhibiting virus replication, reducing virus shedding, and thereby protecting vulnerable populations in the event of an impending influenza pandemic. Here, we review passive broad-spectrum influenza prophylaxis options with a focus on harnessing natural host defenses, including interferons and antibodies.","publish_time":"2014-09-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berry, Cassandra M.; Penhale, William J.; Sangster, Mark Y.","journal":"Influenza Res Treat","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8271398b9073fbb1ad449e72697e6ae8f71d3d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4190013.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4190013/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzI4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["passive broad-spectrum influenza prophylaxis options","impending influenza pandemic","virus replication","virus shedding","early critical phase of influenza virus outbreaks","Active prophylaxis","development","strain specific vaccine","barricade protection","Passive immunity","constant updating of vaccine strain composition","immediate antiviral effects","Exploitation of broad-spectrum mediators","emerging antiviral drug resistance","focus","harnessing natural host defenses","broad acting agents able","impact of antigenic drift","interferons","millions of people","potential","event","strategy","vulnerable populations","period","perennial problem","onset","main countermeasure","everpresent threat of devastating pandemics","vaccination","antibodies","disadvantages","antivirals"],"language":"en"},

The clinical features and outcomes of the most critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by HAdV-55 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, single-center observational study of pneumonia with ARDS in immunocompetent adults admitted to our respiratory ICU. We prospectively collected and analyzed clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics, sequential tests of viral load in respiratory tract and blood, treatments and outcomes. RESULTS: The results for a total of five consecutive patients with severe ARDS with confirmed HAdV-55 infection were included. All five patients were immunocompetent young men with a median age of 32 years. The mean time from onset to dyspnea was 5 days. Arterial blood gas analysis at ICU admission revealed profound hypoxia. Mean partial oxygen pressure/fraction of inspired oxygen was 58.1. Mean durations from onset to a single-lobe consolidation shown on chest X-rays (CXRs) and, from the first positive CXR to bilateral multilobar lung infiltrates, were 2 days and 4.8 days, respectively. The viral load was higher than 1 \u00D7 10(8) copies in three patients and was 1 \u00D7 10(4) in one patient. It was negative in the only patient who survived. The mean duration for noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) failure and IMV failure were 30.8 hours and 6.2 days, respectively. Four patients received venovenous ECMO. Four (80%) of the five patients died despite receiving appropriate respiratory support. CONCLUSIONS: HAdV-55 may cause severe ARDS in immunocompetent young men. Persistent high fever, dyspnea and rapid progression to respiratory failure within 2 weeks, together with bilateral consolidations and infiltrates, are the most frequent clinical manifestations of HAdV-55-induced severe ARDS. Viral load monitoring may help predict disease severity and outcome. The NPPV and IMV failure rates were very high, but ECMO may still be the respiratory support therapy of choice.

APH is a highly competitive sector with a strong emphasis on innovation and, albeit with country to country variations, on scientific research. Proteomics (the study of all proteins present in a given tissue or fluid \u2013 i.e. the proteome) has an enormous potential when applied to APH. Nevertheless, for a variety of reasons and in contrast to disciplines such as plant sciences or human biomedicine, such potential is only now being tapped. To counter such limited usage, 6 years ago we created a consortium dedicated to the applications of Proteomics to APH, specifically in the form of a Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) Action, termed FA1002 \u2013 Proteomics in Farm Animals: www.cost-faproteomics.org. In 4 years, the consortium quickly enlarged to a total of 31 countries in Europe, as well as Israel, Argentina, Australia and New Zealand. This article has a triple purpose. First, we aim to provide clear examples on the applications and benefits of the use of proteomics in all aspects related to APH. Second, we provide insights and possibilities on the new trends and objectives for APH proteomics applications and technologies for the years to come. Finally, we provide an overview and balance of the major activities and accomplishments of the COST Action on Farm Animal Proteomics. These include activities such as the organization of seminars, workshops and major scientific conferences, organization of summer schools, financing Short-Term Scientific Missions (STSMs) and the generation of scientific literature. Overall, the Action has attained all of the proposed objectives and has made considerable difference by putting proteomics on the global map for animal and veterinary researchers in general and by contributing significantly to reduce the East\u2013West and North\u2013South gaps existing in the European farm animal research.

Human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) uses several non-canonical pathways to translate its own proteins, such as leaky scanning, frameshifting, shunt, and cap-independent mechanisms. Moreover, HIV-1 modulates the host translation machinery by targeting key translation factors and overcomes different cellular obstacles that affect protein translation. In this review, we describe how HIV-1 proteins target several components of the eukaryotic translation machinery, which consequently improves viral translation and replication.","publish_time":"2015-01-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guerrero, Santiago; Batisse, Julien; Libre, Camille; Bernacchi, Serena; Marquet, Roland; Paillart, Jean-Christophe","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/49241d35c68b9ffeb0057758abdf00fc18cce2f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4306834.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4306834/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzM5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral translation","protein translation","eukaryotic translation machinery","host translation machinery","key translation factors","HIV","proteins","optimal viral protein synthesis","different cellular obstacles","shunt","main steps","complex process","DNA-viruses","components","initiation","elongation","frameshifting","leaky scanning","cap-independent mechanisms","RNA","non-canonical pathways","Human immunodeficiency virus","termination","infections","replication","review"],"language":"en"},

Recent studies in mouse models have revealed an indispensable role for the innate immune system in defense against influenza virus. Recognition of the virus by innate immune receptors in a multitude of cell types activates intricate signaling networks, functioning to restrict viral replication. Downstream effector mechanisms include activation of innate immune cells and, induction and regulation of adaptive immunity. However, uncontrolled innate responses are associated with exaggerated disease, especially in pandemic influenza virus infection. Despite advances in the understanding of innate response to influenza in the mouse model, there is a large knowledge gap in humans, particularly in immunocompromised groups such as infants and the elderly. We propose here, the need for further studies in humans to decipher the role of innate immunity to influenza virus, particularly at the site of infection. These studies will complement the existing work in mice and facilitate the quest to design improved vaccines and therapeutic strategies against influenza.","publish_time":"2014-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pulendran, Bali; Maddur, Mohan S.","journal":"Influenza Pathogenesis and Control - Volume II","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/683631e3abde760f34aef1956bae0b1cccd17348.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4346783.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4346783/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Influenza viruses","innate immune system","role of innate immunity","pandemic influenza virus infection","activation of innate immune cells","understanding of innate response","uncontrolled innate responses","immune receptors","humans","Recent studies","indispensable role","mouse models","site of infection","regulation of adaptive immunity","substantial threat","induction","exaggerated disease","quest","improved vaccines","Downstream effector mechanisms","defense","therapeutic strategies","multitude of cell types","large knowledge gap","networks","animal health","immunocompromised groups","existing work","infants","mice","advances","viral replication","elderly","need","Recognition"],"language":"en"},

They encode an NS6 protease that cleaves a viral polyprotein at specific sites to produce mature viral proteins. In an earlier study we obtained crystals of murine norovirus (MNV) NS6 protease in which crystal contacts were mediated by specific insertion of the C-terminus of one protein (which contains residues P5-P1 of the NS6-7 cleavage junction) into the peptide binding site of an adjacent molecule, forming an adventitious protease-product complex. We sought to reproduce this crystal form to investigate protease\u2013substrate complexes by extending the C-terminus of NS6 construct to include residues on the C-terminal (P\u2032) side of the cleavage junction. We report the crystallization and crystal structure determination of inactive mutants of murine norovirus NS6 protease with C-terminal extensions of one, two and four residues from the N-terminus of the adjacent NS7 protein (NS6 1\u2032, NS6 2\u2032, NS6 4\u2032). We also determined the structure of a chimeric extended NS6 protease in which the P4-P4\u2032 sequence of the NS6-7 cleavage site was replaced with the corresponding sequence from the NS2-3 cleavage junction (NS6 4\u2032 2|3).The constructs NS6 1\u2032 and NS6 2\u2032 yielded crystals that diffracted anisotropically. We found that, although the uncorrected data could be phased by molecular replacement, refinement of the structures stalled unless the data were ellipsoidally truncated and corrected with anisotropic B-factors. These corrections significantly improved phasing by molecular replacement and subsequent refinement.The refined structures of all four extended NS6 proteases are very similar in structure to the mature MNV NS6\u2014and in one case reveal additional details of a surface loop. Although the packing arrangement observed showed some similarities to those observed in the adventitious protease-product crystals reported previously, in no case were specific protease\u2013substrate interactions observed.","publish_time":"2015-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fernandes, Humberto; Leen, Eoin N.; Cromwell Jr, Hamlet; Pfeil, Marc-Philipp; Curry, Stephen","journal":"PeerJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20ea932a8d52b1cce006e973ae628f0a1ac5a90c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4349150.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4349150/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NS6 construct","constructs NS6","chimeric extended NS6 protease","mature MNV NS6","extended NS6 proteases","specific protease","crystal structure determination of inactive mutants of murine norovirus NS6 protease","adventitious protease-product crystals","C-terminus","cleavage junction","adventitious protease-product complex","cleavage site","crystals of murine norovirus","C-terminal extensions","molecular replacement","specific sites","specific insertion","case","crystal contacts","N-terminus","crystal form","P4-P4","yielded crystals","adjacent NS7 protein","mature viral proteins","residues P5-P1","adjacent molecule","refined structures","subsequent refinement","viral polyprotein","substrate complexes","substrate interactions","corresponding sequence","uncorrected data","peptide binding site","improved phasing","positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses","NS2","additional details","corrections","crystallization","surface loop","earlier study","anisotropic B-factors","Noroviruses","similarities","packing arrangement"],"language":"en"},

However, the tendency to concentrate on the influence of \u201Crisk factors\u201D related to living and working conditions of individuals, rather than to more broadly examine dynamics of the social processes that affect population health, has triggered critical reaction not only from the Global North but especially from voices the Global South where there is a long history of addressing questions of health equity. In this article, we elaborate on how focusing instead on the language of \u201Csocial determination of health\u201D has prompted us to attempt to apply a more equity-sensitive approaches to research and related policy and praxis. DISCUSSION: In this debate, we briefly explore the epistemological and historical roots of epidemiological approaches to health and health equity that have emerged in Latin America to consider its relevance to global discourse. In this region marked by pronounced inequity, context-sensitive concepts such as \u201Ccollective health\u201D and \u201Ccritical epidemiology\u201D have been prominent, albeit with limited acknowledgement by the Global North. We illustrate our attempts to apply a social determination approach (and the \u201C4 S\u201D elements of bio-Security, Sovereignty, Solidarity and Sustainability) in five projects within our research collaboration linking researchers and knowledge users in Ecuador and Canada, in diverse settings (health of healthcare workers; food systems; antibiotic resistance; vector borne disease [dengue]; and social circus with street youth). CONCLUSIONS: We argue that the language of social determinants lends itself to research that is more reductionist and beckons the development of different skills than would be applied when adopting the language of social determination. We conclude that this language leads to more direct analysis of the systemic factors that drive, promote and reinforce disparities, while at the same time directly considering the emancipatory forces capable of countering negative health impacts. It follows that \u201Creverse innovation\u201D must not only recognize practical solutions being developed in low and middle income countries, but must also build on the strengths of the theoretical-methodological reasoning that has emerged in the South.","publish_time":"2015-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Spiegel, Jerry M; Breilh, Jaime; Yassi, Annalee","journal":"Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8db1d047bfd714282858908b4ec51a64c2dc04f7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4353467.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4353467/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQzMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Global North","Latin America","Ecuador","Canada"],"keyphrases":["social determination of health","social determinants of health","collective health","population health","language of social determination","questions of health equity","language of social determinants","social circus","social processes","health of healthcare workers","social determination approach","Global North","Global South","global discourse","language leads","equity-sensitive approaches","emancipatory forces capable of countering negative health impacts","research collaboration","elements of bio","critical reaction","critical epidemiology","related policy","systemic factors","risk factors","context-sensitive concepts","historical roots of epidemiological approaches","bio-medical illness paradigm","antibiotic resistance","food systems","Ecuador","vector","Security","researchers","knowledge users","Canada","diverse settings","Sovereignty","Solidarity","projects","dengue","disease","direct analysis","welcome alternative","long history","Sustainability","time","inequity","relevance","limited acknowledgement","Latin America","voices","Focus","middle income countries","theoretical-methodological reasoning","strengths","practical solutions","influence","reductionist","street youth","praxis","BACKGROUND","attempts","development of different skills","debate","region","dynamics","reverse innovation","conditions of individuals","DISCUSSION","tendency","disparities","CONCLUSIONS","article"],"language":"en"},

We give particular consideration to the relationship between vector valued asymptotically almost periodic functions on a subinterval [\u03B1, \u221E] of the real line and precompactness of the set of its translates. Our compactness criteria are also applied to a question concerning the approximation property for spaces of vector valued continuous functions with topologies induced by weighted analogues of the supremum norm. as well as to obtain nonlinear variants on factorization of compact operators through reflexive Banach spaces.","publish_time":"2006-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ruess, W.

The key instruments in managing public fear and panic were transparency and trust. The highest levels of government were mobilised and every conceivable channel and medium utilised to educate the domestic populace and reassure the international community. Maintaining transparency and nurturing trust did not come easy. There was concern over public morale and resilience, the absence of an international level playing field and the difficulty in differentiating Singapore from countries which managed SARS badly. Achieving trust of the domestic populace was the more difficult task and the government and political leaders had to be seen doing and initiating a range of tangible actions and activities to reassure the public. Singapore also came in for much criticism from other countries for its \u2018draconian\u2019 measures to contain the disease through home quarantine orders and other stern measures on social discipline. Risk communications is an established methodology and lessons can be drawn from the experience of many countries in managing outbreaks touching on public health. While Singapore may be unique for its particular circumstances, its experience highlighted the critical importance of ensuring transparency and public trust in confronting the disease.

Risks of poor welfare are identified using a structured analysis, and issues not identified in the SCAHAW (2001) beef Opinion, especially effects of housing and management on enteric and respiratory diseases are reviewed. The Opinion covers all systems of beef production, although the welfare of suckler cows or breeding bulls is not considered. The Chapter on beef cattle presents new evidence and recommendations in relation to heat and cold stress, mutilations and pain management, digestive disorders linked to high concentrate feeds and respiratory disorders linked to overstocking, inadequate ventilation, mixing of animals and failure of early diagnosis and treatment. Major welfare problems in cattle kept for beef production, as identified by risk assessment, were respiratory diseases linked to overstocking, inadequate ventilation, mixing of animals and failure of early diagnosis and treatment, digestive disorders linked to intensive concentrate feeding, lack of physically effective fibre in the diet, and behavioural disorders linked to inadequate floor space, and co\u2010mingling in the feedlot. Major hazards for white veal calves were considered to be iron\u2010deficiency anaemia, a direct consequence of dietary iron restriction, enteric diseases linked to high intakes of liquid feed and inadequate intake of physically effective fibre, discomfort and behavioural disorders linked to inadequate floors and floor space.","publish_time":"2012-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"EFSA J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ed41e6d5782b6f671e70105576adb328c1723e9d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163673/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs4NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory disorders","Welfare of cattle","beef cattle","digestive disorders","behavioural disorders","inadequate ventilation","beef Opinion","systems of beef production","inadequate intake","inadequate floors","inadequate floor space","respiratory diseases","risks of poor welfare","Major welfare problems","enteric diseases","welfare of suckler cows","intensive concentrate","effective fibre","failure of early diagnosis","animals","treatment","SCAHAW","high concentrate feeds","pain management","intensive calf farming systems","new evidence","Major hazards","recent scientific evidence","high intakes of liquid feed","direct consequence of dietary iron restriction","mutilations","recommendations","discomfort","cold stress","effects of housing","relation","co\u2010mingling","white veal calves","deficiency anaemia","risk assessment","EFSA","breeding bulls","previous Opinions","lack","Chapter","structured analysis","topics","issues","Information","feedlot"],"language":"en"},

However, the degree to which protected areas achieve their conservation goals is generally unknown for many protected areas worldwide. We assess the effect of protected areas on the abundance of 196 common, resident bird species. If protected areas were beneficial to avian biodiversity, we expect landscapes with a higher proportion of protected areas will have higher densities of species compared to landscapes with no protection. LOCATION: Greater Gauteng region, South Africa. METHODS: We analysed bird survey data collected over regular grid cells across the study area. We estimated bird abundance in relation to the proportion of a grid cell that was protected with the Royle\u2013Nichols model and fitted the model once for each of the species. We examined variation in estimated abundance as a function of avian guild (defined by the type of food a species preferentially ate and its foraging mode) with a regression tree analysis. RESULTS: Abundance was significantly positively related to the proportion of protected areas in grid cells for 26% of the species, significantly negatively related in 15%, and not significantly related in 59% species. We found three distinct guild groups which differed in their average abundance, after accounting for associated variance. Group 1 consisted of guilds frugivores, ground\u2010feeders, hawkers, predators, and vegivores and average abundance was strongly positively related to the proportion of protected areas. Group 2 included granivores, and average abundance was strongly negatively related to proportion of protected areas. Group 3 included gleaners only, and average abundance was not related to proportion of protected areas. MAIN CONCLUSION: We conclude that the network of protected areas within the greater Gauteng region sustained relatively higher abundances of common birds and thus perform an important conservation role.","publish_time":"2018-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Duckworth, Gregory D.; Altwegg, Res","journal":"Divers Distrib","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2aacf9937008a41e11a4901adce6fcd3966880bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7163781.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163781/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs4NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Group"],"locations":["South Africa","Gauteng"],"keyphrases":["higher proportion of protected areas","network of protected areas","effect of protected areas","average abundance","bird abundance","estimated abundance","higher densities of species","resident bird species","extinction risks of species","Greater Gauteng region","regular grid cells","avian biodiversity","landscapes","conservation goals","higher abundances of common birds","bird survey data","key conservation tools","function of avian guild","important conservation role","Nichols model","included gleaners","distinct guild groups","predators","ground","feeders","hawkers","guilds frugivores","foraging mode","South Africa","study area","LOCATION","accounting","vegivores","AIM","regression tree analysis","relation","associated variance","Royle","METHODS","populations","type of food","variation","granivores","protection","MAIN CONCLUSION","RESULTS","degree"],"language":"en"},

Accumulating evidence shows that landscape fragmentation drives the observed worldwide decline in populations of pollinators, particularly in species of Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera. However, Little is known about the effects of landscape fragmentation on hoverfly (Diptera, Syrphidae) communities. Hoverflies provide varied ecosystem services: larvae contribute to waste decomposition (saprophagous species) and pest control (aphidophagous species), and adults pollinate a wide range of flowers. 2. To determine how the diversity and quantity of resources for larvae and adults affect hoverfly abundance and species richness at three spatial scales, we recorded insect visitors of five target plant species in Belgian heathlands, habitats that have decreased considerably due to human activities. 3. Hoverflies represented the most abundant visitors on two plant species, and the second most abundant visitors (after bumblebees) on the other target plant species. A large proportion of hoverflies observed were aphidophagous species associated with coniferous and deciduous forests. Resources for the larvae and floral resources for the adults influenced interactions among hoverflies and plants, but acted at different scales: larval habitat availability (distance to larval habitat) was relevant at the landscape scale, whereas adult resource availability (floral density) was relevant at the plot scale. 4. Hoverfly abundance and species richness decreased with distance to larval habitat but increased with floral density. Moreover, landscape structure and composition had different effects according to hoverfly ecological traits. Landscape composition influenced aphidophagous but not saprophagous hoverflies, in that their abundance and species richness decreased with distance to forests. Maintenance of the interactions between plants and their hoverfly visitors requires complementary resources at both landscape and local scales.","publish_time":"2017-07-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moquet, Laura; Laurent, Estelle; Bacchetta, Rossana; Jacquemart, Anne\u2010Laure","journal":"Insect Conserv Divers","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/920ec1cc009c4ac67fd5d1d3c1648c48c2e6ff8c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165621.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165621/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs5Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["species richness","aphidophagous species","saprophagous species","species of Lepidoptera","target plant species","hoverfly visitors","hoverfly abundance","Landscape composition","landscape scale","floral resources","landscape structure","saprophagous hoverflies","effects of landscape fragmentation","adults","larvae","distance","abundant visitors","larval habitat availability","different scales","complementary resources","insect visitors","quantity of resources","floral density","large proportion of hoverflies","different effects","plants","spatial scales","local scales","interactions","plot scale","deciduous forests","adult resource availability","waste decomposition","pest control","varied ecosystem services","Belgian heathlands","Diptera","Syrphidae","habitats","bumblebees","wide range of flowers","ecological traits","communities","Accumulating evidence","diversity","populations of pollinators","Maintenance","Hymenoptera","human activities"],"language":"en"},

Established in 1990, the Cheetah Conservation Fund aims to secure habitats for the long\u2010term survival of the species and its ecosystems. The primary focus of the Fund is working outside of the protected reserves with the local livestock farming communities to develop ways to reduce conflict between humans and Cheetahs. The Fund also conducts independent and collaborative research, disseminates information and recommends management techniques to farmers.","publish_time":"2007-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"MARKER\u2010KRAUS, LAURIE; KRAUS, DANIEL","journal":"Int Zoo Yearb","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e6ef0771d762de965752581c5a6628124432b1d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165671/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs5Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Cheetahs","Cheetah Conservation Fund"],"locations":["Africa"],"keyphrases":["Cheetah Conservation Fund","farmers","animals","livestock interests","largest wild population of Cheetahs","declining prey base","Cheetah Acinonyx jubatus","local livestock farming communities","information","ways","secure habitats","protected reserves","competition","long\u2010term survival","loss of habitat","collaborative research","range","conflict","management techniques","species","half","Namibia","humans","years numbers","ecosystems","Significant declines","primary focus","Africa","pests\u2019"],"language":"en"},

FUENTES DE DATOS: Estudios en cualquier idioma y tipo de publicaci\u00F3n recogidos en las siguientes bases de datos: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library 2009, n\u00FAmero 2), Medline (1966 a mayo de 2009), OldMedline (1955 a 1965), Embase (1990 hasta la semana 18 de 2009) y CINAHL (1982 a mayo de 2009). Se seleccionaron estudios que evaluasen cualquier intervenci\u00F3n f\u00EDsica para prevenir la transmisi\u00F3n de virus respiratorios de animales a humanos o de humanos a humanos, compar\u00E1ndola frente a cualquier otra o frente a ninguna actuaci\u00F3n (\u201Cno hacer nada\u201D). SELECCI\u00D3N DE ESTUDIOS Y EXTRACCI\u00D3N DE DATOS: Ensayos cl\u00EDnicos, estudios observacionales de cohortes, de casos y controles, estudios transversales, estudios antes-despu\u00E9s y estudios de series temporales, realizados en personas de cualquier edad y en los que constase informaci\u00F3n de control de posibles factores de confusi\u00F3n. Tras la lectura del t\u00EDtulo y del resumen se procedi\u00F3 a la lectura completa del estudio si este reun\u00EDa los criterios de elegibilidad o si se dispon\u00EDa de informaci\u00F3n insuficiente para su exclusi\u00F3n del an\u00E1lisis. Se hizo una clasificaci\u00F3n de la calidad atendiendo al riesgo de sesgos: estudios con alto, medio y bajo riesgo de sesgos. Las principales variables de resultados analizadas fueron el n\u00FAmero de casos, la gravedad, los ingresos hospitalarios y la mortalidad por infecciones v\u00EDricas. RESULTADOS PRINCIPALES: La estrategia de b\u00FAsqueda gener\u00F3 2.958 citas, de las que 168 fueron potencialmente relevantes y recuperadas, incluy\u00E9ndose finalmente 58 estudios pertenecientes a 59 proyectos de investigaci\u00F3n (4 ensayos cl\u00EDnicos aleatorios, 14 ensayos aleatorizados en cl\u00FAster, 7 estudios de casos y controles, 21 de cohortes y 13 estudios antes-despu\u00E9s). La calidad de los ensayos cl\u00EDnicos fue baja y la de los estudios observacionales, intermedia. El metaan\u00E1lisis de los estudios de casos y controles sugiere que las medidas f\u00EDsicas son altamente efectivas en prevenir la propagaci\u00F3n del s\u00EDndrome agudo respiratorio severo (SARS). Por ejemplo, el lavado frecuente de manos (\u003E 10 veces al d\u00EDa) obtiene una odds ratio (OR) de 0,45 (intervalo de confianza [IC] 95%: 0,36-0,57) y un n\u00FAmero necesario de pacientes a tratar (NNT) de 4,9 (IC 95%: 3,65-5,52). El uso de mascarillas simples, una OR de 0,32 (IC 95%: 0,25-0,40) y un NNT de 6 (IC 95%: 4,54-8,03) y el empleo de mascarillas N95, una OR de 0,09 (IC 95%: 0,03-0,30) y NNT de 3 (IC 95%: 2,37-4,06). Utilizar guantes, una OR de 0,43 (IC 95%: 0,29-0,65) y NNT de 5 (IC 95%: 4,15-15,41) y el uso de batas, una OR de 0,23 (IC 95%: 0,14-0,37) y NNT de 5 (IC 95%: 3,37-7,12). El uso simult\u00E1neo de lavado de manos, mascarillas, guantes y bata obtiene una OR de 0,09 (IC 95%: 0,02-0,35) y NNT de 3 (IC 95%: 2,66-4,97). Las medidas combinadas tambi\u00E9n fueron efectivas para frenar la transmisi\u00F3n de la gripe entre los familiares. Se desconoce si suplementar el lavado de manos con virucidas y antis\u00E9pticos disminuye la transmisi\u00F3n de las enfermedades respiratorias. CONCLUSI\u00D3N: Las medidas higi\u00E9nicas y las barreras f\u00EDsicas (especialmente el lavado de manos, el uso de mascarillas y el aislamiento de los casos) son estrategias efectivas para impedir la transmisi\u00F3n de las infecciones v\u00EDricas.","publish_time":"2010-06-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Buitrago, Francisco","journal":"FMC","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7144492.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7144492/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs2NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["estudios de casos","estudios observacionales","estudios pertenecientes","estudios transversales","SELECCI\u00D3N DE ESTUDIOS","NNT","estudios de series temporales","n\u00FAmero de casos","lavado de manos","controles","medidas f\u00EDsicas","humanos a humanos","uso de mascarillas simples","ensayos cl\u00EDnicos aleatorios","ensayos aleatorizados","barreras f\u00EDsicas","lavado frecuente","infecciones respiratorias","uso simult\u00E1neo","infecciones v\u00EDricas","uso de batas","transmisi\u00F3n de virus respiratorios","EXTRACCI\u00D3N DE DATOS","aislamiento","FUENTES DE DATOS","intervenciones f\u00EDsicas","cohortes","animales a humanos","n\u00FAmero necesario","RESULTADOS PRINCIPALES","empleo de mascarillas N95","medidas higi\u00E9nicas","guantes","estrategias efectivas","medidas combinadas","calidad","siguientes bases de datos","bajo riesgo de sesgos","Cochrane Library","informaci\u00F3n de control","principales variables de resultados analizadas","informaci\u00F3n insuficiente","enfermedades respiratorias","lectura completa","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials","alejamiento social","cuarentena","tipo de publicaci\u00F3n recogidos","s\u00EDndrome agudo respiratorio severo","proyectos de investigaci\u00F3n","propagaci\u00F3n","ingresos hospitalarios","protecci\u00F3n personal","idioma","antis\u00E9pticos","cl\u00FAster","SARS","resumen","d\u00EDa","veces","estrategia de b\u00FAsqueda","efectividad","mortalidad","gravedad","virucidas","posibles factores de confusi\u00F3n","odds ratio","origen v\u00EDrico","intervenci\u00F3n f\u00EDsica","personas","exclusi\u00F3n","ejemplo","pacientes","intervalo de confianza","semana","citas","criterios de elegibilidad","t\u00EDtulo","CONCLUSI\u00D3N","clasificaci\u00F3n","gripe","familiares","metaan\u00E1lisis","Embase","CINAHL","OBJETIVO","OldMedline","actuaci\u00F3n"],"language":"es"},

Polarized epithelial cells have long captured the attention of cell biologists and cell physiologists. At the electron-microscopic level, one of the most apparent and fundamental features of this cell type is its polarized organization of intracellular organelles and its structurally and compositionally distinct lumenal (apical) and serosal (basolateral) plasma-membrane domains. The polarized epithelial phenotype is an absolute necessity for organ-system function. In the most general sense, these cells organize to form a continuous, single layer of cells, or epithelium, which serves as a semi-permeable barrier between apposing and biologically distinct compartments. Within the tubules of the nephron, these cells orchestrate complex ion-transporting processes that ultimately control the overall fluid balance of the organism. At the surface of the gastrointestinal tract, specialized versions of this cell type control the digestion, absorption, and immuno-protection of the organism.","publish_time":"2008-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gottardi, Cara J.; Caplan, Michael J.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/47719f2c69cb4378011792e702c301b21cf7f118.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7147917/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs3NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["polarized cells","epithelial cells","cell type","polarized epithelial phenotype","cell physiologists","single layer of cells","attention of cell biologists","epithelial-membrane polarity","organism","polarized organization of intracellular organelles","sorting pathways","distinct compartments","distinct lumenal","plasma-membrane domains","sorting-signal paradigm","absolute necessity","specialized versions","apposing","processes","digestion","absorption","gastrointestinal tract","organ-system function","semi-permeable barrier","immuno-protection","nephron","epithelium","complex ion","fundamental features","overall fluid balance","surface","chapter","electron-microscopic level","general sense","tubules"],"language":"en"},

Many healthcare centers and hospitals use reporting systems where medical practitioners write a preliminary medical report and the report is later reviewed, revised, and finalized by a more experienced physician. The revisions range from stylistic to corrections of critical errors or misinterpretations of the case. Due to the large quantity of reports written daily, it is often difficult to manually and thoroughly review all the finalized reports to find such errors and learn from them. To address this challenge, we propose a novel ranking approach, consisting of textual and ontological overlaps between the preliminary and final versions of reports. The approach learns to rank the reports based on the degree of discrepancy between the versions. This allows medical practitioners to easily identify and learn from the reports in which their interpretation most substantially differed from that of the attending physician (who finalized the report). This is a crucial step towards uncovering potential errors and helping medical practitioners to learn from such errors, thus improving patient-care in the long run.

However, existing methods model the geographical influence based on the physical distance between POIs and users, while ignoring the temporal characteristics of such geographical influences. In this paper, we perform a study on the user mobility patterns where we find out that users\u2019 check-ins happen around several centers depending on their current temporal state. Next, we propose a spatio-temporal activity-centers algorithm to model users\u2019 behavior more accurately. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed contextual model by incorporating it into the matrix factorization model under two different settings: (i) static and (ii) temporal.

Recent advances in distributed word representations address the word mismatch problem by enabling semantic matching. However, most existing models rank documents based on semantic matching between query and document terms without an explicit understanding of the relationship of the match to relevance. To consider semantic matching between query and document, we propose an unsupervised semantic matching model by simulating a user who makes relevance decisions. The primary goal of the proposed model is to combine the exact and semantic matching between query and document terms, which has been shown to produce effective performance in information retrieval. As semantic matching between queries and entire documents is computationally expensive, we propose to use local contexts of query terms in documents for semantic matching. Matching with smaller query-related contexts of documents stems from the relevance judgment process recorded by human observers. The most relevant part of a document is then recognized and used to rank documents with respect to the query. Experimental results on several representative retrieval models and standard datasets show that our proposed semantic matching model significantly outperforms competitive baselines in all measures.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Montazeralghaem, Ali; Rahimi, Razieh; Allan, James","journal":"Advances in Information Retrieval","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/178c21001ef4e9c150a233f6d835a9cc9d4c1b5c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148224.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148224/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs4ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["proposed semantic matching model","unsupervised semantic matching model","entire documents","document terms","smaller query-related contexts of documents","local contexts of query terms","proposed model","information retrieval","word mismatch problem","queries","representative retrieval models","relevance decisions","distributed word representations","relevance judgment process","existing models","standard datasets","competitive baselines","explicit understanding","long-standing challenge","user","relationship","human observers","Recent advances","Experimental results","effective performance","primary goal","measures","respect"],"language":"en"},

Biocidal properties should be a necessary feature for medical-use textiles. Biocidal functions, different from biostatic functions, include sterilization, disinfection, and sanitization in an order of the strength. According to guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), medical use biocidal functions should be at least at the disinfection level, which can inactivate most infectious microorganisms. In addition, biocidal functions on textile materials should survive repeated laundering if used as uniforms, linens and even reusable surgical scraps and gowns. Among the currently investigated antimicrobial materials, only N-halamines have shown the capability of providing fast and total kill against a wide range of microorganisms without causing resistance from microorganisms. Furthermore, halamine structures can be recharged by chlorine bleaching, a process recommended by CD as well. Thus, biocidal textiles containing the halamine structures have been developed. Recent studies in biocidal polymers have resulted interesting progresses in incorporating halamines to all synthetic fabrics that are widely used as medical and other professional clothing materials. Chemistry and properties of the new processes have been discussed in this presentation.","publish_time":"2014-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Gang","journal":"Medical Textiles and Biomaterials for Healthcare","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152413.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7152413/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Biocidal properties","biocidal textiles","medical use biocidal functions","biocidal polymers","Textile materials","biostatic functions","antimicrobial materials","growth of microorganisms","infectious microorganisms","wide range of microorganisms","professional clothing materials","halamine structures","synthetic fibers","N-halamines","synthetic fabrics","disinfection level","Prevention","CDC","Disease Control","total kill","good media","linens","US Centers","uniforms","capability","sterilization","interesting progresses","repeated laundering","necessary feature","reusable surgical scraps","great concern","sanitization","drug-resistant bacteria","chlorine bleaching","resistance","addition","new processes","Recent studies","public health","gowns","guidelines","order","Chemistry","strength","presentation"],"language":"en"},

China also strengthened its coordination and cooperation with international partners, and attached importance to public communication and information disclosure. The following results were achieved: (1) China made a tremendous contribution to controlling the epidemic and local capacity-building while realizing the goal of zero infection of Chinese personnel; (2) by exerting the expertise and organizational advantage of military health institutions, China achieved greater effectiveness and efficiency and strengthened bilateral trust; and (3) China improved its biosecurity capacity and established an important platform for tropical infectious disease research and real-time monitoring of global infectious disease epidemics.","publish_time":"2018-12-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Chen","journal":"South-south Cooperation and Chinese Foreign Aid","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d2f9527f4fd6b69f6ade0b5129efe80bb6a34f32.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153409/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Africa"],"keyphrases":["round of aid","health aid initiative","rounds of humanitarian aid","multiple rounds of aid","comprehensive aid scheme","China\u2019s view","Ebola virus disease outbreak","China\u2019s history","China\u2019s fight","Chinese Government","guide China\u2019s policy","post-Ebola reconstruction","tropical infectious disease research","long-term public health system","real-time monitoring of global infectious disease epidemics","infection of Chinese personnel","global responsibility","public communication","real results","biosecurity capacity","local capacity","following results","organizational advantage of military health institutions","attached importance","good faith","important platform","greater effectiveness","affinity","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","international partners","early action","SARS","sincerity","cooperation","experience","efficiency","West African countries","principles","information disclosure","bilateral trust","expertise","coordination","relevant departments","major power","tremendous contribution","short-term goals","RMB of funding","half","flexible measures"],"language":"en"},

These disorders are mainly asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Disorders of the alveoli, where a decrease of lung compliance mandates the use of higher ventilatory pressures that can recruit but also damage the lung. These disorders include the acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and influenza. Additional types of acute respiratory failure are described elsewhere in this book: disorders that result from neuromuscular disease in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-19668-8_19 and pulmonary disorders of the circulation, including pulmonary thromboembolism, in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-19668-8_27.

Steeds gaat het om ziekten die het gevolg zijn van een interactie tussen de mens en een ander biologisch agens: een micro-organisme. Bij een infectieziekte is er sprake van een bepaalde vorm van interactie waarbij schade optreedt voor de mens. Verreweg de meeste interacties tussen mensen en micro-organismen zijn echter niet schadelijk voor de mens. Infectieziekten behoren tot de meest prevalente aandoeningen van de mens en op mondiaal niveau zijn ze nog steeds de belangrijkste oorzaak van vermijdbare sterfte. Daarom is het voor het onderwijs in de geneeskunde van groot belang infectieziekten te beschouwen als een aparte groep ziekten, met een unieke etiologie, epidemiologie, pathogenese, diagnostiek, behandeling en preventie. Infecties komen op alle leeftijden voor en kunnen alle organen en weefsels van het lichaam treffen. Infectieziekten zijn daardoor een belangrijk paradigma in de geneeskunde.

And several successes have been recorded in finding new actives in natural products, some of which have become new drugs or new sources of inspiration for drugs. But in view of the vast amount of research on the subject, it is surprising that not more drug candidates were found. In our view, it is fundamental to reflect upon the approaches of such drug discovery programs and the technical processes that are used, along with their inherent difficulties and biases. Based on an extensive survey of recent publications, we discuss the origin and the variety of natural chemical diversity as well as the strategies to having the potential to embrace this diversity. It seemed to us that some of the difficulties of the area could be related with the technical approaches that are used, so the present review begins with synthetizing some of the more used discovery strategies, exemplifying some key points, in order to address some of their limitations. It appears that one of the challenges of natural product-based drug discovery programs should be an easier access to renewable sources of plant-derived products. Maximizing the use of the data together with the exploration of chemical diversity while working on reasonable supply of natural product-based entities could be a way to answer this challenge. We suggested alternative ways to access and explore part of this chemical diversity with in vitro cultures. We also reinforced how important it was organizing and making available this worldwide knowledge in an \u201Cinventory\u201D of natural products and their sources. And finally, we focused on strategies based on synthetic biology and syntheses that allow reaching industrial scale supply. Approaches based on the opportunities lying in untapped natural plant chemical diversity are also considered.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lauti\u00E9, Emmanuelle; Russo, Olivier; Ducrot, Pierre; Boutin, Jean A.","journal":"Front Pharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6cae7a747dffdda0d7b13d22509e465df50900d4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7154113.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7154113/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjsxMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["natural products","variety of natural chemical diversity","immense natural chemical diversity","untapped natural plant chemical diversity","exploration of chemical diversity","challenges of natural product-based drug discovery programs","reasonable supply of natural product-based entities","used discovery strategies","new drugs","technical approaches","new sources of inspiration","renewable sources of plant","order","drug candidates","new actives","derived products","easier access","technical processes","worldwide knowledge","inherent difficulties","variety of pharmacological targets","industrial scale supply","syntheses","origin","concern","opportunities","key points","testing of extracts","synthetizing","inventory","extensive survey of recent publications","synthetic biology","subject","research","data","present review","screening","biases","area","laboratories","potential","cultures","alternative ways","limitations","successes"],"language":"en"},

It was developed for use at both the 52nd (H52) and 120th (H120) vaccine levels and, because of it ability to provide heterologous cross-protection against a number of IB viruses of different serotypes, has proved to be one of the most enduring live attenuated IB vaccines. In fact, the H120 vaccine is possibly the most widely used live attenuated IB vaccine globally to this day. The use of H52 has, however, declined with the introduction of safe and highly efficacious inactivated IB vaccines. This review documents the original studies to isolate and attenuate the H strain by serial embryo passage, and describes the early studies to demonstrate its efficacy in laboratory studies and under field conditions. The efficacy of the H vaccine in providing cross-protection against some of the many IB variants now reported worldwide is also discussed, and possible future vaccination strategies for IB considered.","publish_time":"2010-10-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bijlenga, Gosse; Cook, Jane K.

Today, humans have the capacity to reach virtually any city in the world within a day or two. Travel to tropical and developing countries are increasing more rapidly than travel to developed countries, and all projections suggest that human travel will continue to increase in the foreseeable future. Infectious diseases influence decisions about travel and trade; and travelers change the epidemiology of infectious diseases. Travel has played an essential role in the movement of HIV/AIDS throughout the world. Rapid international air travel moved the virus that causes SARS to multiple countries within weeks. Travel has been and will continue to be important in the movement of human influenza. Travel consists of sequential shared environments, often with people from diverse regions of the world.

However, research is required to find new ways to distinguish between the colonization and infective exacerbations of COPD to gain a better understanding of the role of infection in the disease. With advances in molecular biology, the antigenic structures of bacteria and the evaluation of the antibody response to antigens can become the basis for identifying an acute exacerbation of COPD (AECB). Most clinical trials of antibiotics were performed for licensing, and patients with pathogens resistant to different antimicrobials were excluded. Future studies of new antimicrobials should examine clinical efficacy more stringently based on a classification system that would help select patients most likely to benefit from an antibiotic.

Comparative analyses of the structures of genomes and their products have placed the picornaviruses into a large \u201Cpicorna-like\u201D virus family, in which they occupy a prominent place. Most human picornavirus infections are self-limiting, yet the enormously high rate of picornavirus infections in the human population can lead to a significant incidence of disease complications that may be permanently debilitating or even fatal. Picornaviruses employ one of the simplest imaginable genetic systems: they consist of single-stranded RNA that encodes only a single multidomain polypeptide, the polyprotein. The RNA is packaged into a small, rigid, naked, and icosahedral virion whose proteins are unmodified except for a myristate at the N-termini of VP4. The RNA itself does not contain modified bases. The key to ultimately understanding picornaviruses may be to rationalize the huge amount of information about these viruses from the perspective of evolution. It is possible that the replicative apparatus of picornaviruses originated in the precellular world and was subsequently refined in the course of thousands of generations in a slowly evolving environment.

These exacerbations are also associated with considerable physiological deterioration and increased airway inflammatory changes caused by a variety of factors such as viruses, bacteria, and some common pollutants. Exacerbation of COPD results in an increase in airflow obstruction, which further increases the load on the respiratory muscles and increases the effort in breathing, thereby leading to respiratory failure in severe cases. Treatment approaches include the use of corticosteroids, antibiotics, inhaled bronchodilator therapy in certain cases, and ventilatory support. Increased patient education about detecting and treating exacerbations early in the natural history of COPD can be significantly beneficial.

Although several studies have reported nosocomial outbreaks in neonatal intensive care units, molecular epidemiology data are scarce. Here, the authors describe two consecutive respiratory syncytial virus outbreaks caused by genotypes ON\u20101 and NA\u20102 in a neonatal intensive care unit in S\u00E3o Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: A prospective search for respiratory syncytial virus was performed after diagnosing the index case and four other symptomatic newborns in the neonatal intensive care unit. Nasopharyngeal aspirate samples of all patients in the neonatal intensive care unit were tested for 17 respiratory viruses using real\u2010time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Genotyping was performed using nucleotide sequencing. RESULTS: From May to August 2013, two different outbreaks were detected in the neonatal intensive care unit. A total of 20 infants were infected with respiratory syncytial virus\u2010A (ten and 14 with ON\u20101 and NA\u20102 genotypes, respectively). The mean age of the infants was 10 days, mean birth weight was 1,961 g, and the mean gestational age was 33 weeks. Risk factors (heart disease, lung disease, and prematurity) were present in 80% and 85.7% of infants in the ON\u20101 and NA\u20102 groups, respectively. In total, 45.8% of infants were asymptomatic and 20.8% required mechanical ventilation. Coinfections were not detected during the outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: Infants in a neonatal intensive care unit who develop abrupt respiratory symptoms should be tested for respiratory viruses, especially respiratory syncytial virus. Even in the absence of severe symptoms, respiratory syncytial virus detection can prevent nosocomial transmission through infection control measures. A better understanding of respiratory syncytial virus molecular epidemiology is essential for developing new vaccines and antiviral drugs against respiratory syncytial virus.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Silva, Daniella Gregoria Bomfim Prado da; Almeida, Fl\u00E1via Jacqueline; Arnoni, Mariana Volpe; S\u00E1fadi, Marco Aur\u00E9lio Palazzi; Mimica, Marcelo Jenne; Jarovsky, Daniel; Rossetti, Gabriela Pereira de Almeida; Magalh\u00E3es, Mauricio; Oliveira, Danielle Bruna Leal de; Thomazelli, Luciano Matsumiya; Colmanetti, Thais Cristina; Durigon, Edison Luiz; Berezin, Eitan Naaman","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da3c44eeb2af260322136c7308268ce787b07cf7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7156209/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs0MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["respiratory syncytial virus detection","consecutive respiratory syncytial virus outbreaks","respiratory viruses","infants","neonatal intensive care units","better understanding of respiratory syncytial virus molecular epidemiology","abrupt respiratory symptoms","nosocomial outbreaks","different outbreaks","mean age","nosocomial transmission","mean gestational age","genotypes","total","molecular epidemiology data","mean birth weight","lung disease","heart disease","absence of severe symptoms","new vaccines","patients","real\u2010time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","symptomatic newborns","antiviral drugs","S\u00E3o Paulo","days","prospective search","pathogen","Risk factors","infection control measures","prematurity","Brazil","authors","index case","Nasopharyngeal aspirate samples","weeks","METHODS","studies","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVE","Genotyping","nucleotide sequencing","mechanical ventilation","groups","Coinfections","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

It describes the roles of intestinal enzymes, focussing on complementarity with salivary, gastric, and pancreatic digestive enzymes and their hydrolytic function in the process of absorption. Gene expression of the enzymes and nutritional regulation of their expression appear during postnatal development up to maturity. After translation of the specific mRNA, a single precursor of maltaseglucoamylase (pro-MG), rich in mannose, is produced in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). In contrast to the relatively small number of carbohydrases, the number of peptidases found in enterocytes in the small intestine is large, because of the large number of different peptide bonds in oligopeptides produced by the action of pancreatic proteases. The digestive function (disaccharidase and peptidase activities) of the enterocytes and their microvilli begins when structural differentiation is complete, that is, during the period of migration over the cryptvillus junction. Modern techniques and investigations are expected to yield relevant data for elaborating feeding strategies that take into account the complex interactions between the diet, the microflora, the luminal milieu and the physiology of the small intestine, including the optimal functioning of the immunological and endocrine systems.","publish_time":"2009-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu\u00EBrou-Luron, I.

Why did 47 states impose barriers anyway? This article argues that states use barriers as political cover to prevent a loss of domestic political support. This logic suggests that governments anticipating high domestic political benefits for imposing barriers during an outbreak will be likely to do so. Logistic regression and duration analysis of an original dataset coding state behavior during H1N1 provide support for this argument: democracies with weak health infrastructure\u2014those that stand to gain the most from imposing barriers during an outbreak because they are particularly vulnerable to a negative public reaction\u2014are more likely than others to impose barriers and to do so quickly.

If bats in close interaction with humans host and shed coronaviruses with zoonotic potential, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus, spillover may occur. Therefore, strategies aiming to mitigate potential spillover and disease emergence, while supporting the conservation of bats and their important ecological roles are needed. Past research suggests that coronavirus shedding in bats varies seasonally following their reproductive cycle; however, shedding dynamics have been assessed in only a few species, which does not allow for generalization of findings across bat taxa and geographic regions. METHODS: To assess the generalizability of coronavirus shedding seasonality, we sampled hundreds of bats belonging to several species with different life history traits across East Africa at different times of the year. We assessed, via Bayesian modeling, the hypothesis that chiropterans, across species and spatial domains, experience seasonal trends in coronavirus shedding as a function of the reproductive cycle. RESULTS: We found that, beyond spatial, taxonomic, and life history differences, coronavirus shedding is more expected when pups are becoming independent from the dam and that juvenile bats are prone to shed these viruses. CONCLUSIONS: These findings could guide policy aimed at the prevention of spillover in limited-resource settings, where longitudinal surveillance is not feasible, by identifying high-risk periods for coronavirus shedding. In these periods, contact with bats should be avoided (for example, by impeding or forbidding people access to caves). Our proposed strategy provides an alternative to culling \u2013 an ethically questionable practice that may result in higher pathogen levels \u2013 and supports the conservation of bats and the delivery of their key ecosystem services.","publish_time":"2020-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Montecino-Latorre, Diego; Goldstein, Tracey; Gilardi, Kirsten; Wolking, David; Van Wormer, Elizabeth; Kazwala, Rudovick; Ssebide, Benard; Nziza, Julius; Sijali, Zikankuba; Cranfield, Michael; Mazet, Jonna A.

It is important for the management at such destinations to prepare for, and respond to, health- and life-threatening infectious diseases, to mitigate any negative impact on local economy and society. Mosquito-borne infections, such as dengue, are rapidly spreading globally, including in Bali, Indonesia. However, travellers tend to be unaware of the health threats resulting from mosquito bites. Increased dengue incidence amongst travellers could also result in exposure of the local people to the infection. Traversing the disciplines of Travel Medicine, Entomology and Business Administration, we carried out a study comprising fieldwork and literature analyses, to address the proposed empowerment of hotels to disseminate information on dengue prevention and control to international travellers. The fieldwork included an outreach workshop and questionnaire, conducted by partnering the local health authorities and hotel association. Additionally, we carried out site visits to several hotels. The questionnaire revealed that only 67% of the participating hotel personnel know that dengue is mosquito-borne. Eighty-three percent of the facilities reported mosquito nuisance problems, and fogging was the most utilised control measure of choice. Our analyses indicate that there is a role for the hotel sector in promoting anti-dengue awareness and activities in Bali. Such an initiative could assist Bali to work towards the good health and well-being for the sustainable development goals. Our follow-up studies will include capacity building for risk communication to international travellers, and for mosquito control at hotels.","publish_time":"2019-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yoshikawa, Minako Jen; Kusriastuti, Rita; Liew, Christina","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/00f4ff4c35b33ae22a8883d06b3def89407aa16e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149142/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjsxNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Bali","Indonesia"],"keyphrases":["mosquito control","dengue prevention","international travellers","mosquito bites","Bali","local health authorities","travel destinations","good health","health threats","anti-dengue awareness","Increased dengue incidence","mosquito nuisance problems","hotel sector","hotel association","local economy","local people","fieldwork","questionnaire","disciplines of Travel Medicine","participating hotel personnel","cancellation of travel plans","proposed empowerment of hotels","utilised control measure of choice","literature analyses","life-threatening infectious diseases","Infectious disease outbreaks","capacity building","fogging","information","negative impact","risk communication","Entomology","well-being","Business Administration","sustainable development goals","society","study","facilities","activities","follow-up studies","outreach workshop","percent","role","exposure","management","site visits","infections","Indonesia","initiative"],"language":"en"},

In each case, \u201Cfinancialization\u201D has been an important element in the growth of the Quaternary economy, even in such relative newcomers as Vietnam, where privatization of services has attracted private equity and other foreign direct investment financiers.

The development of such innovative treatments not only depends on a better understanding of the pathophysiology of acute lung injury, but also required the validation of dynamic assessment tools to be used at the bedside.","publish_time":"2017-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guillon, A.; Gibot, S.; Ait-Oufella, H.; Uhel, F.; Monneret, G.; Sharshar, T.; Taccone, F.

Many diagnostic options have to be taken into account when a patient suffering from lung cancer presents with nonspecific, respiratory, clinical manifestations. A multidisciplinary diagnostic approach is then warranted. The top priority is to rule out those life-threatening causes, such as lung infection, that could be properly treated if a right diagnosis is early. To reach a definite diagnosis frequently requires that one or more diagnostic, pneumologic techniques are performed. Regarding to drug-induced pulmonary disease, prevention is mandatory. In this review we have tried to highlight the risk and characteristics of cytostatic-induced pulmonary toxicity caused by those agents that have been commonly employed to treat lung cancer for the last decades. When treating lung cancer patients, a high clinical suspicion of chemotherapy-induced lung toxicity should be kept in mind since an early withdrawal of the offending drug is the most efficacious therapy.","publish_time":"2001-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cutillas, Jorge Roig; Rodr\u00EDguez, Elvira Gea; Vi\u00F1als, Nuria Barral","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8944dcb651446350b80df07ea49910813fe751af.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149244/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjsyMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung cancer patients","stages of lung cancer","induced lung toxicity","lung infection","pulmonary toxicity","diagnostic options","multidisciplinary diagnostic approach","high clinical suspicion of chemotherapy","clinical manifestations","offending drug","pulmonary disease","efficacious therapy","cornerstone of therapy","early withdrawal","right diagnosis","definite diagnosis","patient suffering","characteristics of cytostatic","prevention","account","mind","life-threatening causes","risk","pneumologic techniques","agents","decades","priority","review"],"language":"en"},

Each of these disciplines works in systems that face ethical dilemmas, making it important that public health workers have motivation to understand and practice within the ethical guidelines of their profession, thus making ethics an important component of training and practice. The dangers of ethical lapses are overwhelmingly apparent in the case of the Eugenics movement of the early 20(th) century which metamorphosed from forced sterilizations in many liberal democratic countries into mass murder of physically and mentally handicapped children and adults in Nazi Germany. Between 1939 and 1941, 180 thousand psychiatric patients along with an equivalent number of handicapped children and adults were killed in an organized extermination program in Germany by lethal gassing. This method was then applied to the industrialized murder or Holocaust of six million Jews and millions of other \u201Cuntermenschen\u201D (sub human) in the greatest genocide in human history. Shortly after World War II ended the Nuremberg Trials of Nazi war criminals were conducted including medical doctors, and some were executed for crimes against humanity. This was followed by the 1948 United Nations Declaration on Human Rights and by the World Medical Association\u2019s Helsinki Declaration. Both are widely accepted as cornerstone documents\u2014the latter specifically governing ethical standards related to human experimentation\u2014and are revised regularly since being issued in 1964. But genocide has not disappeared, nor has unscrupulous experimentation such as the Tuskegee experiment on black Americans infected with syphilis and left untreated even after the availability of a cure, penicillin. Ethical standards are now required by \u201CHelsinki Committees\u201D\u2014ethical review boards\u2014in most medical facilities worldwide. Ethical frameworks have evolved in part due to bitter experience of ethical failures later recognized and affecting public health standards of practice. Future generations of public health leaders and staff will face many ethical issues such as mandatory immunization of health workers and school children, and assisted death of terminally ill patients.","publish_time":"2018-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tulchinsky, Theodore H.","journal":"Case Studies in Public Health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149338.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149338/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjsyOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["United Nations","Human Rights","World Medical Association"],"locations":["Germany","Nuremberg"],"keyphrases":["ethical issues","ethical dilemmas","ethical guidelines","Ethical frameworks","public health workers","environmental health","health promotion","health protection","public health standards of practice","field of public health","governing ethical standards","ethical review boards","dangers of ethical lapses","mandatory immunization of health workers","Future generations of public health leaders","human experimentation","bitter experience of ethical failures","Human Rights","sub human","human history","school children","adults","World War","Nazi Germany","World Medical Association\u2019s Helsinki Declaration","medical facilities","medical doctors","equivalent number of handicapped children","mass murder","professional disciplines","Helsinki Committees","industrialized murder","unscrupulous experimentation","greatest genocide","ill patients","psychiatric patients","Nuremberg Trials of Nazi war criminals","important component of training","United Nations Declaration","liberal democratic countries","wide scope of activities","financing","epidemiology","staff","forced sterilizations","Tuskegee experiment","assisted death","organized extermination program","supervision","sanitation","motivation","black Americans","lethal gassing","Eugenics movement","syphilis","case","century","Holocaust","Jews","ethics","untermenschen","availability","millions","systems","provision of clinical care","cornerstone documents","cure","penicillin","crimes","humanity","method"],"language":"en"},

No single source of information can provide all the information and guidance necessary to develop an adequate safety program/plan to protect laboratory personnel from various hazards. Most countries and provinces have regulations related to safety precautions that may need to be followed by laboratories. This chapter draws attention to general considerations concerning safety approaches in biomedical research laboratories in the United States. The operation of biomedical research laboratories requires attention to many complex issues that depend on the goals and activities of each specific laboratory. All laboratories should consider issues in physical, electrical, and fire safety. Safety can be maintained with the careful evaluation of all safety incidents and modification of the safety plan to prevent similar incidents. Regulations specify approaches necessary to protect employees from blood-borne pathogens, general laboratory chemicals, and specific chemicals such as formaldehyde. All employees need to work in order to maintain a safe working environment. This requires establishing a safety infrastructure, developing and monitoring of an effective safety plan, and imparting information about safety hazards associated with special types of laboratory work: biohazards, chemical hazards, and radiation hazards.","publish_time":"2010-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grizzle, William E.; Bell, Walter C.; Fredenburgh, Jerry","journal":"Molecular Diagnostics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149828.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149828/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs0MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["safety hazards","safety approaches","safety incidents","safety precautions","safety infrastructure","effective safety plan","adequate safety program","specific laboratory","general laboratory chemicals","laboratory personnel","operation of biomedical research laboratories","chemical hazards","radiation hazards","various hazards","special types of laboratory work","attention","approaches necessary","imparting information","specific chemicals","regulations","employees","safe operation","single source of information","general considerations","guidance necessary","complex issues","similar incidents","safe working environment","biohazards","blood","goals","pathogens","monitoring","modification","order","provinces","United States","careful evaluation","chapter","activities","countries","formaldehyde"],"language":"en"},

Due to the fact that a comprehensive colony health monitoring program is so vital in protecting the validity and reproducibility of experimental research data, it must be devoted an appropriate priority in terms of budget, personnel, and other resources. The policies and practices should be defined in written plans, and agreement with the principles set forth should be secured by the scientific and administrative leadership of the institution, as well as by the veterinary and animal care group. Programs should be designed to monitor individual animal health through the use of direct methods such as close observation and physical examination. A program created to monitor the overall health status of a colony population often utilizes more indirect methods. Routine testing of selected representative animals (even in the absence of any signs of illness or disease) can provide valuable information regarding the viral, parasitic, and bacterial agents that such animals are either currently harboring or have been exposed to in the past. Risk analysis should be done by any institution planning on holding rodents, a process that should involve a discussion of the relative costs and benefits of the various options available for routine health monitoring as well as quarantine isolation and testing.","publish_time":"2007-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Otto, Glen; Franklin, Craig L.","journal":"The Laboratory Rat","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150000.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7150000/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs0Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["routine health monitoring","individual animal health","comprehensive colony health monitoring program","overall health status","institution","Routine testing of selected representative animals","colony population","indirect methods","use of direct methods","animal care group","basic principles of medical management of rat colonies","diagnostic approaches","various options available","benefits","close observation","validity","terms of budget","valuable information","relative costs","quarantine isolation","reproducibility of experimental research data","personnel","discussion","infectious diseases of rats","absence","bacterial agents","fact","signs of illness","appropriate priority","written plans","physical examination","practices","administrative leadership","agreement","chapter","process","resources","rodents","Risk analysis","policies","Programs","past"],"language":"en"},

Different hypotheses have been proposed to explain the origin of CICs, including mutations in adult stem/progenitor cells or the acquisition of stem-like characteristics in differentiated cells; however, studies have yielded conflicting identification for CICs and have little information for the origin to generate CICs. Part of the difficulty in identifying CICs may stem from the fact that the CICs studied have been largely derived from cancer cell lines or well-developed tumors. In previous studies, we have reported the enrichment of mouse pulmonary stem/progenitor cells (mPSCs) by using serum-free primary selection culture followed by FACS isolation using the coxsackievirus/adenovirus receptor (CAR) as the positive selection marker. Here, we demonstrated that overexpression of the pluripotent transcription factor Oct-4 is sufficient to induce CAR(\u002B)/mPSCs transformation, which we name CAR(\u002B)/mPSCs(Oct-4_hi). These transformed cells possess cancer initiating and chemoresistance potential, as well as exhibiting remarkable expression of certain proangiogenic factors, including angiopoietins (ANGs) and VEGF, and enhanced angiogenic potential. Moreover, CAR(\u002B)/mPSCs(Oct-4_hi) actively participated in tumor blood vessel formation and triggered a novel angiogenic mechanism, the angiopoietins/Tie2 signaling pathway. These study provide critical evidence supporting the possible origin to generate CICs, and help elucidate the pathways responsible for CICs-mediated blood vessel formation.","publish_time":"2016-02-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gu, Sing-Yi; Ho, Choa-Chi; Huang, Yung-Kang; Chen, Huei-Wen; Wang, Yu-Chi; Kuo, Chia-Yu; Teng, Shu-Chun; Fu, Wen-Mei; Yang, Pan-Chyr; Wu, Cheng-Wen; Peng, Fu-Chuo; Ling, Thai-Yen","journal":"Oncotarget","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97472ef04ad420815a0fa19076162835fad47af4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4924688.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4924688/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozk5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FACS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["origin of CICs","Cancer stem cells","progenitor cells","CAR","differentiated cells","transformed cells","acquisition of stem","adult stem","CICs-mediated blood vessel formation","mPSCs transformation","angiopoietins","enrichment of mouse pulmonary stem","tumor blood vessel formation","possible origin","cancer cell lines","chemoresistance potential","enhanced angiogenic potential","pathways responsible","tumor growth","previous studies","novel angiogenic mechanism","positive selection marker","serum-free primary selection culture","FACS isolation","mutations","remarkable expression of certain proangiogenic factors","ANGs","adenovirus receptor","coxsackievirus","VEGF","little information","help","conflicting identification","critical evidence","well-developed tumors","Tie2","characteristics","pluripotent transcription factor","overexpression","study","Different hypotheses","difficulty"],"language":"en"},

This results in Th2\u2010biased immune responses. The nature of IFN\u2010\u03B2\u2010modulated DC remains elusive. Previously, we observed that IFN\u2010\u03B2 dose dependently induces expression of CD123, i.e. a classical marker for plasmacytoid DC, on human blood monocyte\u2010derived myeloid DC. Such IFN\u2010\u03B2\u2010modulated DC produce predominantly IL\u201010 but are IL\u201012 deficient, with potent Th2 promotion.

We show that IFN\u2010\u03B2 induces development of CD123(\u002B) DC from human blood monocytes, which coexpress BDCA4(\u002B) but are negative for BDCA2(\u2013), a specific marker for plasmacytoid DC.

LXRs and their ligands are negative regulators of macrophage inflammatory gene expression. Multiple sclerosis (MS), a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system of unknown cause, is characterized by recurrent inflammation involving macrophages and their inflammatory mediators. Sweden belongs to the countries with a high MS incidence. In Italy, incidence is lower, with an exception for Sardinia where the incidence is even higher than that in Sweden. Subjects from Sardinia are ethnically more homogeneous and differ from Swedes, also regarding genetic background and environment. We studied LXRs and their related molecules of blood mononuclear cells (MNCs) from female patients with untreated relapsing\u2010remitting MS from Sassari, Sardinia and Stockholm, Sweden. Sex\u2010 and age\u2010matched healthy controls (HCs) were from both areas. mRNA expression was evaluated by real\u2010time PCR.

These tools may therefore enable a fast and rational approach to epitope identification and thereby assist in the development of vaccines and immunotherapy. A crucial step in the generation of such bioinformatics tools is the selection of data representing the event in question (in casu peptide\u2013HLA interaction). This is particularly important when it is difficult and expensive to obtain data. Herein, we demonstrate the importance in selecting information\u2010rich data and we develop a computational method, query\u2010by\u2010committee, which can perform a global identification of such information\u2010rich data in an unbiased and automated manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this method can be applied to an efficient iterative development strategy for these bioinformatics tools. Methods: A large panel of binding affinities of peptides binding to HLA A*0204 was measured by a radioimmunoassay (RIA). This data was used to develop multiple first generation ANNs, which formed a virtual committee. This committee was used to screen (or \u2018queried\u2019) for peptides, where the ANNs agreed (\u2018low\u2010QBC\u2019), or disagreed (\u2018high\u2010QBC\u2019), on their HLA\u2010binding potential. Seventeen low\u2010QBC peptides and 17 high\u2010QBC peptides were synthesized and tested. The high\u2010 or low\u2010QBC data were added to the original data, and new high\u2010 or low\u2010QBC second generation ANNs were developed, respectively. This procedure was repeated 40 times. Results: The high\u2010QBC\u2010enriched ANN performed significantly better than the low\u2010QBC\u2010enriched ANN in 37 of the 40 tests. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that high\u2010QBC\u2010enriched networks perform better than low\u2010QBC\u2010enriched networks in selecting informative data for developing peptide\u2013MHC\u2010binding predictors. This improvement in selecting data is not due to differences in network training performance but due to the difference in information content in the high\u2010QBC experiment and in the low\u2010QBC experiment. Finally, it should be noted that this strategy could be used in many contexts where generation of data is difficult and costly.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lamberth, K.; Nielsen, M.; Lundegaard, C.; Worning, P.; Laurm\u00F8ller, S.

Keratins 16 (K16) and 17 (K17) are mostly absent from uninvolved skin but are upregulated in psoriatic lesions. There is increasing evidence that CD8(\u002B) T cells play an important effector role in psoriasis and M protein\u2010primed T cells may recognize these shared epitopes in skin via molecular mimicry. To identify candidate epitopes, peptides with sequences from K17 were selected on the basis of predicted binding to HLA\u2010Cw6 and sequence similarities with M6 protein. Matched peptides from the sequence of M6 protein and a set of peptides with poor predicted binding were also selected. Cw6(\u002B) individuals with psoriasis and Cw6(\u002B) healthy controls, having a family history of psoriasis, were recruited. PBMCs were incubated with the peptide antigens.

As the list of viruses capable of infecting the CNS expanded rapidly during the earlier part of the 20th century, so too did the recognition that individual viruses exhibited specific affinities for particular regions of the nervous system, and often for particular cell types within these regions. In this part of our review we will focus specifically on the role played by the interaction between specific viral proteins (\u2018cell attachment proteins\u2019) and receptors on target cells in determining the tropism of certain viruses for the CNS. In a subsequent article, the role of host genes, the site of entry and route of spread of virus, and the contribution of tissue-specific viral genes (enhancers) to viral neurotropism will be reviewed.","publish_time":"2003-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tyler, Kenneth L.","journal":"Trends Neurosci","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172453/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs0OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specific regions","specific viral genes","specific viral proteins","CNS","specific affinities","viral illnesses","particular regions","viral neurotropism","individual viruses","nervous system","century","role of host genes","particular cell types","tropism of certain viruses","list of viruses capable","cell attachment proteins\u2019","enhancers","contribution of tissue","target cells","receptors","site of entry","recognition","symptoms","interaction","subsequent article","clinical signs","route","time of Charcot","review"],"language":"en"},

These phenomena have been realized and studied by the anthropology and sociology research communities since 1930. However, the recent rapid development in information technology and the internet has increased the interest in social networks and as a model they have been adapted to more applications and domains. Though researchers first studied social networks of humans, for our study described in this chapter we argue that genes and proteins act collaboratively and exist in communities analogous to humans, animals, insects, etc. They complement each other and collectively achieve specific tasks where some would have major roles appearing upfront and others may play minor background roles. However, molecules turn into aggressive actors when their internal structure is augmented; consequently, they may deviate from their target, change camp, and disturb other molecules leading to disaster. Such mutations may be uncontrolled and unintentionally occur inside a body, or they may be intentional and controlled by humans to serve one of two purposes, treatment or bioterrorism. In other words, mutation in the molecules (genes) can lead to a change in behavior. This may lead to good or bad effect, e.g., recovery from illness or diseases that may severely affect the body causing disability or death. Once mutated outside the body, molecules may turn into harmful biological weapons of mass destruction. The latter process does not require sophisticated equipment and hence is extremely dangerous with the uprising global terrorism activities. Bioterrorism is therefore a serious concern for humanity. One could say that mutated biological agents outside the body once misused could be way more dangerous than mutated molecules within the body. In this chapter, we will elaborate on bioterrorism and its consequences; we will also propose a model to study social networks of genes within the body leading to the identification of disease biomarkers.","publish_time":"2011-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Naji, Ghada; Nagi, Mohamad; ElSheikh, Abdallah M.; Gao, Shang; Kianmehr, Keivan; \u00D6zyer, Tansel; Rokne, Jon; Demetrick, Douglas; Ridley, Mick; Alhajj, Reda","journal":"Counterterrorism and Open Source Intelligence","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c843c3ae661490959ed78113441b59d9e9555d59.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7176268.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176268/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs3ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["body","mutated molecules","social networks of humans","social networks of genes","bioterrorism","Social networks form phenomena","mutated biological agents","model","chapter","study","change","communities analogous","major roles","sociology research communities","minor background roles","harmful biological weapons of mass destruction","information technology","recent rapid development","recovery","uprising global terrorism activities","internet","aggressive actors","animals","bad effect","illness","internal structure","anthropology","sophisticated equipment","serious concern","insects","diseases","purposes","proteins","researchers","identification of disease biomarkers","specific tasks","process","humanity","treatment","camp","words","disability","death","applications","domains","target","mutations","behavior","consequences","disaster"],"language":"en"},

Objective: To discuss the implementation of international and local recommendations, and any additional actions undertaken at our Neonatal Unit in order to prepare for COVID-19. Discussion: Standard precautions in order to prepare a facility and its personnel to safely care for COVID-19 patients as outlined by the World Health Organization procedures have been implemented. Further actions undertaken in our Neonatal Unit included the creation of standard operating procedures, increased communication between neonatal and obstetric teams, limiting staff exposure, the creation of disposable resuscitation boxes to attend deliveries, reallocation of a triage area in the high care ward to an isolation area for sick newborns of suspected or confirmed maternal COVID-19 cases, staff training on personal protective equipment procedures and initiation of an online resources portal for neonatal staff. Conclusion: A rational approach to suspected cases and infection control in-line with local and international guidelines as well as ongoing education should diminish anxiety amongst health-care professionals and provide the best possible care to patients. South Africa is a low-to-middle income country, and the lack of resources available means we cannot increase our capacity, staffing numbers or available equipment. Yet, we must be as prepared, adaptable and efficient as possible to maximize the resources and equipment we have available to us.","publish_time":"2020-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saggers, Robin T.; Ramdin, Tanusha D.; Bandini, Rossella M.; Ballot, Daynia E.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46b1c079eb01c8c21fa6c83160d97b64c1f04d50.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7187743.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7187743/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs5NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["South Africa"],"keyphrases":["neonatal staff","Neonatal Unit","health-care professionals","available equipment","health-care workers","patients","best possible care","maternal COVID","high care ward","lack of resources available","staff training","suspected cases","staff exposure","personal protective equipment procedures","creation of standard operating procedures","World Health Organization procedures","order","South Africa","sick newborns of suspected","online resources portal","isolation area","triage area","infection risk","infection control","local recommendations","Standard precautions","international guidelines","implementation of international","additional actions","creation of disposable resuscitation boxes","increased communication","initiation","deliveries","obstetric teams","rational approach","reallocation","ongoing education","anxiety","capacity","middle income country","novel coronavirus disease","pregnant women","staffing numbers","Background","facility","Conclusion","Discussion","pandemic","personnel","Objective"],"language":"en"},

The fascinating and unparalleled properties of electrospun nanomaterials, such as large surface-to-volume ratios and high open porosity, have opened new and unexpected fields of application, especially in ultrasensitive sensors. By exploiting the inherent physical, electrical and mechanical properties of nanomaterials, it is possible to improve the performance of conventional sensors by increasing their sensitivity, selectivity, portability and power efficiency. In this chapter, the recent progress in the development of electrospun nanomaterials is reviewed. In particular, applications in some predominant sensing approaches, such as acoustic wave, resistive, photoelectric, optical and biological, are discussed.","publish_time":"2014-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, X.F.; Ding, B.; Yu, J.Y.","journal":"Functional Nanofibers and their Applications","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152087.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7152087/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE4LmNzdjs3Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":487495,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:13Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5GzcUqdOC7DkkOLI0gxzvw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_18.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of electrospun nanomaterials","unparalleled properties of electrospun nanomaterials","mechanical properties of nanomaterials","applications","ultrasensitive sensors","performance of conventional sensors","acoustic wave","volume ratios","high open porosity","predominant sensing approaches","selectivity","sensitivity","large surface","recent progress","unexpected fields of application","portability","power efficiency","chapter","decade"],"language":"en"},

The spread of COVID-19 has been heterogeneous, resulting in some regions having sporadic transmission and relatively few hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and others having community transmission that has led to overwhelming numbers of severe cases. For these regions, healthcare delivery has been disrupted and compromised by critical resource constraints in diagnostic testing, hospital beds, ventilators, and healthcare workers who have fallen ill to the virus exacerbated by shortages of personal protective equipment. While mild cases mimic common upper respiratory viral infections, respiratory dysfunction becomes the principal source of morbidity and mortality as the disease advances. Thoracic imaging with chest radiography (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) are key tools for pulmonary disease diagnosis and management, but their role in the management of COVID-19 has not been considered within the multivariable context of the severity of respiratory disease, pre-test probability, risk factors for disease progression, and critical resource constraints. To address this deficit, a multidisciplinary panel comprised principally of radiologists and pulmonologists from 10 countries with experience managing COVID-19 patients across a spectrum of healthcare environments evaluated the utility of imaging within three scenarios representing varying risk factors, community conditions, and resource constraints. Fourteen key questions, corresponding to 11 decision points within the three scenarios and three additional clinical situations, were rated by the panel based upon the anticipated value of the information that thoracic imaging would be expected to provide. The results were aggregated, resulting in five main and three additional recommendations intended to guide medical practitioners in the use of CXR and CT in the management of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rubin, Geoffrey D; Ryerson, Christopher J; Haramati, Linda B; Sverzellati, Nicola; Kanne, Jeffrey P; Raoof, Suhail; Schluger, Neil W; Volpi, Annalisa; Yim, Jae-Joon; Martin, Ian B K; Anderson, Deverick J; Kong, Christina; Altes, Talissa; Bush, Andrew; Desai, Sujal R; Goldin, Jonathan; Goo, Jin Mo; Humbert, Marc; Inoue, Yoshikazu; Kauczor, Hans-Ulrich; Luo, Fengming; Mazzone, Peter J; Prokop, Mathias; Remy-Jardin, Martine; Richeldi, Luca; Schaefer-Prokop, Cornelia M; Tomiyama, Noriyuki; Wells, Athol U; Leung, Ann N","journal":"Radiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2020201365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32255413/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs1MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["management of COVID","spread of COVID","severity of respiratory disease","critical resource constraints","disease progression","disease advances","Thoracic imaging","healthcare workers","healthcare delivery","respiratory dysfunction","pulmonary disease diagnosis","scenarios","utility of imaging","community transmission","mild cases","spectrum of healthcare environments","confirmed cases","unprecedented healthcare crisis","regions","varying risk factors","use of CXR","key tools","community conditions","hospitalized patients","key questions","overwhelming numbers of severe cases","additional recommendations","sporadic transmission","multidisciplinary panel","common upper respiratory viral infections","additional clinical situations","pre-test probability","diagnostic testing","hospital beds","ventilators","computed tomography","principal source of morbidity","chest radiography","mortality","medical practitioners","anticipated value","radiologists","pulmonologists","countries","information","experience","shortages of personal protective equipment","role","decision points","multivariable context","virus","deaths","pandemic","deficit","months","results"],"language":"en"},

However, postoperative groin pain still remains an unresolved problem. There are suggestions that in totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair (TEP-IHR) two of the likely factors responsible for pain are use of fixation and the type of fixation used. Aim To evaluate the impact of mesh fixation on the incidence of postoperative pain, restriction of physical activities, hernia recurrence risk, return to normal activities and demand for analgesics in patients after unilateral TEP-IHR. Material and methods Unilateral TEP-IHR was performed in 139 male patients randomized to three groups: self-gripping mesh (SG), lightweight mesh (L) and lightweight mesh with fixation (LF). Full study-inclusion criteria were met by 110 patients; 43, 18 and 49 in groups SG, L and LF respectively. Follow-up occurred on the 1st, 2nd, and 7th day and 3, 6, 12 months postoperatively. The numeric rating scale (NRS) was used to assess pain and the EuraHS-QoL (European Registry for Abdominal Wall Hernias Quality of Life Score) questionnaire to compare quality of life (QoL) prior to surgery and one year later. Results No statistically significant differences were observed between study groups with regard to the incidence rate and intensity of acute post-operative pain, chronic pain, analgesic demand, return to normal activity, hernia recurrence rate and post-operative QoL.

We provide a review of medical-grade facial protection (surgical masks, N95 respirators and face shields) for healthcare workers, the safety and efficacy of decontamination methods, and the utility of alternative strategies in emergency shortages or resource-scarce settings. METHODS We conducted a scoping review of PubMed and grey literature related to facial protection and potential adaptation strategies in the setting of PPE shortages (January 2000 to March 2020). Limitations included few COVID-19-specific studies and exclusion of non-English language articles. We conducted a narrative synthesis of the evidence based on relevant healthcare settings to increase practical utility in decision-making. RESULTS We retrieved 5462 peer-reviewed articles and 41 grey literature records. In total, we included 67 records which met inclusion criteria. Compared with surgical masks, N95 respirators perform better in laboratory testing, may provide superior protection in inpatient settings and perform equivalently in outpatient settings. Surgical mask and N95 respirator conservation strategies include extended use, reuse or decontamination, but these strategies may result in inferior protection. Limited evidence suggests that reused and improvised masks should be used when medical-grade protection is unavailable. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has led to critical shortages of medical-grade PPE. Alternative forms of facial protection offer inferior protection. More robust evidence is required on different types of medical-grade facial protection. As research on COVID-19 advances, investigators should continue to examine the impact on alternatives of medical-grade facial protection.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garcia Godoy, Laura R; Jones, Amy E; Anderson, Taylor N; Fisher, Cameron L; Seeley, Kylie M L; Beeson, Erynn A; Zane, Hannah K; Peterson, Jaime W; Sullivan, Peter D","journal":"BMJ global health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002553; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32371574/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs1Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["grade facial protection","medical-grade protection","inferior protection","superior protection","Alternative forms of facial protection","grade PPE","COVID","review of medical","critical shortages of medical","surgical masks","alternatives of medical","utility of alternative strategies","setting of PPE shortages","N95 respirators","emergency shortages","inpatient settings","outpatient settings","different types of medical","relevant healthcare settings","N95 respirator conservation strategies","potential adaptation strategies","grey literature records","mask reuse","resource-scarce settings","improvised masks","pandemic","robust evidence","Limited evidence","efficacy of decontamination methods","healthcare workers","practical utility","scoping review of PubMed","peer-reviewed articles","exclusion of non-English language articles","extended use","face shields","specific studies","safety","personal protective equipment","laboratory testing","impact","advances","BACKGROUND","coronavirus disease","investigators","decision-making","improvisation","narrative synthesis","inclusion criteria","research","CONCLUSION","total","Limitations"],"language":"en"},

However, the capacity of SWT to influence pathophysiological processes and the morphology of affected tissues remains unclear. The objective of the current review is to evaluate changes in imaging outcomes of musculoskeletal conditions following SWT. METHODS A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, CINAHL and SportDiscus was conducted from inception to October 2018. Prospective clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of SWT based on changes in imaging outcomes were eligible for inclusion. Articles were evaluated independently for risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias list and the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies. Random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression with a priori determined covariates was conducted for each condition to determine potential predictors of SWT effects. RESULTS Sixty-three studies were included, with data from 27 studies available for effect size pooling. Meta-analyses and meta-regression on imaging outcomes were performed for rotator cuff calcific tendinitis (n = 11), plantar fasciitis (n = 7) and osteonecrosis of the femoral head (n = 9). There was an overall reduction in the size of measured lesion following SWT (MD 8.44 mm (95%CI -4.30, 12.57), p \u003C 0.001) for calcium deposit diameter, (MD 0.92 mm (95%CI -0.03, 1.81), p = 0.04) for plantar fascia thickness and (MD 4.84% (95%CI -0.06, 9.75), p = 0.05) for lesion size in femoral head osteonecrosis. Meta-regression showed no influence of SWT dosage parameters, however, baseline lesion size was an independent predictor for changes in imaging outcomes. CONCLUSIONS SWT altered the morphology of musculoskeletal conditions, potentially reflecting changes in underlying pathophysiological processes.

Failure to identify adverse drug reactions (ADRs) can lead to prescribing cascades and the unnecessary use of over-the-counter products. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to explore and quantify the frequency and severity of ADRs associated with amitriptyline vs. placebo in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults with any indication, as well as healthy individuals. METHODS A systematic search in six electronic databases, forward/backward searches, manual searches, and searches for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval studies, will be performed. Placebo-controlled RCTs evaluating amitriptyline in any dosage, regardless of indication and without restrictions on the time and language of publication, will be included, as will healthy individuals. Studies of topical amitriptyline, combination therapies, or including \u003C 100 participants, will be excluded. Two investigators will screen the studies independently, assess methodological quality, and extract data on design, population, intervention, and outcomes ((non-)anticholinergic ADRs, e.g., symptoms, test results, and adverse drug events (ADEs) such as falls). The primary outcome will be the frequency of anticholinergic ADRs as a binary outcome (absolute number of patients with/without anticholinergic ADRs) in amitriptyline vs. placebo groups. Anticholinergic ADRs will be defined by an experienced clinical pharmacologist, based on literature and data from Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference. Secondary outcomes will be frequency and severity of (non-)anticholinergic ADRs and ADEs. The information will be synthesized in meta-analyses and narratives. We intend to assess heterogeneity using meta-regression (for indication, outcome, and time points) and I2 statistics. Binary outcomes will be expressed as odds ratios, and continuous outcomes as standardized mean differences. Effect measures will be provided using 95% confidence intervals. We plan sensitivity analyses to assess methodological quality, outcome reporting etc., and subgroup analyses on age, dosage, and duration of treatment. DISCUSSION We will quantify the frequency of anticholinergic and other ADRs/ADEs in adults taking amitriptyline for any indication by comparing rates for amitriptyline vs. placebo, hence, preventing bias from disease symptoms and nocebo effects. As no standardized instrument exists to measure it, our overall estimate of anticholinergic ADRs may have limitations.

METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study utilizing all patients completing \u2265 1 Pl-OC cycle from 2016 to 2018 at a large single-center OC program. Subjects were categorized by age at retrieval and number of cycles. We extrapolated age-based oocyte thresholds for 50%, 60%, or 70% eLBR from previously published data. We calculated the proportion of subjects overall, and for each age group, whose number of frozen oocytes was greater than or equal to their age-based threshold for a 50%, 60%, or 70% eLBR after 1 and 2 cycles. OR for 60% eLBR with one cycle was calculated for age and AMH cutoff values and corroborated with logistic regression. RESULTS A total of 1241 subjects, completing 1799 Pl-OC cycles, were included. With one cycle, 66% (819/1241) achieved \u2265 50% eLBR and 51% (634/1241) achieved 70% eLBR. With two cycles, 79.6% (988/1241) attained \u2265 50% eLBR and 65.5% (813/1241) achieved 70% eLBR. Achieving 50%, 60%, or 70% eLBR with 1-2 cycles was significantly associated with both age (p \u003C 0.001) and AMH (p \u003C 0.001). Age \u003C 37.5 and AMH \u003E 1.995 were independently associated with attaining 60% eLBR with one cycle (age: OR 13.73; 95%CI 9.16-20.57, p \u003C 0.001; AMH: OR 7.32; 95% CI 5.50-9.76, p \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Younger age and higher AMH were associated with achieving 50%, 60%, or 70% eLBR thresholds with Pl-OC. Nevertheless, almost all subjects were successfully able to preserve enough oocytes for \u2265 50% eLBR in 1-2 cycles.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maslow, Bat-Sheva L; Guarnaccia, Michael M; Ramirez, Leslie; Klein, Joshua U","journal":"Journal of assisted reproduction and genetics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10815-020-01791-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418136/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs2MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AMH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["eLBR thresholds","age group","Pl-OC cycles","number of cycles","age-based threshold","age-based oocyte thresholds","CONCLUSIONS Younger age","higher AMH","proportion of subjects","AMH cutoff values","number of frozen oocytes","CI","large single-center OC program","planned oocyte cryopreservation","patients","retrospective cohort study","retrieval","logistic regression","METHODS","live birth rate","likelihood","published data","PURPOSE","total"],"language":"en"},

There are currently no antiviral drugs with proven clinical efficacy, nor are there vaccines for its prevention, and these efforts are hampered by limited knowledge of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To address this, we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins physically associated with each using affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), identifying 332 high-confidence SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Among these, we identify 66 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 compounds (29 FDA-approved drugs, 12 drugs in clinical trials, and 28 preclinical compounds). Screening a subset of these in multiple viral assays identified two sets of pharmacological agents that displayed antiviral activity: inhibitors of mRNA translation and predicted regulators of the Sigma1 and Sigma2 receptors. Further studies of these host factor targeting agents, including their combination with drugs that directly target viral enzymes, could lead to a therapeutic regimen to treat COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gordon, David E; Jang, Gwendolyn M; Bouhaddou, Mehdi; Xu, Jiewei; Obernier, Kirsten; White, Kris M; O\u0027Meara, Matthew J; Rezelj, Veronica V; Guo, Jeffrey Z; Swaney, Danielle L; Tummino, Tia A; Huettenhain, Ruth; Kaake, Robyn M; Richards, Alicia L; Tutuncuoglu, Beril; Foussard, Helene; Batra, Jyoti; Haas, Kelsey; Modak, Maya; Kim, Minkyu; Haas, Paige; Polacco, Benjamin J; Braberg, Hannes; Fabius, Jacqueline M; Eckhardt, Manon; Soucheray, Margaret; Bennett, Melanie J; Cakir, Merve; McGregor, Michael J; Li, Qiongyu; Meyer, Bjoern; Roesch, Ferdinand; Vallet, Thomas; Mac Kain, Alice; Miorin, Lisa; Moreno, Elena; Naing, Zun Zar Chi; Zhou, Yuan; Peng, Shiming; Shi, Ying; Zhang, Ziyang; Shen, Wenqi; Kirby, Ilsa T; Melnyk, James E; Chorba, John S; Lou, Kevin; Dai, Shizhong A; Barrio-Hernandez, Inigo; Memon, Danish; Hernandez-Armenta, Claudia; Lyu, Jiankun; Mathy, Christopher J P; Perica, Tina; Pilla, Kala B; Ganesan, Sai J; Saltzberg, Daniel J; Rakesh, Ramachandran; Liu, Xi; Rosenthal, Sara B; Calviello, Lorenzo; Venkataramanan, Srivats; Liboy-Lugo, Jose; Lin, Yizhu; Huang, Xi-Ping; Liu, YongFeng; Wankowicz, Stephanie A; Bohn, Markus; Safari, Maliheh; Ugur, Fatima S; Koh, Cassandra; Savar, Nastaran Sadat; Tran, Quang Dinh; Shengjuler, Djoshkun; Fletcher, Sabrina J; O\u0027Neal, Michael C; Cai, Yiming; Chang, Jason C J; Broadhurst, David J; Klippsten, Saker; Sharp, Phillip P; Wenzell, Nicole A; Kuzuoglu, Duygu; Wang, Hao-Yuan; Trenker, Raphael; Young, Janet M; Cavero, Devin A; Hiatt, Joseph; Roth, Theodore L; Rathore, Ujjwal; Subramanian, Advait; Noack, Julia; Hubert, Mathieu; Stroud, Robert M; Frankel, Alan D; Rosenberg, Oren S; Verba, Kliment A; Agard, David A; Ott, Melanie; Emerman, Michael; Jura, Natalia; von Zastrow, Mark; Verdin, Eric; Ashworth, Alan; Schwartz, Olivier; d\u0027Enfert, Christophe; Mukherjee, Shaeri; Jacobson, Matt; Malik, Harmit S; Fujimori, Danica G; Ideker, Trey; Craik, Charles S; Floor, Stephen N; Fraser, James S; Gross, John D; Sali, Andrej; Roth, Bryan L; Ruggero, Davide; Taunton, Jack; Kortemme, Tanja; Beltrao, Pedro; Vignuzzi, Marco; Garc\u00EDa-Sastre, Adolfo; Shokat, Kevan M; Shoichet, Brian K; Krogan, Nevan J","journal":"Nature","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2286-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32353859/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs2Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral drugs","druggable human proteins","human cells","high-confidence SARS-CoV","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","human protein-protein interactions","FDA-approved drugs","molecular details of SARS","antiviral activity","clinical trials","host factors","viral enzymes","preclinical compounds","sets of pharmacological agents","proven clinical efficacy","multiple viral assays","causative agent of COVID","inhibitors of mRNA translation","predicted regulators","AP-MS","Sigma1","affinity-purification mass spectrometry","limited knowledge","combination","PPIs","Sigma2 receptors","respiratory disease","efforts","vaccines","subset","studies","therapeutic regimen","economic disruption1","prevention","infection","people"],"language":"en"},

In terms of psychological behavior scores, the results showed that female (9.38\u00B14.81), the urban (9.37\u00B15.02) and the medical workers (10.79\u00B15.19) had a poorer mental health than the male (8.45\u00B15.00), the rural (8.71\u00B14.75) and the non-medical workers (the students: 8.85\u00B14.83; public institude workers: 9.02\u00B15.08; others: 8.97\u00B15.39) (P\u003C0.05). 71.9% of the residents (n=2 887) were satisfied with the local epidemic control measures. The residents took various of the measures to prevent and control the epidemic. The ratio of residents that could achieve \u0022no gathering and less going out\u0022 , \u0022wear masks when going out \u0022 and \u0022 do not go to crowded and closed places \u0022 was up to 97.4% (n=3 913), 93.6% (n=3 758) and 91.5% (n=3 673) respectively.

Totally, 12/2300 gastrectomy patients (0.52%) developed intussusception. All 12 had undergone laparoscopic distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer (12/1250, 0.96%) and presented with intussusception through a side-to-side jejunojejunal anastomosis. The mean latency period was 423.8 (range: 86 to 1500) days. Four patients underwent emergent laparoscopic reduction of the efferent loop without bowel resection, along with fixation of the reduced jejunum to the afferent loop and the small bowel mesentery, to prevent a recurrence. One patient required open surgery with manual reduction and segmental resection of the gangrenous small bowel portion. All operated patients recovered without any complications. Intussusception resolved spontaneously in the remaining 7/12 patients. We found that a laparoscopic approach can be used for preventing or managing post-LG intussusception. We found that recurrence can be prevented or treated by anchoring and fixing the (reduced) efferent loop to the afferent loop and the small bowel mesentery.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Si-Hak; Chung, Jae Hun; Choi, Cheol Woong; Kim, Su Jin; Kim, Dae-Hwan; Choi, Chang In; Hwang, Sun-Hwi","journal":"Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy \u0026 percutaneous techniques","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0000000000000773; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32150119/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs2Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gastrectomy patients","post-LG intussusception","management of intussusception","complication of laparoscopic gastrectomy","laparoscopic distal gastrectomy","afferent loop","bowel resection","efferent loop","small bowel mesentery","laparoscopic intervention","laparoscopic approach","operated patients","emergent laparoscopic reduction","gangrenous small bowel portion","recurrence","post-LG time-interval","segmental resection","manual reduction","reduced jejunum","incidence","open surgery","diagnosis","clinical manifestations","range","fixation","gastric cancer","mean latency period","side-to-side jejunojejunal anastomosis","feasibility","treatment","complications","experience","data","condition","days","anchoring"],"language":"en"},

In the early 1990s, researchers reported that TFM induced vitellogenin in fish and that TFM was an agonist for the rainbow trout estrogen receptor. To support continued registration of TFM for sea lamprey control, regulatory agencies required further testing to evaluate potential endocrine disruption effects. Fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) were exposed to TFM at measured concentrations of 0.0659, 0.181, 0.594, 1.79, and 5.11 mg active ingredient (a.i.)/L for 21 days. No-observable- and lowest-observable-effect concentrations (NOEC and LOEC, respectively) were determined to be 1.79 mg/L or greater for each endpoint. Male survival in the highest treatment group was reduced relative to the controls. Percent egg fertility was reduced in the highest treatment group, resulting in an estimated NOEC of 1.79 mg/L. While no effect on gonadal-somatic index (GSI) was observed for males, female GSI was increased in the 5.11 mg/L treatment. Vitellogenin production was not altered relative to the controls for all TFM treatment groups. However, female testosterone was elevated in the 5.11 mg/L treatment. The results suggest that prolonged exposure to TFM at concentrations exceeding 1.79 mg/L has the potential to disrupt endocrine function. Biologically relevant effects in this study were found at the highest exposure concentration following a 21-day exposure. However, the duration of exposure in this study is not consistent with typical treatment durations (12-h) for sea lamprey control. This article is protected by copyright.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A web-based questionnaire was designed to differentiate the impact of the pandemic on inpatient and outpatient nuclear medicine operations and on public versus private health systems, respectively. Questions were addressing the following issues: impact on nuclear medicine diagnostics and therapy, use of recommendations, personal protective equipment, and organizational adaptations. The survey was available for 6 days and closed on April 20, 2020. RESULTS 113 complete responses were recorded. Nearly all participants (97 %) report a decline of nuclear medicine diagnostic procedures. The mean reduction in the last three weeks for PET/CT, scintigraphies of bone, myocardium, lung thyroid, sentinel lymph-node are -14.4 %, -47.2 %, -47.5 %, -40.7 %, -58.4 %, and -25.2 % respectively. Furthermore, 76 % of the participants report a reduction in therapies especially for benign thyroid disease (-41.8 %) and radiosynoviorthesis (-53.8 %) while tumor therapies remained mainly stable. 48 % of the participants report a shortage of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS Nuclear medicine services are notably reduced 3 weeks after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic reached Germany, Austria and Switzerland on a large scale. We must be aware that the current crisis will also have a significant economic impact on the healthcare system. As the survey cannot adapt to daily dynamic changes in priorities, it serves as a first snapshot requiring follow-up studies and comparisons with other countries and regions.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Freudenberg, Lutz S; Dittmer, Ulf; Herrmann, Ken","journal":"Nuklearmedizin.

Although a past history of celiotomy is not a contradiction for PEG construction, this procedure is rarely undertaken in post-esophagectomy patients, for two reasons: anatomically limited gastric spaces and high susceptibility to pulmonary aspiration. To overcome these limitations, we developed an original method of introducing PEG with jejunal extension for esophagectomized patients with retrosternal gastric pull-up reconstruction. The procedures were as follows: (1) confirmation of endoscopic transillumination of the antrum; (2) test puncture of the antral wall and subsequent gastropexy using a double-needle device; (3) insertion of a needle jejunostomy catheter into the antrum; (4) direct catheter cannulation to the pylorus and introduction of a feeding tube into the jejunum. We successfully carried out this procedure in three male patients (70-78 years old): two suffering from repetitive aspiration pneumonia and one with extensive recurrence of esophageal carcinoma. The operative times ranged 15-50 min. There were no PEG-associated complications. Of note, none of the patients experienced aspiration pneumonia after PEG construction. Our novel method appears to be a promising approach to managing esophagectomized patients because of its feasibility and the potential to prevent postoperative pulmonary aspiration.","publish_time":"2020-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Urabe, Masayuki; Koga, Shuhei; Ohkura, Yu; Ueno, Masaki; Udagawa, Harushi","journal":"Clinical journal of gastroenterology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12328-020-01096-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31981087/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs3OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["esophagectomized patients","malnourished patients","male patients","PEG construction","post-esophagectomy patients","repetitive aspiration pneumonia","postoperative pulmonary aspiration","PEG-associated complications","antrum","invasive procedure","needle jejunostomy catheter","original method","novel method","limited gastric spaces","double-needle device","direct catheter cannulation","confirmation of endoscopic transillumination","Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy","retrosternal gastric pull-up reconstruction","jejunal extension","pylorus","subsequent gastropexy","reasons","high susceptibility","antral wall","introduction","suffering","insertion","nutritional benefits","contradiction","potential","test puncture","promising approach","extensive recurrence of esophageal carcinoma","feeding tube","years old","feasibility","past history of celiotomy","jejunum","limitations","operative times","note","procedures"],"language":"en"},

Due to the large number of infected patients and heavy labor for doctors, computer-aided diagnosis with machine learning algorithm is urgently needed, and could largely reduce the efforts of clinicians and accelerate the diagnosis process. Chest computed tomography (CT) has been recognized as an informative tool for diagnosis of the disease. In this study, we propose to conduct the diagnosis of COVID-19 with a series of features extracted from CT images. To fully explore multiple features describing CT images from different views, a unified latent representation is learned which can completely encode information from different aspects of features and is endowed with promising class structure for separability. Specifically, the completeness is guaranteed with a group of backward neural networks (each for one type of features), while by using class labels the representation is enforced to be compact within COVID-19/community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and also a large margin is guaranteed between different types of pneumonia. In this way, our model can well avoid overfitting compared to the case of directly projecting highdimensional features into classes. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms all comparison methods, and rather stable performances are observed when varying the number of training data.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kang, Hengyuan; Xia, Liming; Yan, Fuhua; Wan, Zhibin; Shi, Feng; Yuan, Huan; Jiang, Huiting; Wu, Dijia; Sui, He; Zhang, Changqing; Shen, Dinggang","journal":"IEEE transactions on medical imaging","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/tmi.2020.2992546; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32386147/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs4MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of COVID","different aspects of features","series of features","multiple features","highdimensional features","type of features","CT images","diagnosis process","different views","computer-aided diagnosis","different types of pneumonia","large number of infected patients","large margin","unified latent representation","promising class structure","number of training data","outbreak of Coronavirus Disease","heavy labor","doctors","proposed method","comparison methods","machine learning algorithm","CAP","group of backward neural networks","Extensive experimental results","stable performances","separability","Chest computed tomography","case","community","informative tool","information","efforts of clinicians","model","overfitting","classes","way","completeness","world","study"],"language":"en"},

We must minimize face-to-face contact with vulnerable populations. But we must also persist, adapt, and help our older patients and study participants during the pandemic. METHODS Clinical researchers have an obligation to help, and we can. Recommendations for clinical researchers working with older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed. RESULTS Implement technology now: Minimize face-to-face contact with participants by utilizing digital tools, such as shifting to electronic informed consent and digital HIPAA-compliant tools like emailed surveys or telehealth assessments. Assess the psychological and social impact of COVID-19: How are participants coping? What health or social behaviors have changed? How are they keeping up with current events? What are they doing to stay connected to their families, friends, and communities? Are their health care needs being met? Current studies should be adapted immediately to these ends. Mobilize research platforms for patient needs: Leverage our relationships with participants and rapidly deploy novel clinical engagement techniques such as digital tools to intervene remotely to reduce the negative effects of social isolation on our participants. Equip research staff with tangible resources, and provide timely population-specific health information to support patients and healthcare providers.

It has a new stent-surface modification, which reduces thrombogenicity. We aimed to evaluate clinical and radiographic (safety and efficacy) outcomes of the Pipeline Shield. MATERIALS AND METHODS The 30-day and 1-year mortality and morbidity rates and the 6- and 18-month radiographic aneurysm occlusion outcomes for procedures performed between March 2016 and January 2018 were analyzed. 3D-TOF-MRA was used for follow-up. RESULTS Forty-four attempted Pipeline Shield procedures were performed for 41 patients with 44 target aneurysms (total of 52 aneurysms treated). A total of 88.5% of devices were inserted in the anterior circulation, and 11.5%, in the posterior circulation; 49/52 (94.2%) aneurysms were saccular; and 1/52 (1.9%) was fusiform. One (1.9%) aneurysm was an iatrogenic pseudoaneurysm, and 1 (1.9%) was a dissecting aneurysm. Seventy-one percent (35/49) of the saccular aneurysms were wide-neck (neck, \u003E4 mm), 34.6% (18/52) were large (\u226510 mm), and 3.8% (2/52) were giant (\u226525 mm). The mean aneurysm sac maximal diameter was 9.0 mm, and the mean neck width was 5.0 mm. The cumulative mortality and morbidity rates were 2.3% and 6.8% at 1 year, respectively. The adequate occlusion rate was 78.8% at 6 months and 90.3% at 18 months. CONCLUSIONS In this pragmatic and non-industry-sponsored study, the occlusion rates and safety outcomes were similar to those seen in previously published studies with flow-diverter devices and earlier generation Pipeline Embolization Devices.","publish_time":"2019-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Atasoy, D; Kandasamy, N; Hart, J; Lynch, J; Yang, S-H; Walsh, D; Tolias, C; Booth, T C","journal":"AJNR.

This Perspective seeks to explore newly occurring cardio-renal-pulmonary organ damage induced or aggravated by the disease process of COVID-19 and its implications for the cardiovascular risk management of people with diabetes, especially taking into account potential interactions with mechanisms of cellular intrusion of SARS-CoV-2. Severe infection with SARS-CoV-2 can precipitate myocardial infarction, myocarditis, heart failure, and arrhythmias as well as an acute respiratory distress syndrome and renal failure. They may evolve along with multiorgan failure directly due to SARS-CoV-2-infected endothelial cells and resulting endotheliitis. This complex pathology may bear challenges for the use of most diabetes medications in terms of emerging contraindications that need close monitoring of all people with diabetes diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whenever possible, continuous glucose monitoring should be implemented to ensure stable metabolic compensation. Patients in the intensive care unit requiring therapy for glycemic control should be handled solely by intravenous insulin using exact dosing with a perfusion device. Although not only ACE inhibitors and angiotensin 2 receptor blockers but also SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, pioglitazone, and probably insulin seem to increase the number of ACE2 receptors on the cells utilized by SARS-CoV-2 for penetration, no evidence presently exists that shows this might be harmful in terms of acquiring or worsening COVID-19. In conclusion, COVID-19 and related cardio-renal-pulmonary damage can profoundly affect cardiovascular risk management of people with diabetes.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ceriello, Antonio; Standl, Eberhard; Catrinoiu, Doina; Itzhak, Baruch; Lalic, Nebojsa M; Rahelic, Dario; Schnell, Oliver; \u0160krha, Jan; Valensi, Paul","journal":"Diabetes care","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20-0941; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32409501/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","diabetes medications","renal failure","cardiovascular risk management of people","worsening COVID","disease process of COVID","mechanisms of cellular intrusion of SARS","pulmonary damage","related cardio-renal","occurring cardio-renal","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","heart failure","coronavirus disease","metabolic control","multiorgan failure","Severe infection","acute respiratory distress syndrome","pulmonary organ damage","concomitant cardiovascular disorders","receptor blockers","receptor agonists","SGLT2 inhibitors","glycemic control","close monitoring","ACE inhibitors","intravenous insulin","terms of emerging contraindications","infected endothelial cells","continuous glucose monitoring","stable metabolic compensation","GLP","intensive care unit","account potential interactions","exact dosing","therapy","myocarditis","angiotensin","use","arrhythmias","myocardial infarction","worse prognosis","pioglitazone","challenges","implications","number of ACE2 receptors","perfusion device","Patients","endotheliitis","penetration","complex pathology","Perspective","conclusion","evidence"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES To summarize the existing literature on COVID-19 infection during pregnancy and childbirth, particularly concerning clinical presentation and outcomes. SEARCH STRATEGY A systematic search of LitCovid, EBSCO MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus electronic databases. The references of relevant studies were also searched. SELECTION CRITERIA Identified titles and abstracts were screened to select original reports and cross-checked for overlap of cases. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS A descriptive summary organized by aspects of clinical presentations (symptoms, imaging, and laboratory) and outcomes (maternal and perinatal). MAIN RESULTS We identified 33 studies reporting 385 pregnant women with COVID-19 infection: 368 (95.6%) mild; 14 (3.6%) severe; and 3 (0.8%) critical. Seventeen women were admitted to intensive care, including six who were mechanically ventilated and one maternal mortality. A total of 252 women gave birth, comprising 175 (69.4%) cesarean and 77 (30.6%) vaginal births. Outcomes for 256 newborns included four RT-PCR positive neonates, two stillbirths, and one neonatal death. CONCLUSION COVID-19 infection during pregnancy probably has a clinical presentation and severity resembling that in non-pregnant adults. It is probably not associated with poor maternal or perinatal outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Elshafeey, Farida; Magdi, Rana; Hindi, Nader; Elshebiny, Mohamed; Farrag, Nourhan; Mahdy, Shahd; Sabbour, Mohamed; Gebril, Sara; Nasser, Mohamed; Kamel, Menna; Amir, Abdelrahman; Emara, Moataz Maher; Nabhan, Ashraf","journal":"International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32330287/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["outcomes of COVID","infection","perinatal outcomes","pregnancy","BACKGROUND Clinical presentation","CONCLUSION COVID","pregnant women","aspects of clinical presentations","maternal mortality","SEARCH STRATEGY","systematic search of LitCovid","non-pregnant adults","references of relevant studies","EBSCO MEDLINE","descriptive summary","Web of Science","abstracts","stillbirths","ANALYSIS","CINAHL","symptoms","imaging","severity","RT-PCR positive neonates","DATA COLLECTION","newborns","laboratory","existing literature","childbirth","Scopus electronic databases","SELECTION CRITERIA","titles","original reports","neonatal death","OBJECTIVES","MAIN RESULTS","intensive care","total","vaginal births","cases","cesarean"],"language":"en"},

METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 63 patients with COVID- 19 from Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, including 32 moderate cases and 31 severe cases. The demographic data, underlying diseases, clinical manifestations and laboratory test results were compared between the two groups. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the factors that predicted the severity of COVID-19. The receiver- operating characteristic curve (ROC) of neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was calculated, and the area under the curve (AUC) was determined to estimate the optimal threshold of NLR for predicting severe cases of COVID-19. RESULTS The patients with moderate and server COVID-19 showed significant differences in the rate of diabetes, NLR, serum amyloid A (SSA), C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum albumin (ALB) levels (P \u003C 0.05). The co- morbidity of diabetes, NLR, SSA and CRP were found to positively correlate and ALB to inversely correlate with the severity of COVID-19 (P \u003C 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that NLR was an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 (OR=1.264, 95% CI: 1.046-1.526, P=0.015) with an AUC of 0.831 (95% CI: 0.730-0.932), an optimal diagnostic threshold of 4.795, a sensitivity of 0.839, and a specificity of 0.750.

Main outcomes are pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals, likelihood ratios (LRs), area under the curve (AUC) of lung auscultation for different pulmonary pathologies and breath sounds. A meta-regression analysis is performed to reduce observed heterogeneity. For 34 studies the overall pooled sensitivity for lung auscultation is 37% and specificity 89%. LRs and AUC of auscultation for congestive heart failure, pneumonia and obstructive lung diseases are low, LR- and specificity are acceptable. Abnormal breath sounds are highly specific for (hemato)pneumothorax in patients with trauma. Results are limited by significant heterogeneity. Lung auscultation has a low sensitivity in different clinical settings and patient populations, thereby hampering its clinical utility. When better diagnostic modalities are available, they should replace lung auscultation. Only in resource limited settings, with a high prevalence of disease and in experienced hands, lung auscultation has still a role.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arts, Luca; Lim, Endry Hartono Taslim; van de Ven, Peter Marinus; Heunks, Leo; Tuinman, Pieter R","journal":"Scientific reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64405-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32355210/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsxMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnostic accuracy of lung auscultation","AUC of auscultation","obstructive lung diseases","specificity","low sensitivity","diagnostic modalities","different clinical settings","pooled estimates of sensitivity","overall pooled sensitivity","different pulmonary pathologies","assessment of patients","LRs","adult patients","line diagnostic tool","pulmonary symptoms","Studies","respiratory symptoms","meta-analysis","common respiratory pathologies","Abnormal breath sounds","resource limited settings","meta-regression analysis","clinical utility","observed heterogeneity","significant heterogeneity","pneumonia","congestive heart failure","patient populations","high prevalence of disease","confidence intervals","experienced hands","likelihood ratios","area","hemato","curve","pneumothorax","Main outcomes","trauma","Results","stethoscope","debate","instrument","role"],"language":"en"},

Among these viruses, La Crosse virus (LACV), a member of the California serogroup, circulates in the eastern and midwestern United States. While LACV infection is often asymptomatic, dozens of cases of encephalitis are reported yearly. Unfortunately, no antivirals have been approved to treat LACV infection. Here, we developed a method to rapidly test potential antivirals against LACV infection. From this screen, we identified several potential antiviral molecules, including known antivirals. Additionally, we identified many novel antivirals that exhibited antiviral activity without affecting cellular viability. Valinomycin, a potassium ionophore, was among our top targets. We found that valinomycin exhibited potent anti-LACV activity in multiple cell types in a dose-dependent manner. Valinomycin did not affect particle stability or infectivity, suggesting that it may preclude virus replication by altering cellular potassium ions, a known determinant of LACV entry. We extended these results to other ionophores and found that the antiviral activity of valinomycin extended to other viral families including bunyaviruses (Rift Valley fever virus, Keystone virus), enteroviruses (Coxsackievirus, rhinovirus), flavirivuses (Zika), and coronaviruses (HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV). In all viral infections, we observed significant reductions in virus titer in valinomycin-treated cells. In sum, we demonstrate the importance of potassium ions to virus infection, suggesting a potential therapeutic target to disrupt virus replication.Importance No antivirals are approved for the treatment of bunyavirus infection. The ability to rapidly screen compounds and identify novel antivirals is one means to accelerate drug discovery for viruses with no approved treatments. We used this approach to screen hundreds of compounds against La Crosse virus, an emerging bunyavirus that causes significant disease, including encephalitis. We identified several known and previously unidentified antivirals. We focused on a potassium ionophore, valinomycin, due to its promising in vitro antiviral activity. We demonstrate that valinomycin, as well as a selection of other ionophores, exhibits activity against La Crosse virus as well as several other distantly related bunyaviruses. We finally observe that valinomycin has activity against a wide array of human viral pathogens, suggesting that disrupting potassium ion homeostasis with valinomycin may be a potent host pathway to target to quell virus infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sandler, Zachary J; Firpo, Mason R; Omoba, Oreoluwa S; Vu, Michelle N; Menachery, Vineet D; Mounce, Bryan C","journal":"Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.00086-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32284379/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsxNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LACV"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["Crosse virus","antiviral activity of valinomycin","virus replication","LACV infection","Keystone virus","virus titer","potential antivirals","known antivirals","novel antivirals","unidentified antivirals","potent anti-LACV activity","valinomycin-treated cells","potassium ionophore","Rift Valley fever virus","cellular potassium ions","importance of potassium ions","treatment of bunyavirus infection","encephalitis","known determinant of LACV entry","potential antiviral molecules","significant human pathogens","viral families","significant reductions","disrupting potassium ion homeostasis","viral infections","significant disease","potential therapeutic target","screen hundreds of compounds","ionophores","related bunyaviruses","approved treatments","wide array of human viral pathogens","emerging bunyavirus","cellular viability","potent host pathway","multiple cell types","diseases","Coxsackievirus","drug discovery","means","enteroviruses","HCoV","coronaviruses","Zika","flavirivuses","rhinovirus","dose-dependent manner","dozens of cases","member","hemorrhagic fevers","midwestern United States","California serogroup","approach","particle stability","selection","MERS-CoV","infectivity","method","targets","results","sum"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study is to assess the outcomes of the FTRD among its early users in the USA. METHODS Patients who underwent endoscopic full-thickness resection (EFTR) for lower gastrointestinal tract lesions using the FTRD at 26 US tertiary care centers between 10/2017 and 12/2018 were included. Primary outcome was R0 resection rate. Secondary outcomes included rate of technical success (en bloc resection), achievement of histologic full-thickness resection (FTR), and adverse events (AE). RESULTS A total of 95 patients (mean age 65.5 \u00B1 12.6 year, 38.9% F) were included. The most common indication, for use of FTRD, was resection of difficult adenomas (non-lifting, recurrent, residual, or involving appendiceal orifice/diverticular opening) (66.3%), followed by adenocarcinomas (22.1%), and subepithelial tumors (SET) (11.6%). Lesions were located in the proximal colon (61.1%), distal colon (18.9%), or rectum (20%). Mean lesion diameter was 15.5 \u00B1 6.4 mm and 61.1% had a prior resection attempt. The mean total procedure time was 59.7 \u00B1 31.8 min. R0 resection was achieved in 82.7% while technical success was achieved in 84.2%. Histologically FTR was demonstrated in 88.1% of patients. There were five clinical AE (5.3%) with 2 (2.1%) requiring surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS Results from this first US multicenter study suggest that EFTR with the FTRD is a technically feasible, safe, and effective technique for resecting difficult colonic lesions.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ichkhanian, Y; Vosoughi, K; Diehl, D L; Grimm, I S; James, T W; Templeton, A W; Hajifathalian, K; Tokar, J L; Samarasena, J B; Chehade, N El Hage; Lee, J; Chang, K; Mizrahi, M; Barawi, M; Irani, S; Friedland, S; Korc, P; Aadam, A A; Al-Haddad, M A; Kowalski, T E; Novikov, A; Smallfield, G; Ginsberg, G G; Oza, V M; Panuu, D; Fukami, N; Pohl, H; Lajin, M; Kumta, N A; Tang, S J; Naga, Y M; Amateau, S K; Brewer, G O I; Kumbhari, V; Sharaiha, R; Khashab, M A","journal":"Surgical endoscopy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07504-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32180001/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsyNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FTRD","FTR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["endoscopic resection of difficult lesions","resection of difficult adenomas","thickness resection device","R0 resection rate","en bloc resection","prior resection attempt","use of FTRD","difficult colonic lesions","EFTR","rate of technical success","difficult anatomic locations","mean age","METHODS Patients","lower gastrointestinal tract lesions","mean total procedure time","US multicenter study","Mean lesion diameter","Secondary outcomes","CONCLUSIONS Results","distal colon","proximal colon","clinical AE","US tertiary care centers","effective technique","non-lifting","achievement of histologic","infiltration","appendiceal orifice","deep wall origin","Primary outcome","early users","adverse events","diverticular opening","year","common indication","BACKGROUND Introduction","subepithelial tumors","SET","USA","surgical intervention","aim","adenocarcinomas","rectum"],"language":"en"},

On 2nd February, 2020, Wuhan began to build a modular hospital to treat patients caught with mild illness. The mobile modular hospital is mainly composed of medical modules, technical support modules, ward units, living support units and transportation capacity under field conditions, and there are complete equipment and specialized personnel to treat patients. Due to the severity and particularity of SARS-CoV-2, taking granted from lessons learnt from mobile modular hospitals, we use the existing large venues to construct a new fixed modular hospital. As patients need to be treated and tested, it is important to develop a clinical laboratory in the modular hospital and ensure biosafety. The construction of a clinical laboratory in the modular hospital is faced with problems such as time pressure, limited site selection, high level of biosafety, lack of experience and so forth.

Liver, brain, gills, and gonads were dissected out and processed to determine markers of oxidative stress, neurotoxicity and lysosomal biomarkers, and histopathology. Analyses of sediment granulometry and chemical profiles indicated different degrees of toxicity and suggested a distinct release of pollutants from each sediment in relation with their physicochemical properties. Interestingly, biological responses were in agreement with contaminant levels reported in source sediments. The most distinct toxicopathic effects were detected upon exposure to the harbour\u0027s sediment and particularly on day 28. Overall, enhanced hepatic glutathione-S-transferase activity and lysosomal enlargement were detected in all experimental groups, demonstrating a toxic effect from all sediments whilst catalase inhibition, lysosomal membrane destabilisation, changes in lysosomal content and liver histopathology were most pronounced in soles exposed to the harbour\u0027s sediment. The Integrative Biomarker Response index (IBR/n) evidenced that exposure to the three sediments caused an impact of diverse magnitude in sole health (IBR/nHarbour \u003E IBR/nMixture \u003E IBR/nEstuary). The magnitude of biological responses essentially depended on the presence of contaminants in source sediments, which seemed to be altered by the conditions imposed by whole-sediment toxicity assays.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Briaudeau, Tifanie; Zorita, Izaskun; Izagirre, Urtzi; Marig\u00F3mez, Ionan","journal":"The Science of the total environment","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138849; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408203/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjszNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["source sediments","IBR","harbour\u0027s sediment","sediment toxicity assays","Analyses of sediment granulometry","lysosomal content","lysosomal enlargement","lysosomal biomarkers","lysosomal membrane destabilisation","presence of contaminants","liver histopathology","distinct toxicopathic effects","exposure","magnitude of biological responses","different degrees of toxicity","polluted harbour","laboratory conditions","moderately polluted estuary","impact of diverse magnitude","distinct release of pollutants","changes","chemical profiles","catalase inhibition","sole health","transferase activity","neurotoxicity","nHarbour","Solea senegalensis juveniles","toxic effect","contaminant levels","agreement","soles","nMixture","Integrative Biomarker Response index","hepatic glutathione-S","experimental groups","intricate association","markers of oxidative stress","present study","relation","benthic fish","brain","gills","physicochemical properties","nEstuary","gonads","field","Biometry data","days"],"language":"en"},

Organic-F was mineralized by 94.0 \u00B1 5.2%, which was in accordance with the high fludioxonil removal efficiency (95.4 \u00B1 4.0%).

Various researches have shown the bioactivity, physiological activity and potential health benefits of the two components. In this study, a simultaneous and rapid method for determination of sesamin and sesamolin in sesame oils was proposed. The excitation-emission fluorescence spectra of the oils were obtained after a simple pretreatment method, then the self-weighted alternating trilinear decomposition were adopted to extract the quantitative information from the highly overlapped spectra. RESULTS It was found that reasonable quantification results can be obtained with the limits of detection for the two lignans were 0.05 mg/g and 0.24 mg/g, while limits of quantitation were 0.14 mg/g and 0.74 mg/g, respectively. In addition, the average recoveries for sesamin and sesamolin were 99.05% and 94.97%.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs), especially TLR4 which participates in mucosal immunity, may be involved in the pathogenesis of IgAN. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether sIgA and TLR4 interact to mediate kidney damage in IgAN patients. IgAN patients with positive sIgA deposition in renal tissues were screened by immunofluorescence assay. Patient salivary sIgA (P-sIgA) was collected and purified by jacalin affinity chromatography. Salivary sIgA from healthy volunteers was used as a control (N-sIgA). Expression of TLR4, MyD88, NF-\u03BAB, TNF-\u03B1, IL-6, and MCP-1 were detected in the mesangial area of IgAN patients by immunohistochemistry, the expression levels in patients with positive sIgA deposition were higher than that with negative sIgA deposition. Human renal mesangial cells (HRMCs) were cultured in vitro, flow cytometry showed that P-sIgA bound HRMCs significantly better than N-sIgA. HRMCs were cultured in the presence of sIgA (400 \u03BCg/mL) for 24 h, compared with cells cultured with N-sIgA, HRMCs cultured in vitro with P-sIgA showed enhanced expression of TLR4, increased secretion of TNF-\u03B1, IL-6, and MCP-1, and increased expression of MyD88/NF-\u03BAB. TLR4 shRNA silencing and NF-\u03BAB inhibition both reduced the ability of HRMCs to synthesize TNF-\u03B1, IL-6, and MCP-1. Our results indicate that sIgA may induce high expression of TLR4 in HRMCs and further activate downstream signalling pathways, prompting HRMCs to secrete multiple cytokines and thereby mediating kidney damage in IgAN patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Junjun; Mi, Yiming; Zhou, Ruwen; Liu, Zhangsuo; Huang, Bo; Guo, Ruxue; Wang, Panfei; Lu, Yanru; Zhou, Yali; Quan, Songxia","journal":"Journal of nephrology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40620-020-00722-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388684/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjszOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["IgA"],"keyphrases":["N-sIgA","presence of sIgA","positive sIgA deposition","P-sIgA bound HRMCs","negative sIgA deposition","Patient salivary sIgA","enhanced expression of TLR4","high expression of TLR4","ability of HRMCs","mesangial area of IgAN patients","pathogenesis of IgAN","expression levels","increased expression of MyD88","TNF-\u03B1","MCP","TLR4 shRNA silencing","NF-\u03BAB inhibition","increased secretion of TNF","kidney damage","Human renal mesangial cells","renal tissues","IgA nephropathy","secretory IgA","immunohistochemistry","downstream signalling pathways","multiple cytokines","immune responses","healthy volunteers","control","flow cytometry","Previous studies","immunofluorescence assay","receptors","TLRs","\u03BCg","jacalin affinity chromatography","Toll","mucosal immunity","study","results","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Replication of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is the likely target of the investigational nucleotide analogue remdesivir (RDV). RDV shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against RNA viruses, and previous studies with RdRps from Ebola virus (EBOV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have revealed that delayed chain-termination is RDV\u0027s plausible mechanism of action. Here, we expressed and purified active SARS-CoV-2 RdRp composed of the non-structural proteins nsp8 and nsp12. Enzyme kinetics indicated that this RdRp efficiently incorporates the active triphosphate form of RDV (RDV-TP) into RNA. Incorporation of RDV-TP at position i caused termination of RNA synthesis at position i\u002B3. We obtained almost identical results with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 RdRps. A unique property of RDV-TP is its high selectivity over incorporation of its natural nucleotide counterpart ATP. In this regard, the triphosphate forms of 2\u0027-C-methylated compounds, including sofosbuvir, approved for the management of hepatitis C virus infection, and the broad-acting antivirals favipiravir and ribavirin, exhibited significant deficits. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the target specificity of RDV, as RDV-TP was less efficiently incorporated by the distantly related Lassa virus RdRp, and termination of RNA synthesis was not observed. These results collectively provide a unifying, refined mechanism of RDV-mediated RNA synthesis inhibition in coronaviruses and define this nucleotide analogue as a direct-acting antiviral (DAA).","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gordon, Calvin J; Tchesnokov, Egor P; Woolner, Emma; Perry, Jason K; Feng, Joy Y; Porter, Danielle P; Gotte, Matthias","journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra120.013679; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32284326/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs0MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RDV","RNA","ATP"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["RDV-TP","Incorporation of RDV","active SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","termination of RNA synthesis","RNA viruses","refined mechanism of RDV","target specificity of RDV","unique property of RDV","active triphosphate form of RDV","viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","mediated RNA synthesis inhibition","Replication of SARS","related Lassa virus RdRp","Ebola virus","coronavirus disease","position i","RdRps","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","investigational nucleotide analogue remdesivir","delayed chain-termination","direct-acting antiviral","management of hepatitis C virus infection","natural nucleotide counterpart ATP","likely target","triphosphate forms","identical results","broad-spectrum antiviral activity","C-methylated compounds","broad-acting antivirals favipiravir","RDV\u0027s plausible mechanism of action","EBOV","previous studies","ribavirin","coronaviruses","high selectivity","sofosbuvir","non-structural proteins nsp8","unifying","significant deficits","current pandemic","Effective treatments","nsp12","COVID","DAA","evidence","regard","Enzyme kinetics"],"language":"en"}]}

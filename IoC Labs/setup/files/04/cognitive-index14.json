Diseases affecting this species can result in large economic losses. Because knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of the immune response in bivalves, especially clams, is scarce and fragmentary, we sequenced RNA from immune-stimulated R. philippinarum hemocytes by 454-pyrosequencing to identify genes involved in their immune defense against infectious diseases. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: High-throughput deep sequencing of R. philippinarum using 454 pyrosequencing technology yielded 974,976 high-quality reads with an average read length of 250 bp. The reads were assembled into 51,265 contigs and the 44.7% of the translated nucleotide sequences into protein were annotated successfully. The 35 most frequently found contigs included a large number of immune-related genes, and a more detailed analysis showed the presence of putative members of several immune pathways and processes like the apoptosis, the toll like signaling pathway and the complement cascade. We have found sequences from molecules never described in bivalves before, especially in the complement pathway where almost all the components are present. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first transcriptome analysis using 454-pyrosequencing conducted on R. philippinarum focused on its immune system. Our results will provide a rich source of data to discover and identify new genes, which will serve as a basis for microarray construction and the study of gene expression as well as for the identification of genetic markers. The discovery of new immune sequences was very productive and resulted in a large variety of contigs that may play a role in the defense mechanisms of Ruditapes philippinarum.","publish_time":"2012-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moreira, Rebeca; Balseiro, Pablo; Planas, Josep V.; Fuste, Berta; Beltran, Sergi; Novoa, Beatriz; Figueras, Antonio","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/21268687c8044a9acd561589e1f291f0843c6678.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3334963.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3334963/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzQ0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ruditapes"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune defense","immune pathways","immune response","immune-stimulated","immune system","large number of immune","discovery of new immune sequences","philippinarum hemocytes","defense mechanisms of Ruditapes philippinarum","new genes","large variety of contigs","bivalves","related genes","pyrosequencing technology","complement pathway","large economic losses","translated nucleotide sequences","detailed analysis","molecular mechanisms","high-quality reads","transcriptome analysis","complement cascade","infectious diseases","study of gene expression","worldwide cultured bivalve species","High-throughput deep sequencing of","important commercial value","presence of putative members","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","processes","apoptosis","clams","RNA","microarray construction","length","toll","Manila clam","role","rich source of data","METHODOLOGY","basis","average","BACKGROUND","protein","components","identification of genetic markers","results","knowledge","molecules","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The results showed that the epidemic spanned a large geographic area, with the most affected areas being in western China. Significant differences in incidence were found among age groups, with incidences peaking in school-age children. Overall, the epidemic spread from southeast to northwest. Proximity to airports and being intersected by national highways or freeways but not railways were variables associated with the presence of the disease in a county. Lower temperature and lower relative humidity were the climatic factors facilitating local transmission after correction for the effects of school summer vacation and public holidays, as well as population density and the density of medical facilities.

MEDI-565 binds CEA on cancer cells and CD3 on T cells to induce T-cell mediated killing of cancer cells. To understand the molecular basis of human CEA recognition by MEDI-565 and how polymorphisms and spliced forms of CEA may affect MEDI-565 activity, we mapped the epitope of MEDI-565 on CEA using mutagenesis and homology modeling approaches. We found that MEDI-565 recognized a conformational epitope in the A2 domain comprised of amino acids 326\u2013349 and 388\u2013410, with critical residues F(326), T(328), N(333), V(388), G(389), P(390), E(392), I(408), and N(410). Two non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs10407503, rs7249230) were identified in the epitope region, but they are found at low homozygosity rates. Searching the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank\u00AE database, we further identified a single, previously uncharacterized mRNA splice variant of CEA that lacks a portion of the N-terminal domain, the A1 and B1 domains, and a large portion of the A2 domain. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of multiple cancers showed widespread expression of full-length CEA in these tumors, with less frequent but concordant expression of the CEA splice variant. Because the epitope was largely absent from the CEA splice variant, MEDI-565 did not bind or mediate T-cell killing of cells solely expressing this form of CEA. In addition, the splice variant did not interfere with MEDI-565 binding or activity when co-expressed with full-length CEA. Thus MEDI-565 may broadly target CEA-positive tumors without regard for expression of the short splice variant of CEA. Together our data suggest that MEDI-565 activity will neither be impacted by SNPs nor by a splice variant of CEA.","publish_time":"2012-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peng, Li; Oberst, Michael D.; Huang, Jiaqi; Brohawn, Philip; Morehouse, Chris; Lekstrom, Kristen; Baeuerle, Patrick A.; Wu, Herren; Yao, Yihong; Coats, Steven R.; Dall\u2019Acqua, William; Damschroder, Melissa; Hammond, Scott A.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5a2557d0cb42ffcb93f693d7fa4e70fb817e20b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3344869.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3344869/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzQ1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CEA","National Center for Biotechnology Information"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CEA splice variant","binds CEA","form of CEA","epitope of MEDI","short splice variant of CEA","CEA-positive tumors","uncharacterized mRNA splice variant of CEA","spliced forms of CEA","widespread expression of full-length CEA","T cells","molecular basis of human CEA recognition","cancer cells","mediate T-cell","activity","bispecific T-cell engager","A2 domain","conformational epitope","epitope region","N-terminal domain","concordant expression","SNPs","large portion","non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms","Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of multiple cancers","CD3","BiTE","regard","B1 domains","Biotechnology Information GenBank","database","treatment of patients","antibody","mutagenesis","National Center","carcinoembryonic antigen","development","rs10407503","homology modeling approaches","amino acids","rs7249230","binding","critical residues F","low homozygosity rates","MT111","addition"],"language":"en"},

A continuous surveillance by public health authorities will be critical to monitor the appearance of new influenza variants, especially in animal reservoirs such as swine and birds, in order to prevent the potential animal-human transmission of viruses with pandemic potential.","publish_time":"2012-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Esp\u00EDnola, Emilio E","journal":"Open Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f6091029a2cc8ddd6a5c6ee18de7478b73daab2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3349948.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3349948/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzQ1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic potential","swine","human influenza origins","pandemic phase","order","genes","appearance of new influenza variants","potential animal-human transmission of viruses","animal reservoirs","new variant","important amino acid mutations","worldwide percentage of detection","neutral selection models of evolution","public health authorities","triple reassortment","genomic segments","transmissibility","viral performance","continuous surveillance","birds","study","resistance","sequences of hemagglutinin","neuraminidase","extent of diversity","drugs","strains","H1N1","objective","cases"],"language":"en"},

However, the performance of these tools varies in different circumstances. To address this problem, we employed an ensemble approach to incorporate two popular Web tools, MimoPro and Pep-3D-Search, together for taking advantages offered by both methods so as to give users more options for their specific purposes of epitope-peptide mapping. The combined operation of Union finds as many associated peptides as possible from both methods, which increases sensitivity in finding potential epitopic regions on a given antigen surface. The combined operation of Intersection achieves to some extent the mutual verification by the two methods and hence increases the likelihood of locating the genuine epitopic region on a given antigen in relation to the interacting peptides. The Consistency between Intersection and Union is an indirect sufficient condition to assess the likelihood of successful peptide-epitope mapping. On average from 27 tests, the combined operations of PepMapper outperformed either MimoPro or Pep-3D-Search alone. Therefore, PepMapper is another multipurpose mapping tool for epitope prediction from affinity-selected peptides.

At the end of the epidemic, the global cumulative total was 8098 with 774 deaths. Seven Asian countries/regions were among the top ten on the list. Mainland China and Hong Kong, SAR, accounted for 87% of all cases and 84% of all deaths. Severe acute respiratory syndrome is caused by a novel coronavirus. It has alarmed the world with its infectivity and significant morbidity and mortality, its lack of a rapid, reliable diagnostic test and lack of effective specific treatment and vaccination. The adverse impact on travel and business around the world, particularly in Asia, has been enormous. Some lessons learnt from this epidemic included: (1) any outbreak of infectious disease can rapidly spread around the world by air travel; (2) early reporting of the outbreak to neighbouring countries/regions and the World Health Organization is essential to prevent international spread; and (3) infection control, tracing and quarantine of contacts are essential to control the epidemic. Many questions remain unanswered, including the origin and pathogenesis of the novel coronavirus, the natural history and the best specific treatment of the disease. The SARS\u2010CoV has probably jumped from an animal host to humans.

Serum samples had high concentrations of antibody to mouse hepatitis virus and immunohistochemical examination revealed the presence of mouse hepatitis virus antigen in granuloma macrophages. Serological testing for other infectious agents and bacterial culture were negative and wild type mice kept in the same facility remained healthy. Despite the association between the disease and mouse hepatitis virus infection, the precise role played by mouse hepatitis virus was not determined. While the disease is superficially similar to feline infectious peritonitis (another coronavirus\u2010induced serositis), differences exist between the histopathological findings in these two conditions.

However, the mechanism of its action on proteins in aqueous solution is not well understood. We have carried out a systematic analysis of the conformation and environment of MPD molecules bound to proteins. We find that the majority of MPD molecules adopt their most stable conformer. They prefer to bind to hydrophobic sites with a distinct preference for leucine side chains. Most MPD binding sites involve amino\u2010acid residues in helical or \u03B2\u2010sheet structures. MPD binding to proteins is penetrative, leading to displacement of water molecules in grooves and cavities (sometimes ligand\u2010binding and active sites) on the protein surface. This results in a large reduction of solvent\u2010accessible area, which can have significant implications for protein stability. The packing of the MPD molecules by the protein is not optimal and usually some other solvent molecules are also bound along with it. Our analysis suggests that MPD is not as strong a denaturant as often suggested. It promotes stabilization of the protein by preferential hydration, which is facilitated by attachment of MPD molecules to the hydrophobic surface.","publish_time":"2004-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anand, Kanchan; Pal, Debnath; Hilgenfeld, Rolf","journal":"Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a6152804f5e340dc158357957fa609094f56174e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161645/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs3MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["environment of MPD molecules","attachment of MPD molecules","majority of MPD molecules","MPD binding sites","solvent molecules","proteins","protein surface","displacement of water molecules","hydrophobic sites","protein stability","active sites","hydrophobic surface","systematic analysis","large reduction of solvent","acid residues","accessible area","grooves","distinct preference","ligand","cavities","conformation","popular chemical additive","significant implications","crystallization of biological macromolecules","action","leucine","sheet structures","preferential hydration","chains","results","aqueous solution","stabilization","stable conformer","mechanism","Methyl","pentanediol","denaturant","packing"],"language":"en"},

Saikosaponins represent a group of oleanane derivatives, usually as glucosides, that are found in a number of plant families.

Its activity depends on the expression of p17 receptors (p17R) on the surface of target cells. Whether p17 also plays a role in stimulating human monocytes, a major HIV\u20101 reservoir, is not known. Here we show that human monocytes constitutively express p17Rs and that p17 selectively triggers these cells to produce MCP\u20101. The effect of p17 on MCP\u20101 expression was observed at the transcriptional level and was primarily dependent on the activation of the transcription factor AP\u20101. p17 increased the binding activity of AP\u20101 complexes in a time\u2010 and dose\u2010dependent manner. Deletion of the AP\u20101 binding sites in the MCP\u20101 promoter resulted in the lack of p17\u2010induced MCP\u20101 transcription. In particular, the P3 binding site located between \u221269 and \u221263 position seems to be essential to MCP\u20101 mRNA induction in p17\u2010treated monocytes. An ever increasing amount of evidences shows a tight link between biologically dysregulated monocytes, AP\u20101 activation, MCP\u20101 release and HIV\u20101 pathogenesis.

Hantaviruses, like other members of the Bunyaviridae family, have previously not been shown to be sensitive to RNI. In this study, we compared the effects of NO and peroxynitrite on hantavirus replication and free mature virions in vitro, and of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in hantavirus\u2010infected suckling mice. The NO\u2010generating compound S\u2010nitroso\u2010N\u2010acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), as well as cytokine\u2010induced NO, strongly inhibited hantavirus replication in Vero E6 cells, while pretreatment of free virions with SNAP only had a limited effect on their viability. In contrast, 3\u2010morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride (SIN\u20101), a peroxynitrite donor, inhibited virus replication only to a very low extent in vitro, but pretreatment of virus with SIN\u20101 led to a considerably lowered viability of the virions.

Most contain conserved helicase motifs that act as an engine to power DNA unwinding. All DNA helicases share some common properties, including nucleic acid binding, NTP binding and hydrolysis, and unwinding of duplex DNA in the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 or 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction. The minichromosome maintenance (Mcm) protein complex (Mcm4/6/7) provides a DNA\u2010unwinding function at the origin of replication in all eukaryotes and may act as a licensing factor for DNA replication.

New pathogens and antimicrobial\u2010resistant forms of older pathogens continue to emerge, some with the potential for rapid, global spread and high morbidity and mortality. Pathogens can emerge either through introduction into a new population or when the interaction with the vector changes; emergence is also influenced by microbiological adaptation and change, global travel patterns, domestic and wild animal contact and other variants in human ecology and behaviour. Quick, decisive action to detect and control novel pathogens, and thereby contain outbreaks and prevent further transmission, is frequently hampered by incomplete or inadequate data about a new or re\u2010emerging pathogen. Three examples of pathogens that are current causes for human health concern are avian influenza, West Nile virus (WNV) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. Pathogens directly or indirectly transmitted by aerosolized droplets, such as avian influenza and SARS, pose considerable containment challenges. Rapid screening tests for other newly described pathogens such as WNV require time for development and may be \u003C100% reliable. The importance of vigilance in the detection and control of newly recognized infectious threats cannot be overstressed.

The model takes into account that a susceptible person either gets immediately infected or weakened when getting into contact with an infectious one. As the number of weakened people increases, they eventually can become infected in a short time period and a pandemic outbreak occurs. The time required to reach such a pandemic outbreak allows for intervention and is often called golden time. Understanding the size-dependence of the golden time is useful for controlling pandemic outbreak. Using an approach based on a nonlinear mapping, here we find that there exist two types of golden times in the two-step contagion model, which scale as [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] with the system size [Formula: see text] on Erd\u0151s-R\u00E9nyi networks, where the measured [Formula: see text] is slightly larger than [Formula: see text].

Despite an improved understanding of molecular mechanisms and advances in supportive care strategies, ARDS remains associated with high mortality, and survivors usually face long-term morbidity. In recent years, preclinical studies have provided mounting evidence of the potential of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapies in lung diseases and critical illnesses. In several models of ARDS, MSCs have been demonstrated to induce anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, improve epithelial and endothelial cell recovery, and enhance microbial and alveolar fluid clearance, thus resulting in improved lung and distal organ function and survival. Early-stage clinical trials have also demonstrated the safety of MSC administration in patients with ARDS, but further, large-scale investigations are required to assess the safety and efficacy profile of these therapies. In this review, we summarize the main mechanisms whereby MSCs have been shown to exert therapeutic effects in experimental ARDS. We also highlight questions that need to be further elucidated and barriers that must be overcome in order to efficiently translate MSC research into clinical practice.","publish_time":"2019-09-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lopes-Pacheco, Miqu\u00E9ias; Robba, Chiara; Rocco, Patricia Rieken Mac\u00EAdo; Pelosi, Paolo","journal":"Cell Biol Toxicol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc84e71201caa08697552bc57debc8f80135fd3f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7222160.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222160/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs2MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","MSC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["experimental ARDS","models of ARDS","improved lung","lung diseases","MSC research","safety of MSC administration","therapeutic effects","clinical practice","MSCs","clinical outcomes","multifaceted lung disorder","stage clinical trials","based therapies","improved understanding of molecular mechanisms","main mechanisms","endothelial cell recovery","specific therapeutic intervention","anti-apoptotic effects","potential of mesenchymal stem cell","advances","supportive care strategies","mounting evidence","survivors","preclinical studies","high mortality","distal organ function","critical illnesses","alveolar fluid clearance","acute respiratory distress syndrome","survival","patients","recent years","efficacy profile","long-term morbidity","large-scale investigations","review","barriers","questions"],"language":"en"},

The effects of sleep deprivation on the cardiovascular, pulmonary, immune, endocrine, and neuropsychological systems are discussed, with a focus on short-term deprivation in critically ill populations. Where evidence is lacking in the literature, long-term sleep deprivation studies and the effects of sleep deprivation in healthy individuals are also referenced. Lastly, strategies for the promotion of sleep in the NeuroICU are presented.","publish_time":"2019-08-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Victoria A.; Owens, Robert L.; LaBuzetta, Jamie N.","journal":"Neurocrit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b2ba8510a9f8091d982742abeae0b5a327daf154.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7222162.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222162/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs2MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of sleep deprivation","promotion of sleep","long-term sleep deprivation studies","methods of measuring sleep","common causes of sleep disturbance","short-term deprivation","NeuroICU","focus","intensive care setting","neurological intensive care unit","ill patients","ill populations","narrative review","endocrine","hospital","literature","healthy individuals","neuropsychological systems","patient-related factors","everyday functioning","strategies","evidence"],"language":"en"},

While the assays themselves encompass a broad range of diverse and unrelated experimental protocols, the numerical data garnered from these experiments often have similar statistical properties. In general, a primary dataset measures the paired expression of two internally controlled reporter genes. The expression ratio of these two genes is then normalized to an external control reporter. The end result is a \u2018ratio of ratios\u2019 that is inherently sensitive to propagation of the error contributed by each of the respective numerical components. The statistical analysis of this data therefore requires careful handling in order to control for the propagation of error and its potentially misleading effects. A careful survey of the literature found no consistent method for the statistical analysis of data generated from these important and informative assay systems. In this report, we present a detailed statistical framework for the systematic analysis of data obtained from bicistronic reporter assay systems. Specifically, a dual luciferase reporter assay was employed to measure the efficiency of four programmed \u22121 frameshift signals. These frameshift signals originate from the L-A virus, the SARS-associated Coronavirus and computationally identified frameshift signals from two Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes. Furthermore, these statistical methods were applied to prove that the effects of anisomycin on programmed \u22121 frameshifting are statistically significant. A set of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, which can be used as templates for data generated by dual reporter assay systems, and an online tutorial are available at our website (http://dinmanlab.umd.edu/statistics). These spreadsheets could be easily adapted to any bicistronic reporter assay system.","publish_time":"2004-11-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jacobs, Jonathan L.; Dinman, Jonathan D.","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-pdf/32/20/e160/3888891/gnh157.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs2MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Microsoft"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Bicistronic reporter assay systems","dual reporter assay systems","statistical analysis of data","dual luciferase reporter assay","informative assay systems","controlled reporter genes","numerical data","external control reporter","systematic analysis of data","frameshift signals","statistical methods","detailed statistical framework","similar statistical properties","expression ratio","propagation of error","Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes","paired expression","ratio of ratios\u2019","careful survey","careful handling","effects of anisomycin","misleading effects","respective numerical components","set of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets","unrelated experimental protocols","broad range of diverse","online tutorial","consistent method","experiments","SARS-associated Coronavirus","primary dataset","literature","order","mainstay of molecular biology","website","frameshifting","efficiency","templates","end result","assays"],"language":"en"},

The first human CoV identified in the 1960s was isolated from patients presenting with common cold symptoms. Subsequent epidemic outbreaks of novel zoonotic CoV transmission were reported, examples including HCoV-229E (229E), HCoV-OC43 (OC43), severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The ongoing outbreak of MERS in the Middle East is originating from a zoonotic source of dromedary camels. Surveillance later revealed that three CoV species\u2014HCoV-229E (229E), camel-HKU23, and MERS-CoV\u2014were co-circulating in Saudi Arabia dromedary camels. Camel-HKU23 belongs to Group 2a CoV, which also includes human coronavirus OC43, bovine coronavirus, and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus. Recombination, resulting in the generation of different novel genotypes, has been reported previously among these CoVs. Our surveillance of dromedary camels slaughtered in a major abattoir in Nigeria identified camel-HKU23 from nasal swab samples with a prevalence of 2.2 per cent. Phylogenetic analysis showed Nigeria camel-HKU23 is distinct from those previously identified in Saudi Arabia, while still genetically similar, as they share a monophyletic origin. Recombination analysis of Nigeria camel-HKU23 revealed two recombination breakpoints at positions of 22774\u201324100 base pairs (bp) and 28224\u201329362 bp. Recombination breakpoint at position 22774, encoding the Group 2a CoV-specific hemagglutinin esterase gene, exhibited high bootstrap support for clustering with RbCoV HKU14, which was previously detected in domestic rabbits in China. The recombination signal is only observed in Nigeria camel-HKU23, suggesting a regional varied evolutionary history of camel-HKU23. Our findings extended the knowledge of the evolutionary relationship among Group 2a CoVs. Further surveillance in other African camels will be important to elucidate the evolution of camel-HKU23.","publish_time":"2019-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"So, R T Y; Oladipo, J O; Chu, D K W; Peiris, M","journal":"Virus Evol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6736086/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs4ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia","Nigeria","China"],"keyphrases":["Recombination analysis of Nigeria camel-HKU23","MERS-CoV","evolution of camel","human CoV","CoV species","surveillance of dromedary camels","HCoV-OC43","Group","recombination breakpoints","recombination signal","CoVs","Saudi Arabia dromedary camels","regional varied evolutionary history of camel","zoonotic source of dromedary camels","African camels","human coronavirus OC43","Middle East respiratory syndrome","CoV-specific hemagglutinin esterase gene","Subsequent epidemic outbreaks of novel zoonotic CoV transmission","ongoing outbreak of MERS","bovine coronavirus","severe acute respiratory syndrome","evolutionary relationship","Phylogenetic analysis","generation of different novel genotypes","high bootstrap support","positive-sense RNA viruses","co-circulating","large genomic size","major abattoir","nasal swab samples","clustering","porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus","positions","examples","RbCoV HKU14","patients","prevalence","knowledge","common cold symptoms","base pairs","domestic rabbits","China","bp","kilobases","findings","monophyletic origin","cent","Coronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

The risks associated with this condition include ventilator associated lung injury, over distension of lungs, and poor gas exchange which results in increased morbidity and mortality. With quality improvement initiatives like prone positioning, the mortality and morbidity associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome(1) can be reduced by improving hypoxemia(2) with a significant enhancement in PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios while reducing injurious ventilation. Also, prone positioning can help prevent invasive interventions such as placing patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy.(3) Methods: We evaluated the safety of prone positioning for improving hypoxemia in critically ill patients with PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio \u003C 100 mmHg to PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio \u003C 200 mmHg from 1(st) January 2017 to 31(st) December 2018, without major complications. Data collected included the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios based on arterial blood gases of mechanically ventilated patients before and after prone positioning. We were able to facilitate prone positioning in 72 out of 110 patients with severe ARDS having a total average PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio of 84.4 \u00B1 30 mmHg. The patients were proned for a maximum of 16 hours in each session where up to three sessions were incorporated. No major complications were encountered during the proning sessions. This was thought to be accomplished through the coordination of a dedicated multidisciplinary team, education and simulation classes for physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists, following appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria for prone positioning, and implementing quality measures through Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles as represented in Figure 1. Results: The total average PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio before proning for 65% of patients (n = 72) with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome(4) was 84.4 \u00B1 30 mmHg and after one hour of 16 hours proning, it improved to 180.3 \u00B1 78 mmHg. The remaining 35% of patients either had traumatic fractures, unstable spinal injury, severe hemodynamic instability, or morbid obesity together with ARDS which made them unfavorable for prone positioning. Out of those who were proned, 11 (12.5%) patients did not have improvement in oxygenation after proning due to non-recruitable lungs and were put on ECMO. The PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios before and after one hour of implementing the prone position technique in each quarter of 2017 and 2018 are represented in Figure 2.

The CDC42 gene mutations are associated with distinct clinical phenotypes characterized by neurodevelopmental, growth, hematological, and immunological disturbances. Case presentation: We report the case of an 11-year-old boy with syndromic features, immunodeficiency, and autoinflammation who developed hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and malignant lymphoproliferation. In this patient, a novel heterozygous p.Cys81Tyr mutation in the CDC42 gene was found by whole exome sequencing. Conclusions: The Cdc42 molecule plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation and a wide array of tissue-specific functions, and its deregulation may result in a broad spectrum of molecular and cellular dysfunctions, making patients with CDC42 gene mutations susceptible to infections, immune dysregulation, and malignancy. In the patient studied, a syndromic phenotype with facial dysmorphism, neurodevelopmental delay, immunodeficiency, autoinflammation, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis shares common features with Takenouchi\u2013Kosaki syndrome and with C-terminal variants in CDC42. It is important to emphasize that Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma is described for the first time in the medical literature in a pediatric patient with the novel p.Cys81Tyr mutation in the CDC42 gene.

The challenge for disease ecology is to unravel these systems, discover how complex they truly are, and to determine if they can be predicted and controlled using targeted environmental, public health, or medical interventions. Between 1999 and 2005, a total of 42 research awards were made under the EID program.

The past 6 years have been an exciting time for the field of disease ecology; we expect the coming years to be even more exciting and productive.","publish_time":"2006-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scheiner, Samuel M.; Rosenthal, Joshua P.","journal":"Ecohealth","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/56363fc5d9338b50e780afeff9dd3d5d581bb1d6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088405.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088405/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs5Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Science Foundation\u2013National Institutes of Health","EID"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EID program","EID projects","field of disease ecology","public health resources","Ecology of Infectious Diseases","coming years","National Institutes of Health initiative","interdisciplinary research projects","predictive understanding of disease dynamics","exciting time","medical interventions","environmental component","research awards","adoption of novel interventions","joint National Science Foundation","purpose","wide range of theoretical","methodological advances","models","local scale","advantage","focus","government agencies","areas","policy","systems","total","challenge"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The SAC (3 pediatric rheumatologists and 2 pediatric infectious disease specialists) elaborated and approved by consensus a provisional list of OI for use in JIA. Through a 5 step-procedure, all the severe and serious infections, classified as per MedDRA dictionary and retrieved in the Pharmachild registry, were evaluated by the SAC by answering six questions and adjudicated with the agreement of 3/5 specialists. A final evidence-based list of OI resulted by matching the adjudicated infections with the provisional list of OI. RESULTS: A total of 772 infectious events in 572 eligible patients, of which 335 serious/severe/very severe non-OI and 437 OI (any intensity/severity), according to the provisional list, were retrieved. Six hundred eighty-two of 772 (88.3%) were adjudicated as infections, of them 603/682 (88.4%) as common and 119/682 (17.4%) as OI by the SAC. Matching these 119 opportunistic events with the provisional list, 106 were confirmed by the SAC as OI, and among them infections by herpes viruses were the most frequent (68%), followed by tuberculosis (27.4%). The remaining events were divided in the groups of non-OI and possible/patient and/or pathogen-related OI. CONCLUSIONS: We found a significant number of OI in JIA patients on immunosuppressive therapy. The proposed list of OI, created by consensus and validated in the Pharmachild cohort, could facilitate comparison among future pharmacovigilance studies.

The reciprocal cell-cell/ECM interaction and tumor cell hijacking of non-malignant cells force stromal cells to lose their function and acquire new phenotypes that promote development and invasion of tumor cells. Understanding the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms governing these interactions can be used as a novel strategy to indirectly disrupt cancer cell interplay and contribute to the development of efficient and safe therapeutic strategies to fight cancer. Furthermore, the tumor-derived circulating materials can also be used as cancer diagnostic tools to precisely predict and monitor the outcome of therapy.

The role of Dot1L against infections was highlighted by an increase of influenza A and vesicular stomatitis virus replication in Dot1L-inhibited cells mediated by a decreased antiviral response. Interferon-beta (IFN-\u03B2) reporter assays indicate that Dot1L is involved in the control of retinoic acid-inducible gene-I protein (RIG-I) signaling. Accordingly, Dot1L inhibition decreases the IFN-\u03B2 promoter stimulation and RIG-I- mitochondria-associated viral sensor (RIG-I-MAVS) association upon viral infection. Replication of an influenza A virus lacking NS1 (delNS1), incapable of counteracting the antiviral response, is not affected by Dot1L inhibition. Consequently, RIG-I-MAVS association and nuclear factor\u2013\u03BAB (NF-\u03BAB) nuclear translocation, are not affected by the Dot1L inhibition in delNS1 infected cells. Restoration of NS1 expression in trans also reinstated Dot1L as a regulator of the RIG-I-dependent signaling in delNS1 infections. Interferon-inducible E3 ligase tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25) expression increases in influenza virus infected cells, but Dot1L inhibition reduces both the TRIM25 expression and TRIM25 protein levels. TRIM25 overexpression reverses the defective innate response mediated by Dot1L inhibition elicited upon virus infection or by overexpression of RIG-I signaling intermediates. Thus, TRIM25 is a control point of the RIG-I recognition pathway controlled by Dot1L and may have a general role in RNA viruses recognized by the RIG-I sensor.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marcos-Villar, Laura; Nistal-Villan, Estanislao; Zamarre\u00F1o, Noelia; Garaigorta, Urtzi; Gastaminza, Pablo; Nieto, Amelia","journal":"Cells","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d20b66267fd6aff187081e293ae9c5817c5b3ba8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7140698.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7140698/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjsyNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Dot1L inhibition","role of Dot1L","Dot1L enzyme","Dot1L-inhibited cells","overexpression of RIG","Influenza virus infection","TRIM25 expression","influenza virus infected cells","TRIM25 overexpression","TRIM25 protein levels","delNS1 infected cells","expression increases","increase of influenza","viral infection","delNS1 infections","vesicular stomatitis virus replication","MAVS association","Restoration of NS1 expression","decreased antiviral response","viral sensor","defective innate response","NF-\u03BAB","IFN-\u03B2 promoter stimulation","nuclear factor","Interferon-beta","nuclear translocation","control point","general role","control of retinoic acid-inducible gene","Interferon-inducible E3 ligase tripartite motif","histone","methylation of lysine","mitochondria","reporter assays","RNA viruses","incapable","recognition pathway","dependent","regulator","intermediates"],"language":"en"},

NHPs were exposed to DENV-1 via subcutaneous or intradermal inoculation of virus only, intradermal inoculation of virus and salivary gland extract, or infectious mosquito feeding. The infectious mosquito feeding group exhibited delayed onset of viremia, greater viral loads, and altered clinical and immune responses compared to other groups. After 15 months, NHPs in the subcutaneous and infectious mosquito feeding groups were re-exposed to either DENV-1 or DENV-2. Viral replication and neutralizing antibody following homologous challenge were suggestive of sterilizing immunity, whereas heterologous challenge resulted in productive, yet reduced, DENV-2 replication and boosted neutralizing antibody.

They consist of a bilayer of phospholipid molecules in which proteins are embedded. These integral membrane proteins, which cross the bilayer once or several times, generally have a higher than average hydrophobicity and tend to aggregate. Detergents are needed to remove integral membrane proteins from the lipid bilayer and they have to be present during further chromatographic purification. Predominantly, four modes of HPLC have been used alone or in combination for the puridication of integral membrane proteins. These are based on differences of proteins in size (size-exclusion chromatography, SEC), electrostatic interaction (ion-exchange chromatography, IEC), bioaffinity (bioaffinity chromatography, BAC) and hydrophobic interaction (reversed-phase chromatography, RPC, and hydrophobic-interaction chromatography, HIC). SEC, IEC, BAC and HIC are used under relatively mild conditions, and buffer systems generally contain a non-ionic detergent. RPC generally has a denaturing effect on the protein and should preferably be used for the purification of integral membrane proteins smaller than 50 kD.","publish_time":"1987-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Welling, Gjalt W.; Van der Zee, Ruurd; Welling-Wester, Sytske","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148774/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjszNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEC","IEC","HIC","RPC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["puridication of integral membrane proteins","bioaffinity chromatography","differences of proteins","hydrophobic-interaction chromatography","purification of integral membrane proteins smaller","phase chromatography","size-exclusion chromatography","hydrophobic interaction","ion-exchange chromatography","electrostatic interaction","SEC","IEC","lipid bilayer","RPC","BAC","bilayer of phospholipid molecules","Biological membranes","chromatographic purification","compartmentation of biological processes","major function","buffer systems","cells","kD","mild conditions","non-ionic detergent","denaturing effect","organelles","combination","average hydrophobicity","times","Detergents","modes of HPLC"],"language":"en"},

NET formation has been reported to be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, there are no reports dealing with serial changes of NET formation in tracheal aspirate of ARDS patients. CASE PRESENTATION: We report three cases of ARDS. Case 1 is a 69-year-old man with necrotizing fasciitis of the buttocks, case 2 is a 49-year-old woman with extensive burns (80% of total body surface), and case 3 is a 73-year-old woman with severe bacterial pneumonia. We found abundant expression of citrullinated histone H3 (Cit-H3) and the formation of NETs at the onset of ARDS in all cases. The amounts of Cit-H3 and NETs decreased with the amelioration of respiratory failure in cases 1 and 2. In case 2, the amounts of Cit-H3 and NETs increased with aggravation of infection and respiratory status. In case 3, the abundant expression of Cit-H3 and NETs persisted; the patient did not recover from ARDS and eventually died. Cit-H3 and NETs were found in tracheal aspirates even if the patients had no direct injury to the lung as in cases 1 and 2. CONCLUSIONS: In these three cases, the formation of NETs was observed in tracheal aspirate of patients with ARDS by either direct or indirect insults to the lung. The amount of NET formation changed dynamically over the clinical course of each patient.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ojima, Masahiro; Yamamoto, Norihisa; Hirose, Tomoya; Hamaguchi, Shigeto; Tasaki, Osamu; Kojima, Takashi; Tomono, Kazunori; Ogura, Hiroshi; Shimazu, Takeshi","journal":"J Intensive Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac1632dd166e137cd82880670bc4107834f2467b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149861.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149861/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjszNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["formation of NETs","Cit-H3","cases of ARDS","tracheal aspirate of ARDS patients","amounts of Cit","onset of ARDS","CASE PRESENTATION","tracheal aspirate of patients","year-old woman","serial changes of NET formation","abundant expression of citrullinated histone H3","tracheal aspirates","year-old man","respiratory status","lung","amelioration of respiratory failure","direct injury","acute respiratory distress syndrome","fibrous structures","Neutrophil extracellular traps","necrotizing fasciitis","extensive burns","aggravation of infection","total body surface","buttocks","severe bacterial pneumonia","BACKGROUND","indirect insults","clinical course","activated neutrophils","reports","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Sick foals were separated from their mothers following the onset of diarrhoea and given fluid therapy and antibiotics, but despite these measures 4 of 12 affected foals on one property died. Acute and convalescent sera were collected from 6 foals, and in each case a rise in the titres of complement fixing and neutralising antibodies was demonstrated. Faecal filtrates containing foal rotaviruses were fed to gnotobiotic piglets and the effects compared with those of other rotaviruses.

Methods (1) Paired t\u2010tests to compare mean daily deaths and hospital admissions during and after weekends (Saturday\u2013Tuesday) with means for the week, in south\u2010east England; (2) Linear regressions to see whether trends of daily deaths change when admissions are reduced at Christmas. Results Neither mean daily all\u2010cause, respiratory or ischaemic heart deaths exceeded weekly averages during weekends, or during Saturday\u2013Monday or Saturday\u2013Tuesday, despite falls in daily elective and daily emergency hospital admissions at weekends that averaged 61\u201372% and 14\u201322%, respectively. During 19\u201324 December, daily deaths were above annual means, respiratory deaths by 49% (29, 1\u201358), but elective admissions fell and although emergency admissions tended to rise, total admissions rose only for respiratory disease, and only by 33% (376, \u221247 to 799). On Christmas Day (25 December), even emergency admissions fell sharply below previous trends, respiratory emergency admissions by 18% (P \u003C 0.01). Respiratory deaths alone then immediately increased (P \u003C 0.01) above trend, by 5.9% (5.8 deaths/day) on 26 December and by 12.9% (12.9) on 27 December. Conclusions No adverse effect on mortality was apparent within 2 days from reduction in medical services at weekends. However, respiratory deaths accelerated sharply after reduction in elective and emergency admissions at Christmas, when rates of infection and mortality from respiratory disease were high.

The key issue is that PAH is a form of PH. On the opposite, PH does not automatically imply PAH. Pulmonary arterial hypertension must be differentiated from other causes of PH that are frequently seen in ICU. It was recently emphasized that pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) must be differentiated from PH and PAH. The prognosis of PAH was consistently improved in the ten past years by introduction of selective pulmonary vasodilators and management by highly specialized medical teams. In ICU patients, PAH remains a severe disease with a high mortality rate. When PAH is suspected, a systematic diagnosis approach is of particular importance in order to rapidly eliminate left cardiac, thromboembolic and pulmonary causes of PH. Left cardiac disease is the most common cause of PH. Early recognition of PAH allows a rapid introduction of selective pulmonary vasodilators that can improve outcome. Idiopathic PAH is the most frequent cause but it can also be associated with scleroderma, HIV infection, anorexigen toxicity, thyroid disease, cirrhosis. Pulmonary vasodilators should be only a part of a general management including treatment of triggering factors, optimization of fluid balance, decrease of RV afterload by using pulmonary vasodilators while maintaining cardiac output and mean arterial pressure. The early contact of PH referral center or specialized physician is of particular importance.","publish_time":"2014-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muller, Laurent; Bengler, Christian; Roger, Claire; Cohendy, Robert; Lefrant, Jean Yves","journal":"Uncommon Diseases in the ICU","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b475ae6c1687ee547f8be5a707c98d076bb4182.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120311.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120311/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PAH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pulmonary causes of","Idiopathic PAH","prognosis of PAH","forms of pulmonary hypertension","diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension","Early recognition of PAH","pulmonary veno-occlusive disease","rapid introduction of selective pulmonary vasodilators","cardiac disease","causes of PH","severe disease","thyroid disease","specialized physician","cardiac output","particular importance","early contact of PH referral center","arterial pressure","ICU patients","general management","common cause of","frequent cause","systematic diagnosis approach","specialized medical teams","anorexigen toxicity","treatment of triggering factors","optimization of fluid balance","HIV infection","RV afterload","PVOD","past years","scleroderma","high mortality rate","cirrhosis","intensive care unit","order","form of","outcome","key issue","opposite"],"language":"en"},

Earlier, killed or attenuated pathogens were employed for vaccine development. But in present era, the peptide vaccines are in much trend and are favoured over whole vaccines because of their superiority over conventional vaccines. These vaccines are either based on single proteins or on synthetic peptides including several B-cell and T-cell epitopes. However, the overall mechanism of action remains the same and works by prompting the immune system to activate the specific B-cell- and T-cell-mediated responses against the pathogen. Rino Rappuoli and others have contributed in this field by plotting the design of the most potent and fully computational approach for discovery of potential vaccine candidates which is popular as reverse vaccinology. This is quite an unambiguous advance for vaccine evolution where one begins with the genome information of the pathogen and ends up with the list of certain epitopes after application of multiple bioinformatics tools. This book chapter is an effort to bring this approach of reverse vaccinology into notice of readers using example of coronavirus.","publish_time":"2018-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dangi, Mehak; Kumari, Rinku; Singh, Bharat; Chhillar, Anil Kumar","journal":"Bioinformatics: Sequences, Structures, Phylogeny","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f197af46dbe7cc4b8a2342039e5c88aa9d471694.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120312.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120312/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rino Rappuoli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["peptide vaccines","conventional vaccines","T-cell epitopes","specific B-cell","approach of reverse vaccinology","vaccine evolution","vaccine development","discovery of potential vaccine candidates","computational approach","list of certain epitopes","potent substitute of available medicines","notice of readers","application of multiple bioinformatics tools","synthetic peptides","effort","single proteins","mediated responses","viral diseases","example of coronavirus","immune system","attenuated pathogens","unambiguous advance","present era","superiority","trend","genome information","overall mechanism of action","book chapter","design","Rino Rappuoli","field"],"language":"en"},

However, utilization of plant systems for production of edible vaccines has been a comparatively recent phenomenon. There are several potential advantages of plant derived vaccines over other conventional systems of vaccine production such as mammalian or avian cell culture. The cost of vaccines is one factor preventing further use of vaccination, leaving hundreds of thousands of children susceptible to preventable diseases. Especially for developing world this novel technique proved to be a boon for its low cost of production, convenient administration, easy storage and negligible chances of infection whereas the conventional system of vaccine production limits the applicability of vaccines in many parts of the world. These vaccines are prepared by introducing selected desired genes into plants and inducing these genetically modified plants to manufacture the encoded proteins. Transgenic plants may provide an ideal expression system, in which transgenic plant material can be fed directly as oral dose of recombinant vaccines. Expression of vaccines in plant tissue eliminates the risk of contamination with animal pathogen, provides a heat stable environment and enables oral delivery thus eliminating infection related hazards. Identification of transgenic material, containment of the transgenes and control of recombinant protein may be potential problems for large scale production of vaccines in plants. Factors like scaling up production as well as distribution and handling of transgenic plant material must comprise the future consideration in this field.","publish_time":"2013-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sahai, Aastha; Shahzad, Anwar; Shahid, Mohd.","journal":"Recent Trends in Biotechnology and Therapeutic Applications of Medicinal Plants","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64c25194dc908c1e68a8e6b65f52c5af63a24fb7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120501.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120501/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsxMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Transgenic"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["production of edible vaccines","Expression of vaccines","cost of vaccines","applicability of vaccines","Transgenic plants","large scale production of vaccines","potential advantages of plant derived vaccines","handling of transgenic plant material","oral dose of recombinant vaccines","conventional systems of vaccine production","plant tissue","low cost of production","modified plants","utilization of plant systems","Identification of transgenic material","conventional system of vaccine production limits","world","ideal expression system","oral delivery","potential problems","negligible chances of infection","infection related hazards","control of recombinant protein","convenient administration","easy storage","mammalian","transgenes","heat stable environment","hundreds of thousands","animal pathogen","risk of contamination","children susceptible","boon","containment","distribution","future consideration","preventable diseases","use of vaccination","avian cell culture","selected desired genes","novel technique","encoded proteins","parts","recent phenomenon","pharmaceutical","field","source","Factors"],"language":"en"},

To date, the status of a considerable proportion of HIV/AIDS patients has changed from a near-fatal disorder secondary to opportunistic infections to a chronic disease in which a variety of co-morbid conditions have become prevalent and relevant. Arthralgia and myalgias are the most common symptoms. The rate of spondyloarthritis varies according to the geographic area, genetic and mode of transmission. Most RA and SLE patients might go into remission after the development of AIDS, but also there are patients that continue with active disease. Prevalence of DILS is highest among African Americans in less advanced stages. PAN is clinically less aggressive and peripheral neuropathy is the most common clinical manifestation. Anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS), systemic sclerosis and poly-dermatomyositis are uncommon. After the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), a decline of spondyloarthritis disorders and of DILS and development of new syndromes such as IRIS, osteoporosis and avascular bone necrosis have occurred.

Natural scenarios include common, emerging/re-emerging and chronic infectious diseases: they are caused by biological agents, which can be normally present in the communities, as acute or chronic pathologies, or suddenly appear, causing new or uncommon syndromes. In particular, a lot of environmental and human factors can influence emerging and re-emerging diseases: for example, urbanization and people mobility facilitate microorganisms spread, while climate changes are likely to induce a relocation of pathogens vectors. Unintended events are usually due to research and diagnostic activities: laboratories are the places where biological agents are handled and a lack in Biosafety measures or negligence can result in accidental release; the so called Laboratory Acquired Infections represent the main consequence, since they cause pathologies in the laboratory workers, but could be also transmitted in the population.

The UV spectrum of solar radiation is by convention divided into three parts: UV-A: 310\u2013400 nm, UV-B: 280\u2013310 nm and UV-C: less than 280 nm. UV-B is the most energetic component reaching Earth surface because the stratospheric ozone layer effectively absorbs completely wavelengths below 290 nm. UV-B is an increasing threat due to increasing UV-B levels on Earth surface as a consequence of depletion of stratospheric O(3). In general, the effects of atmospheric UV-B radiation are negative for biological life. Enhanced levels of UV-B radiation can indeed negatively change plant physiological processes, growth and productivity. However, while studying UV-B effects on medicinal plants, some interesting phenomena have been discovered. For example, basil plants respond positively to UV-B radiation by increasing oil yield (Chang et al. J Horticult For 1:27\u201331, 2009). In other studies medicinal plants show beneficial aspects in term of increase in volatile oil yield and secondary metabolite production (Kumari et al. Ecotoxicol Environ Safety 72:2013\u20132019, 2009c, 2010). Medicinal herbs have great market value in India and worldwide. The medicinal value of plants depends upon phenolics, antioxidants and volatile yield. Therefore further UV-B experiments increasing the levels of these compounds are needed. Here we review the effect of UV-B exposure on metabolites, volatiles, and antioxidants potential in medicinal plants. This chapter reports: (1) aspects of the global market for medicinal and aromatic plants in India in order to assist the medicinal plant industry to make informed decisions. (2) The biodiversity loss due to wild harvesting of plants, and as an alternative the cultivation strategy of medicinal plants. (3) Main medicinal plant species having rich antioxidant potential. (4) Main secondary metabolites of plant origin such as phenylpropanoids, terpenes, alkaloids, and volatile oil, and other important metabolites containing high antioxidant level used in human diet and health.

The public health system and medical care community in the United States have wrestled with developing new and more accurate methods for earlier detection of threats to the health of the public. The benefits and challenges of using Emergency Department data for surveillance are described in this chapter through examples from one biosurveillance system, the North Carolina Disease Event Tracking and Epidemiologic Collection Tool (NC DETECT). ED data are a proven tool for biosurveillance, and the ED data in NC DETECT have proved to be effective for a variety of public health uses, including surveillance, monitoring and investigation. A distinctive feature of ED data for surveillance is their timeliness. With electronic health information systems, these data are available in near real-time, making them particularly useful for surveillance and situational awareness in rapidly developing public health outbreaks or disasters. Challenges to using ED data for biosurveillance include the reliance on free text data (often in chief complaints). Problems with textual data are addressed in a variety of ways, including preprocessing data to clean the text entries and address negation. The use of ED data for public health surveillance can significantly increase the speed of detecting, monitoring and investigating public health events. Biosurveillance systems that are incorporated into hospital and public health practitioner daily work flows are more effective and easily used during a public health emergency. The flexibility of a system such as NC DETECT helps it meet this level of functionality.","publish_time":"2010-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Waller, Anna E.; Scholer, Matthew; Ising, Amy I.; Travers, Debbie A.","journal":"Infectious Disease Informatics and Biosurveillance","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c2ca3dc1fb37e6bbfdf9700330a64b2d6bf2052.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120837.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120837/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsyNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["Emergency Department","Epidemiologic Collection Tool","NC"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["public health surveillance","public health system","public health outbreaks","public health emergency","public health events","preprocessing data","interpreting data","textual data","variety of public health threats","variety of public health uses","use of ED data","free text data","Emergency Department data","distinctive feature of ED data","public health practitioner daily work flows","electronic health information systems","Biosurveillance systems","variety of ways","challenges","early detection of disease outbreaks","earlier detection of threats","text entries","proven tool","Epidemiologic Collection Tool","North Carolina Disease Event Tracking","medical care community","hospital","reliance","situational awareness","United States","accurate methods","emerging field","chapter","chief complaints","address negation","benefits","examples","disasters","timeliness","Problems","flexibility","speed","level of functionality","investigation"],"language":"en"},

To achieve robust replication, plus-stranded RNA viruses interact with numerous cellular molecules via protein\u2013protein, RNA\u2013protein, and protein\u2013lipid interactions using molecular mimicry and other means. These interactions lead to the transformation of the host cells into viral \u201Cfactories\u0022 that can produce 10,000\u20131,000,000 progeny RNAs per infected cell. This chapter presents the progress that was made largely in the last 15 years in understanding virus\u2013host interactions during RNA virus replication. The most commonly employed approaches to identify host factors that affect plus-stranded RNA virus replication are described. In addition, we discuss many of the identified host factors and their proposed roles in RNA virus replication. Altogether, host factors are key determinants of the host range of a given virus and affect virus pathology, host\u2013virus interactions, as well as virus evolution. Studies on host factors also contribute insights into their normal cellular functions, thus promoting understanding of the basic biology of the host cell. The knowledge obtained in this fast-progressing area will likely stimulate the development of new antiviral methods as well as novel strategies that could make plus-stranded RNA viruses useful in bio- and nanotechnology.","publish_time":"2008-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nagy, Peter D.; Pogany, Judit","journal":"Viral Genome Replication","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14cc0c3048094f4895fcf6b4ad024820226c1173.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120932.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120932/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjszMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host interactions","host range","virus interactions","stranded RNA virus replication","identified host factors","understanding virus","virus pathology","given virus","virus evolution","subverting host proteins","stranded RNA viruses useful","capable of reprogramming host cells","modulating protein","eukaryotic viruses","lipid interactions","robust replication","cellular pathways","numerous cellular molecules","normal cellular functions","infected cell","proposed roles","largest group","membranes","insights","molecular mimicry","key determinants","development of new antiviral methods","ribonucleoprotein complexes","novel strategies","basic biology","transformation","years","progeny RNAs","means","nanotechnology","factories","employed approaches","Studies","area","infection","chapter","progress","knowledge","addition"],"language":"en"},

It is a tropical and subtropical fruit tree which is native to Fujian and Guangdong regions of China and is cultivated as an important commercial fruit crop in many parts of the world. It is famous for its fragrant and sugary flavour. After China, India is at the second position in the production of lychee in the world. The varieties with large pulp, small seeds and noteworthy flavour are of great interest among the consumers and farmers. Lychee fruit took tremendous attention of scientists as it contains ample amounts of anti-oxidants, vitamins and fibre. Moreover, the plant parts possess considerable anti-pyretic, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, anti-tumour and anti-oxidant properties. Propagation of lychee from seeds is difficult and not practicable because of longer juvenile period and non-viable, abortive and genetically diverse nature of the seedlings. However, the techniques such as cell, tissue and organ culture (micropropagation) can overcome the difficulties of lychee propagation.

Ellipsometry is an optical technique that measures changes in the reflectance and phase difference between the parallel (R (P)) and perpendicular (R (S)) components of a polarized light beam upon reflection from a surface. Aside from providing a simple, sensitive, and nondestructive way to analyze thin films, ellipsometry allows dynamic studies of film growth (thickness and optical constants) with a time resolution that is relevant to biomedical research. The present chapter intends to introduce ellipsometry as an emerging but highly promising technique, that is useful to elucidate the interactions of proteins with solid surfaces. In this regard, particular emphasis is placed on experimental details related to the development of biomedically relevant conjugated surfaces. Results from our group related to adsorption of proteins to nanostructured materials, as well as results published by other research groups, are discussed to illustrate the advantages and limitations of the technique.","publish_time":"2009-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mora, Maria F.; Wehmeyer, Jennifer L.; Synowicki, Ron; Garcia, Carlos D.","journal":"Biological Interactions on Materials Surfaces","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/66c1ed523ad26adc1f40f874f274be662baa5afa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121108.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121108/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs0MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spectroscopic ellipsometry","optical technique","promising technique","Results","optical constants","adsorption of proteins","interactions of proteins","experimental details","solid surfaces","biomedical research","instrument details","research groups","present chapter","development of biomedically relevant conjugated surfaces","dynamic studies of film growth","thickness","time resolution","polarized light beam","components","phase difference","reflectance","films","changes","basic concepts","nondestructive way","reflection","particular emphasis","nanostructured materials","regard","advantages","limitations"],"language":"en"},

Proper sample acquisition and sample transport, as well as accurate DNA or RNA isolation are a prerequisite for reliable test results in molecular diagnostics of viral infections.

Many virus species consist of several subspecies, genotypes or variants. This molecular variation has to be taken into account when applying molecular diagnostics. More complicated diagnostics for genotyping or the detection of mutations related to therapy failure often rely on sequencing, although for some viral targets commercial assays are available.

This marriage of health issues to security logic has been met with a mix of applause, caution, and critique. In particular, there have been growing claims that the successful global health initiatives such as, the Global Fund for AIDS, TB, and Malaria (Global Fund) and the Global Alliance for Vaccine Immunization (GAVI) were achieved without asserting their necessity on security considerations. Thus, what difference does the association of security to health make for the success and longevity of global health initiatives? In this chapter, I answer this question through comparing a case where the security logic was deliberately deployed to frame the \u2018health emergency\u2019 (Framework Convention on Tobacco Control), against a case where human rights logic was used to advocate for its creation (the GAVI).

Their excellent antigen presentation potential can contribute to the activation of other cells of the immune system, and evidence is emerging that specialized subsets of these cells, that may be increased with age, can influence the cell-mediated immune system in antitumor responses. They can also regulate immune responses, to avoid autoreactivity and excessive inflammation. Deficiencies in regulatory B cells may be beneficial in cancer but will only exacerbate the inflammatory environment that is a hallmark of aging. The B cell role as antibody producers is particularly important, since antibodies perform numerous different functions in different environments. Although studying tissue responses in humans is not as easy as in mice, we do know that certain classes of antibodies are more suited to protecting the mucosal tissues (IgA) or responding to T-independent bacterial polysaccharide antigens (IgG(2)) so we can make some inference with respect to tissue-specific immunity from a study of peripheral blood. We can also make inferences about changes in B cell development with age by looking at the repertoire of different B cell populations to see how age affects the selection events that would normally occur to avoid autoreactivity, or increase specificity, to antigen.","publish_time":"2019-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dunn-Walters, Deborah K.; O\u2019Hare, Joselli Silva","journal":"Handbook of Immunosenescence","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/60a3c6f441aff320017f61160b124818112fd4e1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121151.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121151/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs0Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune responses","B cell role","B cell development","regulatory B cells","repertoire of different B cell populations","age","immune system","different environments","tissue responses","numerous different functions","number of different roles","antitumor responses","autoreactivity","tissue-specific immunity","certain classes of antibodies","excellent antigen presentation potential","antibody producers","T-independent bacterial polysaccharide antigens","changes","IgG","study of peripheral blood","respect","evidence","activation","cancer","inferences","inflammatory environment","IgA","mucosal tissues","specialized subsets","humans","Deficiencies","hallmark of aging","excessive inflammation","mice","selection events","specificity"],"language":"en"},

In the shifting perspectives of what English is (really global or truly local?), what it does (for and in education), and how it is used in this country (globally and/or locally), the paper hopes to elucidate the dimensions of teaching and learning English in the Singapore context and perhaps more widely in an Asia-Pacific context.","publish_time":"2013-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pakir, Anne","journal":"Dynamic Ecologies","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/10587b77282d64ba60378b33e3e2f1d96347c7b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121236.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121236/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs0Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Singapore"],"keyphrases":["glocal English","learning English","use of English","global language","Singapore context","global-local tensions","country","chapter re-","inter-ethnic communication","Asia-Pacific context","technology","industry","trade","science","commerce","economic power","finance","interesting ways","communicative tool of immense political","Internet","social media","dimensions of teaching","multilingual population base","notion","Kachru","Kontalinguistik","glocalism","ongoing discussions","special polities","shifting perspectives","label","world","paper","phenomenon","education"],"language":"en"},

Exposure to humans and tameness of animals when exposed to humans may also imply significant costs such as the rapid spread of viruses and other microorganisms that constitute reservoirs or vectors of serious diseases. Ecotourism and nature-based tourism are factors that may affect the behavior of animals living in natural habitats, including their stress and fear responses. Here I review a scarce and scattered literature dealing with changes in animal behavior across generations and critically assess the relative importance of the mechanisms that potentially underlie these changes. Animals may show short-term changes in behavior across generations as a consequence of microevolution (a genetic change in behavior), nongenetic so-called epigenetic changes, reductions in the response to behavioral stimuli with repeated exposure to a stimulus (habituation), and the nonrandom distribution of animals that differ in behavior among sites (so-called phenotypic sorting). I conclude with a plea for future research to allow assessment of the underlying causes of long-term changes in behavior of animals exposed to human disturbance, particularly those changes caused by ecotourists\u2019 activities.","publish_time":"2017-05-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"M\u00F8ller, Anders Pape","journal":"Ecotourism\u0026#x02019;s Promise and Peril","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a88f888d4a742e0ff74f849bbd7fb1f425c93a45.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123190.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123190/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs0OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["behavior of animals","animal behavior","short-term changes","tameness of animals","wild animals","generations","nongenetic so-called epigenetic changes","nonrandom distribution of animals","underlying causes of long-term changes","humans","repeated exposure","human disturbance","Human interactions","so-called phenotypic sorting","reductions","assessment","behavioral stimuli","reservoirs","microorganisms","habituation","consequence of microevolution","sites","consequences","rapid spread of viruses","population trends","scattered literature","natural habitats","nature-based tourism","stress","significant costs","stimulus","factors","future research","vectors of serious diseases","Ecotourism","plea","relative importance","mechanisms","fear responses","status","ecotourists","activities"],"language":"en"},

Most of the vaccines in current use were empirically developed during the last century. Today, due to the great advances in fields such as immunology and bioengineering, the rational development of live attenuated vaccines becomes increasingly feasible. Moreover, live vaccines can be used as carrier systems for heterologous antigens or therapeutic factors. In each case, the development of a recombinant live attenuated vaccine is a complex task where properties such as targeting specificity, antigen synthesis, antigen release, and safety aspects have to be integrated. A range of such recombinant vaccine candidates have successfully been tested in the clinics, but very few have been approved so far. In many cases, further optimization of such vaccines is necessary with regard to their efficacy and safety profiles. In the present chapter, we focus on current strategies which are employed for the development of new and the optimization of first generation recombinant live vaccines based on bacteria and viruses.","publish_time":"2012-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Loessner, Holger; Schwantes, Astrid; Hamdorf, Matthias; Komor, Uliana; Leschner, Sara; Weiss, Siegfried","journal":"Development of Novel Vaccines","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b97daece91268763e6995ace7c98d0ccc6a9a6b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123214.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123214/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs1MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["generation recombinant live vaccines","employment of live attenuated vaccines","rational development of live attenuated vaccines","recombinant live attenuated vaccine","recombinant vaccine candidates","optimization","development of new","antigen release","antigen synthesis","safety profiles","safety aspects","current strategies","current use","long-standing record","immunology","specificity","carrier systems","complex task","heterologous antigens","properties","human","regard","bioengineering","bacteria","therapeutic factors","fields","veterinary medicine","efficacy","great advances","range","viruses","present chapter","cases","century","clinics"],"language":"en"},

Careful donor selection, aseptic graft procurement and processing, and tissue sterilization, by irradiation or proprietary chemical processing, are the three major steps of the graft preparation procedure. Successful allograft implantation depends on sterility, reduction of antigenicity, and preservation of the biomechanical properties of the graft.

Typically, all forms of regulated necrosis are defined by finite rupture of the plasma cell membrane. Apoptosis is characterized by an enzymatic machinery that consists of caspases which cause the morphologic features of this type of cell death. Mechanistically, apoptosis can be instigated by two major cellular signalling pathways: an intrinsic pathway that is initiated inside cells by mitochondrial release of pro-apoptotic factors or an extrinsic pathway that is initiated at the cell surface by various death receptors. In necroptosis, the biochemical processes are distinct from those found in apoptosis; in particular, there is no caspase activation. As such, necroptosis is a kinase-mediated cell death that relies on \u201Creceptor-interacting protein kinase 3\u201D which mediates phosphorylation of the pseudokinase \u201Cmixed lineage kinase domain-like protein.\u201D While ferroptosis is an iron-dependent, oxidative form of regulated necrosis that is biochemically characterized by accumulation of ROS from iron metabolism, oxidase activity, and lipid peroxidation products, pyroptosis is defined as a form of cell death (predominantly of phagocytes) that develops during inflammasome activation and is executed by caspase-mediated cleavage of the pore-forming protein gasdermin D. Finally, NETosis refers to a regulated death of neutrophils that is characterized by the release of chromatin-derived weblike structures released into the extracellular space. The chapter ends up with a discussion on the characteristic feature of regulated necrosis: the passive release of large amounts of constitutive DAMPs as a consequence of final plasma membrane rupture as well as the active secretion of inducible DAMPs earlier during the dying process. Notably, per cell death subroutine, the active secretion of inducible DAMPs varies, thereby determining different immunogenicity of dying cells.","publish_time":"2018-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Land, Walter Gottlieb","journal":"Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns in Human Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d7fba582a165d8031dbe9fdf737b6559e9d7aee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123501.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123501/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs2OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["form of cell death","cell death subroutine","type of cell death","kinase-mediated cell death","regulated death of neutrophils","various subroutines of regulated cell death","cell surface","apoptosis","subforms of regulated necrosis","plasma cell membrane","various death receptors","oxidative form of regulated necrosis","characteristic feature of regulated necrosis","protein kinase","necroptosis","active secretion of inducible DAMPs","release of chromatin","cells","protein gasdermin","pyroptosis","ferroptosis","caspase activation","NETosis","chapter","passive release of large amounts of constitutive DAMPs","caspase-mediated cleavage","consequence of final plasma membrane rupture","finite rupture","intrinsic pathway","iron metabolism","iron-dependent","mixed lineage kinase domain","extrinsic pathway","inflammasome activation","dying process","mitochondrial release of pro-apoptotic factors","oxidase activity","derived weblike structures","lipid peroxidation products","major cellular signalling pathways","pseudokinase","phosphorylation","pore","accumulation of ROS","morphologic features","caspases","discussion","phagocytes","extracellular space","different immunogenicity","biochemical processes","enzymatic machinery"],"language":"en"},

Importantly, increasing demand and commercialization of bushmeat is exposing more people to pathogens and facilitating the geographic spread of diseases. To date, these linkages have not been systematically assessed. Here we review the literature on bushmeat and EIDs for sub-Saharan Africa, summarizing pathogens (viruses, fungi, bacteria, helminths, protozoan, and prions) by bushmeat taxonomic group to provide for the first time a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge concerning zoonotic disease transmission from bushmeat into humans.

NBSs are classified according to the transducer element (electrochemical, piezoelectric, optical, and thermal) in accordance with biorecognition principle (enzyme recognition, affinity immunoassay, whole sensors, DNA). NBSs have varied forms, depending on the degree of interpretation of natural processes in plants. Plant nanobionics uses mathematical models based on qualitative and less quantitative records. NBSs can give information about endogenous concentrations or endogenous fluxes of signaling molecules (phytohormones). The properties of NBSs are temporal and spatial resolution, the ability of being used without significantly interfering with the system. NBSs with the best properties are the optically genetically coded NBSs, but each NBS needs specific development efforts. NBS technologies using antibodies as a recognition domain are generic and tend to be more invasive, and there are examples of their use in plant nanobionics.

Recent efforts have expanded our knowledge of the true diversity of plant viruses by studying those viruses that infect wild, undomesticated plants. Those efforts have provided answers to basic ecological questions regarding viruses in the wild, and insights into evolutionary questions, regarding the origins of viruses. While much work has been done, we have merely scratched the surface of the diversity that is estimated to exist. In this chapter we discuss the state of our knowledge of virus diversity, both in agricultural systems as well as in native wild systems, the border between these two systems and how viruses adapt and move across this border into an artificial, domesticated environment. We look at how this diversity has affected our outlook on viruses as a whole, shifting our past view of viruses as purely antagonistic entities of destruction to one where viruses are in a mutually beneficial relationship with their hosts. Additionally, we discuss the current work that plant virology has put forth regarding the evolutionary mechanisms, the life histories, and the deep evolution of viruses.","publish_time":"2016-06-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stobbe, Anthony; Roossinck, Marilyn J.","journal":"Current Research Topics in Plant Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9872943d4dcc7f265a87d2540ace5c7a7baf486.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123681.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123681/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs4MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["origins of viruses","true diversity of plant viruses","deep evolution of viruses","past view of viruses","agricultural systems","native wild systems","knowledge of virus diversity","evolutionary questions","border","majority of plant virology","evolutionary mechanisms","Recent efforts","current work","basic ecological questions","life histories","answers","antagonistic entities of destruction","state","insights","domesticated environment","beneficial relationship","undomesticated plants","hosts","outlook","chapter","surface"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, in recent decades immunotherapy has become the mainstream therapy, which highlights the tremendous potential of immune response mediators, including vaccines for prevention and treatment of various forms of cancer. However, despite the tremendous advances in microbiology and immunology, there are several vaccine preventable diseases which still lack effective vaccines. Classically, weakened forms (attenuated) of pathogenic microbes were used as vaccines. Although the attenuated microbes induce effective immune response, a significant risk of reversion to pathogenic forms remains. While in the twenty-first century, with the advent of genetic engineering, microbes can be tailored with desired properties. In this review, I have focused on the use of genetically modified bacteria for the delivery of vaccine antigens. More specifically, the live-attenuated bacteria, derived from pathogenic bacteria, possess many features that make them highly suitable vectors for the delivery of vaccine antigens. Bacteria can theoretically express any heterologous gene or can deliver mammalian expression vectors harboring vaccine antigens (DNA vaccines). These properties of live-attenuated microbes are being harnessed to make vaccines against several infectious and noninfectious diseases. In this regard, I have described the desired features of live-attenuated bacterial vectors and the mechanisms of immune responses manifested by live-attenuated bacterial vectors. Interestingly anaerobic bacteria are naturally attracted to tumors, which make them suitable vehicles to deliver tumor-associated antigens thus I have discussed important studies investigating the role of bacterial vectors in immunotherapy. Finally, I have provided important discussion on novel approaches for improvement and tailoring of live-attenuated bacterial vectors for the generation of desired immune responses.","publish_time":"2019-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Sudeep","journal":"Pharmaceuticals from Microbes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1801513c69b235e2631913f915203bb67a1757e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123696.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123696/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs4MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["live-attenuated bacteria","attenuated microbes","effective vaccines","suitable vectors","DNA vaccines","pathogenic bacteria","role of bacterial vectors","pathogenic microbes","properties of live","delivery of vaccine antigens","desired features of live","pathogenic forms","modified bacteria","anaerobic bacteria","effective immune response","mammalian expression vectors","vaccine preventable diseases","generation of desired immune responses","desired properties","mechanisms of immune responses","tremendous potential of immune response mediators","tumor-associated antigens","various life-threatening infectious diseases","noninfectious diseases","treatment of various forms of cancer","important studies","important discussion","suitable vehicles","tremendous advances","human use","recent decades immunotherapy","significant risk of reversion","year","prevention","mainstream therapy","immunology","improvement","novel approaches","heterologous gene","tumors","advent of genetic engineering","microbiology","millions","century","regard","review"],"language":"en"},

It is a continulation of the previous chapter that established a basic background knowledge of adaptive immune principles necessary to understand the mode of action of both disease causation and biologics therapeutic treatment via immune modulation.","publish_time":"2019-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Williams, Kevin L.","journal":"Endotoxin Detection and Control in Pharma, Limulus, and Mammalian Systems","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/98af092ec48bbedf1980be21902da3f0d59f871c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123716.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123716/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs4Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["production of biologics","biologics revolution","biologics therapeutic treatment","treatment of disease","immune modulation","mode of action","animal proteins","disease causation","manner of control","means of production","previous chapter","mechanism of action","biotechnology revolution","human cadaver proteins","caveats of endotoxin control","basic background knowledge of adaptive immune principles necessary","regard","contaminants","potential impurities","insulin","growth hormone","terms","changes","overview","realization","differences","rigors of manufacturing","fruits","continulation","advent"],"language":"en"},

This chapter focuses on the natural history of local and regionally recurrent metastases and the multiple treatment modalities which exist for advanced locoregional melanoma, including regional perfusion procedures such as hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion and isolated limb infusion, intralesional therapies, and neo-adjuvant systemic therapy strategies for borderline resectable regional disease. Hyperthermic limb perfusion (HILP) and isolated limb infusion (ILI) are generally well-tolerated and have shown overall response rates between 44% and 90%. Intralesional therapies also appear to be well-tolerated as adverse events are usually limited to the site of injection and minor transient flu-like symptoms. Systemic targeted therapies have shown to have response rates up to 85% when used as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with borderline resectable disease. While combination immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting has also shown promising results, this data has not yet matured.","publish_time":"2019-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perez, Matthew C.; Tanabe, Kenneth K.; Ariyan, Charlotte E.; Miura, John T.; Mutabdzic, Dorotea; Farma, Jeffrey M.; Zager, Jonathan S.","journal":"Cutaneous Melanoma","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/82b9d1b7860dc00c588c4013a8ab11e6f1c77deb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123735.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123735/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs4NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["isolated limb infusion","hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion","Hyperthermic limb perfusion","recurrent locoregional disease","borderline resectable disease","isolated recurrences","borderline resectable regional disease","intralesional therapies","unresectable disease","advanced locoregional melanoma","regional perfusion procedures","neoadjuvant therapy","cutaneous melanoma","Systemic targeted therapies","patients","overall response rates","recurrent metastases","mainstay of treatment","neoadjuvant setting","neo-adjuvant systemic therapy strategies","multiple treatment modalities","HILP","minor transient flu","ILI","site of injection","natural history of local","promising results","adverse events","data","symptoms","combination immunotherapy","surgical resection","significant therapeutic challenge","chapter"],"language":"en"},

Dengue is endemic in over 140 countries in Asia, the USA, the Eastern Mediterranean, and Africa. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that there are more than 2.5 billion people\u2014mainly occurs in children living in tropical and subtropical countries\u2014at risk of dengue infection with one or more dengue viruses. There are estimated nearly 100 million symptomatic dengue infections occurring worldwide annually, nearly 75% in Asia and the Western Pacific region [1]. During the past decades, the outbreaks of dengue infection have been reported throughout the world with increased severity. Ecologic and demographic changes are considered to be the contributing factors to the emergence of dengue infection in the past decades. Dengue has expanded into new countries and into urban settings associated with increased distribution of A. aegypti, population growth, urbanization, development of slums, migration of population, movement of dengue virus by infected travelers, trade development, and improved diagnostic capabilities in medical practice [2, 3]. Increased transmission of dengue virus in tropical urban areas has been created by substandard housing and crowding as well as deterioration in water, sewer, and waste management systems, all of which are intimately associated with unplanned urbanization [4\u20137]. So it is likely that dengue will expand its geographic reach and become an increasing burden on health resources in affected areas during the next decade. An effective vector-control management is the only means to reduce dengue infection in endemic areas. Because vector control has achieved only limited success so far in reducing the transmission of dengue, the usage of effective dengue vaccine in target population along with the preventive measures already used such as raising public awareness may be the means to effectively control of this disease in endemic area [8].","publish_time":"2018-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tantawichien, Terapong; Thisayakorn, Usa","journal":"Neglected Tropical Diseases - South Asia","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b74a8407dad2df2aa75f399ba32759514005fac9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123783.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123783/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs4NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Eastern Mediterranean","Africa","Asia","Western Pacific"],"keyphrases":["dengue viruses","emergence of dengue infection","risk of dengue infection","outbreaks of dengue infection","movement of dengue virus","symptomatic dengue infections","Increased transmission of dengue virus","usage of effective dengue vaccine","endemic areas","vector control","tropical urban areas","effective vector-control management","target population","population growth","migration of population","Aedes aegypti","affected areas","subtropical countries","new countries","increased distribution of","Asia","past decades","increased severity","means","World Health Organization","trade development","development of slums","urban settings","single-stranded RNA virus","Aedes albopictus mosquito species","viral infections","health resources","important mosquito","unplanned urbanization","waste management systems","increasing burden","improved diagnostic capabilities","infected travelers","sewer","geographic reach","medical practice","water","children","contributing factors","Eastern Mediterranean","preventive measures","limited success","deterioration","Western Pacific region","substandard housing","disease","demographic changes","public awareness","Africa","people"],"language":"en"},

Understanding parasite dynamics for bats is important from a human public health perspective because of their role as natural reservoirs for recent high-profile emerging zoonotic pathogens (e.g. Ebola, Hendra) and from a bat conservation perspective because of the recent emergence of white-nose syndrome (WNS) in North America highlighting the potential population impacts of parasites and pathogens. Although some bat species are among the most gregarious of mammals, species vary widely in terms of their social behavior and this variation could influence pathogen transmission and impacts. Here, we review the literature on links between bat social behavior and parasite dynamics. Using standardized search terms in Web of Science, we identified articles that explicitly tested or discussed links between some aspect of bat sociality and parasite transmission or host population impacts. We identified social network analysis, epidemiological modeling, and interspecific comparative analyses as the most commonly used methods to quantify relationships between social behavior and parasite-risk in bats while WNS, Hendra virus, and arthropod ectoparasites were the most commonly studied host-parasite systems. We summarize known host-parasite relationships in these three systems and propose testable hypotheses that could improve our understanding of links between host sociality and parasite-dynamics in bats.","publish_time":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Webber, Quinn M.

Features of this concept such as its defeasibility make it well suited to reasoning in contexts of uncertainty.

The infections are commonly caused by helminths (e.g. Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and hookworm) and protozoa (e.g. Blastocystis hominis, Cryptosporidium sp., Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia duodenalis). Poor sanitation and poverty are some of the factors associated with IPIs. With the ever-increasing impact of IPIs, newer detection approaches have been developed and studied. The efficacy of diagnostic method is crucial to give an accurate identification of these parasites. Recent developments of diagnostic tools such as serology- and molecular-based assays are assisting the conventional method of microscopy in detecting and further confirming current or past infections and the specific species of parasites. Ongoing investigations in parasitic infections using these advanced tools will provide useful information that will enable the evaluation of the effectiveness of the current control program and thus, assist future planning for improved strategies in eradicating these parasitic infections.","publish_time":"2018-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Richard, Reena Leeba; Yusof, Hartini","journal":"Regional Conference on Science, Technology and Social Sciences (RCSTSS 2016)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb540e4ef71f546591f0a8c1823d6119eef34045.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121306.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121306/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs1MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["past infections","Intestinal parasitic infections","ever-increasing impact of IPIs","efficacy of diagnostic method","advanced tools","Recent developments of diagnostic tools","indigenous communities","various communities","current control program","conventional method of microscopy","specific species of parasites","Cryptosporidium","hookworm","protozoa","widespread public health concern","serology","Entamoeba histolytica","Trichuris trichiura","severe implications","Ascaris lumbricoides","Blastocystis hominis","improved strategies","molecular-based assays","newer detection approaches","future planning","evaluation","effectiveness","useful information","schoolchildren","helminths","Giardia duodenalis","accurate identification","Ongoing investigations","poverty","Poor sanitation","factors","numerous studies","countries"],"language":"en"},

Over the past two decades, biotechnological interventions, especially Bt proteins, have been successfully implemented across the world and have had major impacts on reducing chemical pesticide applications. As insects continue to adapt to insecticides, both chemical and protein-based, new methods, molecules, and modes of action are necessary to provide sustainable solutions. RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a significant tool to knock down or alter gene expression profiles in a species-specific manner. In the past decade, there has been intense research on RNAi applications in crop protection. This chapter looks at the current state of knowledge in the field and outlines the methodology, delivery methods, and precautions required in designing targets. Assessing the targeting of specific gene expression is also an important part of a successful RNAi strategy. The current literature on the use of RNAi in major orders of insect pests is reviewed, along with a perspective on the regulatory aspects of the approach. Risk assessment of RNAi would focus on molecular characterization, food/feed risk assessment, and environmental risk assessment. As more RNAi-based products come through regulatory systems, either via direct application or plant expression based, the impact of this approach on crop protection will become clearer.","publish_time":"2017-11-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alamalakala, Leela; Parimi, Srinivas; Patel, Navid; Char, Bharat","journal":"Trends in Insect Molecular Biology and Biotechnology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/49c063d6c5bc9cdd8c3e1479c0213e8ce4b0f68a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121382.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121382/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs1NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Risk assessment of RNAi","RNAi applications","use of RNAi","RNAi-based products","crop protection","successful RNAi strategy","feed risk assessment","environmental risk assessment","major impacts","major orders of insect pests","major focus area","gene expression profiles","plant expression","approach","targeting of specific gene expression","chemical pesticide applications","regulatory systems","new methods","regulatory aspects","delivery methods","current literature","past decade","current state of knowledge","molecular characterization","intense research","modes of action","biotechnological interventions","field","direct application","food","precautions","decades","methodology","molecules","species-specific manner","Bt proteins","sustainable solutions","insecticides","crops","chapter","perspective","world","significant tool","RNA interference","insects","targets"],"language":"en"},

The common imaging finding is usually as a lung infiltrate or consolidation of some type of distribution or another. Trying to find the putative cause for the imaging pattern is a good first step in narrowing the differential diagnosis and answering the question: what accounts for this pattern on imaging studies? Most of these diseases have an acute or subacute onset and exhibit restrictive pattern on pulmonary function tests. When treated promptly, they resolve completely with little or no residual injury to the lung architecture. On a small biopsy it is important to have a clinical history and imaging results before embarking on a descriptive rather than a definitive diagnosis. The smaller the sample, the more information is needed to complete the picture. Pulmonologists should be advised to target the part of the lung that should provide the most information related to the process under investigation. An endobronchial wall biopsy is not suitable in the setting of investigating a lung infiltrate as part of the alveolated lung has to be included.

Food safety management tools, including food legislation, national and international standards, quality management systems, risk analysis, risk-based inspections and controls, monitoring and alert systems for food contaminants and food-borne diseases, quantitative microbial risk assessment, nutrition and toxicology studies, and elaborate food processing technologies have brought to consumers in developed countries a wide selection of safe foods. Predictive and early warning and communication systems are being developed to increase the ability to \u201Cexpect the unexpected\u201D and take prevention measures before food hazards become real risks. The production, processing, transportation, storage and/or distribution stages of modern food supply chains remain exposed to various types of biological or chemical contaminants, as evidenced by recent events or crises. The prion/BSE, dioxin, acrylamide, melamine, bisphenol A cases, and the numerous pathogen outbreaks illustrate this exposure. The melamine story and the international traffic of counterfeited foods and drinks show that profit-motivated fraud and adulteration are rising threats, opening potential paths for terrorist actions. Recent food preservation, processing or packaging technologies and trends, in spite or because of their benefits (mild treatment, extended product shelf-life, \u201Cfresher\u201D quality, RTE pre-cooked convenience) also bring safety risks at the consumer level: incomplete microbial inactivation, possible non respect of adequate storage conditions and expiration dates, undercooking, and generation of stress-resistant micro-organisms. Innovative technologies, such as the use of nanoparticules in foods or food contact materials, and the development of active, intelligent or sustainable food packaging entail uncertainties and safety concerns. Natural disasters, droughts, floods, conflicts, and poverty often lead to emergency situations requiring large assistance operations with complex logistics and specific meals ready-to-eat or nutrient-supplemented foods. Containerised food processing units that could be deployed and quickly set to operate in \u00ADproduction-disrupted areas are being developed by the World Food Programme. Other strategies against food insecurity include insurance policies for crop failures and renting of agricultural lands abroad. Citizen perception of food safety risks and the EU consumers\u2019 \u201Cright to informed choice\u201D explain why some technologies elicit rejection: ionising irradiation of foods, hormonal and antibiotic treatment of animals, the use of various \u201C\u00ADartificial\u201D food additives, genetically modified crops and ingredients, cloned animals. Perceived benefits responding to consumers\u2019 needs (healthier, more nutritive, higher quality, more convenient, lower cost), \u201Cnaturalness\u201D, respect of the environment and trusted information are the major factors influencing consumers\u2019 acceptance of innovative food technologies and products. Novel foods and technologies are also subject to strict regulatory pre-market safety assessment and authorisation procedures. While necessary for protection against unexpected risks, some of these rules serve as barriers to innovation and trade, and fodder for strong political debates.","publish_time":"2011-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheftel, J.

Forensics is one such field, where tracing the leftover evidence on a crime scene can lead to the identification and prosecution of the culprit. When leftover microbes in the biological material or objects used by the culprit or the person in question are used to correlate the identity of the individual, it takes us to the new field of science\u2014\u201Cmicrobial forensics.\u201D Technological advances in the field of forensics, molecular biology, and microbiology have all helped to refine the techniques of collecting and processing of the samples for microbiological identification using DNA-based methods followed by its inference in the form of evidence.

Once established, this technique would facilitate accurate identification and differentiation of an individual or suspect to guide investigations along with conventional evidence.

Multi-organ disorders, active malignancy, and specific active infection are general agreed upon contraindications. Only 21% of organ donors had suitable lungs for transplant. Although immunosuppressive regimens vary, most lung transplant centers use induction to avoid early acute rejection. The postoperative period is not only crucial for early detection of complications, such as infections and rejection, but also in the long term when gastrointestinal and neurological complications may compromise up to 50% of the patients. One year survival rate is around 85%, and 3 year survival is around 65%.

Healthcare workers are also at risk of acquiring nosocomial viral infections, affecting their own health, as well as facilitating spread of the infection to other patients, their family, and the community. Healthcare-associated viral infections may occur in a variety of healthcare settings, including clinics, emergency centers, urgent care centers, procedure suites, operating rooms, hospital wards, nurseries, and intensive care units. In addition, non-patient care areas, such as the cafeteria, waiting areas, and playrooms may also be a source of viral infections that can spread in the healthcare setting. These infections may be device-related or transmitted via blood products or organ donation and respiratory droplets, through food including human milk, person to person, or via air ducts, fomites, and surfaces. They most commonly involve the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts; however, all organ systems may potentially be involved. Both DNA and RNA viruses, either common or exotic, may contribute to healthcare-associated viral infections. Advances in molecular viral diagnostics have enabled rapid detection and routine surveillance for viral infections and now allow early identification of viruses. Prompt identification allows timely containment measures to minimize transmission to other patients or healthcare workers and avoids hospital, community, and global outbreaks.","publish_time":"2018-07-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Demmler-Harrison, Gail J.","journal":"Healthcare-Associated Infections in Children","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db9afaa302dcdb85b08c3b28e5f168e6a33121a3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121921.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121921/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs4MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nosocomial viral infections","source of viral infections","Healthcare workers","increased healthcare costs","variety of healthcare settings","molecular viral diagnostics","urgent care centers","person","non-patient care areas","patients","community","intensive care units","early identification of viruses","emergency centers","hospital wards","patient morbidity","respiratory droplets","organ donation","Prompt identification","RNA viruses","organ systems","facilitating spread","procedure suites","operating rooms","rapid detection","mortality","nurseries","prolonged hospitalization","clinics","major contributors","blood products","food","transmission","human milk","timely containment measures","routine surveillance","risk","pediatric age groups","air ducts","exotic","cafeteria","addition","gastrointestinal tracts","device-related","fomites","surfaces","DNA","playrooms","family","global outbreaks","Advances"],"language":"en"},

It may have a cardiovascular or a non-cardiovascular origin, the latter including pulmonary parenchymal diseases. Depending on the cause, it may be associated with fever, cough, hemoptysis, and/or chest pain, with a duration of symptoms that can range from hours to days. Prompt identification of the underlying cause of acute dyspnea is essential in guiding appropriate therapy and management, as patients may rapidly progress to acute respiratory failure. Evaluation with chest radiography is vital for initial assessment and may reveal diffuse parenchymal abnormalities, which may require further assessment with computed tomography (HRCT). Acute non-infectious parenchymal lung diseases are often overlooked and may be under-diagnosed. Their diagnosis requires the evaluation, along with the HRCT pattern, of the clinical and laboratory features and of the bronchoalveolar lavage. Biopsy may be necessary in more complex cases. Although the most frequent cause of diffuse non-infectious parenchymal lung involvement is acute hydrostatic pulmonary edema, there is a wide variety of diseases that may be encountered, including acute drug toxicity, hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). In trauma patients, fat embolism syndrome (FES) must be taken into account. Acute respiratory failure is an eventuality that can occur during the course of chronic lung diseases (UIP for example), which may have been unknown until then.","publish_time":"2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dalpiaz, G.; Piolanti, M.","journal":"Emergency Radiology of the Chest and Cardiovascular System","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b3b6eaa764a55c902558fd554df28b885496eeef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121959.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121959/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs4NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute respiratory failure","Acute non-infectious parenchymal lung diseases","acute respiratory distress syndrome","underlying cause of acute dyspnea","acute drug toxicity","pulmonary parenchymal diseases","acute hydrostatic pulmonary edema","diffuse parenchymal abnormalities","frequent cause of diffuse non-infectious parenchymal lung involvement","course of chronic lung diseases","wide variety of diseases","Evaluation","diffuse alveolar hemorrhage","emergency room","emergency medicine","initial assessment","trauma patients","chest radiography","chest pain","HRCT pattern","fat embolism syndrome","non-cardiovascular origin","HP","ARDS","hypersensitivity pneumonitis","common presenting complaint","appropriate therapy","FES","UIP","laboratory features","intensive care","hemoptysis","management","example","eventuality","Prompt identification","bronchoalveolar lavage","duration of symptoms","DAH","computed tomography","complex cases","hours","Biopsy","fever","cough","days","account","diagnosis"],"language":"en"},

It is also involved in the regulation of different genes and cellular functions, particularly in the context of inflammation, regeneration and immune control. Conversely, vitamin D deficiency which is often found in chronic, infectious and inflammatory diseases is thought to drive or enhance uncontrolled inflammation. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the airways most often because of cigarette smoking. It has been recognized that repetitive airway infections and systemic consequences or co-morbidities also contribute to the progressive nature of COPD. Vitamin D deficiency is known to sneak in from the early stages of COPD, to become highly prevalent at the more severe stages, and may thereby catalyse airway infection, inflammation and systemic consequences. Undoubtedly, vitamin D deficiency enhances bone resorption and osteoporosis in COPD for which appropriate vitamin D supplementation is recommended. However, conflicting evidence has emerged on the extra-calcemic effects of vitamin D in COPD. A recent intervention trial with high-dose supplementation in COPD was only able to reduce exacerbation frequency in the subgroup of patients with lowest baseline vitamin D levels. It confirms that severe vitamin D deficiency is a health hazard but that more clinical and experimental studies are needed to explore how vitamin D deficiency may affect airway biology and systemic effects in the context of smoke-induced lung diseases.","publish_time":"2012-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Janssens, Wim; Lehouck, An; Decramer, Marc; Gayan-Ramirez, Ghislaine","journal":"Vitamin D and the Lung","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62884a459ed22441eceda3b3c041e4f8ca3803e8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121988.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121988/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs4NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe vitamin D deficiency","appropriate vitamin D supplementation","extra-calcemic effects of vitamin D","lowest baseline vitamin D levels","chronic inflammation","context of inflammation","early stages of COPD","progressive nature of COPD","systemic consequences","systemic effects","uncontrolled inflammation","airway biology","severe stages","repetitive airway infections","context of smoke","bone resorption","bone homeostasis","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","inflammatory diseases","high-dose supplementation","induced lung diseases","subgroup of patients","osteoporosis","co-morbidities","health hazard","important regulator of calcium","cellular functions","recent intervention trial","exacerbation frequency","regulation of different genes","regeneration","airways","immune control","experimental studies","conflicting evidence","cigarette smoking"],"language":"en"},

The number of transplants performed worldwide has been increasing for several years until recently. ITx has recently become a valid therapeutic option with a graft survival rate between 80 % and 90 % at 1 year, in experienced centers. These results have been achieved due to a combination of several factors: better understanding of the pathophysiology of intestinal graft, improved immunosuppression techniques, more efficient strategies for the monitoring of the bowel graft, as well as control of infectious complications and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). In fact, this procedure is associated with a relatively high rate of complications, such as infections, acute rejection, graft versus host disease (GVHD), and PTLD, if compared to the transplantation of other organs. These complications may be, at least in part, the consequence of the peculiarity of this graft, which contains gut-associated lymphoid tissue and potentially pathogenic enteric flora. Furthermore, in these patients, the existing disease and the relative malnutrition could predispose them to infectious complications. Additionally, other factors associated with the procedure, such as laparotomy, preservation injury, abnormal motility, and lymphatic disruption, could all be implicated in the development of complications.","publish_time":"2013-09-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tuveri, Massimiliano; Pisu, Salvatore; Cicalese, Luca","journal":"Living Donor Advocacy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/405888623bb1a5010775cc93c9f40d3efdfe3e83.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122154.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122154/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs5NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of complications","pathophysiology of intestinal graft","bowel graft","control of infectious complications","high rate of complications","graft survival rate","Intestinal transplantation","life-threatening complications of irreversible intestinal failure","host disease","existing disease","patients","PTLD","ITx","procedure","factors","posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease","improved immunosuppression techniques","abnormal motility","TPN","physiologic alternative","total parenteral nutrition","efficient strategies","better understanding","acute rejection","valid therapeutic option","lymphoid tissue","preservation injury","laparotomy","infections","relative malnutrition","pathogenic enteric flora","monitoring","GVHD","lymphatic disruption","combination","gut","experienced centers","consequence","peculiarity","number of transplants","organs","years","results"],"language":"en"},

The role of nanomaterials is rapidly increasing in many aspects of everyday life. This is promoting a wide range of research needs related to both the design of new materials with required properties and performing a comprehensive risk assessment of the manufactured nanoparticles. The development of nanoscience also opens new areas for QSAR modelers. We have begun this contribution with a detailed discussion on the remarkable physical\u2013chemical properties of nanomaterials and their specific toxicities. Both these factors should be considered as potential endpoints for further nano-QSAR studies. Then, we have highlighted the status and research needs in the area of molecular descriptors applicable to nanomaterials. Finally, we have put together currently available nano-QSAR models related to the physico-chemical endpoints of nanoparticles and their activity. Although we have observed many problems (i.e., a lack of experimental data, insufficient and inadequate descriptors), we do believe that application of QSAR methodology will significantly support nanoscience in the near future.

In addition, national guidance on proper waste disposal techniques was not well developed. As a result, there were many instances where hazardous waste was not disposed of properly, such as the Love Canal environmental pollution incident. This incident led to the passage of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976. This act gave the United States Environmental Protection Agency regulatory control of all stages of the hazardous waste management cycle. Presently, numerous federal agencies provide guidance on methods and approaches used to evaluate potential health effects and assess risks from contaminated source media, i.e., soil, air, and water. These agencies also establish standards of exposure or health benchmark values in the different media, which are not expected to produce environmental or human health impacts. The risk assessment methodology is used by various regulatory agencies using the following steps: i) hazard identification; ii) dose-response (quantitative) assessment; iii) exposure assessment; iv) risk characterization. The overall objectives of risk assessment are to balance risks and benefits; to set target levels; to set priorities for program activities at regulatory agencies, industrial or commercial facilities, or environmental and consumer organizations; and to estimate residual risks and extent of risk reduction. The chapter will provide information on the concepts used in estimating risk and hazard due to exposure to ground and surface waters contaminated from the recycling of hazardous waste and/or hazardous waste materials for each of the steps in the risk assessment process. Moreover, this chapter will provide examples of contaminated water exposure pathway calculations as well as provide information on current guidelines, databases, and resources such as current drinking water standards, health advisories, and ambient water quality criteria. Finally, specific examples of contaminants released from recycled hazardous waste materials and case studies evaluating the human health effects due to contamination of ground and surface waters from recycled hazardous waste materials will be provided and discussed.","publish_time":"2005-07-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rodriguez-Proteau, Rosita; Grant, Roberta L.","journal":"Water Pollution","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e7953b1634ae1f0c4754dee3845162a53e9dd4eb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122228/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs5ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["United States Environmental Protection Agency"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hazardous waste spills","recycling of hazardous waste","recycled hazardous waste materials","hazardous waste management cycle","ground water","exposure assessment","risk assessment methodology","risk assessment process","estimating risk","risk characterization","transport of hazardous chemicals","overall objectives of risk assessment","health advisories","human health effects","standards of exposure","examples of contaminated water exposure pathway calculations","current drinking water standards","proper waste disposal techniques","various regulatory agencies","potential health effects","human health impacts","extent of risk reduction","surface waters","health benchmark values","ambient water quality criteria","contamination of ground","residual risks","numerous federal agencies","contaminated source media","information","chapter","Love Canal environmental pollution incident","United States Environmental Protection Agency regulatory control","national guidance","following steps","current guidelines","Recovery Act","different media","hazard identification","specific examples of contaminants","stages","case studies","resources","commercial facilities","methods","priorities","approaches","program activities","Resource Conservation","fate","consumer organizations","databases","soil","landfills","dose-response","target levels","passage","RCRA","addition","benefits","concepts","principles","air","instances","result"],"language":"en"},

GP is a class I fusion protein that forms trimeric spikes composed of heterodimers of the subunits GP1 and GP2. GP1 and GP2 are derived from the precursor pre-GP by furin cleavage during exocytosis. GP1 contains a receptor-binding core topped by a glycan cap and a heavily glycosylated mucin-like domain, while GP2 contains a fusion loop and a membrane anchor. After entering cells by macropinocytosis, the glycan cap and the mucin-like domain are removed from GP1 by endosomal cathepsins B and L exposing the binding site for the Niemann-Pick C1 receptor. It appears that there is no strict requirement for specific proteases involved in GP processing. Thus, furin is not indispensible for GP1-2 cleavage, and GP1 may be trimmed not only by cathepsins B and L but also by other endosomal proteases. Two soluble glycoproteins of Ebola virus are also processed by host proteases. A significant amount of GP1,2 is cleaved by the metalloprotease TACE and shed from the surface of infected cells (GP1,2 delta).

Numerous studies in preclinical models of BPD and PH have demonstrated that therapies based on mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) can resolve pulmonary inflammation and ameliorate the severity of disease. Recent evidence suggests that novel, cell-free approaches based on MSC-derived exosomes (MEx) might represent a compelling therapeutic alternative offering major advantages over treatments based on MSC transplantation. Here, we will discuss the development of MSC-based therapies, stressing the centrality of paracrine action as the actual vector of MSC therapeutic functionality, focusing on MEx. We will briefly present our current understanding of the biogenesis and secretion of MEx, and discuss potential mechanisms by which they afford such beneficial effects, including immunomodulation and restoration of homeostasis in diseased states. We will also review ongoing clinical trials using MSCs as treatment for BPD that pave the way for bringing cell-free, MEx-based therapeutics from the bench to the NICU setting.","publish_time":"2019-08-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yeung, Vincent; Willis, Gareth R.; Taglauer, Elizabeth; Mitsialis, S.

Viruses show characteristic infectivity, virulence and pathogenicity.

The physical, chemical and biological environment operates on the virus itself and may also alter the host biological or behavioral response. Viral infections have incubation periods lasting days or weeks, while their pathologic sequelae may not manifest for years or decades. Likewise the degree or intensity of host response and clinical expression may range from largely inapparent to highly lethal. The degree of cell, tissue and organ specificity is high. Common syndromes involve the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and central nervous systems, the liver, and mucocutaneous surfaces. Vertical transmission may produce a variety of congenital and perinatal conditions. Viruses spread by multiple modes, using nearly every bodily surface or fluid as a route of exit or entry, either by direct contact or indirectly through an animal vector or other inanimate vehicle. Different viral Infections occur nearly ubiquitously or sporadically; they may be present continuously throughout a population (endemic) or occur in seasonal rhythm or in unexpectedly explosive form (epidemic). Many viruses are refractory to all known therapeutic agents, while for a few, the increasing number of highly effective agents holds great promise. Vaccines have produced many historical successes including the ultimate goal of eradication, but many viral infections continue to elude effective vaccine development.

We review here the fascinating history of HLCC and of biocontainment units and make recommendations regarding those highly hazardous communicable diseases that might optimally be managed in these units.","publish_time":"2018-07-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cieslak, Theodore J.; Herstein, Jocelyn J.; Kortepeter, Mark G.","journal":"Bioemergency Planning","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5a641525854d41bba9c07824ba6a47803f83996.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122591.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122591/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsxODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HLCC"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["employment of HLCC units","HLCC capacity","specialized biocontainment units","hazardous communicable diseases","specific diseases","fascinating history of HLCC","Ebola virus disease outbreak","personnel controls","nosocomial disease transmission","High-level containment care","additional safeguards","conventional airborne infection isolation rooms","unique collection of engineering","management of patients","recommendations","United States","process","convergence of events","nations"],"language":"en"},

The compulsory licensing measure can be effective in dealing with situations inhibiting access to medicines, for example when a patent holder fails to use the patent in the granting country or when he or she maintains artificially high prices for patented articles. Despite the significant international development, it remains to be seen how the flexibility margins provided by the TRIPS provisions can be used as safeguards to protect public health interests of the poor countries. Effective mechanisms are also required to support countries that are unable to make effective use of compulsory licensing due to the inefficiency of manufacturing capacity. This chapter examines the problem of using the legal mechanism of compulsory licensing by developing countries. It looks at Thailand\u2019s experiences with the use of compulsory licensing to increase access to medicines. Since the majority of compulsory licences issued around the world are related to pharmaceutical patents, the chapter highlights the use of compulsory licensing in the context of a range of public health responses. It first discusses the use by Thailand of the compulsory government use licensing to increase access to medicines. It also examines international rules on compulsory licensing, including the provisions of the Paris Convention, the TRIPS Agreement, and the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health. Finally, the chapter discusses various legal issues under the Thai Patent Act regarding the compulsory licensing provisions. It also highlights the possible impact, in a broad sense, of the use of legal mechanisms such as compulsory licensing, which aims to effectively maintain fair market competition and dilute the monopoly power of the patent holder.","publish_time":"2014-07-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuanpoth, Jakkrit","journal":"Compulsory Licensing","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dd80a99fe81fcb9c754a7940599c886156c73349.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122632.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122632/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsyMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Public Health"],"locations":["Thailand"],"keyphrases":["compulsory licensing provisions","effective use of compulsory licensing","compulsory licensing measure","compulsory government use licensing","legal mechanism of compulsory licensing","majority of compulsory licences","use of legal mechanisms","TRIPS Agreement","TRIPS provisions","patent holder","access","medicines","chapter","poor countries","Effective mechanisms","public health interests","Thai Patent Act","range of public health responses","various legal issues","international rules","significant international development","context","monopoly power","Doha Declaration","national intellectual property law","safeguards","broad sense","world","Paris Convention","force","example","fair market competition","pharmaceutical patents","Thailand\u2019s experiences","high prices","patented articles","possible impact","inefficiency of manufacturing capacity","problem","flexibility margins","WTO","situations","granting country"],"language":"en"},

The most common and dangerous complication that can develop post surgery/trauma is infection caused by opportunistic pathogens, which pose a significant challenge to the healing process ([1]). In addition to interference with the healing process and direct damage to infected tissues caused by the infecting organism, systemic complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and acute renal failure (ARF) can develop. These complications significantly exacerbate a patient\u2019s already deteriorating health and increase recovery times that correlate directly with increased mortality.

Many platelet-derived inhibitors have been identified but not fully characterised and so questions remain regarding the mechanisms that underlie the effects on platelet activity following their activation, inhibition or genetic disruption. However, dysregulation of inhibitory signals is believed to contribute to enhanced risk of thrombosis in diseases such as diabetes and other pathological conditions. In this chapter we have described platelet-derived inhibitors of platelet function that are secreted by or expressed within platelets themselves to provide inhibition or negative regulation to the processes that underpin activation.","publish_time":"2017-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Unsworth, A.

Thoracic radiation as well as cancer pharmacotherapeutics, including conventional chemotherapy, molecular targeted agents, and cancer immunotherapies, have been associated with a unique spectrum of histopathologic injury patterns that may involve the lung parenchyma, pleura, airways, and/or pulmonary vasculature. Injury patterns may be idiosyncratic, unpredictable, and highly variable from one agent class to the next. Variability in lung injury patterns within a specific therapeutic class of drugs also occurs, adding to the conundrum. Drug-induced toxicities to the thoracic cavity are infrequent, and early recognition of clinical clues portends a good outcome in most cases. Failure to recognize early clinical signs, however, may result in irreversible and potentially lethal consequences. This chapter provides an overview of our current knowledge of thoracic complications associated with cancer pharmacotherapies. The review is not intended to be a treatise of all cancer agents that adversely affect the lungs, but rather a discussion of established risk factors and histopathologic patterns of lung injury associated with broad classes of cancer agents. Optimal management strategies, based on existing clinical experience, will also be discussed. Complications associated with thoracic radiation are also reviewed. It is hoped that these discussions will facilitate early recognition and management of treatment-related thoracic complications and, ultimately, better patient outcomes.","publish_time":"2019-07-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shannon, Vickie R.","journal":"Oncologic Critical Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dd50d11f2e14a75346c9e208e70bbcc9ceb77264.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123056.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123056/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs0MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung injury patterns","cancer pharmacotherapeutics","cancer therapeutics","cancer immunotherapies","cancer pharmacotherapies","histopathologic patterns of lung injury","Thoracic radiation","thoracic cavity","related thoracic complications","broad classes of cancer agents","successful cancer therapy","unique spectrum of histopathologic injury patterns","lung parenchyma","current knowledge of thoracic complications","early recognition of clinical clues","clinical signs","molecular targeted agents","existing clinical experience","management of treatment","agent class","Optimal management strategies","specific therapeutic class of drugs","conventional chemotherapy","discussion of established risk factors","limiting factor","airways","good outcome","overview","Drug-induced toxicities","better patient outcomes","pleura","discussions","lungs","Variability","lethal consequences","pulmonary vasculature","cases","chapter","Failure","treatise","conundrum","review"],"language":"en"},

This short review was aimed to systematically discuss methodological principles of a small number of existing techniques and understand their advantages and disadvantages. Existing epidemiological methods have been mostly limited to a single-and-brief exposure setting, while the application to human-to-human transmissible disease epidemic with stochastic dependence structure in the observed case data has remained to be a statistical challenge. In veterinary applications, a large-scale sampling for laboratory testing has been commonly adapted to substantiate a freedom from disease, but such study has only accounted for binomial sampling process in estimating the error probability of elimination. Surveillance and mathematical modeling are two complementary instruments in the toolbox of epidemiologists. Combining their strengths would be highly beneficial to better define the end of an epidemic.","publish_time":"2016-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nishiura, Hiroshi","journal":"Mathematical and Statistical Modeling for Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/34f138e39337da19b45e22d8bdfa9c633be44b39.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123060.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123060/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs0MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human transmissible disease epidemic","surveillance","Existing epidemiological methods","laboratory methods","infectious disease control activities","large-scale sampling","laboratory testing","binomial sampling process","small number of existing techniques","stochastic dependence structure","downgrading alert level","restoring healthcare workers\u2019","forthcoming changes","complementary instruments","observed case data","shift","brief exposure setting","methodological principles","mathematical modeling","study","error probability of elimination","veterinary applications","toolbox of epidemiologists","practical importance","disadvantages","freedom","short review","statistical challenge","strengths"],"language":"en"},

By examining the policy implications of the key narratives around public health, animal health and trade, it becomes possible to clarify the relationship between global understandings of infectious disease risk and their impact on the development of local responses to disease problems. We highlight the tensions that resource-constrained countries face in the nexus of animal health-public health and trade, including the perception that resource-constrained countries are both source and victims of potential infectious disease threats. Given this scenario, it is important to think about how developing countries, particularly those in Sub-Saharan Africa, can approach infectious disease risk management as it relates to pandemic scale threats such as avian and pandemic influenza. We outline some of the key considerations in defining and assessing disease risk using avian and pandemic influenza in Zambia as an example. We conclude that the key to the feasibility of the analysis of the risk of multi-sectoral affecting emerging infectious diseases such as zoonotic avian influenza is flexibility in how risk is framed across the public health, animal health and trade systems.","publish_time":"2016-06-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mwacalimba, Kennedy","journal":"International Farm Animal, Wildlife and Food Safety Law","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/84410afd000e3ba812045fe85c3484997701e2e5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123115.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123115/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs0NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Sub-Saharan Africa","Zambia"],"keyphrases":["infectious disease risk management","understandings of infectious disease problems","global understandings of infectious disease risk","nexus of animal health-public health","internationalized representations of infectious disease threats","victims of potential infectious disease threats","pandemic influenza","developing countries","resource-constrained countries","zoonotic avian influenza","risk of multi-sectoral affecting emerging infectious diseases","pandemic scale threats","trade systems","key narratives","Sub-Saharan Africa","key considerations","profound implications","policy implications","impact","development of local responses","analysis","relationship","perception","era of globalization","Zambia","flexibility","example","feasibility","tensions","scenario"],"language":"en"},

There has always been a problem of arriving at a consensus in the definition of the term: postoperative liver failure (PLF). The burgeoning rate of living donor liver transplants, with lives of perfectly healthy donors involved, has mandated a consensual definition, uniform diagnosis and protocol for management of PLF. The absence of a uniform definition has led to poor comparison among various trials. PLF remains a dreaded complication in resection of the liver, with a reported incidence of up to 8 % [1], and mortality rates of up to 30\u201370 % have been quoted [2].

So far a lot of supermolecules as chemical drugs have been widely used in clinics. Supermolecules as chemical drugs, i.e. supramolecular chemical drugs or supramolecular drugs, which might have the excellences of lower cost, shorter period, higher potential as clinical drugs for their successful research and development, may possess higher bioavailability, better biocompatibility and drug-targeting, fewer multidrug-resistances, lower toxicity, less adverse effect, and better curative effects as well as safety, and therefore exhibit wide potential application.

With the aim of studying the biological functions of HPV16 HBE7, the transforming potential of HPV16 HBE7 in NIH/3T3 cells was detected through observation of cell morphology, cell prolieration assay and anchorage-independent growth assay. The effect of HPV16 HBE7 on cell cycle was examined by flow cytometry.

The spike protein of SARS-CoV consists of S1 and S2 domains, which are responsible for virus binding and fusion, respectively. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) positioned in S1 can specifically bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on target cells, and ACE2 regulates the balance between vasoconstrictors and vasodilators within the heart and kidneys. Here, a recombinant fusion protein containing 193-amino acid RBD (residues 318\u2013510) and glutathione S-transferase were prepared for binding to target cells. Additionally, monoclonal RBD antibodies were prepared to confirm RBD binding to target cells through ACE2. We first confirmed that ACE2 was expressed in various mouse cells such as heart, lungs, spleen, liver, intestine, and kidneys using a commercial ACE2 polyclonal antibody. We also confirmed that the mouse fibroblast (NIH3T3) and human embryonic kidney cell lines (HEK293) expressed ACE2. We finally demonstrated that recombinant RBD bound to ACE2 on these cells using a cellular enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoassay. These results can be applied for future research to treat ACE2-related diseases and SARS.","publish_time":"2014-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Hyun; Hong, Yeongjin; Shibayama, Keigo; Suzuki, Yasuhiko; Wakamiya, Nobutaka; Kim, Youn Uck","journal":"Genes Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b23503d8506882ea3e3e90c80f86e1ebaac1ffa6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7097624.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7097624/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjsyNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RBD binding","target cells","recombinant RBD","ACE2-related diseases","commercial ACE2 polyclonal antibody","various mouse cells","virus binding","SARS coronavirus","amino acid RBD","spike protein of SARS","monoclonal RBD antibodies","heart","kidneys","CoV","receptor-binding domain","S1","recombinant fusion protein","mouse fibroblast","cellular enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","human embryonic kidney cell lines","NIH3T3","HEK293","lungs","intestine","liver","S2 domains","future research","immunoassay","spleen","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","vasodilators","residues","vasoconstrictors","balance","glutathione S-transferase","angiotensin","results"],"language":"en"},

A longstanding approach to understanding such processes has been the social amplification of risk framework. But this implies that some true level of risk becomes distorted in social actors\u2019 perceptions. Many risk events are characterised by such uncertainties, disagreements and changes in scientific knowledge that it becomes unreasonable to speak of a true level of risk. The most we can often say in such cases is that different groups believe each other to be either amplifying or attenuating a risk. This inherent subjectivity raises the question as to whether risk managers can expect any particular kinds of outcome to emerge. This question is the basis for a case study of zoonotic disease outbreaks using systems dynamics as a modelling medium. The model shows that processes suggested in the social amplification of risk framework produce polarised risk responses among different actors, but that the subjectivity magnifies this polarisation considerably. As this subjectivity takes more complex forms it leaves problematic residues at the end of a disease outbreak, such as an indefinite drop in economic activity and an indefinite increase in anxiety.","publish_time":"2012-07-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Busby, J S; Onggo, S","journal":"J Oper Res Soc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a8ec1b4be27a8206c71763548901bbc11421540.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7099211.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7099211/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjsyNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["risk managers","risk events","true level of risk","social amplification of risk framework","polarised risk responses","social processes","social actors\u2019 perceptions","question","inherent subjectivity","indefinite drop","indefinite increase","different actors","different groups","case study of zoonotic disease outbreaks","systems dynamics","economic activity","uncertainties","scientific knowledge","problematic residues","disagreements","changes","end","basis","complex forms","modelling medium","particular kinds of outcome","anxiety","cases","longstanding approach","central problem","polarisation"],"language":"en"},

Microgrooves were fabricated with a truncated V-shape in cross-section at 15/3.5, 30/10, and 60/10 \u03BCm (width/depth) by photolithography. Subsequent acid etching was applied to the entire surface of the fabricated Ti substratum to generate etched microgrooves and ridges (designated as E15/3.5, E30/10, and E60/10). Both smooth and acidetched-only Ti were used as controls (designated as NE0 and E0). Large-scale gene expression analyses were performed using differential display PCR, and the results were confirmed using RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR. Of the 21 genes with altered expression determined by differential display PCR and sequencing, we verified through RT-PCR that MTDH and TIMP1 were up-regulated and TGF-\u03B21, TPM1, and VIM were down-regulated in the HGFs cultured on E60/10 versus NE0. We also confirmed, by quantitative real-time PCR, that MTDH and TIMP1 expression in HGFs on E60/10 was significantly up-regulated compared to HGFs on the other Ti substrata.

However, data on these outcomes have been reported by relatively few centers. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of allogenic HSCT recipients age \u226518 years at Oregon Health and Science University Hospital (OHSU) between 2010\u20132015. During the study period, OHSU standard practice was to preemptively treat CMV-viremic patients (quantitative PCR assay \u2265 200 copies/mL or consecutive PCR assays \u003C200 copies/mL) with first-line valganciclovir or ganciclovir and second line foscarnet if there were contraindications to first-line agents. Study data were collected from an electronic health record repository and local Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) database. Primary outcomes were clinical manifestations of CMV disease, death, and cause of death within 1 year of transplant. RESULTS: Among 409 HSCT recipients, mean age was 53 (standard deviation: 13) years and 41% were female. 192 (47%) patients had CMV viremia and the median (interquartile range) time to CMV reactivation was 42 (31\u201353) days (Figure 1). Patients with acute myeloid leukemia were significantly less likely to have CMV reactivation (39% vs. 55%, P \u003C 0.01) and those with myelodysplastic syndromes had a non-significantly higher risk (24% vs. 17%, P = 0.06). 4 (1%) patients had a documented clinical manifestation of CMV disease (3 pneumonia and 1 pancreatitis). One-year mortality was 36% (148/409); there was no significant difference in mortality (37.5% vs. 35.0%, P = 0.60) or cause of death (P = 0.30) between patients with and without CMV reactivation (Figure 2). The most frequent causes of death among CMV viremic patients were recurrent/persistent disease (35%), acute graft vs. host disease (GVHD) (22%), infection (19%), and chronic GVHD (11%). CMV was documented as the primary cause of death for 2 patients. CONCLUSION: Nearly half of HSCT recipients had CMV reactivation and more than a third died within one year of transplant. However, incidence of CMV disease was rare and reactivation was not associated with increased mortality. Further study is needed to identify risk factors for CMV reactivation, infection and mortality in this population. DISCLOSURES: J. P.

Despite this, there is scant literature addressing the topic. We aimed to describe demographic characteristics, type of infection, healthcare utilization, disposition and outcomes among patients hospitalized for IDU-related infection over a multi-year period at a large tertiary care referral center in Boston, MA. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients hospitalized for IDU-related infection from 1/1/2012-9/30/2015. 901 charts were initially identified using administrative codes; 234 met the following inclusion criteria: 1) hospitalization within the study period for treatment of \u22651 of 6 selected infections and 2) IDU within 6-months preceding qualifying hospitalization. During the study period, 234 patients had 488 cumulative admissions. Admissions for IDU-related infection and \u226430-day readmission, all-cause, underwent detailed abstraction (N = 338; 69%). RESULTS: Of 234 patients, over half were male (57%; N = 134), 78% white (N = 183), 17% homeless (N = 37), 88% had public insurance (N = 210); 53% had a history of Hepatitis C infection (N = 124), most with untreated or unknown infection status (86%; N = 107). Average age was 38 (range 18-75). Fifty-eight percent (N = 136) of patients had one admission during the study period, the remainder had between 2-13 (mean = 3.6). Sentinel admission infection types were 1) skin and soft tissue (SSTI) N = 111 (42%), 2) endocarditis N = 70 (30%), 3) bone and joint N = 26 (10%), 4) pyogenic spinal N = 39 (15%), 5) isolated bacteremia N = 9 (3%) 6) and acute viral hepatitis N = 8 (3%). Of 338 admissions, 57% (N = 192) included infectious disease consultation; 50% resulted in discharge to another facility and 82% (excluding isolated SSTI) required multi-week intravenous antibiotics on discharge. By 15-months following the study period, 12% were deceased (N = 28); 5 died during hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Our study describes the characteristics of patients hospitalized with IDU-related infection over a multi-year period in a region highly impacted by the opioid epidemic. High rates of hospital readmission, prolonged antibiotic therapy and out-of- hospital death were common in this young cohort.

GIS/GPS-assisted methods provide a promising alternative, but these methods need further improvement. We established a stratified 3-stage GIS/GPS-assisted sampling method in which residential areas of a target population are divided into mutually exclusive cells \u2013 geographic units (geounits) as the primary sampling frame (PSF). Geounits with residential households were randomly selected from the PSF with a semi-automatic algorithm implemented in R. Novel methods were used to sample households and participants. Simulations and application studies indicated adequate feasibility, efficiency and validity of the method in sampling rural-to-urban migrants from a large city with complex residential arrangements. With this method, researchers can determine sample size and number of geounits, households and participants to be sampled; optimally allocate geounits; determine area size of sampled geounits and estimate sample weights; and complete sampling for field data collection in a short period. Our method adds an integrative approach for GIS/GPS-assisted random sampling with a de facto population assumption. Additional evaluation studies are needed to assess the utility of this method in different settings.","publish_time":"2018-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Xinguang; Hu, Hui; Xu, Xiaohui; Gong, Jie; Yan, Yaqiong; Li, Fang","journal":"J Surv Stat Methodol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/22aed3c49261e9b93a38aa05690558da3ca2764d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107540.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107540/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs0MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["R.

A total of 466 mixed gender commercial piglets from a breed-to-wean sow farm were enrolled. Piglets were alternately assigned by birth order within a litter to four umbilical treatment groups; iodine (2%), Zurex umbilical dip, a dry dip created using an antibacterial peptide (nisin) mixed with talc (formulation concentration = 3.105 g nisin/100 g talc on a wt/wt basis), and no treatment. At birth, stall conditions (wet/dry and clean/dirty) were evaluated on a 3 point scale (3 = most dirty or most wet and 1 = dry or clean). Before treatment, diameter of the umbilical cords were determined using digital calipers. All data were analyzed using mixed model methods. Models included the fixed effects of birth weight, umbilical diameter at birth, gender, stall conditions and treatment. Pre-weaning mortality was significantly affected by umbilical treatment (p \u003C 0.05) and by ratio of umbilical diameter to birth weight (p \u003C 0.001). Piglets treated with 2% iodine had a higher mortality rate than piglets treated with other antiseptics or those that were untreated. Piglets with the lowest umbilical cord diameter to birth weight ratio had the highest survival rate. Stall conditions at birth (p \u003C 0.005) and the ratio of umbilical diameter to birth weight (p \u003C 0.05) affected the incidence of umbilical hernias. Piglets born in wet stall conditions or those with a high umbilical cord to birth weight ratio had a higher incidence of umbilical hernias in the growing phase. Final 150 d weight of pigs was affected by the ratio of umbilical diameter to birth weight (p \u003C 0.0001) and gender (p \u003C 0.0001), and tended to be affected by stall conditions at birth (p = 0.06). Male pigs weighed 93.5 kg, while female pigs weighed 86.5 kg. Piglets with the highest ratio of umbilical cord diameter to birth weight and those born in wet stall conditions weighed less. In conclusion, measuring the umbilical cord to birth weight ratio was a much better predictor of pre-weaning mortality, incidence of umbilical hernias, and 150 d weight than birth weight alone.","publish_time":"2016-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robinson, A.

The first part of this paper overviews the theoretical innovations of the last decades regarding the interpretation of cause-specific mortality dynamics, often referred to as epidemiological transition theories, and their relevance for the analysis of mortality inequalities. The paper then analyses the cause-specific trends of mortality for two educational classes between 1971 and 2008. The trends were corrected for changes in the coding system and divided into linear (stagnating, increasing or decreasing) periods. Causes of death were grouped according to the relationship between the sequences of these periods for the two educational classes. The 57 causes of death were finally clustered into six groups. One group, which is dominated by nutrition-related and cardiovascular diseases, is largely responsible for the onset of mortality inequalities in 1980. The results imply that the quality of nutrition has diverged for the educational classes since 1980, and this fact has left its footprint on the pattern of mortality. The history of food production and availability seems to be in line with nutrition-related mortality, and it is argued that nutrition transition theory provides a very plausible explanatory framework for the growth of mortality inequalities.","publish_time":"2014-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kov\u00E1cs, Katalin","journal":"Mortality in an International Perspective","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d744f8c99aeec8b4d53a7a83e61a094ae181ab2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114985.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7114985/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs2MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hungary"],"keyphrases":["nutrition-related mortality","pattern of mortality","growth of mortality inequalities","onset of mortality inequalities","analysis of mortality inequalities","specific mortality dynamics","cause-specific trends of mortality","transformation of mortality patterns","educational classes","quality of nutrition","nutrition transition theory","periods","present paper","causes of death","interpretation of cause","epidemiological transition theories","plausible explanatory framework","relevance","Hungary","availability","decades","cardiovascular diseases","line","coding system","history of food production","stagnating","changes","theoretical innovations","relationship","footprint","sequences","fact","results","years","groups"],"language":"en"},

Evaluating the quantitative and qualitative impact of public health interventions on the spread of infectious diseases is a crucial public health objective. The recent avian influenza (H5N1) outbreaks and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic have raised significant global concerns about the emergence of a deadly influenza virus causing a pandemic of catastrophic proportions. Mitigation strategies based on behavior changes are some of the only options available in the early stages of an emerging epidemic when vaccines are unlikely to be available and there are only limited stockpiles of antiviral medications. Mathematical models that capture these behavior changes can quantify the relative impact of different mitigation strategies, such as closing schools, in slowing the spread of an infectious disease. Including behavior changes in mathematical models increases complexity and is often left out of the analysis. We present a simple differential equation model which allows for people changing their behavior to decrease their probability of infection. We also describe a large-scale agent-based model that can be used to analyze the impact of isolation scenarios such as school closures and fear-based home isolation during a pandemic. The agent-based model captures realistic individual-level mixing patterns and coordinated reactive changes in human behavior in order to better predict the transmission dynamics of an epidemic. Both models confirm that changes in behavior can be effective in reducing the spread of disease. For example, our model predicts that if school closures are implemented for the duration of the pandemic, the clinical attack rate could be reduced by more than 50%. We also verify that when interventions are stopped too soon, a second wave of infection can occur.","publish_time":"2012-10-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Valle, Sara Y.

This integrative field builds on and complements comparative immunology by evaluating immunity across levels of biological organization using an evolutionary and ecological framework. One major accomplishment of ecoimmunology has been to demonstrate that immune defenses have costs, and these costs can be context-dependent. As a result, researchers assess immunity not only in terms of specific immune pathways but also as functional, emergent traits, such as resistance against and tolerance of parasites. Ecoimmunology also highlights the importance of integration across physiological systems, including the immune, endocrine, and nervous systems, in the production of immune defenses. The field has demonstrated the importance of genetics, developmental environment, and current conditions to individual variation in immune function and emphasized the traits of species, such as body size, that could be integral to immune phenotypes. Furthermore, ecoimmunological studies have shown that heterogeneity in immunity at the individual and species levels can have important consequences for disease dynamics within populations and communities as well as population cycling. Herein we discuss these key research areas in ecoimmunology as they relate to three central themes: (1) immunity in the context of the whole organism, (2) heterogeneity in immunity, and (3) the broad consequences of individual variation in immunity. We conclude by reviewing future directions for ecoimmunology, focusing on those that could have important implications for public health, conservation, and wildlife management.","publish_time":"2018-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schoenle, Laura A.; Downs, Cynthia J.; Martin, Lynn B.","journal":"Advances in Comparative Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/009ec0e97d44766e9e4344af3b00a5e9f01d7537.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114998.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7114998/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs2MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immunity","immune function","immune phenotypes","consequences of variation","production of immune defenses","important consequences","broad consequences of individual variation","major accomplishment of ecoimmunology","terms of specific immune pathways","species levels","traits of species","costs","heterogeneity","important implications","nervous systems","physiological systems","importance of genetics","importance of integration","emergent traits","integrative field","context-dependent","levels of biological organization","current conditions","conservation","populations","public health","developmental environment","disease dynamics","causes","comparative immunology","communities","resistance","endocrine","ecological framework","wildlife management","body size","key research areas","researchers","study","ecoimmunological studies","central themes","tolerance of parasites","organism","future directions","result"],"language":"en"},

Its spatial and temporal distribution is found ubiquitous. Though the sponges have simple morphology and anatomy, they show symbiotic association with several microorganisms, which are the main source of secondary metabolites and are capable of producing many biologically active compounds. So there is a good debate going on among the researchers that the source of such biologically active compounds/substances is either the sponge itself or the microorganism residing in the sponges. But unfortunately most of these symbiotic microorganisms are non-culturable. Anyhow the sponges as a whole are the good source of several substances covering the polyketides, alkaloids, terpenes, etc. This chapter deals with the variety of such chemical substances present in the sponges and their biological activities.","publish_time":"2016-11-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shanmugam, A.; Vairamani, S.","journal":"Marine Sponges: Chemicobiological and Biomedical Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/68eb7ca93eda1ecdba443e32ad5a045e1fbbf2a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120082.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120082/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs5MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Sponges","good source","symbiotic microorganisms","active compounds","chemical substances present","main source of secondary metabolites","symbiotic association","good debate","anatomy","deeper waters","alkaloids","variety","polyketides","intertidal region","simple morphology","temporal distribution","chapter","terpenes","researchers","biological activities","oceans"],"language":"en"},

The \u2018delayed infection\u2019 hypothesis, first formulated in 1988, parallels the hygiene hypothesis and has an evolutionary foundation in the concept of a mismatch between prior genetic selection and programming (of the immune system) and contemporary social circumstances. In essence, the hypothesis predicts that ALL is triggered by an abnormal immune response to one or more common microbial infections and that the abnormality arises for two reasons: (i) infectious exposures being delayed beyond the immunologically anticipated period of infancy; (ii) some degree of inherited genetic susceptibility via, for example, allelic variation in genes involved in the MHC and/or immune response network. The hypothesis also has a framework in the underlying cell and molecular biology of ALL and its natural history. Epidemiological studies of social contacts in infancy (as a proxy for common infections) and risk of ALL provide indirect but strong support for the hypothesis.

It is characterized by the use of four different primers specifically designed to recognize six distinct regions of the target gene, and the reaction process proceeds at a constant temperature using strand displacement reaction. Quickness and simplicity is the advantage of the method. Amplification and detection of gene can be completed in a single step, by incubating the mixture of samples, primers, DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity and substrates at a constant temperature. The method was applied to two fungal infections; paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), a deep mycosis caused by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and Ochroconis gallopava infection. For PCM a combination of F3, B3, FIP, and BIP primers designed from the partial sequence of P. brasiliensis gp43 gene was used. The PCR products amplified by the primer set; F3 and B3 showed species specificity for P. brasiliensis and the detection limit of the PCR was 100 fg of fungal genomic DNA. The specific DNA banding pattern of P. brasiliensis was detected in the clinical and nine-banded armadillo derived isolates, paraffin-embedded tissue sample or sputum from PCM patient. LAMP method was used also for the identification of O. gallopava by using species-specific primer sets based on the D1/D2 domain of the LSU rDNA sequence. The method successfully detected the gene from both fungal DNA derived from brains and spleens of experimentally-infected mice with O. gallopava and environmental isolates. In conclusion, LAMP method for PCM and O. gallopava seemed to be useful for identification, diagnosis or retrospective study with advantage in the quickness and simplicity procedure, but require strictly-controlled environments.","publish_time":"2009-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sano, Ayako; Itano, Eiko Nakagawa","journal":"Molecular Identification of Fungi","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3637268009291f05d08c628cfe230e03f7305c45.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124037.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124037/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjsyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCM","BIP","PCR","LSU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of gene","fungal DNA","LAMP method","specific gene","brasiliensis gp43 gene","target gene","Paracoccidioides brasiliensis","DNA polymerase","PCM patient","fg of fungal genomic DNA","fungal infections","fungal investigation","B3","genetic diseases","strand displacement reaction","constant temperature","BIP primers","advantage","specific DNA banding pattern of","Ochroconis gallopava infection","different primers","identification of","detection limit","Quickness","strand displacement activity","infectious diseases","genetic disorders","partial sequence of","banded armadillo derived isolates","environmental isolates","combination of F3","PCR products","isothermal amplification","simplicity procedure","reaction process proceeds","LSU rDNA sequence","species-specific primer sets","paraffin-embedded tissue sample","D1","sputum","substrates","D2 domain","retrospective study","infected mice","diagnosis","FIP","spleens","deep mycosis","species specificity","methods","mixture of samples","large number of medical fields","paracoccidioidomycosis","brains","distinct regions","Loop","conclusion","single step","use","controlled environments"],"language":"en"},

Most bacteria cause pneumonia by first colonizing the upper respiratory tract and later descending into the tracheobronchial tree.","publish_time":"2010-02-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hasan, Ashfaq","journal":"Understanding Mechanical Ventilation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/354e73885bfae49fe38521d0fce26867985353aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124052.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124052/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjszMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["airborne particles","airborne microbes","airborne route","bacteria cause infections","tracheobronchial tree","bacteria cause pneumonia","area","upper respiratory tract","particles of respirable size","later descending","contamination","diameters","mycobacteria","range","ambient air","viruses","alveolar epithelium","contact","reality","configuration","deposit","lung","legionella"],"language":"en"},

However, SS also affects many extraglandular systems. In SS patients, the pattern of extraglandular manifestations may have a close similarity with the vasculitic features seen in SLE patients that are mediated by immune complexes and complement. However, SS patients also have an increased frequency of lymphocytic infiltration into extraglandular tissues, as might be expected by their increased frequency of lymphoma in comparison to SLE patients. For example, SS patients need to be evaluated for interstitial nephritis (in contrast to the glomerulonephritis of SLE) or interstitial pneumonitis (in comparison to pleurisy of SLE). This chapter will focus on the clinical extraglandular manifestations of primary SS that are not specifically covered in other chapters. These extraglandular manifestations have led to a recently introduced \u201Cdisease activity\u201D and \u201Corgan damage index.\u201D The recognition of these extraglandular manifestations is important since they have prognostic and therapeutic implications. The differential diagnosis of these extraglandular manifestations includes overlapping features with other autoimmune diseases (particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, dermatomyositis, celiac sprue, and small- and medium-sized vessel vasculitis), infectious diseases that mimic autoimmune disease (particularly hepatitis C, HIV, syphilis, tuberculosis), and predisposition to drug toxicities that may involve extraglandular organs (particularly skin rashes, nephritis, pneumonitis, myositis, and hematopoietic abnormalities).","publish_time":"2011-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fox, Robert I.","journal":"Sj\u0026#x000f6;gren\u0026#x02019;s Syndrome","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d35718e741544b82913ac4319a692f3f478e4bbc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124115.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124115/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjs3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SS patients","SLE patients","pattern of extraglandular manifestations","extraglandular organs","extraglandular tissues","extraglandular systems","clinical extraglandular manifestations of primary SS","glomerulonephritis of SLE","pleurisy of SLE","autoimmune diseases","autoimmune disorder","interstitial pneumonitis","comparison","interstitial nephritis","increased frequency of lymphocytic infiltration","increased frequency of lymphoma","infectious diseases","dry mouth","dry eyes","overlapping features","vasculitic features","disease activity","lymphocytic infiltrates of lacrimal","Primary Sj\u00F6gren\u2019s syndrome","scleroderma","medium-sized vessel vasculitis","systemic lupus erythematosus","keratoconjunctivitis sicca","hepatitis C","skin rashes","tuberculosis","syphilis","HIV","dermatomyositis","close similarity","celiac sprue","drug toxicities","predisposition","salivary glands","prognostic","contrast","organ damage index","immune complexes","differential diagnosis","hematopoietic abnormalities","recognition","therapeutic implications","complement","example","chapters"],"language":"en"},

In the United States, NEC strikes 1 to 8% of patients admitted to neonatal intensive care units, almost all of whom are premature infants. The incidence is low in certain countries wity a low premature birth rate, e.g., Japan. Two theories of pathogenesis are: the Santulli theory, which implicates three factors: ischaemia, bacteria and substrate; and the Lawrence theory, which stresses the injurious role of bacterial toxins on the immature gut of the preterm infant. Clinical and experimental evidence support each of the theories, but neither theory can explain certain clinical phenomena, particularly the resistance to NEC manifested by more than 90% of preterm infants, who never develop the syndrome. A unifying hypothesis of pathogenesis and a mathematical model of NEC are outlined. Because clustering of cases may occur, the design of clinical trials of preventive measures for NEC must include simultaneous control infants.","publish_time":"2006-12-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kosloske, Ann M.","journal":"Semin Neonatol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128836/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjsyODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Necrotizing","Lawrence"],"organizations":["NEC"],"locations":["United States","Japan"],"keyphrases":["premature infants","preterm infants","mathematical model of NEC","certain clinical phenomena","Lawrence theory","Santulli theory","theories of pathogenesis","syndrome","certain countries wity","simultaneous control infants","low premature birth rate","design of clinical trials of preventive measures","unifying hypothesis of pathogenesis","common neonatal gastrointestinal emergency","neonatal intensive care units","immature gut","injurious role of bacterial toxins","substrate","factors","patients","incidence","resistance","ischaemia","crepitant necrosis","Japan","experimental evidence","Necrotizing enterocolitis","bowel","world","United States","clustering of cases"],"language":"en"},

We conducted an inductive qualitative study comprising semi-structured interviews as the primary empirical data source. 12 interviews were carried out with informants from three clusters. We found that the co-creation arenas and activities in the business clusters stimulate and facilitate digitalization among the cluster companies. We also addressed the most significant drivers and barriers to co-creation to get a deeper understanding of the co-creation phenomenon.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Olsen, Dag H.; Eikebrokk, Tom Roar; Asp\u00F8, Kristian; Sajets, Elaine","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5960d0ab8e7a9d7e558d0c6852eec6c2ca7450d4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134261.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134261/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsxODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Norway"],"keyphrases":["co-creation activities","co-creation arenas","co-creation phenomenon","business clusters","digitalization","businesses","business practice","inductive qualitative study","transform","cluster companies","semi-structured interviews","general lack of research","deeper understanding","primary empirical data source","firms","rapid progress","digital technologies","significant drivers","barriers","growing emphasis","Norway","paper reports","capacity","informants"],"language":"en"},

Buying and selling through social media can create a reliable and sustainable platform for buyers and vendors, offering an alternative platform to traditional online approaches. Research on social commerce began to achieve traction in 2006 and has grown since with a significant focus from academics who have offered new insight to many of the key topics. This study seeks to offer an additional contribution to the literature by analysing the predictors of consumer adoption of social commerce from existing studies by employing a weight analysis technique. The analysis considered seven dependent variables (along with their best and worst predictors) that are most frequently examined and are relevant to consumer adoption. The review presented in this study suggests that the intention to purchase is the most frequently examined dependent variable and that trust in the social commerce context is a key factor.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sarker, Prianka; Hughe, Laurie; Dwivedi, Yogesh K.; Rana, Nripendra P.","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c29f82aa57babfd1302378fee4a6f7bc33fa1729.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134279.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134279/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsxOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["social media","social interaction","social commerce context","predictors of consumer adoption of social commerce","alternative platform","sustainable platform","study","growing platform of e-commerce","key factor","dependent variables","key topics","worst predictors","weight analysis technique","traditional online approaches","existing studies","buyers","vendors","trust","academics","new insight","literature","brand awareness","additional contribution","purchase","significant focus","sales","intention","Research","traction","review"],"language":"en"},

This research, used the UTAUT model with purposive sampling for 497 diabetic respondents, residing in low socio-economic communities. It analysed survey data using linear regression. It found that age had a strong moderating effect on all four UTAUT constructs. Gender only had a moderating effect on performance expectancy and social influence. In contrast to findings in the extant literature, income and location had no significant moderating effect in this context.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petersen, Fazlyn; Baker, Adiel; Pather, Shaun; Tucker, William D.","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1ad9212d25188110f6756f31bd623a6f7ba6eb53.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134280.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134280/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsxOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Africa"],"keyphrases":["significant moderating effect","strong moderating effect","location","income","age","gender","context warrants research","diabetic respondents","ICT use","ICT acceptance","UTAUT model","UTAUT constructs","increasing number of diabetic patients","South Africa","geographical areas","large segments","population","demographic factors","extant literature","purposive sampling","performance expectancy","impact of socio","social influence","analysed survey data","linear regression","technological forms of exclusions","findings","diabetes self-care","low socio-economic communities"],"language":"en"},

For this purpose, we apply a qualitative research approach which consists of two steps. First, we analyze job advertisements and code the identified competences by using the DigComp 2.0 framework. Second, we conduct interviews to validate and discuss our findings from the previous step. Our analysis reveals that the most important required competence categories are information and data literacy, followed by digital content creation.

In this context, new concepts such as digital connectivity, interconnection, and interoperability emerged as highly disruptive approaches for logistics systems and supply chain management (SCM). To shed more light on these complexities and see how companies organized in a SCM model can adopt, implement and operate in a digital connectivity model, this study proposes a framework, namely SIMPLE. To develop the framework, we employed a literature review approach, focusing on recent studies published in journals. After the literature analysis, six dimensions related to digital connectivity in supply chains and logistics emerged, namely Smart, Innovative, Measurable, Profitable, Lean, and Excellence (SIMPLE). This framework brings opportunities for future studies, while providing important insights into the dynamics of digital connectivity in logistics and supply chains. Therefore, these SIMPLE framework dimensions should enable the actors involved in organizations\u2019 operations to interact adequately and harmoniously so as to maximize the value generated in the network.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Queiroz, Maciel M.; Fosso Wamba, Samuel","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fcc1766adc621b2d6d90e671aafd560471f10fbc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134284.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134284/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsyMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SCM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["digital connectivity model","dynamics of digital connectivity","SIMPLE framework dimensions","supply chains","logistics systems","SCM model","supply chain management","recent studies","future studies","literature analysis","literature review approach","disruptive approaches","important insights","unprecedented changes","Lean","interoperability","actors","study","complex challenges","new concepts","edge technologies","interconnection","Excellence","companies","context","opportunities","types of business","complexities","organizations\u2019 operations","journals","value","network","light","Industry"],"language":"en"},

One such inequality that plagues societies is the rural-urban divide. Several social entrepreneurs are attempting to leverage technology to bridge this divide. In our research-in-progress paper, we describe the case of an Indian company, which is leveraging technology to create knowledge-based jobs for the rural Indian population. The approach adopted by the company in initiating and sustaining such an effort was an inside-out approach in contrast to the usual approach of focusing only on the internal resources within the company. Specifically, our research aims at abstracting the process mechanisms that enabled such an initiative. The unearthed mechanisms would inform future research on the modalities for orchestrating such an initiative. The findings would also help practitioners, especially social entrepreneurs, to think of innovative business models that would create value not only for the company but also for society as a whole. The delineated learnings would also help enthused social entrepreneurs to transplant such initiatives to other regions of the world.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shirish, Anuragini; Srivastava, Shirish C.; Shainesh, G.","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/74bcfea77c671d5e15359149c94f14621d172233.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134320.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134320/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsyMzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["social entrepreneurs","Indian company","technology","usual approach","future research","society","rural Indian population","rural-urban divide","unearthed mechanisms","process mechanisms","governments","areas of prime concern","knowledge-based jobs","policy makers","innovative business models","value","societies","case","initiatives","contrast","different forms","globe","progress paper","effort","inside","modalities","practitioners","initiating","delineated learnings","internal resources","regions","world","inequality","findings","Inequalities"],"language":"en"},

These benefits include improved, data driven decision-making, which can lead to deeper insight into business operations and as a result better performing organisations. Not surprisingly, an increased number of organisations are researching best implementation practices for BDA projects. Similar to software projects, research has shown that many BDA projects fail or do not deliver the business value as promised. To address this issue, the main objective of this research is to identify BDA implementation considerations for new BDA endeavors that will help organisations to align their BDA efforts with their overall business strategy to maximize business value. Based on a Benefit Dependency Network (BDN) model as main theoretical underpinning, a structured literature review was conducted focusing on investment objectives, business benefits, enabling changes and IT enablers when implementing BDA. A BDA implementation requires a holistic approach by considering aspects such as the skills of people which will have an impact on the structure of the organisation, business processes and technology changes to deliver benefits and investment objectives. Each of the domains of the BDN should be considered prior to BDA implementations. The research offers a guideline to organisations implementing BDA, based on the foundation of BDN.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maritz, Juane; Eybers, Sunet; Hattingh, Marie","journal":"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e2381eec8b3052df9e304af7eb0026f9de49bbb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134384.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134384/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjsyNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Big Data Analytics","BDA","Benefit Dependency Network","BDN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BDA projects","BDA efforts","BDA implementations","business benefits","BDA implementation considerations","new BDA endeavors","business value","business processes","business operations","research","overall business strategy","increased number of organisations","benefits of Big Data Analytics","investment objectives","foundation of BDN","software projects","best implementation practices","technology changes","main objective","main theoretical underpinning","data driven decision-making","model","structured literature review","Benefit Dependency Network","aspects","holistic approach","deeper insight","impact","result","instances","enablers","guideline","skills of people","issue","analytical capabilities","domains"],"language":"en"},

The aim was to find out a method for a quantitative evaluation of the health level in farms selling young breeders. An exhaustive protocol was prepared for data collection. The sources of information were clinical inspections on the farms, meat inspection data at slaughter and laboratory investigations. Data processing issued in the selection of a profile made of 14 prevailing health indicators. These were then associated so as to set up a health index with an overall score. In a second phase, the relevance of the method with respect to disease transmission was assessed. The principle was a contact challenge within totally controlled facilities between SPF pigs hysterectomy-derived and gilts taken from farms with different health scores as previously checked. The contact lasted for 28 days. Eleven farms were chosen and in every one of them 7 gilts were sampled and 10 SPF pigs were assigned to each of these farms. All the pigs were submitted to a detailed observation. At the end of it the pigs were euthanized at the laboratory and checked to find out any lesions and infectious agents. A wide range of symptoms appeared among the SPF pigs. Mortality rate was 14.6%. Pneumonia affected 23.7% of them. A relationship was found between the germ transfer and the severity of the troubles. The degree of illness in SPF pigs was clearly related to the score obtained previously in the corresponding farms.

To explore the feasibility of low-cost database construction, we studied the roadmap of HSMPD. A HSMPD-oriented tool, called \u201Csignal-molecule-profiling (SMP) chip\u201D was developed for data acquisition, which can be employed in the routine blood tests in hospitals; the results will be stored in the HSMPD system automatically. HSMPD system can provide data services for the TBI community, which generates a stable income to support the data acquisition. The small-scale experimental test was performed in the hospital to verify SMP chips and the demo HSMPD software. One hundred and eighty nine complete SMP records were collected, and the demo HSMPD system was also evaluated in the survey study on patients and doctors. The function of SMP chip was verified, whereas the demo HSMPD software needed to be improved. The survey study showed that patients would only accept free tests of SMP chips when they originally needed blood examinations. The study indicated that the construction of HSMPD relies on the self-motivated cooperation of the TBI community and the traditional healthcare system. The proposed roadmap potentially provides an executable solution to build the HSMPD without high costs.","publish_time":"2013-12-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Xinyan; Dong, Tao","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14a0b8d9f05d4baef14cfa9178748cb9d504d523.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3881147.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3881147/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TBI","SMP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["construction of HSMPD","roadmap of HSMPD","demo HSMPD system","demo HSMPD software","HSMPD-oriented tool","function of SMP chip","TBI community","profiling database","free tests of SMP chips","data acquisition","survey study","complete SMP records","data services","patients","traditional healthcare system","feasibility of low-cost database construction","prospective medical database","human signal-molecule","routine blood tests","blood examinations","proposed roadmap","translational bioinformatics","executable solution","stable income","self-motivated cooperation","hospitals","results","doctors","small-scale experimental test","high costs"],"language":"en"},

Thus, removing FH from the surface renders viruses, such as HIV, susceptible to CML. For a proof of concept, we developed a construct consisting of recombinant bifunctional single-chain variable fragment (scFv) based on a monoclonal antibody against Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) envelope protein gp70, which was coupled to specific binding domains (short consensus repeats 19-20; SCR1920) of FH. We used Pichia pastoris as expression system in common shake flasks and optimized expression in high density bench top fermentation. Specific binding of recombinant scFv was proven by flow cytometry. The recombinant scFv-SCR significantly enhanced CML of F-MuLV in vitro implying that FH binding to the viral surface was impaired by the scFv-SCR. This novel concept to enhance virolysis may provide a new approach for antiviral treatment.","publish_time":"2014-01-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huber, Georg; B\u00E1nki, Zolt\u00E1n; Kunert, Renate; Stoiber, Heribert","journal":"Biomed Res Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/52431fafe4d5ccd27011d899aa54aa5aa3537e95.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3913500.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3913500/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CML"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FH binding","Specific binding of recombinant scFv","recombinant scFv-SCR","F-MuLV","specific binding domains","envelope of viruses","enhanced CML of F","surface renders viruses","optimized expression","expression system","viral surface","novel concept","proof of concept","recombinant bifunctional single-chain variable fragment","complement-mediated lysis","envelope protein gp70","soluble regulator of complement activation","common shake flasks","Friend murine leukemia virus","protection","high density bench","monoclonal antibody","potent immune defense mechanism","short consensus repeats","Pichia pastoris","factor H","new approach","virolysis","fermentation","HIV","construct","antiviral treatment","SCR1920","flow cytometry"],"language":"en"},

Only little is known about factors influencing its general composition. Here, the effect of the probiotic bacterium Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) NCIMB 10415 on the pig faecal virome composition was analysed in a pig feeding trial with sows and their piglets, which received either the probiotic bacterium or not. RESULTS: From 8 pooled faecal samples derived from the feeding trial, DNA and RNA virus particles were prepared and subjected to process-controlled Next Generation Sequencing resulting in 390,650 sequence reads. In average, 14% of the reads showed significant sequence identities to known viruses. The percentage of detected mammalian virus sequences was highest (55\u201377%) in the samples of the youngest piglets and lowest (8\u201310%) in the samples of the sows. In contrast, the percentage of bacteriophage sequences increased from 22\u201344% in the youngest piglets to approximately 90% in the sows. The dominating mammalian viruses differed remarkably among 12 day-old piglets (kobuvirus), 54 day-old piglets (boca-, dependo- and pig stool-associated small circular DNA virus [PigSCV]) and the sows (PigSCV, circovirus and \u201Ccircovirus-like\u201D viruses CB-A and RW-A). In addition, the Shannon index, which reflects the diversity of sequences present in a sample, was generally higher for the sows as compared to the piglets. No consistent differences in the virome composition could be identified between the viromes of the probiotic bacterium-treated group and the control group. CONCLUSION: The analysis indicates that the pig faecal virome shows a high variability and that its general composition is mainly dependent on the age of the pigs. Changes caused by feeding with the probiotic bacterium E. faecium could not be demonstrated using the applied metagenomics method.","publish_time":"2014-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sachsenr\u00F6der, Jana; Twardziok, Sven O.; Scheuch, Matthias; Johne, Reimar","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ade1a8f088544b34547d3f9608805c969c9f189f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3929612.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3929612/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzUz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Next Generation Sequencing"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pig viruses","sows","pig faecal virome composition","pig stool","pig faeces","day-old piglets","youngest piglets","community of viruses","viruses CB","probiotic bacterium Enterococcus faecium","dominating mammalian viruses","general composition","probiotic bacterium-treated group","passaged plant viruses","pooled faecal samples","feeding trial","percentage of detected mammalian virus sequences","small circular DNA virus","RNA virus particles","minor virus species","PigSCV","percentage of bacteriophage sequences","circovirus","diversity of sequences present","reads","control group","significant sequence identities","high variability","NCIMB","dependo","bacteriophages","effect","viromes","boca","analysis","kobuvirus","Shannon index","process","Generation Sequencing","contrast","RESULTS","consistent differences","BACKGROUND","applied metagenomics method","addition","RW","factors","CONCLUSION","average","Changes"],"language":"en"},
